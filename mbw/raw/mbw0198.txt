[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.160]   because everybody was in town for the World Wide Developers
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.880]   conference.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.520]   Now, it's nothing unusual to have Alex Lindsey in studio.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.520]   It's great to have you, Alex.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.360]   Welcome to the show.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.760]   I'm glad you traveled long and far to be here.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.840]   Just a block, I think.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.840]   Cool blocks.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.040]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.880]   Also joining us, it's really wonderful to have
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.480]   Mr. Don McAllister, who did travel far.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.080]   He came all the way from Liverpool.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.280]   He did.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.320]   Well, yeah, WWDC is like the sideline.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.400]   It came for this really.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.120]   That's the main reason for the trip.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.360]   And then WWDC is a sideline.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.720]   Don's the host of ScreenCasts Online.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.640]   And has his own jingle.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.480]   I don't know why.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.080]   Don McAllister.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.320]   I don't know, you know, because you're not on that offer.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.800]   No, well, Jeff's done my theme tune.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.160]   So he's probably going to be a failure.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.200]   Jeff's doing you a failure.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.800]   He's now we have to have you on.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.320]   Somebody who did travel all the way from the left right coast.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.280]   Right coast, I believe it is.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.120]   Correct coast.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.600]   Yes, the correct coast.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.440]   Mr. Andy Nocko, great to see Andy.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.320]   Once a year, keep coming with the free beverages,
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.160]   and I'll keep coming in studio.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.960]   Now we brought you Coke Zero, but does that
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.160]   have kosher sugar in it?
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.240]   Has fast fork acid.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.320]   That's really what I'm in for it.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.720]   My doctor says I do have a fast fork acid deficiency.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.120]   I'm 97 of these a day.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.800]   That's what gives him that bass sound.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.920]   Andy Nocko.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.200]   And ladies and gentlemen, a very special guest.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.600]   And special guest.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.880]   Insert name here.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.360]   Lisa.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.280]   You can see how special she is.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.880]   Lisa Bettany, the only one without a jingle on the show today.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.360]   Hi, Lisa.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.880]   It's good to see you.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.380]   Hi.
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.880]   Good to see you.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.120]   From mostlyleaser.com, she's a blogger
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.840]   and a very accomplished photographer
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.640]   and has been on the show many times before.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.720]   Did you come for WWDC or are you just in town?
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.720]   I did well.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.960]   We launched my new iPhone app, Camera Plus.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.560]   Wait a minute.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.920]   I haven't heard about that.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.000]   You haven't heard about it.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.560]   This is you.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.840]   What do you mean?
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.840]   It's all everybody's talking about the--
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.280]   What do you mean your iPhone app?
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.720]   Well, I helped develop it.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.400]   Really?
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.840]   Cheers.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.760]   Who wrote all the code?
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.520]   Did you go on stage with Steve and show it all?
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.320]   We were hoping that we'd pop up there,
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.920]   but we sent him an email.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.720]   A lot of stuff popped up, didn't it?
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.560]   It really did.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.040]   So tell me, this is cool.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.240]   I didn't even know you were doing this, Camera Plus.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.600]   Free Zoom, Flash, Crop, Effect, Share, Record Videos on 2 and 3G.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.960]   And it's free?
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.760]   So you're not in this for the money.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.320]   No.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.960]   It's not free?
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.800]   It's not free.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   It says free.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.160]   But it's so inexpensive.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.720]   It's a free Zoom.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.080]   There's no extra charge for the Zoom.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.880]   Camera Plus with a plus sign.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.440]   Oh, I'm looking at the wrong one.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.440]   Yeah, it's all right.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.640]   Where are you all this?
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.480]   CamPL.us.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.480]   CamP.us.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.280]   I'm sorry I showed the free one.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.720]   I haven't been camping a good long time.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.000]   I'm looking forward to the current.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.600]   OK, so say it again.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.200]   The URL is C-A-M.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.840]   P-L.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.840]   P-L.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.840]   US.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.840]   Clever.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.840]   And I did--
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.520]   Oh, this is much prettier than the other one.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.520]   Yeah, actually, I shot the video 5D Mark II styles.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.520]   So--
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.040]   And I was--
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.200]   So what does this do?
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.800]   $2.99.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.000]   OK, that's practically free.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.920]   It's practically free.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.720]   And you can win them a 5D Mark II photo rig.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.160]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.240]   OK, they asked me, come up with your dream rig.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.640]   And I thought they were maybe going to buy me a present.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.720]   And then they said, no, you have to give this away.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.760]   And I'm like--
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.440]   Damn you.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.040]   Damn you.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.880]   You can win a 5D Mark II and every lens from a fish eye
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.200]   to a macro to telephoto.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.680]   This is great.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.360]   Will this work with the new iPhone?
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.160]   It's going to be amazing.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.200]   Yeah, they know that iPhone is actually a decent camera.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.320]   5 megapixels.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.040]   I'm really happy.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.080]   HD video.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.520]   If I were Cisco, I'd be a little worried,
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.360]   not only because this puts the flip kind of on the wrong side.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.080]   They also own iOS.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.600]   Oopsie.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.080]   I'm guessing they made some money on that.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.480]   Maybe.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.360]   Maybe that's how it worked out.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.840]   Apple just kind of flicked a couple--
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.720]   They owned--
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.520]   Apple bills out.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.960]   Didn't they?
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.320]   They also owned-- that's not the only thing Cisco owned.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.280]   Oh, well.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.120]   Well, anyway, who was in the hall?
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.720]   You were done, right?
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.400]   Yeah, I was there.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.360]   And Andy, you were also in the hall.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.880]   Impressions done, anything?
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.280]   Yeah, it was a long keynote.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.760]   It was--
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.480]   Two hours, yeah.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.560]   I was just going off for two hours.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.320]   We covered it here.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.080]   I was not here.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.520]   I was on assignment.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.640]   I was actually in service for my first some teachers.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.520]   But Tom Merritt did a great job with Alex.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.040]   You were here?
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.600]   I loved it.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.400]   I loved the show.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.240]   Did you enjoy it?
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.920]   I really did.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.680]   And I mean, we were sort of watching you.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.560]   And then we had Engadget up there.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.680]   Well, everybody live blogs at GDGT Ryan.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.680]   Does it?
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.040]   Joshua Topolsky, who was on Twitter for Engadget.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.160]   But then when it all went down, it was like--
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.320]   They couldn't blog.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.120]   I know, but we were all just sort of--
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.000]   And what did you do, Alex?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.080]   Were you able to figure out what was going on?
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.400]   Yeah, it was kind of-- there was kind of a start.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.840]   We had an audio stream for a little bit.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.320]   And then whoever was streaming it stopped when they said,
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.800]   you got to turn everything off.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.000]   And then it was like everything stopped for a second.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.800]   And then it started to pick back up again.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.560]   Because there were some of the folks--
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.960]   I know Jason Snell was like, yeah,
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.680]   we're not going to turn off our MIFI.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.760]   You know, it's not really going to happen.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.400]   That is kind of a problem in that.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.320]   I felt as though I can turn off my MIFI for the duration
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.360]   of this immediate Wi-Fi demonstration.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.320]   But I really don't want to have to say,
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.160]   yes, the CEO of Apple asked me to stop reporting this event live.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.000]   And I did it.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.060]   Yeah.
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.000]   Because I don't know what the reason is.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.800]   It was the MIFI.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.440]   It was the base stations that people were using.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.880]   So the normal Wi-Fi just carried on working.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.880]   So I was just trying to--
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.880]   What do you mean base stations people?
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.040]   Well, I think it identified 700 base stations.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.680]   But like the MIFI is the right--
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.520]   Base station-- oh, MIFI is the only one that they have.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.000]   There were 700 MIFI.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.800]   Why are these MIFI?
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.640]   I think it's a 570.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.640]   577.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.640]   570.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.120]   570 just the MIFI is alone.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.120]   What?
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.600]   At least that's how I--
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.600]   So a lot of these journalists were sitting in there,
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   were developers, too, I guess.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.240]   You're not going to necessarily-- if it's really important
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.760]   that you be live blogging, you're not going to trust the Wi-Fi
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.760]   that they give you.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.280]   You are not going to trust the AT&T networks.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.280]   You're going to be--
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.600]   You think there were 540 live blogs of this event?
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.600]   I think--
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.760]   I think-- well, none of this live blogs.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.760]   But people who just want to tweet,
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.480]   and people just as a matter of general principle,
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.160]   like, I'm going to have a laptop open.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.000]   I'm going to be Facebooking while I'm doing this.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.440]   I'm just an ignorant tech guy.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.840]   But why didn't Steve have his own secured access
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.160]   point with his own secured bandwidth for this demo?
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.160]   I'm just--
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.160]   What the--
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.680]   I mean, what I think that the issue was,
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.840]   is it literally just created so much cross talk.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.080]   You have that meant it's Wi-Fi.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.920]   It doesn't matter if you have your own or not.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.160]   There's no bandwidth.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.320]   It's not the bandwidth issue.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.600]   It's literally just--
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.480]   There is so much interference going on.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.360]   There's no channels on them.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.480]   Because these were--
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.360]   I mean, the radio system was designed for one every, what,
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.480]   like 500 yards max.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.840]   So it was designed for having--
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.800]   the person designed did not imagine
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.260]   you'll be able to carry your own internet
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.760]   in a credit card like this.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.200]   And hundreds of people, you know,
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.160]   you can't be that forward.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.440]   This is exactly what happened to Google or Google I/O.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.720]   They couldn't do the demo of their remote control
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.480]   on Google TV.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.520]   And they had the same do the same thing.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.440]   But the difference is that they're like, can everybody
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.520]   turn off their cell phones?
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.040]   Our wireless keep-- please go--
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.640]   oh, guys, throw every keyboard.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.080]   Well, Steve says it with more authority.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:25.880]   Steve said--
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.880]   He shared it.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.880]   Don't really say--
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.400]   He said, like, quote unquote, we have a choice here.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.800]   We can either like not do any more wireless demos,
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.920]   or we can all turn-- do you want to see more demos?
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.440]   Yes.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:35.440]   OK.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.840]   And we'd turn this stuff off.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.200]   And then like five minutes later,
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.520]   he does an external and it glows in instantly.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.360]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.160]   And you hold the power of Steve.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160]   There's the difference between Steve and Vic right there.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.920]   Did you get an email from AT&T?
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.920]   Yes.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:49.920]   There was--
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:50.920]   What?
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.240]   Oh, come on.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:51.800]   During this?
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.320]   Because the problem was that he was trying--
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.120]   he was trying to show the iPhone
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.800]   for loading in the New York Times page.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.120]   And it was just stolen because it could not
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.360]   find a connection to the internet.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.800]   Like a couple embarrassing air mess
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.280]   that we can't get a connection to the internet on the phone.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.960]   And so they're trying to resolve this.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.080]   And AT&T releases a press release
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.320]   that I see like in the middle of the keynote saying--
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.600]   It wasn't our fault.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.720]   We're responsible for a lot of stuff.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.240]   But we weren't responsible for this.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.240]   There's so many--
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.720]   There's somebody sitting in the audience writing this press release.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.360]   And it had the form of like--
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.280]   I don't think there were like thumb errors in the typing.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.960]   But you could tell that someone was like saying, OK,
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.840]   at last we have a plausible explanation
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.040]   for a problem with an iPhone that is not our responsibility.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.960]   I almost thought that this was like a setup to say--
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.280]   and we just like to let everyone know we're
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.400]   going to add Verizon.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.040]   And the whole thing is like--
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.040]   These are the problems that we've been having for the last year.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.240]   We can't kick it with 3G.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.240]   Let's turn off the Wi-max connection in the new iPhone 4.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.440]   Wouldn't that have been nice?
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.440]   That would have been a good setup.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.440]   That's what I had been predicting and I was wrong.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.440]   There was a heckler as well when I thought you--
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.000]   When he asked for any suggestion, someone railed out.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.680]   Verizon!
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.800]   Ouch.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.320]   Ouch.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.560]   Well, next year they're going to get around.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.240]   They're going to build a big Faraday cage on stage.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.720]   So you can just go in and do the demo with the Faraday.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.640]   I think the next one, you're going
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.640]   to see like trailing this long cat 6 cable off the box.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.160]   It's nothing.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:09.920]   Don't worry about it.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.400]   It's nothing.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:10.760]   It's nothing.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.360]   So let's go through one by one Steve's points
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.000]   in his presentation.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.720]   I guess.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.120]   I mean, they're close to 100 million of these devices.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.000]   iPhone and iPod touches.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.800]   And I guess iPad 3 throw an iPad for a couple million.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.360]   That's amazing.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.160]   100 million.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.600]   That's what he said we'd have.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.560]   By the end of the year.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.440]   And you got to see that if there was anything that
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.480]   was directly pointed at the Google I/O keynote,
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.880]   the first 15 of us was all about here's how much money
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.360]   we're making from developers.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.400]   Here's where the-- here's the amount of market
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.240]   that we have versus Android.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.000]   Here's the amount of browser eyeballs we have.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.360]   60 million in I/Aad buys already.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.800]   So it wasn't as blatant as what Google was talking about.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.800]   Apple, but you could clearly tell that, OK, you want to play?
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.560]   Put on the pass because this is the NFL.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.960]   I mean, the $60 million in I/ads,
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.800]   and you don't even have a service ship.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.800]   I mean, that's pretty impressive.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.960]   And the names as well.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.760]   And we do all household names, really big players in the space.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.920]   Well, and that's a shot at Google.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.840]   That isn't necessarily even for developers.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.320]   That's a message to Google.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.840]   We're in your cheese here.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.400]   Not only that, because Google was saying, no, come on.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.240]   Yes, Apple started their own service,
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.160]   but we're in the ad business from day one.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160]   We've been doing ads where all the ads are.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.560]   Apple did something very smart.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.360]   They decided to redefine the fight, saying, our job is not
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.520]   to be the number one ad company.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.840]   Our job is to help you sell money through ads
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.200]   in a non-intrusive way.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.920]   We're not going to sell ads that take people outside of your app.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.960]   And we're also not going to sell ads that are going to annoy
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.480]   our users.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.520]   So as for the users point of view,
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.840]   it's for the developers point of view, we're just not--
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.560]   we're Apple.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.720]   We love everybody.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.640]   We're not into this bill.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.760]   At least as a developer, is that compelling to you?
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.840]   Did you look at, for instance, you charge for this?
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.520]   There's no ads I presume in camera plus.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.360]   No, no.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.000]   Would you consider it now?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.280]   I don't think so, honestly.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.000]   I like to keep it really clean.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.120]   But Steve said, if we want to encourage free apps,
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.280]   if you want to encourage free apps, that's how you do it, right?
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.080]   Yeah, I guess so.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.600]   I mean, yeah, I would like to keep it clean and not
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.920]   have anything sort of intrude on the user experience.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.280]   I'm pretty excited about it.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.520]   Are you going to do free ads?
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.240]   Yeah, we're definitely going to do ad-based stuff.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.120]   I mean, what I think is interesting
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.520]   is the idea that I don't trust--
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.680]   this is the odd thing, is that I've never put Google ads
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.440]   on my website, because I hate the way the text looks.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.200]   Or I don't trust that the banner stuff is going to be appropriate,
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.200]   or it's going to be whatever.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.520]   And I have to admit that I trust that Apple's
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.400]   going to worry about the fit and finish of the ads to a level
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.480]   where I'm actually pretty excited about putting it on.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.160]   I think because there's something like--
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.520]   when we ran ads for iStock photo on Macbreak, I remember,
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.840]   I felt like it actually brought the production value of our show
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.840]   up.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.720]   It was such great ads.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.120]   And so in the same way, I think that Apple's ads,
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.960]   they're going to be appropriately put in.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.560]   And we'll see.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.280]   I mean, maybe it won't.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.120]   And it's an opportunity for--
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.400]   I think especially for the early adopters,
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.360]   it's an opportunity to get a hold of some of that $60 million
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:13.840]   in $4 million.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.920]   Well, looking for the emotional response.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.160]   And I think the way they'll position it
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.400]   is that they'll make the ads compelling.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.160]   And people will actually look forward to new ads
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.840]   as they come out and say, well, have you seen the latest
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.720]   such and such ads?
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.160]   Because you kept within the application.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.520]   You don't have to go to the browser.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.560]   And I mean, the one they demoed at the keynote
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.920]   was pretty cool, actually.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.200]   Yeah, it was more like a standalone app that
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.440]   advertises the product.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.680]   I mean, all the different brands that they were showing
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.960]   are the ads you would find in a golf magazine.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.160]   And I think the most annoying ads are on the internet,
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.400]   the ones where there's a leprechaun that's burping out dollar
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.840]   signs to try to convince you to refinance your home.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.840]   So that's what I really want to see.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.240]   What's the full spectrum of ads are going to be available?
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.600]   Because the first time I get one of these fly by night,
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.120]   pennies for gold.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.440]   Well, I think that Apple is looking for Fortune 500
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:57.920]   companies.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.280]   They're looking for big ads.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.320]   They're looking for people with big creative budgets,
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.040]   with things that are interesting to go into.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.240]   And I think that's an interesting--
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.560]   and it shows you the different philosophy
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.040]   between Apple and Google.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.880]   The shotgun philosophy versus the we're
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.560]   going to shine off every little thing,
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.800]   whether you like it that or not.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.880]   I mean, there's sometimes when I wish that Apple would do
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.960]   more of the shotgun--
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.160]   I wish they'd let us experiment a little bit more.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.680]   I'm going to jailbreak my phone, my old one,
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.720]   so that I can play with that go out into the playground
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.640]   and play, because I feel like there's too much control for me
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.360]   all the time.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.480]   But the main phone that I'm using, it'll just be.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:39.240]   Do you think that users are getting more used to ads
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.880]   in this way, like very directed ads?
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.120]   I mean, Google ads are scary.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.280]   Like they're like, hey, Lisa.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.520]   They're not as bad as Facebook ads.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.840]   I would say other 53-year-olds in Petaluma like this.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.960]   I mean, I just-- I don't miss that at all.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.520]   But I do miss Farmville.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.160]   And I'm very pleased to see that Mark Pinkis took the stage.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.240]   Farmville is now--
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.880]   How much would I damage the smartphone by pounding
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.080]   my head against it over and over again, Liam?
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.520]   Come on.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:07.840]   Admit it.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.960]   You want to play Farmville.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.880]   No, I don't.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:10.320]   No, you don't.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.200]   It's a horrible addictive--
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.920]   you know that Farmville thing that you told us about,
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.520]   Billy, said the parody video, is actually very right on.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.400]   It's not fun.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.080]   It's addictive.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.480]   And you have this social obligation
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.480]   to give people stuff because they gave you stuff.
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.640]   What did you hear about the kid in England who literally
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.720]   maxed his credit card?
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.600]   Yeah, because he kept buying more Farmville crap
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.880]   to pull the chicken coop.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.960]   I think it's a secret Chinese plot to slow the American
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.240]   populace down so they can continue to overtake us.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.960]   It should be Zinga.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.080]   Yeah, Zinga.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.400]   There's so many games like that.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.680]   They're like stress putty that you have.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.240]   That all you can do is just keep needing it and needing it
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.840]   just gives you something to just have a town-power response.
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.720]   It's not as opposed to a game that really makes you think
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.560]   hard and really--
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.480]   My dog gets excited when you say stress putty.
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.480]   Calm down.
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.480]   I don't know who he is.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.520]   If I stepped up to a small dog, I bet I would feel it.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.600]   No, no, he loves stress putty.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.200]   No, my mom actually had--
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:05.960]   I gave her an iPad.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.960]   She's out visiting Kazabi's graduation.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.440]   I gave her an iPad put.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.640]   We rule on it, which is a farming game on it.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.040]   And she's normally knits constantly.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:14.840]   Same idea.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.680]   She hasn't knit one pearl.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.240]   Oh, dear.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:17.740]   I know.
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.240]   I don't get socks this year.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.240]   I'm bald.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.360]   I'm looking forward to giving her a new scarf from her.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.000]   Oh, you know, if you ask her, she's going to come by later.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.560]   She'll make you a doctor who's scarf.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.360]   It was weird, though, that they put those demos on so early
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.560]   on in the keynote.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.880]   With it being a tech--
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.000]   That's what they started with, isn't it?
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:35.920]   Yeah, pretty much so.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:36.920]   Yeah, once they got all the--
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.600]   Let's take a break.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.440]   I want to--
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.480]   speaking of ads, do an ad.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.760]   But we're going to come back.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:42.640]   We've got a great panel.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.200]   Andy Inato is here.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.920]   Don McAllister, Lisa Bettany, Alex Lindsay.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.520]   And we're going to-- actually, let's go through step-by-step
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.320]   what's new in the iPhone.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.040]   There's only a handful of new things, really, in the iPhone.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.400]   And we'll do that right now.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.640]   And what we didn't see, too-- because there's actually
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.240]   probably more to say about what didn't happen than what
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.800]   did happen at WWDC.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.640]   And we haven't mentioned price and availability.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.520]   I suppose I should do that.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.280]   199 for 16 gigabytes, 299 for 32 gigabytes.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:11.800]   You can order on the 15th in less than a week.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.000]   And you can pick it up on the 24th.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.320]   Unless you're in Canada.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.880]   What is the Canada situation?
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.480]   July.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:16.980]   Really?
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:17.480]   Really?
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.880]   They're on the second round, too.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.200]   Is that the first round of external?
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.160]   I know why.
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:21.960]   Is it on Rogers?
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.400]   Is that who does it?
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.000]   Or Bell.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.520]   Rogers?
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.320]   I think more carriers are going to carry.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.200]   Not just Rogers.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.000]   Yes, you have that advantage in that camera.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.280]   But still, it was the same with iPad.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.120]   And I've sort of been outspoken about not getting an iPad.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.160]   And it's mainly because we just--
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.520]   Yeah, you want a boycott.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.320]   Yeah, and we don't get it for so long.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.120]   You want to play reword.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.120]   I know.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.960]   And now I've got my foot in my mouth.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.800]   And I really want one.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.040]   And I've been searching and searching.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.400]   And there's not a place in--
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.880]   You can't get one here.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.640]   I think you should move to the state, Slakes of Batman.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.360]   Just move to the state so you'd get iPhones, iPads.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:55.880]   I know.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.880]   You'd be on our show more often.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.240]   I'm so close.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:57.720]   Yes.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.840]   It's worth losing your health coverage.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.120]   Oh, yeah, that.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.080]   Oh, that.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.080]   Ow.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:03.600]   Oh, maybe not.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.080]   Ouch.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.200]   All right, let's talk a little bit about our friends at the--
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.480]   robo.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.960]   We are-- I think we're getting to be a Drobo house.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.360]   We get a lot of Drobo's coming in house.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.440]   We're using them more and more.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.160]   And that's because we learned a lesson.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.600]   We bought very expensive hard drives.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:25.080]   We bought what's called a SAN, a storage area network for $20,000.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:29.200]   And it's proving, frankly, to be less reliable, less
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.080]   effective, less useful than a Drobo.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.200]   And I'm thinking, oh, Drobo's an advertiser.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.680]   What was I thinking?
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.840]   I was convinced, oh, you've got to go with the corporate solution.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.520]   Do you have a Drobo elite?
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.360]   We have elites.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.280]   We have FSSs.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.080]   We have all sorts of-- calling before she left,
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.080]   kind of said, we're getting Drobo's everywhere.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.320]   And I actually have to check what's going on with the Drobo's.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.600]   Because we're editing off of them.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.480]   And all the Mac breaks are all edit from a Drobo elite.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.400]   We've got five IMACs.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.440]   How many editors at once, though?
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.440]   We have five IMACs.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.520]   I don't know if they're all editing all the time at once,
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.680]   but they're-- it's a pretty steady stream of stuff.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.880]   And I think that's what a SAN is about availability.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.760]   A SAN is about-- we have three editors editing video
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.640]   while I'm recording.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.240]   I'm recording to the SAN right now, all over fiber optic.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.240]   Right.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.360]   But yeah, I'm thinking that we made a mistake.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.480]   You know, whether elite wasn't out when we bought the SAN.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.320]   Right, right.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.040]   I've definitely found since shooting a lot more with 5D Mark 2.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.440]   You need that storage.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:31.160]   It is insane how you go from just filling--
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.680]   Scads.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.240]   Are you all sorts of Johns about the-- everybody's a Drobo user.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.320]   Yeah, I am actually.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.560]   I recently upgraded to a Drobo pro.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.520]   I was going to send a full 5 disc, right?
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.200]   And the Pro is 8.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:43.720]   8?
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.720]   Yeah, the 8.0.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.720]   8.0.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.520]   But the nice thing is I've sort of repurposed the original Drobo
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.720]   from a media center because as you collect more and more media,
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.520]   I always had a problem of deleting stuff off the drive
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.200]   when it got too big.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.920]   But with the Drobo now, I can just-- I've only populated it
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.240]   with two, three drives.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.000]   I've got a spare drive slot free.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.560]   So as my media collection builds, I can just pop another drive
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:03.560]   in and it'll just expand.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.560]   So it works really well.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.160]   I haven't even started the ad in already the ad.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:06.680]   Oh, sorry.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.640]   No, no, it's great.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.440]   That's a better ad than me saying it.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.800]   But I'll give you some of the details.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:17.680]   It's drob.com/macbreak for some really good discounts, $75
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.560]   to $500 on populated Drobo's.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.640]   What is a Drobo?
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.560]   It's an enclosure.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.080]   You can buy it with or without drives.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.520]   If you've got a lot of drives lying around,
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.320]   it's great for that because it drives, unlike a raid where
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.640]   the raid aggregates the drives but makes the size of each drive
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.560]   the size of the smallest drive.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.880]   Drobo just adds them all up.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.960]   They can be all different sizes.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.440]   Hetterogeneous drives as long as they're SATA.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.000]   Drobo then assigns about a quarter to a third of that drive
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.040]   for redundancy so you never lose a bit even if drive dies.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.320]   And on the bigger Drobo's, you can lose two drives simultaneously
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.960]   and still not lose data.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.640]   So the original Drobo is four disk bays.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.040]   That's what I use at home as a backup.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.160]   And I've got terabyte and a half drives in it.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.040]   So that's three, six total.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.480]   And about four of that six is used for storage.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.560]   That's a lot of terabytes.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.480]   The newer Drobo S has five disk bays.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.480]   And that's for people like Lisa, creative professionals
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.920]   who have a lot of data.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.640]   And they need some speed too because it's a little bit faster.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.200]   The Drobo Pro, that's what Don has with eight bays.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:19.720]   Wow.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.080]   At 16 terabytes with the current hard drives,
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.680]   but you can go even bigger as the drive capacities increase.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.120]   You were talking about Alex about the Drobo Elite.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.600]   This is really more like a SAM.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.200]   This has eight drives, but it also
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.960]   has up to 16 computers connected via iSCSI over ethernet
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.600]   for-- there are two gigabit ethernet ports.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.640]   So it looks like a local disk drive
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.400]   to up to 16 different computers.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.560]   And that's why the editors can share it and so forth.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.840]   It's also VMware certified.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.200]   So you can use it for virtualization.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.160]   It's been very successful.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:50.800]   Has it really?
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.760]   Yeah, it's been really successful.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.840]   Yeah, see, I should have--
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.760]   And they're editing a lot of this XDCam or Apple Pro Rives.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.880]   It's all HD.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.600]   Yeah, we don't really-- we don't have a production type for SD.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.520]   And then there's the new Drobo FS, which is basically like a NAS.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.120]   It has two processors, and it's running Linux,
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.000]   and you have plugins.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:11.720]   It's really great.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.440]   This is all of it.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.200]   It's fantastic.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.800]   It just looks great at the firmware for that as well.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.320]   So you can use it as a proper time machine.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:17.920]   Oh, that's good.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.800]   Yeah, you can actually partition a separate partition
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.640]   one on the FS.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.840]   That is a massive time machine.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.200]   Is it every one you're using time machine?
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.440]   No, I don't use it.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.120]   I use it first.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:25.800]   Some of the machines.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.040]   They're on tops and stuff.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.000]   But it always seems stressful when it says you got to back up
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.080]   all the time.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.760]   And mine currently says you haven't backed up in 200--
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.760]   Doesn't it do it on--
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.200]   That's stressful.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.160]   That's very stressful.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.440]   You should be stressing you out.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.360]   Because it should do it automatically.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.400]   I thought time machine the whole point was it just does it.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.040]   Well, I don't know.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.200]   I stopped it because it did it always interrupts
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.000]   what I'm doing.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.640]   And I just like--
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.200]   No, no.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.440]   I'm always in the middle of something.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.240]   Get a Drobo.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.640]   The FS has the software to do it all.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.560]   It's just automatic.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.200]   You don't think about it.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.760]   So what was the price point of--
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.360]   Well, at least in betting all you have to do is go to Drobo.com/Macbreak.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.480]   You can use a coupon code MacbreakWeekly.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.600]   I should put that in.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.600]   I have it say Macbreak.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.640]   MacbreakWeekWeekly coupon code.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:15.080]   And you will save $75 to $500 on a populated Drobo system.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:15.920]   So if you've got a lot of--
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.960]   you seem like it might have a lot of hard drives lying around.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.680]   So you just get the enclosure.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.160]   I do like to name them.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:25.920]   I would say for you, the FS is a good choice.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.600]   $16.99.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.320]   You have to name your hard drives?
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.800]   Yes, with masking tape.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.360]   I know.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.000]   There's this side of me that's very disorganized.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:38.880]   And while I was--
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.800]   Just give me a sample.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:40.300]   Names.
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.520]   What do you name them?
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.000]   Like Bobby Sue, Billy Joe.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.880]   Do you name them after Greek Homeric heroes?
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.320]   I have dinosaurs escape.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.560]   This one?
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.120]   What is that?
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.440]   Is that a movie?
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.240]   No, it's--
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.760]   Just something that came to your mind?
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.800]   I name all my products.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.960]   They all have names.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.320]   Dinosaur escape.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.400]   Dinosaur is escape.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.880]   And then I have the super fantastic monkey.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.320]   See, I'd never forget that name.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:06.840]   Well, yeah.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.800]   It's just like, where are you?
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.680]   It's an image.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.960]   All on super fantastic monkey.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.480]   But I'd like to change over to dinosaur is escape.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.720]   That makes sense.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.960]   And all my networks.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.000]   You know, you've got to give it because you know everyone's
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.600]   going to look at what your name is.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.480]   So it really has to be memorable.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.560]   See, I'm so boring.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.120]   I do things.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.160]   This was as if Davis did.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.360]   I like to name him after Greek gods and stuff like that.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.440]   Or actually, my Wi-Fi access point,
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.600]   you're named after Dead Rockstar.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.200]   Morrison, Joplin, Hendrix.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:32.680]   That's--
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.640]   I know my Drobo is all after bellies.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.200]   I think of them as big bellies.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.920]   So I have Fat Belly and Deli--
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.960]   and I have Deli Belly and Yellow Belly.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.880]   Oh, he's eating him.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.720]   So I used to manage a whole host of servers in my corporate.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.800]   And we used to name them all after Irish whiskey.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.520]   No, whiskeys.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:49.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:50.520]   That's a good idea.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.400]   Blem around G and Glamphidic.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.360]   And there was one that kept crashing.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.440]   It was called Glamilla.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.440]   Oh.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.840]   That's terrible.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.560]   That is terrible.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.880]   Fortunately, only people over 80 get that joke.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.120]   So that's--
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:03.840]   we'll leave it at that.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.360]   Drobo.com/Macbreak.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.680]   You see how for code Macbreak weekly.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.640]   And then be creative with your naming.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.720]   And if you have a clever name, send it to us.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.200]   Well, how do you--
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.000]   that's a new contest.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.640]   How do you name your Drobo?
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.120]   How do you name your Drobo?
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.160]   All of your IP address.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.560]   And whether you have file sharing turned on on that device.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.440]   We'd love to know.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.040]   Just send it along to Leo@twit.tv.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.080]   All right, let's run through.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:30.080]   So availability is soon.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.880]   I didn't think it would be available day of, I guess.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.400]   I was hoping.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.400]   That was something.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.880]   Every-- the consensus--
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.160]   we had some good people on Twit who
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.880]   have a lot of experience with this Joshua Topolski
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.200]   and Gajas said, no, no, it'll be 10 days on the nose.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.200]   And he said, because--
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.600]   not for any manufacturing reason,
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.760]   but because they want time for people to build up slathering
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.640]   desire.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:52.560]   Really?
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.040]   The big line.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.200]   Don't you want people to run into the store immediately?
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.560]   I don't understand that.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.080]   I don't know that Apple's never had a problem building up
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.000]   desire for it.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.840]   So why would they wait 10 days or 15 days?
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.360]   A line's preparation, I think.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.800]   They also just want to make sure that the message gets out
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.800]   before the products actually shift.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.600]   So they don't want people-- OK, that makes sense.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.960]   They know what the kind of people like us who
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.760]   watch these keynotes and know immediately
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.360]   to run to the store and buy everyone,
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.240]   they want time for the normal people to see the ads.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.800]   So they know it's in the store, and then they
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.800]   can put them on sale.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.840]   They want to make sure that people know what it is that
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.760]   makes it so interesting, as opposed to somebody
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.160]   saying, well, this is just like Blackberry comes up
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.000]   with a new device every year.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.800]   HTC comes up with seven devices every year.
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.160]   This is not just simply every year.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.520]   Apple comes up with a new phone.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.320]   They have a point to it, and here's what the point is.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.240]   I mean, any times that's what came out when people were
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.000]   claiming that the Gizmodo iPhone-- well, that was an
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.200]   intentional leak to the drama world.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.320]   Apple has never had a problem getting people interested
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:46.920]   in their products.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.640]   Anybody who's tried to buy a 3G iPad can tell you.
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:53.320]   Although let's point out, Gizmodo did have the phone.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.360]   That's the phone, right?
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:54.860]   Yeah.
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:58.000]   But see, I was looking back to the original report.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.380]   Let's not forget, they had it in their hands.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.380]   They took it apart as far as they possibly could.
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:04.640]   They did not know what--
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.120]   They still missed the story.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.540]   They did not know that the frame was actually the antenna.
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.220]   They did not know that the back was glass.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.280]   They said it was plastic.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.200]   They missed the story.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.440]   If you pay $500,000 and take that risk, get the story.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.440]   Send it to something.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.900]   You can hire a guy who simply says, here's someone who's
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.520]   in the business of building these things.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.720]   Sent it to the same teardown guys who do the professional
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.420]   teardowns.
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.500]   Tell us what is in here.
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.020]   I fix it.
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.300]   They'll tell you.
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.500]   Of course, I fix it wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.240]   That's the problem is you've got this tainted object nobody
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.860]   wants.
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.620]   You know what?
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.060]   John Gruber got the story.
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.700]   The big story is the resolution of this split.
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.540]   And John called it exactly right.
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.860]   Wow.
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:44.220]   Wow.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:44.540]   What is it?
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.740]   960 by 800?
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:46.100]   What is it?
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.180]   960 by 640.
[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.180]   640.
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.220]   The big deal is a 326 per inch.
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.340]   DPI, the DPI.
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:52.780]   It's unbelievable.
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.340]   I mean, more than a laser printer.
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.880]   Well, it's more than an art magazine.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:02.720]   When you go to an art magazine in the store, maybe it's 300 DPI.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.320]   But it's a very, very high resolution.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.360]   I think the interesting point is that it's 75 DPI greater
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.600]   than the HTC Incredible and the HTC Evo.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.240]   And in fact, what it does is it's not only sets a standard
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:16.920]   for phones now.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.320]   It's just a standard for desktops.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.840]   It's a standard for laptops.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.160]   It sets a standard for the iPad.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.280]   It sets a standard for everything.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.280]   We've never seen a display.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.380]   Now, Don, you and Andy probably got to hold it.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.380]   Did you hold it?
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.740]   No, no, Andy did.
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.660]   So Andy, tell us.
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:31.460]   Tell us what does it look like?
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.540]   For reasons that are stupid to relate,
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:37.260]   I had but the most bearish refractions of FaceTime with it.
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.460]   But within the few scant seconds I had,
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.220]   the display is kind of a little bit off-putting.
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.340]   It's so good.
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.580]   It reminds you of being in Best Buy and walking up
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:45.660]   and about to pick up the phone.
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.260]   And they realized that, no, there's no point.
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.940]   That's just the sample display that has a sticker on front of it
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:50.660]   to--
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:51.300]   It's that good.
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.140]   Because they're worried about people--
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.140]   It's rock solid.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.140]   It's really good.
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.600]   The real enhancement-- this is something that I had more time--
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.720]   unfortunately, I have to admit that I had more time looking
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.940]   at the display via the keynote than via the actual device
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:02.520]   itself.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.480]   But what really impressed me was not so much
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.880]   the higher resolution of the display,
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.680]   but what it does to color.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.000]   That when you look at the springboard,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.280]   when you look at the home screen,
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.280]   the shadows are so much more reasonable.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.600]   There's so much-- there's much less of a graphic effect
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.200]   and more of it in actual detail.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.840]   There's photos, skin tones are less bandy, less blemishy
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.180]   and blotchy.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.480]   I think it's going to set the standard for just showing
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.500]   people what pictures look like.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.700]   It's going to be really interesting.
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.860]   If you have an iPhone 4 in your pocket and an iPad
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.700]   and you want to show pictures of your baby,
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.880]   do you show them the big version on your iPad
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.580]   or the better color version on the little pocket?
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.100]   How is the color reproduction on it?
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.340]   Do we know?
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.740]   I mean, this is one of the wraps on the Nexus
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.500]   is that as good as that AMOLED screen is,
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.740]   it doesn't do very good color reproduction.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.280]   And also inside the demo room, it
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.580]   had the same sort of really flattering lighting
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.540]   that they had in the iPad.
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.500]   So you can't tell.
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.100]   So also, whatever it's going to know is the first thing you
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.140]   do is you take it outside of bright sunlight
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.620]   because that's the fail of the Nexus 1
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.100]   and so many of the other Google phones.
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.220]   I have to say, though, on the way in,
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:06.580]   I had the Nexus 1 in the iPad.
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.700]   And I just wanted to see I held them on both and bright light.
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.860]   Neither one is that.
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.340]   I mean-- OK, but this is an iPad compared to a phone
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.220]   that you're actually putting your pocket on.
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.340]   But it's the same.
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.700]   It's this IPS technology on the iPhone 2.
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.220]   It's terrible.
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.340]   I had the-- I was using the Nexus 1 as my main phone
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.180]   for two whole weeks.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.960]   I only stopped the day I left for San Francisco.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.400]   I wanted to make sure I re-familiarized myself with it.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.960]   And also learn fro-yo, which is an awesome operating system.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.600]   And the idea that I have to shade my phone to dial it
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:32.760]   in sunlight that--
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.640]   If you turn it all the way up, you can see.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.640]   You have to turn it all the way up.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.520]   Well, they have changed the manufacturing process
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.040]   though for the new iPhone.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.240]   And that they are now bonding the two layers together.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.360]   And apparently, again, this is Gruber called on this one
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:44.920]   when he looked at it.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.240]   It looks as though rather than looking through glass
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.000]   at the images.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.760]   It looks as though the image is actually on the glass.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.760]   There's no refraction.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.260]   It's so banded together.
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.060]   You don't--
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.980]   Yeah, that's a very good one.
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.880]   As a photographer, Lisa, do you think this now?
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.000]   I mean, it's five megapixels, which is a credible number
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.780]   of megapixels if it's a decent.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.380]   We don't know what the chip is and so forth.
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.500]   But you sure get something that looks nice on there.
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.980]   Well, I mean, recently, obviously,
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:10.900]   testing my new app, Camera Plus.
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:11.420]   We'll plug it.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:11.900]   We'll plug it.
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:12.740]   Don't worry.
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:13.700]   You're going to get plenty of plugs.
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.160]   I've been leaving my 5D Mark II behind and just
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.220]   the iPhone.
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:22.760]   And to think that that quality is going to increase really
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.900]   excites me and also the possibility
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:29.260]   of showing my photos at the quality at the level
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:30.480]   that I want to show.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.760]   I mean, I always have my portfolio on my phone.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.000]   So I know I'm on a plane or I meet someone.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.100]   I can just show my portfolio.
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.120]   So that is really exciting.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.880]   What I'm really excited about is the flash.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.780]   And I'm also really excited about the ability
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.020]   to use it as a continuous light source
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.120]   when you're shooting video.
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:53.120]   And obviously, HD video is something you're probably
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.300]   really excited about.
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:58.160]   And I think that it's definitely going
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:02.980]   to change the way we use the iPhone.
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.200]   I have to say, I'm kind of thinking,
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.040]   I don't need to carry a video camera.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.360]   Well, that's what happened with me.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.440]   I mean, on this trip, I've brought my Canon PowerShotg.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.440]   10, I've brought a little Kodak ZIA.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.600]   I've brought my iPhone.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.960]   And I'm not a great photographer,
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.560]   but I like to take snaps and take a case of a piece of video.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.420]   And with the new phone, I would actually just leave
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.260]   that all behind.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.580]   I just type the phone with me.
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:23.100]   I know just with my iPhone.
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:26.820]   When I went to Africa, I took Canon 5D Mark II.
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.820]   Which is a great--
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.060]   And my iPhone video.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.540]   In between those two, I have high resolution stills
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.700]   in video and smaller, more portable resolution stills.
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:35.780]   And this makes it only better.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.340]   Now, one thing I will say about the video,
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:38.300]   and I haven't tested it yet.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.420]   So we're going to throw this thing.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.660]   As soon as we get it, we're going to throw it up against charts.
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:42.420]   And we're going to show it.
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.380]   I'm going to guess that it's like all the other cameras that
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:45.900]   are like this.
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.600]   So this HD stuff is exciting in theory.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:54.400]   But the chip and the lens are not able to resolve 720p.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.280]   So the thing is, this is marketing.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.280]   I just want to--
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.200]   Well, no, wait a minute.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.800]   OK, so that means it can't resolve five megapixels.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.200]   Because 720p is really only a megapixel or two.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.120]   It's not really.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.440]   So it's not even a five megapixel.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.440]   You know, all of these things--
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.000]   Yeah, it is.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.080]   It's capturing five megapixels.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:10.720]   And it may be--
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.320]   Well, that's enough for 720p.
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.200]   No, no, I understand.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.520]   But I'm just saying that when we put--
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.600]   I'm going to guess.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.320]   And we're going to see.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.620]   I'm going to put this up on the charts.
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.340]   And I put it up against a professional resolution chart.
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:20.900]   You'll see some of this.
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.980]   You're going to see that it's just going to all blur in
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:23.780]   to about--
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:25.540]   because what I found, like for instance,
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:31.500]   the Panasonic Lumix, which I have, whatever--
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.700]   when I have an LX3 or whatever.
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.300]   It's great.
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:36.740]   You know, it's a great still camera.
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.140]   You start shooting the video.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.860]   And it looks great at 640 by 360.
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.980]   But at 720p, which is what it advertises, it's soft.
[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.520]   You know, and so the thing is, is that--
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.760]   and the same with the flip--
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.120]   It's soft with the 78.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.160]   No, it's the same.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.360]   And so what I'm saying is that I'm glad that they're doing
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:52.880]   all this stuff.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.720]   I don't need them to give me a higher resolution,
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:57.440]   because I know I'm not really getting that.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:02.120]   But what I will say is that at this point, for just the camera
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.320]   that I'm going to carry around, like if I want something
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.760]   in my pocket, it's going to be my iPhone.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.200]   I'm done with getting point and shoots that are--
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.880]   unless they're specialty cameras like this 3D Fuji camera
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.440]   or something like that.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.420]   All I'm going to have is specialty cameras on my big camera.
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.420]   But my-- oh, I got to carry something around and take
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:18.260]   pictures.
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.820]   It's going to be my iPhone with this one.
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:21.620]   This has gone over that threshold for me.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.140]   I don't know if I go that far.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.720]   I mean, anytime that I have any chance
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.300]   I want to take any decent pictures,
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.300]   I will always have a pocket camera with me.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.940]   Because the controls, the amount of control I have over
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.220]   how the thing gets illuminated.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:35.900]   Plus, remember that you're not going to have a variable zoom.
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.180]   It's just going to be a fixed focal length camera.
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:39.740]   But the thing that really gets me interested
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:41.420]   is this increased low light performance,
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.660]   at least what they've been talking about.
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:45.200]   They're a thing that has a backside illuminated sensor,
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.400]   which is usually for low light.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.160]   The very, very smart thing that they did--
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.080]   and this is a complaint that I talked about in both of my
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:55.840]   reviews of 8 megapixel cameras on those two Android phones--
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.680]   is that, well, great.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.000]   You've got a number that's larger than the previous number.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.440]   You've got 8 instead of 5.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.160]   But it doesn't take better pictures.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.640]   It keeps getting any time you-- if you have a nice flat
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.040]   lighting without really intense highs or lows,
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:08.960]   it does an OK job.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.680]   And any other source circumstance is really, really
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:11.400]   terrible.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:15.300]   And yet, by keeping it at 5, they're leaving the image pixels
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.520]   like really, really large enough that they can get good
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.600]   sampling and low noise.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.880]   There's the shots that they were showing up there during
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.200]   the keynote were for a camera phone.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.160]   Actually, I should have been qualified.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.000]   They're just spectacular shots.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.880]   You don't even want to say for a camera phone, they're very,
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.320]   very good.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.920]   If they just snuck those in there saying, oh, well, we took
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.400]   a walk in San Francisco.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.720]   Yeah, but that's a demo.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:38.200]   Come on.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.200]   Who knows what they did.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.200]   But do it.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.760]   I have seen demo photos from every single camera
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.280]   back there.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.560]   But don't exactly say, wow, for a camera phone, that looks
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.120]   really, really good.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:52.320]   Yeah, and let's be honest with the fact that do we actually
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:56.680]   need like 720p coming from our iPhone?
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.560]   I mean, it's about capturing moments.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:03.000]   It'll be good enough for the baby's first steps and--
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.400]   Yeah, the news.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.920]   I mean, this is like when you look at--
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.320]   Is it better-- let me ask you this.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.560]   Is it better than broadcast?
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.200]   The old standard definition SD broadcast, I guess it
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:13.680]   probably is.
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.960]   I guess it's probably in that-- well, the lens is going
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.360]   to be different.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.360]   The lens makes a huge difference.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.160]   The lens is what makes you--
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.200]   Oh, yeah, because these are all the same pickups
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.160]   in most of these cameras.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.920]   It's the software.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.720]   It's the glass or plastic.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.360]   Well, the thing, when you look at a professional camera,
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.320]   you have an enormous amount.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.960]   In a perfect condition, a lot of these cameras look similar.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.920]   It's when the conditions are imperfect,
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.280]   that the lens really comes out, that the size of the chip
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.840]   comes out, that all these other things come out.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.240]   So professional cameras are very different.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.640]   But when you look at news gathering,
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.720]   I think that the iMovie combination with the camera--
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.000]   It's good for CNN, as we said.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.280]   If you're like-- well, especially in countries
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.080]   where people are sensitive about--
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.920]   you're in Iran during a big event,
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.840]   being able to pop open an iPhone and shoot a bunch of what's
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.400]   going on, then edit it, and then upload it.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.800]   Can I say one thing or even better?
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.680]   Just basically look like you're just making a call,
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.360]   but actually you're filming someone getting beaten.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.960]   Yeah, I think in transmission.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.240]   What worries me is that--
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.160]   Maybe I'm wrong, has Apple posted images or video
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.720]   direct from the phone yet?
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.600]   Have we been able to look at them directly?
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.520]   It worries me a little bit that we haven't seen that.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.640]   Doesn't that indicate that maybe it's not going to be--
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.360]   They did say during the presentation that the footage
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.320]   they showed on stage was actually untouched footage
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.160]   from the phone.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.520]   I want to see it, though.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.440]   But also--
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.320]   It was obviously shot.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.800]   But I would like to know the name of the person
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.160]   who got the shot, because it was definitely
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.480]   professional level footage.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.480]   And there I'm talking about the selection of shots,
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.480]   the way that instinctively--
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:35.980]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:36.680]   --you've had five years of training.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.040]   You know that I'm going to walk behind him,
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.040]   then I'm going to let my--
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.640]   I don't pan back while the person walks back.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.040]   Well, of course you're going to give it to--
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.440]   You're not going to give it to me.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.080]   I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I should
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.000]   something for Steve's keynote.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.240]   I mean, they're going to use it.
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.320]   He did say that some of our employees went out
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.120]   with iPhone 4s.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.760]   We got lost the phone back.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.920]   And I thought this was strange when Steve said,
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.160]   I'd like to show you a little movie I made.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:58.920]   Like he made.
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:37:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.240]   I did say.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:01.880]   Maybe he did.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.240]   I don't know.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.200]   Maybe he really likes using--
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.400]   Well, his excitement they didn't actually show
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.720]   was I can just imagine your iPhone and your iPad.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.880]   Once they get iMovie onto the iPad.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.880]   You know, then--
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.560]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.800]   --because you can then just connect you.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.800]   I mean, you can do it now with--
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.800]   You just got to use iMovie on a screen.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.280]   Yeah, it is a bit limiting.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.760]   But on the iPad, you've got this one.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:19.260]   Fine.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:24.000]   Well, I think when we talk about the rumored missing camera
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.640]   mounts and so on and so forth on the iPad,
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:29.400]   I do think the iPad's pretty compelling with a camera mount.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:29.760]   I'm just--
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.280]   I'm down the road.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.400]   I'm not sure, though.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.400]   You still get the problem of how do you
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.600]   walk down the street holding it like this?
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.200]   It would be fun.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.600]   It would be like a big monitor.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.200]   No, I know.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.080]   I can't see the screen, so I can't really
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.200]   see what I'm shooting.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:41.700]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:42.200]   Oh, no.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.000]   You'd have a back monitor.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.360]   Well, if you have a back monitor,
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.480]   you're going to anger all the people
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.280]   who wanted a front mounted camera for a face.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:47.680]   Are you just both?
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.680]   Like, you get this?
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:49.120]   Oh, there is.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:49.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.000]   I take it back.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.680]   There is an iPhone for photo gallery online.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.680]   So we can see these images.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.600]   Well, that's a pretty good image from a camera phone.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.000]   OK.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.120]   If you have to dig through the specs,
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.160]   go to the camera page on apple.com,
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.440]   and they do have a gallery.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.480]   I think it's just about the potential of great shots
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.400]   and just the immediacy of it.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.360]   And not-- you always have your phone.
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.360]   I pretty much walk around with my phone.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:16.880]   It is.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.520]   The best camera you have, the best
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.080]   camera is the one you have with it, right?
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:23.280]   Yeah, and so it's about capturing moments right away,
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.200]   and the ability to share them immediately.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.920]   The life handling in this is quite good.
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.280]   I don't know how much retouch this is,
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.600]   but that's one of the things camera phones do not do well.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:34.240]   It's white balance and handling odd contrast.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.360]   This is a good example.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.720]   That previous one is perfect.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.960]   This is a hard shot to get.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.480]   When we were in the bright.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.920]   Believe it or not, when I was in Bermuda,
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.360]   I literally had five phones with me in my bag.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.400]   So I wanted to go to the beach, compare that with--
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.360]   compare all five phones to this to see how well it handled.
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:54.520]   Like beach scenes were intense blue, different shaded beach
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.360]   sand, and all of them just really just blew it.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.120]   Even the iPhone was probably best in terms
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.680]   of overall lighting color, but all of them really blew it.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.920]   These wouldn't seem really vibrant, but--
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.640]   They say this is un-retouched.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.600]   If that's the case, unbl--
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.520]   Well, can-- would they lie?
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.520]   I don't know.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:11.320]   I don't think they can.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.320]   I don't think they would.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.960]   I don't think they're saying it's un-retouched.
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.560]   And they might shoot 40 of them to get the ones that are--
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.400]   You can see it blown out.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.320]   I mean, you can see these blue whites are going--
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.320]   Pointed never, never to land.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.560]   But at the same time, they're getting detail in the shadow
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.080]   here.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.720]   Well, that's-- you get one of the top shots.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:26.760]   You know, so you get one of them.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.560]   This is a tough shot.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.120]   And that's why I'm zooming in on it.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.000]   What should I zoom in on that you want to see more of?
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:33.360]   Zoom?
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.360]   The pencils for a second.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.320]   Pencils the color.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.480]   I have to say on the pencils, especially since we know
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.320]   what a Ticonderoga number two pencils
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.360]   supposed to look like, is it awful?
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.720]   Let's look at the detail here.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.520]   That's pretty good.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.760]   I got to say, though, I don't recall the color in the keynote
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.320]   being quite so vivid.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.880]   This is pretty-- well, yeah.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.000]   I'm sure your monitor's a well-tuned,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.840]   and maybe I'm just misremembering.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.920]   I remember that being not quite so much of a--
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.040]   --we didn't have a citrusy orange.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.600]   Our monitors are not well-tuned.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.400]   It could very well be--
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.880]   But the color reproduction does seem accurate.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.560]   And the detail-- and I guess that's
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.400]   what I'd look at in a camera phone, too, is the fine detail--
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.760]   is pretty good.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.800]   It seems fairly low noise as well.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:15.040]   You can see some grain here, but not bad.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.520]   Oh, that's OK.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.960]   You want to look at some video?
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.200]   I think there's video on here, too.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.960]   I'll see if I can find it while we talk.
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.120]   So that's pretty impressive.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.920]   I mean, look, admittedly, look, it's not
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.200]   going to replace a 5D mark, too.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.920]   But this is one in your pocket.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.760]   That's exactly right.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.880]   I mean, whenever I think I'm going to be taking pictures,
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:32.320]   I take my little mic on pocket.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.160]   When I know I'm going to have a whole day of someplace
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.280]   spectacular, I'll take the SLR.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.960]   But it's always good to the camera you happen to have with you
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.440]   all the time is now that much better.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.520]   I'm getting close to buying--
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:42.960]   I'm going to close to them right away.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:43.400]   Right away.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.200]   And I think--
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.520]   That's true, right from the phone, don't you?
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:48.600]   I mean, there are these great apps like Camera Plus
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.880]   that you could use to touch them up in the phone.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:52.400]   So--
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.320]   And the phone and share them?
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.800]   But that's the most curious part of it, especially
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.000]   when they got into the iMovie for the iPhone demo.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.280]   Because when they finished the demo
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.480]   and they showed the finished video,
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.760]   it looks spectacular with motion maps, with GPS,
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.400]   and transitions, and complex titles, and Ken Burns' effects.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.080]   And I'm thinking, you know what?
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.360]   I'm really not going to stand there in a bus terminal
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:13.480]   and edit this together.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.120]   All I really want to do is take Shot A,
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.920]   Payson and Shot B, Payson and Shot C.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:17.360]   Great.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.000]   Put on a YouTube.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.440]   Anything more complicated than that,
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.480]   I'm more than happy to go into my desktop
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.960]   and then simply sync it and then sit down and patiently
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:24.720]   have a whole screen work.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.880]   How long is that going to take top load, though?
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.920]   Well, the other thing, though, is that I really found myself
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.640]   on AT&T's network.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:31.680]   I know when I was in--
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.080]   No, we understand the two gigabyte cap.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:34.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.080]   Touching.
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.600]   OK.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.200]   I think when I was in Africa, I would have been very happy to--
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.200]   I shot a lot of stuff.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.080]   And I found myself using the Squarespace app,
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.160]   where I could just take photos and upload from there.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.840]   But the thing is, there were a lot of times
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.000]   I didn't want to pull up my laptop.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.280]   I didn't want to do all this stuff.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.080]   I just wanted to--
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.840]   I would have been happy to edit some of the videos.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.240]   And the reason I didn't post as many videos
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.000]   is because I was like, oh, I have to take it and put it
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.840]   on my laptop and I have to do this stuff.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.600]   And for me, just being able to go through and cut it.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.240]   And I don't know how easy that's going to be.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.120]   The touch stuff and everything else,
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.480]   that's going to be the big question is, is it really--
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.800]   I still-- I look at it like that might be hurt my fingers.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.400]   Yeah, it looked like a very streamlined interface.
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.680]   But the one person I felt sorry for was stuck.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.240]   I met someone after the keynote.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.320]   And I was asked--
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.240]   he used to use a question.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.400]   How-- what do you think of the keynote?
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.600]   He said, well, let me tell you, for the past
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.880]   next month, I've been working on the--
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:25.360]   I've been working on the Flip video application for the iPhone.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.200]   And now I really think I'm out of a job.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.280]   Oh, man.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.160]   I said, oh, dear, I'm sorry.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.880]   I was complaining about the Wi-Fi,
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:36.640]   but I think you have more reason to be upset than I do.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:40.440]   And when you look at the price point, Flip is 200.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:44.080]   So when you have all that, the capability to do all that,
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.800]   I mean, and a Flip doesn't take photos.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.560]   So what I usually use is just like a Canon point and shoot.
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.600]   If I want to take just stills and video.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.840]   But the ability to do all that and make a phone call.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.440]   But of course, Flip doesn't come with a to your contract.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.080]   So yeah.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:58.440]   That's true.
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.000]   That's true.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:43:59.440]   That's true.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.600]   But Flip doesn't come with wireless connectivity, either.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.100]   Yeah.
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:02.440]   You know, that's true.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.360]   Yeah, but the iPhone doesn't come with a wrist strap, all right?
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.560]   Tough guy.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.040]   You want to go?
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.600]   We can go.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.440]   I can't find any sample video as far as I can tell.
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.000]   Maybe somebody in the chat room can find it.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.560]   They found the sample pictures.
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:14.840]   So--
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.800]   I do think that what Apple's doing is really doing this thing.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.120]   Again, when I talk about the iPad,
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.320]   I look at my kids and my parents.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.120]   And not so much the way I like to use cameras,
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.400]   but the way they like to use cameras.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.880]   And it's just like whatever little camera
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.920]   will take a photo and grab it and everything else.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.120]   When you look at that and then being
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:35.560]   able to carry their books and do other things
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.760]   and have all the little applications and everything else.
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:39.600]   You really are.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.400]   This is the device that you're putting,
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.800]   just your entire little world.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.440]   You used to say, is it good enough?
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.000]   But it's better than good enough, really.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.040]   The quality of the photos that will
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.120]   generate for the average person is better than they actually
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:50.480]   need.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:52.520]   So it's going to be the one that they'll carry with them all
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:53.040]   the time.
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.280]   That's going to be doubly important.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.200]   You don't lose your iPhone.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.440]   It's bad enough if people will see
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:59.480]   the past two years where the crummy 640 by 40 videos.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:03.120]   Now they'll see your entire life in high death.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:06.200]   I have to say, editing myself in HD
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.640]   is one of the most humbling experience.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.240]   Oh, give me a break.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.240]   Oh, you go.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:12.720]   You try to say--
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.360]   Oh, I don't have to.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.160]   I just thought it's beautiful to high death
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.480]   as I am in regular life.
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.440]   I find it highlights all my flaws.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:21.960]   The Blanche du Blanche.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.440]   The light, the light.
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.880]   Of course it's light.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.880]   When I was a fair younger child, I was kind of big.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:30.880]   I'm sorry, Lisa.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.040]   I haven't liked to breathe on my life anymore.
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.040]   I'm going to give you a hard time at everybody sitting
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:35.880]   and not buying it.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.600]   Editing in high death.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:39.240]   My god.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.240]   People were very bad.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.760]   Bad, bad people.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.040]   All right.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:45.080]   So I think a big winner in display--
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.800]   There's nothing competing with it.
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.840]   Although we'll withhold judgment till we hold one in our hands.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.560]   But that seems to--
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.440]   You know, there are eight megapixel cameras.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.880]   The Evo has eight megapixel camera.
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.160]   A lot of these phones have it.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.480]   But eight megapixels, as you point out, Alex doesn't really
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:01.880]   mean anything because it's all kind of digitally enhanced.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.880]   Would you take yours and put it up against the chart
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.160]   with this one when it comes out?
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.040]   That's what we had to do is compare the eight megapixel
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.400]   to the five megapixel and see how it's resolving.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.120]   Video, good, eye movie.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.440]   Who cares, right?
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.640]   Well, I think it's just the potential of it moving to the iPad
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:22.400]   and not being something that people would be able to use.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.840]   I just don't see people editing a movie.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.040]   No, again, we're getting a little bit of fun.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:25.880]   We'll be using it too.
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:26.880]   I just think we love fingertips.
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:28.160]   The getting us used to the whole concept of, you know,
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:32.480]   if it's as simple to do the simple clip A, clip B, clip C,
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:36.440]   combine post to YouTube as it is to do a really impressive big
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.000]   display.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:37.520]   That's fine.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:40.120]   If I can be in and out in less than a minute,
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.600]   then maybe that's a feature that I would use.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.840]   I was thinking of that Trip to China, where I had the big $1,000
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:48.520]   really good consumer 3CCD IHD cam and had the little flip cam.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:51.320]   I shot maybe 20 minutes with the $1,000 camera
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:53.960]   and maybe four hours with the flip because I wanted to use it
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.320]   and it was always with me.
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:58.720]   And so if I don't use eye movie a lot because it seems
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:01.520]   like such a production to do an editing project.
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.120]   So if I could be like on the train on the way home or on the plane
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.280]   and simply saying I've got four hours to kill before my plane
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.840]   lands and cut together what is actually kind of a good
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.440]   little eight minute video of my entire trip.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.880]   That would be a big one for me.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:13.960]   There already are applications.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.040]   I mean, one of the potential casualties of yesterday
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.360]   is like real director, which can get both of the iPad
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.160]   and also for the iPhone.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.400]   And that's a full blown video editor.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.320]   Which I recommended.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.280]   You know, I was my pick.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.360]   Yeah, I thought it was great.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.080]   Yeah, I thought it was really--
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.320]   Not that I used it.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.720]   Did you use it?
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:27.720]   I know.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.280]   Thank you for your time.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.400]   I could have reached it.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.440]   It's beauty.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.120]   Yeah, I loved it.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:35.120]   The idea existed.
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:35.920]   This is such a great idea.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:36.920]   We salute your sponge.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.240]   I did test it and it worked.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.120]   So that was good for me.
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:41.800]   I only found it like three days ago,
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:42.320]   whatever.
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:42.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.320]   OK, listen to the show more often.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:49.600]   And imagine people that say they're windows users
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:55.280]   or they don't have a computer that they can edit with.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.000]   Like, lolcat people.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:57.920]   It's good for lolcats.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.560]   You see a cat running on a treadmill.
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.000]   It's good for lolcats.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.680]   You know, you can get that all edited together and up.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.520]   And you do want sometimes a little bit more
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:12.240]   than just a little bit more than just trimming the ends.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.760]   You know, where there's just a little something in the middle
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.760]   you wanted to get rid of or there's a little something
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:16.400]   somewhere else.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.520]   And with a little bit of training,
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:22.120]   someone can understand, oh, I could shoot something wide
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.480]   and then I could go in and shoot a couple inserts.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:26.520]   And then I could just paste them on top of that.
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:27.320]   You know, those are all--
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.520]   Just hand your fuzzy hair.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.040]   We need some second unit footage.
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:32.680]   It's going to happen.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.600]   They're telling you.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:39.880]   Now, they-- I don't know if this-- this unlike the--
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.920]   this is video on the page, but unlike the pictures,
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.920]   it doesn't say un-retouched video directly from a phone.
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:48.040]   In fact, it looks much more like an ad.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.160]   Also, because this has been compressed and prepared
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:50.800]   for streaming.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:51.280]   Right.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.800]   So it's not a good way to test it.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.280]   It is the same place they took the picture of the guy.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.080]   Out at--
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.120]   See, well, actually--
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:01.600]   I'm sure they put it on a tripod for that shot.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:04.440]   But I wanted to ask if iMovie for iPhone
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.040]   has image stabilization built into it.
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.360]   There is IS somewhere.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:10.200]   I saw IS whether it's in the camera.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.560]   You would assume so, yeah.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.840]   Seems like I could with the gyro and the--
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.000]   You know, like all those things that they should know
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.200]   if the gyro jiggle in.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:17.960]   It's got a gyro.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.800]   OK, what is the deal with the gyro?
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:21.520]   It's a more--
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.440]   It's for gaming.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:27.200]   Well, it's a more fine-tuned-- combined with the motion--
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.400]   you know, all the other pieces.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.720]   It's just going to be a much more fine-tuned ability
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.360]   to know exactly what's happening with the--
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.360]   Yeah, because now instead of simply
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:37.680]   taking a guess based on the motion of the device itself,
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:41.360]   it basically knows what is gravity doing to this device
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:42.360]   at this moment.
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:44.640]   So it gets three axes right off the gyro,
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.720]   combined with the other sensors.
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:50.400]   Apple says it's now a six-ass axis motion position sensor.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.480]   And the demo that they did on screen, which was hard--
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.360]   a little bit hard for me to follow until they switched
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.960]   from gyros on to gyros off.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.360]   You see the precision that was now
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.640]   possible to rotate a game and have control over--
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.240]   Just a little better than an accelerometer.
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.800]   Imagine Farmville.
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:04.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:05.960]   I'm trying not to.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:09.560]   I really want to see how people exploited outside of gaming,
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:10.080]   though.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.360]   Just like the first camera app, a Street View
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.360]   that is a little bit punchier.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.360]   I actually want to see a compass app that doesn't just
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.440]   start jerking the camera left and right.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.400]   I want to be able to know, look, I just want to know,
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.640]   do I walk that way or that way?
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:26.680]   And it's sending me inside of a brick wall instead.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.240]   I know the big area that this could prove a real boon
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.320]   is augmented reality.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.880]   Yeah, yeah, layer and stuff like that.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:36.120]   By the way, I know where I saw I.S.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.760]   It's in that new camera plus application.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:39.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.200]   Just taking the world.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.800]   Will that be the camera plus application?
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.720]   We keep hearing so doggone much about the app.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.880]   Oh, man, is this going to be using the gyro and everything?
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.280]   Will it be able to use that stuff?
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:47.800]   Yeah, I mean, once--
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:49.400]   It's just tapping into core motion.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.240]   I mean, once we heard all those things,
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:53.880]   we're like, OK, we're getting back to--
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:54.640]   Yeah, version two.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:57.360]   That was one of those really wonderful little gasps
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.520]   and applause from the audience.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.560]   Because it's a developer keynote.
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:01.120]   It's a developer keynote.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.720]   So when developer says, oh, by the way,
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.640]   we now have core motion, meaning that just ask the phone what's
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.800]   happening to it, and it will tell you in plain English
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.400]   where English developers can understand.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.080]   By the way, Lisa, this does seem like the one camera at.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:15.160]   No, I'm really, really proud of it.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.760]   This is pretty-- this is very sweet.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.400]   It's got it all.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:17.920]   It's got effects.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:18.520]   It's got cropping.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.720]   It's got borders.
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:21.400]   And those are my special effects.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:22.520]   I'm sharing them with you.
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:24.360]   Thank you.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:25.120]   And I really--
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:27.000]   Like box, it's got built-in sharing.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:27.680]   This is very cool.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.360]   Flickr, Twitter, Facebook.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.280]   And we have our own sharing site as well,
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:32.720]   so you don't have to use TwitchPix.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:33.560]   Who's doing this with you?
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:34.680]   Tap, tap, tap.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:35.320]   Wow.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:37.280]   And they are perfect.
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:38.320]   They're good.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.120]   They're probably the best iPhone developers out there.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.160]   That's really good, Lisa.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:44.120]   I just have to say that--
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.360]   Oh, my god.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:48.240]   You just look horrible and high-def.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.240]   You really-- I'm sorry.
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:51.240]   I'll have to move my pointer.
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.240]   Every picture you take of all of your friends
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:54.440]   will look exactly like that.
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:55.440]   Just like that.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.920]   Like that.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:59.920]   I understand the Casa Desperate Housewise
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.080]   use no other application for their promo pictures.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:04.000]   This is-- what is this?
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.960]   Like $20,000 with a camera here?
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:06.800]   Yes.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:07.920]   They asked me--
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.320]   They said, what's your dream rig?
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.160]   $10,000.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:10.680]   Wow.
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:14.320]   And I wrote everything down from every single lens
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.160]   that I'd ever want.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.000]   And then they're going to give it away.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.840]   They're going to pry it from my hand.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.640]   Yeah, you were like, what?
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:25.400]   I really hope somebody who's into photography
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.400]   and gets this because it's going to kill me
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.480]   if somebody wins this.
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.440]   What's it on eBay or--
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.560]   Vadimart 2.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.040]   Will it blend?
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.040]   Oh, no.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.040]   No.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.040]   No.
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.040]   Don't even say that.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.040]   Oh, it's--
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.040]   It's shuttered.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:42.040]   It's shuttered.
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.280]   It's such beautiful.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.840]   And just the fact that we spent so long sort of finding
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:49.640]   every little piece of gear, like it has a lens, baby.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:50.680]   And there has--
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:51.680]   How fun.
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:53.280]   Actually, it must have been fun to put together.
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.240]   Well, it was.
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:55.240]   And then I realized--
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.080]   By a rapper, I love that.
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:56.440]   The lens, baby.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:57.440]   I love that.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.440]   Extra battery pack.
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.440]   Extra battery pack.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:00.440]   Extra battery pack.
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:01.440]   I don't even have these things.
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.440]   And I realized I only had--
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:03.440]   You just got your 5D?
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.440]   I mean, come on.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.440]   I only have two.
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.440]   I only own two lenses.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:07.440]   Wow.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.440]   Right.
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.440]   Because it was supposed to be my gear, like when my gear.
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:11.440]   And they're all--
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:12.440]   There wasn't much.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:13.440]   A flash.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:17.160]   Well, you should have tuned the contest that way where all your old gear that you
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.160]   replaced with the new stuff.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.160]   There you go.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.120]   Here's two-year ago, a camera body.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:25.440]   Here's the practica FX I bought in college for my photo class.
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:27.440]   No, it's--
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.440]   Enjoy.
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:29.440]   I included.
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:30.880]   APS is coming back as a phone format.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:31.880]   We just know it.
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.880]   They really should say that on the printout there.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:35.880]   Lisa Betty, not included.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.800]   Yeah, I'm really excited to share this.
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:38.800]   And--
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.800]   Oh, come on.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:44.840]   Hey, we're going to take a break, come back in just a bit with more about the iPhone.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:46.600]   And there's lots more to talk about.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:52.840]   And also Safari 5 and other and Apple announcements that nobody said anything about yet.
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:53.840]   But we will.
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:55.560]   Because as soon as I find them.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:59.240]   But Flast, I want to tell you how you can get that new iPhone 4.
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:01.440]   You're probably wondering, gee, I just bought my 3GS.
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.240]   It was nice of--
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:07.240]   To use Steve's words, generous of AT&T.
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:12.400]   That if you still under contract AT&T, if it expires in 2010, which of course nobody
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:18.800]   who bought a 3GS, my contract won't expire for another year, right?
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:21.480]   So-- but anyway, this is what you do.
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:22.640]   You don't sell it.
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.560]   You gazelle it.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:27.360]   You know, on average, in fact, I can do it right now.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.360]   Let's do it.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:34.760]   I think the gazelle price on a 3GS is very close to the price that it will cost you to
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:35.760]   get the new iPhone.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:39.880]   So it's kind of a push upgrade.
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:40.880]   Don't just sell it.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:42.440]   Gazelle it.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:44.960]   Let's see, iPhone.
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:47.360]   This is when their business gets very busy.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.960]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:56.440]   iPhone, I'm going to put a 3GS because I've got to get my money back out of this thing.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:57.440]   3GS.
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:03.080]   I have a-- I have a-- what do I have?
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.920]   I think I have a 32 gig.
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:05.920]   I think I did.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:07.360]   All right, let's search for it.
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:08.760]   Is it make a call successfully?
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:11.000]   Well, it's successful with any AT&T phone.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.400]   Is it free of water damage?
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:13.400]   Yes.
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:14.400]   Is it in good condition?
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.400]   Because I--
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:16.400]   Does it count if I dropped it in the toilet?
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.400]   Yes, no.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.400]   You cannot.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.400]   And I have the original.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:22.440]   And it actually will survive.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:23.440]   We've done some testing.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:24.440]   I've done some testing.
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:25.440]   Looks $272.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:26.440]   A warm wash.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:27.440]   I'm going to get almost all of it back.
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:29.640]   So they put it in rice for four days and it'll work for sure.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:30.640]   Really?
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:31.640]   Warm wash?
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:32.640]   You tried this?
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:33.640]   Unfortunately, yes.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:34.640]   But don't--
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:35.640]   Man, the dryer.
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:36.640]   At that point, you cannot gazelle it.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:37.640]   You have to tell them because there's a little thing in it.
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:38.640]   There was washed and dried.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:39.640]   Not this one.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:40.640]   So you can't gazelle it.
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:41.640]   I gave it to someone else in the office.
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:42.640]   I said, if you can get this to work, you can have it.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:49.360]   So gazelle sends you a box and you can put all your gadgets in there and they pay for
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:50.440]   the shipping.
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:51.760]   You send it to them.
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:52.760]   They assess it.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:55.680]   And if it matches the condition, you said they'll give you that amount.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:56:00.200]   They've in some cases they'll even give you more if you underestimated the value.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.600]   And now you're ready to buy your new iPhone.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.240]   See, isn't this great?
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.080]   They resell it.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.160]   Now here, that's a good question.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:09.920]   If it is not resellable, if there's nothing they can do with it, they recycle it and they
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:10.920]   use green recyclers.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.080]   They use certified.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:14.480]   So you know it's not being shipped offshore.
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:23.320]   They use cloud blue right now, although they go with all of this certified EPA EMS systems
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.440]   independently audited, the good recyclers.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.440]   So you're right.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:30.000]   If it's not resellable, 272 is a great price.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   Well, that was the 32 gigs.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.040]   So it's like $12 less than I paid for it.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:35.040]   Right.
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:36.040]   So but you know why?
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.920]   Because there is a good resale market on iPhone.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:39.920]   Right.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.920]   And they're doing pretty well on it.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:41.920]   And take it overseas.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.920]   Oh yeah, they're doing fine on it.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:47.600]   It's a really clever business G A Z E L L E dot com.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:49.640]   Let me show you one other thing I really like about gazelle.
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:54.560]   If you are a nonprofit and you're trying to fund a cause, it's better than a bake sale.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:56.240]   Have a gazelle sale.
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:00.520]   They will set up a gazelle page for your personalized gadget drive page.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:04.840]   You tell your people, you know, your families or whatever your soccer team.
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:07.680]   Go to gazelle at the special page.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:11.040]   Everything that they send in their donating to you and you get and it's great way to raise
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.760]   money for your favorite charity, better than a bake sale.
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:14.760]   Isn't that clever?
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:19.040]   I like this company G A Z E L L E dot com.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.360]   If you're getting a new iPhone and yeah, you're like me.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:24.440]   You got a 3GS so AT&T is not going to give you a break.
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:27.440]   At least you can sell it on gazelle G A Z E L L.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:29.400]   Is this available in Canada?
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:31.600]   Well, I don't know.
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.360]   Let me see.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:34.360]   I have no idea.
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:35.360]   That's a good question.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:36.360]   I have to move here.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:37.360]   Just move here.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:38.360]   Would you stop asking these tough questions?
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:39.360]   Just move here.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.360]   I don't see why not.
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:43.720]   I mean, you know, then there's that tariff thing though on the shipping, right?
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:45.640]   They send you the box.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:46.640]   It's used.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:47.960]   You put it in the box, then they send you a check.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:50.000]   I bet you could do it.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.880]   Would you find out somebody find out for us?
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.840]   Can you do gazelle in Canada?
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:54.840]   I will find out.
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:55.840]   I happen to have some friends.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:57.840]   What are you laughing at?
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:58.840]   I don't know.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:57:59.840]   It's kind of lonely up there in Canada.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:02.520]   But there's still some loss Leo.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.560]   Buy some drinks.
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:05.560]   I don't know.
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:08.920]   Oh, yeah, baby.
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.680]   Do the gazelle G A Z E L L E dot com.
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:13.880]   We thank them for their support of Matt Bragg.
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:14.880]   Go on.
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:16.280]   Don't just sell it.
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:17.280]   Gazelle it.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:18.280]   All right.
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:20.320]   So we covered the display.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:21.520]   We covered what else?
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.600]   What else do we need to cover?
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:24.320]   We covered the camera.
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:25.440]   We covered eye movie.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.320]   We covered the gyro multitask.
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:30.080]   Let's talk a little bit about some of the software updates.
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:33.960]   Steve, I have to say that folder demo was very elegant.
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:39.240]   The way you do the folder, you drag any application on top of any other application.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:44.520]   And then I don't know how names a folder, somehow logically based on iTunes category.
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:47.040]   iTunes category, app store categories.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.040]   So that's going to.
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:52.600]   So the example they use in the video is you drag a trip it or one of these travel apps
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:53.600]   to another travel app.
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:55.520]   Suddenly they're both in a folder called travel.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:57.520]   Love that.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:58.520]   Love your name as well.
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:01.160]   If you want to do your own name, you can edit it.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:02.160]   Okay.
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:04.720]   Now, look, Android's had folders for a while.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:06.080]   So this is catch up.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:09.120]   And this is an example of how Apple does it elegantly.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:10.120]   Right.
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:13.560]   It's like they don't get into the numbers game of saying we have more features than anybody
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:14.560]   else.
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:17.000]   They're just like we put in this feature the way that it should be implemented in a way
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.360]   that makes sense.
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:21.500]   And really the best illustration of this concept has been the way that cut copy and
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:26.000]   paste works on the iPhone compared to the way that works on Android, where it works
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.160]   kind of sort of and not in all applications.
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:30.560]   And sometimes it works not the way expected it to.
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:34.480]   If you're expecting to move the insertion point more precisely than you were able to.
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:36.320]   Good luck with that.
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.800]   It came late to the iPhone, but it came really, really well.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.800]   We're not getting folders the way that people are customarily expected to get them.
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:43.000]   It's a little weird, but it works.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.480]   But it's really what we don't want necessarily a directory file structure on the iPhone.
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:51.720]   What we want is the ability to take a million pages of icons and organize them logically.
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:54.760]   What I really like about is the fact that you can even drag folders into the dock.
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:58.400]   So if you want to essentially have an application launcher just for your social media apps,
[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:03.360]   tap the whole screen flips up for a bit showing you just all your social media app, tap and
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.280]   you're back in a Twitter.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:08.040]   So you can really run your entire show from just one page now.
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.640]   It seems very clever.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.480]   Multitasking also unique kind of implementation, but it seems effective.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:19.160]   Yeah, especially because they've essentially given people given developers the infrastructure
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.880]   for most of the tasks they actually want.
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:24.200]   The one that they demonstrated of course was Pandora running in the background.
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:25.200]   That's what everybody wants.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.200]   Whatever exactly you want.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:30.560]   In fact, even my mom's using the iPad, she said, can I play my farm game and have Pandora
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.560]   running?
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:32.800]   It's the first thing that comes up.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:36.040]   And once again, you get that sort of everything just goes zhoot sludge up to show you this
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.680]   little control list and hiding behind it always.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:42.680]   It's not as though you get a customized Pandora playback deck.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:46.840]   It gives you a set of audio controls that is common to all playback, all background
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.960]   playback uses the same APIs.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.520]   So people are going to get a very consistent experience.
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:54.640]   So Pandora has to be rewritten to take advantage of this, it sounds like.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:59.600]   All background apps have to be rewritten to take advantage of these custom APIs because
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.160]   once again, it's not simply that they're managing running of background apps, it's that you
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:07.520]   have to call this API that Apple has specifically written to work in the background without
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.680]   taxing the battery, without taxing the processor.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.240]   Isn't this part of the argument, I mean, goes to the argument of why Apple wants everything
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.240]   written in Xcode.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.640]   You know, where you have, you know, to take advantage of, you know, to fully take advantage
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:22.560]   of what they're providing is that underline infrastructure that allows all these apps to
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.560]   do the same thing together.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.560]   Exactly.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.560]   And that's been their game for a few years now.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:31.160]   They really did a good job of once again, moving the argument that app that Google made when
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:35.760]   they're talking about why they reject certain apps reason that they gave three most common
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.480]   reasons why they reject an app.
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:41.400]   Number three was because it uses an outside API and they didn't simply say, well, because
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:46.000]   we want to control our platform, this because that way when if you have a custom API and
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.320]   we upgrade the OS, it's going to make your app fail and that's not good for you.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.360]   It's not good for the user.
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.680]   So that's why we're not allowing outside APIs against that.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.600]   We're Apple positioning it as a feature for developers and a feature for users, not simply
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:02.000]   that we want to have, we don't want people to put flash on our device if we don't want
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   it to be there.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.040]   It also plays into the fact why there is a delay before the phone comes out because at the
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:10.520]   conference they release the GM master for the, you know, for the, so it's done.
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.520]   It's done.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:15.120]   But it now gives the developers the opportunity to go away, test their applications against
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.440]   it and then get it into the store so that when the phone is released in, you know, three
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:23.360]   weeks or whatever, you know, these, these extra features are available within the applications.
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:26.120]   It'd be terrible if they were to release it today and half the apps weren't ready for
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.120]   it.
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:30.040]   So, you know, because they wouldn't multitask in the current versions.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.760]   Have you been using multitasks a lot with Android?
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:36.040]   Well, it's just, it's what you do with a, with a, you know, you're using it.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.400]   What you do with a phone, you just, you run something, it's running and when you leave
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:43.040]   it, it's still running and Pandora is still running or the music's still running or whatever.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:47.680]   And it actually can produce some odd effects because you can run the music player and
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:52.360]   run audible.com and run another music player and all playing it once.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:55.000]   Which tab is making that noise?
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.920]   I guess the issues of multitasking are the very limited resources on a device like this,
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.920]   battery life and reliability.
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:09.320]   And so the real question, you know, I have to say that they, it works pretty well in
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.640]   Android, but not perfectly.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:11.960]   It really depends on the device.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.720]   My Nexus One works really, really great.
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:17.560]   I hardly noticed any battery drain, even when I was trying to test out flash and making
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.560]   it break.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:21.480]   I had that actually during a taping of Mac break a couple of weeks ago, I was having
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.600]   a flash benchmark running for two hours.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.240]   It really didn't drain down the battery all that much.
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.240]   But none of us.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:32.160]   And by the way, I tested with and without third party task killers and I decided not
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.160]   to use one.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:36.480]   It does the Android Google voice, oh, you don't need one.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.000]   It's kind of a voodoo thing and it's true.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.200]   And I was looking at the API, it's built into the API.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.200]   There's garbage collection.
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:46.080]   Well, I'll say I have to realize that no mobile OS does multitasking the way that most people
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.960]   think define multitasking.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:51.280]   It really is a chance of suspending an application preventing it from doing anything else in
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:55.520]   the background, but allowing it to do things that it thinks it needs to do.
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.680]   And this is almost the exact same thing that Apple's doing right now.
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:00.720]   A lot more control because you can't write your own background APIs.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.280]   You still have to go through Apple systems.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:08.480]   But if the same result is available to the user, the things that I was missing when I
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:12.080]   switched back to my iPhone a couple of days ago, if you're in a navigation app, the ability
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:15.460]   to be listening to something but also have the navigation app in the background say, oh,
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:20.320]   by the way, you've got a turn coming up in the next 30 minutes, as opposed to somebody
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.920]   have to switch between them to figure it out.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:23.680]   Was that exit 12 or exit 21?
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.840]   That's another good use GPS.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:31.360]   And that is another specific API providing a background nav app can simply be alert and
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.320]   aware and updating its position and still communicate to the user.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.000]   You know, they still lag way behind Android is a notification.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.560]   And they've got to solve this problem.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.360]   Well, see, you're going to have multitasking.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:44.000]   You've got to have the ability for multiple tasks to notify you there's something going
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   on.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.520]   I have enough confidence that this is another thing like cut and paste where they're waiting
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.640]   to figure out how to do it really emphatically.
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:55.160]   I love the way that I like the way that Android does notifications where it's just all there.
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:59.000]   Even if you just want to see what track is playing right now, flick from the top of any
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.960]   application, you see the notification right there.
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.680]   And it stacks them up so you have multiple app.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.040]   And that's actually the plus and the minus.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:08.440]   What I don't like about the fact is that if I don't use my phone for about 42 minutes
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:13.280]   to look at it, I just see this big line of icons and usually it stacks the least important
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:16.080]   thing up at the top and I have to really scroll through to find the thing that's actually
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.080]   important.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.840]   So, however, at least you know on the iPhone, we need to get one of the better than just
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:23.480]   a little dialogue box that simply stacks up.
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:24.480]   Yeah, excuse me.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.600]   We're having a page through notification after notification.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:34.000]   I'm very pleased that BOS beat BLT and baseball, but I don't want to have to like page the
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.640]   first time that I react to my phone was just like stack and stack and stack with the MLB
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:38.640]   app.
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.440]   Tell you about all the games that that's oh, they want.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.440]   Oh, they lost.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:42.440]   Oh, they lost.
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.440]   Oh, they really lost.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.440]   Oh, thank you.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.440]   And I presume you can control that too.
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:49.040]   You can say I don't want notifications and all that stuff.
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:50.040]   That's a special case.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.440]   I really didn't set it up correctly.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:54.200]   So, MLB is still one of my favorite heaps for the day.
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.600]   801 contrast ratio on that display.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.600]   Is that high?
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.600]   Is that seems high?
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.600]   I don't know.
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.600]   Do you know it?
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.600]   It's pretty high.
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.600]   It's pretty high.
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:09.640]   You know, there's you have, you know, I think your current LCD TVs, I think are at
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:11.680]   2000 to one or some of them are 10,000.
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.360]   So, but it's still it's still very high.
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:19.120]   What I'm really interested in when we talk about the resolution is so, you know, the
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:23.120]   iPad when when is the if the iPad starts starting to look that's so good.
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:24.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.960]   Well, if it starts approaching, it can't even get to that density and it's already in 1920
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:30.800]   by 1080, you know, if if they actually decided to make the iPad eventually run.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.880]   Where are they getting these IPS screens?
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.440]   I mean, we at this is an interesting custom screen.
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.680]   You know, maybe they're building bigger ones.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.040]   I wonder if they can and why not.
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.040]   Sure, they can.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.040]   I think it's a price.
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:46.560]   Another little feature they have like the Android phone now, a second microphone for noise cancellation.
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.800]   That's a feature a lot of Android users like a lot.
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:49.800]   The Nexus one.
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.280]   That was another applause moment when they have a second microphone.
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:54.720]   After it meant someone was showing me very proudly at Cine Gear.
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:07:01.000]   Cine Gear is this huge, you know, camera and equipment convention down in LA.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.400]   And this guy was showing me this huge box that that's what it does.
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.920]   It takes a sample of the background and then it removes it.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.040]   Now it does it incredibly well.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.200]   But he was he would say, how much does that box cost?
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.880]   And he's like, oh, it's five thousand, you know, five thousand dollars.
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:19.920]   And I was watching the iPhone big demo and I was like, yeah, I think I'm just going to
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:20.920]   use my iPhone.
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:21.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.360]   So how much disappointment did you sense in the hall?
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:27.520]   Was there any palpable disappointment that it was still just AT&T?
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.920]   I was really hoping this would be the day that they would say Verizon.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:32.920]   I know Lisa, this doesn't affect you, but.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:36.560]   No, it was so sad because when I come here, it's it's just the drop calls.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:40.240]   Now maybe that, you know, and by the way, this is what Joshua Topolsky thought is that
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:44.440]   maybe it's the phone that's causing the drop calls and not the network.
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.360]   Maybe this new antenna in the outside.
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.360]   Maybe that'll make a difference.
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:54.400]   Yeah, there's, I have access to information I really can't share, but I now am convinced
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.120]   that there's something the iPhone is doing specifically that is unique to that handset
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:01.160]   that it does a very it keeps.
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.920]   I have to go back to my notes from a conversation.
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:06.400]   I had a couple of weeks ago to explain it, but I guess the upshot is just that now I'm
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.800]   going to convince this less a problem with AT&T than the way that the iPhone communicates
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:11.800]   with this carrier.
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.760]   You're not the only person who said that now and I'm starting to I'm starting to believe
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:16.920]   that this would be the test.
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:20.280]   If they can fix it in this phone, they're going to have a lot more happier people.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:24.440]   I still very it was very disappointed that we're still we're still on.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.720]   And we got a micro cell at the office.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.680]   You know that you had to you had no coverage in there.
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:29.680]   We had no coverage.
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:32.600]   We got a micro cell, but the thing is is now it's not even on the AT&T network.
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.240]   I mean, it's not ethernet, whatever.
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.480]   And you'll see five bars, but it's still dropping.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.480]   Oh, interesting.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.040]   Well, that's an indicator.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.120]   How is it a no to or using a to?
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:44.800]   Yeah, I mean, to be honest, I don't really use it as a phone that often I mean, I still
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:49.920]   use my iPhone as a portable device, you know, and I have very poor reception where I live
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:50.920]   anyway.
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.320]   So I don't use it in the house for calls.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:56.480]   In fact, I have to go into the back garden to actually use it to send an SMS message.
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.480]   It's ridiculous.
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:01.600]   So I don't see that many complaints from people.
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.600]   I don't either actually.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:06.720]   The big problem was I thought that Netflix must have been a lot more excited about the
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:11.680]   iPhone app release when iPhone users still got unlimited data.
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.960]   Yeah, I thought that that's going to be that's fun.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:18.760]   That means I can watch what one one movie is usually about 300 to 400 megabytes streaming
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.120]   or might be a little bit less.
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:21.680]   Well, at least that's not usually used.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.760]   You had to have seen AT&T look at that and just go, I don't even know that.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:26.760]   This is slobbers, Mike.
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:30.100]   You know, I said, Oh, AT&T is making this change on June 7th because they're going to
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:31.100]   announce Verizon.
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:34.760]   That's obvious what they did because they were terrified about streaming Netflix and all
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.520]   of high resolution video.
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.520]   Imagine your antennas just like is melting.
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:42.160]   You know, it's I mean, that would be just insane.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.960]   I just want to start using it the way it's supposed to be used.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:45.960]   Yeah.
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:46.960]   I was lucky.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:50.720]   Initially, when they launched in Canada, they had a six gigabyte sort of cap.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:51.720]   Yeah.
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.320]   And that's totally fine for me.
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:56.200]   But the price point is just insane.
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:00.080]   And then by your by my megabyte, it's very expensive in Canada.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.080]   Yes.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:07.220]   And so consequently, if I switch to a different carrier, I lose the six because it's not available
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:08.220]   anymore.
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:11.900]   So yeah, it's it's it's it's a yeah.
[01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:13.340]   I'm a little bothered.
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:17.540]   I bought the data plan for the iPad just because I'm writing the book and I have to make sure
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:19.900]   I use it for a couple of months, even though I have the MyFi.
[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:24.900]   And now I'm like, how much am I going to miss the ability to stream Netflix all you can
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.940]   eat without having an extra dongle?
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:30.860]   And it's like, well, the MyFi the MyFi is limited to five gigs, isn't it?
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:32.140]   My my five is limited to five.
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:36.700]   But in my personal use, and I'm a pretty heavy mobile user, that's about perfect.
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:40.100]   Cause usually on a heavy month, I'll do four and a half.
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:41.660]   I have rarely exceeded five.
[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:43.700]   And when I did it was by not very much.
[01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:46.940]   And then I looked at my use past usage for the past year, year and a half.
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:50.500]   And I rarely had a month that was below two.
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:55.180]   So on this new plan, I would automatically being being charged for overages, even on
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:56.580]   my iPhone, even on my iPhone.
[01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:59.260]   There'd be many months in which I'd be hit with like a $40 bill.
[01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:01.300]   Now, but here's the thing though, is you're paying $25.
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:03.140]   Is it $25 for two gig?
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.140]   Right.
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:09.780]   So now if you think about it as you're paying $60 for your MyFi and you're paying $10 a
[01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:18.220]   month more for every gigabyte, you're really if you wanted five, if you wanted five gigs,
[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:19.660]   you could pay $55 a month.
[01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:23.860]   It would be the same as the MyFi roughly, because you're paying, you get in the five
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:28.500]   gigabytes of transfer that you would get with the MyFi for $55 instead of $60.
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.500]   Right.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:33.100]   Plus, but plus I have to pay the extra money to do tethering to get the functions of my
[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:34.100]   MyFi.
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:36.340]   Plus I'd be limited to only one connection instead of up to five.
[01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:37.340]   That's another question.
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:38.340]   No tethering.
[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:39.340]   I thought maybe we'd see tethering.
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:40.340]   Didn't we still need an AT&T?
[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:41.340]   Yeah.
[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:42.340]   I think I'm an out-tethering.
[01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:48.340]   I think I think Apple is tired of AT&T and they're not going to get any press from Steve.
[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:49.340]   I think that was it.
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:50.340]   Where was it?
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:51.340]   Where did they say tethering?
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:52.340]   Was it in the...
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:56.980]   It was buried in the announcement that AT&T made about their price in pan, which they
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:58.700]   said, "Isn't it wonderful?
[01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:01.780]   We're knocking five dollars off the price of the data plan."
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:05.340]   "No, no, oh thank you, but no, no, please retain your seats.
[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:06.340]   We just love our users."
[01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:09.060]   So is there going to be a setting in the iPhone that says turn on tethering like there
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:11.060]   is in Froyo or what does it be?
[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:14.660]   Well, it uses the same system that uses on every international carrier where if you
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.900]   want to turn on tethering, I believe it's in the settings panel and it's just a switch
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.260]   you turn on.
[01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:20.260]   It should simply work.
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:22.500]   But it is something you have to purchase through AT&T.
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:23.500]   20 bucks a month.
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:24.500]   It is an extra 20 bucks a month.
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:25.500]   It is via USB tethering.
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:28.260]   It's cheaper than Verizon or Sprint.
[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:29.260]   Yeah, but that's just 30.
[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:30.260]   Yeah, but that's just in the internet.
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:31.260]   You don't get any extra data.
[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:32.260]   Right.
[01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:33.260]   Well, there's just the privilege of tethering.
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:35.260]   Wait a minute, you get no data?
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:36.740]   You don't get any extra data.
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:37.740]   There's a double gotcha.
[01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:38.740]   Right.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:42.180]   Most of the time when you get tethering, they bill you separately for the...
[01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:46.340]   You have essentially one cap for what you use by tethering a one cap you use via the
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:47.340]   phone.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:49.140]   But they're saying, "No, you got a two gigabyte pool.
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:52.020]   No matter how you go over it, you're over and you get charged for it."
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:55.940]   It's something like $10 for every gigabyte you go over, I believe.
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:13:00.940]   It was enough that it made me wonder if the point was not to turn this into revenue but
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:06.060]   to sort of keep people from using 3G when for things that they think you should probably
[01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:07.060]   find a Wi-Fi hotspot.
[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:08.060]   They're very careful to...
[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:13.700]   They're very proud to mention that, by the way, we also include access to 20,000 AT&T
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:16.420]   Wi-Fi hots for free in this data plan.
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:20.660]   We would love for you to, instead of standing in the sidewalk outside the bookstore.
[01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:23.300]   But maybe that's where I want to stand.
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:24.300]   Yeah.
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:25.820]   I like it there.
[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:31.980]   Well, of course, Johnny Ive and everybody got most excited about FaceTime.
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:39.380]   Oh, when you smile in...
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:42.140]   I wonder if this was the Louis Armstrong really, yeah.
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:48.380]   No, this was coming.
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:53.220]   I think this is...
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.220]   I think this is...
[01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:58.780]   If there's an Apple versus Google thing, this is their response to Google's Paris search
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:04.620]   ad because by the end, a room full of heart and beat developers are going, "Oh, we're
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:05.620]   Apple's dad."
[01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:06.620]   So first they show up for Apple.
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:09.780]   A plotting the Apollo because, "Oh, and they're in one of them is deaf and they're using
[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:10.780]   me as so...
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:14.420]   I think they're going to be the graduate talking to grandma and grandpa."
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:19.260]   I did notice that they didn't show any clips of people sexting each other.
[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:22.020]   What is it going to be like?
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:23.820]   Do you think you could use it that way?
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:25.820]   I think we'll use that way.
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:26.820]   It's just like...
[01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:31.140]   Oh, you know, I was on an online form and it's not FaceTime.
[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:37.260]   So, Don, that's going to be your first iPhone 4 application, like video capture from FaceTime.
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:40.100]   Oh, did you show hot?
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:43.740]   They show that the baby, the sonogram.
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:47.180]   You know, look, they acted as if Skype never happened.
[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:49.500]   It's like, "Oh, we've invented it.
[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:50.500]   Wait a minute.
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:51.500]   Hold on.
[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:52.500]   Haven't we been doing this all along?"
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:53.500]   I guess.
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.940]   Even Nokia has phones that do this.
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:55.940]   Fring does this.
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:57.780]   Yeah, well, there's good news and bad news.
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:01.300]   Having just tried the Evo with the front-facing camera, it's like, "Wow, it's got a front-facing
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:03.100]   camera so I can do live chat."
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:04.100]   Well, no, it's a nobody.
[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.100]   That application's not working.
[01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.460]   Well, if I can do this, no, that's not working either.
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:10.620]   You can use it as a front-facing camera for a quick, but that's about it.
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:11.620]   This is supposed to be...
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:12.620]   You can just ring.
[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:15.420]   I've fringed people with it and you do get to have a video at that, but not on the box.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:16.620]   But these pictures are a little.
[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:18.180]   They're shaky.
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.100]   It's not like Skype for one thing.
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:24.000]   Well, the win is that if you make a phone call, it just simply gives you the option of
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.620]   making a video call without any setup or any service.
[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:30.700]   But you could really see sort of like the excitement curves start to go down with all
[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:33.300]   these little throwaway lines that went into the next two sentences.
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:34.900]   Well, it's only Wi-Fi.
[01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:36.900]   When you call any iPhone 4...
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:39.020]   Oh, so it doesn't work that thing else.
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:41.460]   Over your Wi-Fi network, oh, so it doesn't work by 3G.
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:44.940]   I thought this was going to be unlimited video conferencing to any content.
[01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:48.900]   And then of course, we're making this an open technology.
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:50.380]   What does that mean?
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:51.380]   Do we know?
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.380]   Which is my follow-up questions.
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:57.780]   Like, do you mean that, "Great, so developers can write any iPhone 4 app that uses FaceTime
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:01.380]   or is it going to be if I want to put this on my Google Evo phone?"
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:03.380]   You see, using H.323.
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:04.380]   Do we know?
[01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:06.820]   Is it standard or is it new standard?
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:12.260]   All I know for sure right now is that it bundles a whole bunch of open standards to get
[01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:13.260]   this working.
[01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:14.260]   They actually put it on screen.
[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:15.260]   They put it on the list, didn't they?
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:21.420]   Did they say H.
[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:23.580]   And basically saying that they're saying that this bundle of technology is going to
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:27.140]   be open, but they don't know exactly what they mean by that.
[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:31.500]   Even Skype is saying, "Well, we'd like to partner, but how?"
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:32.500]   What?
[01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:37.140]   If it's a standard like H.323, then anybody could write a SIP client or whatever.
[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:40.580]   I was pretty significant though that when there, when he was almost the first paragraph
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:44.740]   when he was introducing this, talk about we expect there to be 10 million FaceTime devices
[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:46.340]   out by the end of the year.
[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:50.260]   And that made me think, "Oh, so is there going to be like a new iPad that has a front-facing
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:52.820]   cameras or going to be another Apple device that uses this?"
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:55.500]   And I think that that's what he meant by saying they're going to be 10 million devices
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:56.500]   that use FaceTime.
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:58.900]   Or maybe they're just thinking they're going to say, "I don't know if you met these going
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:00.660]   to sell 10 million iPhone 4s.
[01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:01.660]   It's a curious--
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:04.740]   I'm surprised it doesn't immediately interact with iChat."
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:05.740]   Yeah.
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:06.740]   I mean, I was just kind of like a--
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:07.740]   Yeah.
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:08.740]   To me, I know brain.
[01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:10.740]   I hear that practically no one's working on the iChat at Apple.
[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:11.740]   Right.
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:13.820]   That's nothing on the OS 10 on Apple.
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:14.820]   Ooh.
[01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:17.220]   Not that I'm bitter or scared.
[01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:18.220]   Said Alex Lindsay.
[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:19.220]   Yeah.
[01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:20.220]   Well, there are.
[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:24.100]   To those of you who are not listening watching the feed and not know who said that.
[01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:28.940]   Well, I mean, I would say we didn't-- one thing, I mean, with WWDC, I mean, there's almost
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:34.220]   no-- I mean, they've just-- if there's any focus that you look at when Apple's looking
[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:37.620]   at the future, I mean, there's no awards for OS 10.
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:38.620]   OS 10.
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:43.420]   There's very few-- I mean, everything is focused on developing for the iPad and the iPhone.
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:47.780]   There's not-- and I've heard from people who are both developing inside and outside of
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:50.220]   companies that there's a lot of concern.
[01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:51.220]   Like, we're not spending a lot--
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:54.500]   Is that your biggest disappointment?
[01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:55.500]   About Apple?
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:57.020]   No, just about WWDC.
[01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:58.260]   Life, about life in general.
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:17:59.260]   Not that way.
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:00.260]   I think about it.
[01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:02.500]   I'm like, it was no award.
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:08.340]   No, no, I think that for WWDC, the thing that concerned me was just that there was no
[01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:09.500]   focus on that.
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:10.500]   Yeah.
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:11.500]   There's no--
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:12.500]   No mention.
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:13.740]   I mean, it's still a big part of their business.
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:16.220]   It's still a huge part of the consumer business.
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:19.540]   Now, maybe Apple doesn't think that that's going to happen for the long term, but I think
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:23.380]   that it's for someone who uses pro apps and a lot of big machines.
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:24.380]   Yeah.
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:27.260]   Do you think iOS will become OS 10?
[01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:28.220]   No.
[01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:30.100]   No, no, stupid, bad idea.
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:33.660]   No, no, I just think that it's going to become-- but I think it is going to become the largest
[01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:35.580]   platform that Apple's focused on.
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:38.460]   I think just Apple just have this laser focus at any one particular time.
[01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:39.460]   Yeah, right now.
[01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:40.900]   You know, now it's-- and I was surprised that the keynote--
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:41.900]   It's a type of transport.
[01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:43.860]   Yeah, at the keynote, it was just the iPhone.
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:46.620]   There was nothing else mentioned, so it was purely one topic.
[01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:49.540]   I mean, Safari didn't get mentioned, although it came out in the same day, and that was
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:51.940]   mentioned later on in the afternoon in some of the keynotes.
[01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:55.820]   But that whole focus was just on the iPhone just to get that.
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:19:00.180]   And I was quite surprised how just a bunch of a backseat the iPad took, because they didn't
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:01.180]   really mention the iPad.
[01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:02.180]   It's really, really special.
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:06.060]   Even with the announcement of OS 4, they didn't say-- and it's going to be available on the
[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:07.060]   iPad later this year.
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:08.060]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:09.060]   What is the availability?
[01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:13.980]   So it's going to be out on all iPhones June 21st, but not all features will be available.
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:15.460]   Not all features for all phones.
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:18.300]   If you have an iPod touch, not all features will be available.
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:21.580]   And iPhone 3GS, not all features are going to be available.
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:22.580]   Not even on 3GS?
[01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:23.580]   Well, the front-day 3MS will--
[01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:24.580]   Oh, the 3GS will.
[01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:27.500]   No, the features of the OS will be.
[01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:30.900]   Folders, multitasking, everything but FaceTime.
[01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:31.900]   Sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:32.900]   I'm quick, I'm sorry.
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:36.340]   And the iPad, they say, I know they said before fall.
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:37.340]   They said fall.
[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:39.700]   They haven't added any details of that at all.
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:44.460]   Actually, the only iPad-related announcements that I can even remember are upgrades to the
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:46.460]   iBooks app that--
[01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:48.140]   Wireless syncing and--
[01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:49.860]   Wireless syncing to all devices.
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:54.540]   Note taking, bookmarking, and all your bookmarks and notes and the highlights.
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:58.220]   We'll now sync across all copies of that book, across all versions that you have.
[01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:00.220]   So if you buy it once, it'll automatically go first.
[01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:02.940]   Is that different from Kindle?
[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:05.180]   Kindle does all that sort of stuff.
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:07.380]   It's basically giving it feature parity with the Kindle.
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:08.860]   Yeah, it's the whisper-net, isn't it?
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:09.860]   Yeah, the whisper-net.
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:10.860]   Yeah, the whisper-net.
[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:13.540]   But I think your Kindle, you're limited to five devices.
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:15.980]   Steve implied that it was kind of every device.
[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:17.620]   It depends on book to book.
[01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:20.620]   On the Kindle, the publisher can determine how many copies of the book you can have on
[01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:21.620]   different devices.
[01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:24.500]   My favorite Michael Palin book, the first thing I do whenever I get a Kindle app,
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:28.780]   working on any device is to re-download my Kindle Palin biography.
[01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:31.940]   And I just realize that I've just hit my limit of five or whatever my name is.
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:35.660]   But it does vary from seller to seller.
[01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:40.140]   Other features, there are some other small fiddly bits.
[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:41.140]   No, no.
[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:42.700]   There was the wireless syncing.
[01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:43.860]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:50.100]   I've been looking for the slide from Steve of what it supports for FaceTime.
[01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:55.300]   It's H.264, AAC SIP.
[01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:58.940]   That's the signaling protocol that's used by a lot of these phones.
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:00.940]   So that's good news.
[01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:03.980]   H.264 for the video is kind of interesting.
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:06.380]   Turn, ICE, RTP, and SRTB.
[01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:09.140]   It is an interesting mishmosh of standards that they've put into this.
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:12.820]   Yeah, and it also underscores the idea that no, if anyone's saying we're not an open standards
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:15.500]   company, well, look, we're using open standards to build this.
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:17.780]   We're also publishing this as an open standard.
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:18.780]   Right.
[01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:22.180]   Actually, the bigger thing I just reminded myself of that I thought I was kind of curious.
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:26.340]   When they were talking about HTML5, they did not simply talk about how it's wonderful
[01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:31.700]   to use HTML5 to build dynamic websites.
[01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:34.540]   They're actually giving it parity with apps in the App Store.
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:38.420]   They actually said that we have two different application development environments.
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:40.180]   One is a curated environment called the App Store.
[01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:42.820]   The other is a web-based system called HTML5.
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:45.460]   They describe both of them as application development systems.
[01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:50.620]   So Ston, in turn, Sparky is saying in our chatroom, our ways to get through NAT routers.
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:56.260]   Bear, our sysadmin says that if it's given the standards they talked about, it's jingle
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:59.500]   functional, so it should talk to Google talk video.
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:05.100]   So maybe it is a little bit more compliant than is obvious from just words.
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:07.740]   Quite surprised that they didn't actually include a Mac client.
[01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:11.580]   You would have thought, you know, rather than restricting it just from iPhone to iPhone.
[01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:13.300]   To include a Mac client that would have been-
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:14.660]   Especially considering it's Wi-Fi.
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:16.300]   And does it require a carrier?
[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:21.100]   And the only reason I could think of that might do that is because it would actually
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:24.900]   encourage more people like Skype and everything else to say, "Oh, we can build something that
[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:26.260]   will tie that in."
[01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:29.420]   If it immediately opened up to iChat, you'd know that everybody would be just getting
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:34.740]   kind of wired into that iChat environment and then not necessarily go out into the
[01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:35.900]   wild blue under as much.
[01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:40.540]   But leaving it open and saying it's open standards possibly would actually maybe encourage
[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:42.620]   more people to do that as well.
[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:45.500]   So RTP is the transfer protocol for VoIP.
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:47.900]   SIP is the signaling handshake protocol.
[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:49.780]   Stun is the NAT traversal protocol.
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:50.780]   So it sounds like it does.
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:52.540]   I'm sorry, I'm still working on this.
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:53.540]   Apologies.
[01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:54.540]   But I'm watching the chatroom.
[01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:56.540]   We have some very smart telco people in there.
[01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:58.780]   I mean, there's a lot of this keynote for a lot of different people.
[01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:02.100]   Sometimes I was really, really surprised by the things that got cheers, including the
[01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:04.420]   Farmville being able to have the tractor.
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:05.980]   But also the simple fact that this-
[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.980]   It took me like 10 seconds for it to really sink in.
[01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:12.860]   The coolness of the fact that iBooks now supports PDF directly.
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:13.860]   That's good news.
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:17.140]   Because everyone is clamoring for it because it's using academics, use in research.
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:19.380]   There's so many people who use PDF as the lingua frankwa-
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:20.940]   Frankwa for all their breeding.
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:21.940]   But also the cool-
[01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:24.220]   That almost in passing said that if you have-
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:26.620]   If you are email the PDF, tap it.
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:28.140]   It won't simply open in iBooks.
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:30.460]   It will be added to your iBook library.
[01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:35.340]   So that just made a lot of third party document viewer apps not irrelevant, but now they
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:41.300]   have to do more than simply open and display permanently house a document like that.
[01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:45.260]   And the fact that it works on the iPhone 2, that also now opens up that field a little
[01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:46.260]   bit.
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:48.540]   Now you're going to see the printing features of these third party apps expand.
[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:53.340]   You're going to have to see the Dropbox and box.net and iDusk features expand because
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:57.620]   that's a picture percent of what people want that application for.
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:58.940]   What was the one more thing?
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:00.780]   There was a one more thing I forgot.
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:02.580]   The one more thing I think was FaceTime.
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:05.580]   That was FaceTime.
[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:10.540]   He said there were eight new things that I'm going to show you and then after the FaceTime
[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:12.500]   demo and here's the ninth thing.
[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:13.900]   It wasn't John Mayer.
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:14.900]   Thank God.
[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:15.900]   No John Mayer at all.
[01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:20.540]   Well with a Wi-Fi thing they figured they had enough disasters in their hands for what
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:22.340]   you know.
[01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:25.700]   I don't want to leave anything out.
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:27.700]   I'm drawing a blank here.
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:31.100]   I'm looking through my notes and I'm not seeing anything.
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.100]   I think we kind of got it.
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.300]   We didn't really talk about Safari 5.
[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:36.300]   We're going to talk about Safari 5.
[01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:37.300]   They didn't talk about Safari 5.
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:38.300]   They didn't talk about the phone.
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:39.300]   They didn't talk about the name.
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:40.300]   They didn't mention the keynote.
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:42.500]   I was like the big idiot when I got like the late in the afternoon people asked by thought
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:43.500]   about Safari 5.
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:44.500]   Oh they released Safari.
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.260]   Oh well I think it's wonderful.
[01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:48.620]   I want to know what you think about it.
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:49.620]   Right right right right.
[01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:52.780]   Well the only thing I noticed immediately is it broke all my extensions although you can't
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:56.220]   turn on the developer menu and turn the extensions back on.
[01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:58.380]   But you know with trepidation.
[01:24:58.380 --> 01:24:59.380]   Have you played with IE5?
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:00.380]   No.
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:01.380]   No.
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:04.380]   I got my compact 386 going.
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:07.380]   Have you played with Safari 5?
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:08.380]   No.
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:12.180]   Don was actually I was one of those people that watched the keynote and didn't know.
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:15.380]   So Don was telling me in the Mustang raid.
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:16.380]   On the way huh?
[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:17.380]   Yeah.
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:19.380]   Lisa and Don came up and Andy came up in the Mustang.
[01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:20.380]   I don't know how you fit.
[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:21.380]   It's very cozy.
[01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:22.380]   Yeah I bet it was.
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:23.380]   Who sat in the back?
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:25.380]   Lisa and Selfie.
[01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:29.380]   Some people have all the luck.
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:32.380]   What do you think of IE5?
[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:33.380]   Oh sorry Safari.
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:35.380]   You should be now.
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:39.300]   Yeah it's I mean I only downloaded it.
[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:43.620]   I had a look at it yesterday at the the keynotes because they had it they had some demos later
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:45.620]   on in the afternoon for the developers.
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:46.860]   But some nice features in there.
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:49.700]   I mean there's a feature in there which is called reader which I think will be impressive
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:50.700]   for most people.
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:51.700]   What a surprise that was.
[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:52.700]   Yeah.
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:53.700]   Yeah I mean.
[01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:54.700]   That's the big new feature.
[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:55.700]   What strips all the ads.
[01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:59.340]   Yeah it's well it's not just the ads but it actually simplifies the layout of the page
[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:03.700]   so if you have a really busy website with lots of adverts or lots of banners and things
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:05.340]   that you just want to focus on the text.
[01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:07.660]   It's very much like the readability plugin that you can get now.
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:09.580]   You know people usually readability.
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:10.740]   It basically mimics that.
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:16.180]   So you in the URL buy you get a little reader button that you click and then you get this
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:20.420]   nice clean representation of the page presented to you which you can then print or email.
[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:22.900]   It also is well what you thought was nice and I haven't tested it.
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:25.740]   You know one of the annoying things if you go to a web page and there's like five pages
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:26.900]   you've got to click through each page.
[01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:28.620]   Apparently it brings all five pages together.
[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:30.180]   So you can read it in long go.
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:33.620]   I'm wondering how happy sites like the Atlantic, the New York Times all these are going to
[01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:37.980]   be where congratulations you've taken away my ads you've also taken a play with the clicks
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:38.980]   of the video.
[01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:42.540]   Oh and you're starting your own ad business at the same time.
[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:43.540]   Odd.
[01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:47.020]   You know though I often will as you say I will go to the print click the print button so
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:48.020]   I get the print version.
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.020]   Yeah.
[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:50.980]   And that's what I want to read because it's all stripped down.
[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:55.060]   Developer of Instapaper has got to be really happy about this because that feature was made
[01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:56.060]   for Instapaper.
[01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:57.060]   Yeah.
[01:26:57.060 --> 01:27:02.820]   And then all the Instapaper part of what it does is to do that feature but not work so
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:05.220]   much better now that they have that built into the browser.
[01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:11.940]   I'm really curious if we could go around and just find which browser you prefer.
[01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:12.940]   Chrome.
[01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:17.420]   I'm a Chrome guy although I have to say I'll try Safari 5 to see because it looks like
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:21.180]   it's faster but I just I'm a big Chrome fan on all my platforms and I think about Chrome
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:27.020]   as it sinks my bookmarks across all Linux Windows and Mac and Tush and since I do use
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:29.620]   all three that's nice although I could do that with X marks I guess.
[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:34.300]   What do you what do you I'm I use both Safari and Firefox and so I it depends on I have
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:37.260]   to admit it depends on which sites I'm going to and what I'm doing I kind of just know
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:41.380]   that these are the ones that I kind of go back and forth I use Safari a lot because of
[01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:45.980]   the RSS reader the RSS stacking so what I have is I've got you know and I know that
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:50.740]   there's tons of readers that do it but it's just a simple list that I can that I can sort
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:55.260]   by date and have you know 60 different websites that I'm just kind of going through all the
[01:27:55.260 --> 01:27:59.540]   headlines as I get that's how I do all my studying and I know that there's better ways
[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:02.620]   to do it but it's just simple it's in my thing and when I click on it it just opens
[01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:06.940]   you know it just keeps on you know and I'm used to it and so so but Safari and Firefox
[01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:10.140]   and I need to try Chrome I just have to admit that's one of the things I'm in my little
[01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:16.380]   world and I haven't it's just fast it's huge you move to Firefox because of plugins or
[01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:19.740]   I moved to Firefox mostly because there's certain plugins I have to admit the way I manage it
[01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:25.940]   is a lot of times so my Safari has kind of kept pretty clean and Firefox I let it build
[01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:31.140]   up all my my my passwords and my you know I'm going to sell because they're now they
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:35.940]   have a very rich set of extensions and doesn't bog it down like it does Firefox right so
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:40.660]   I wasn't using Chrome until those extensions those key ones that I needed like last pass
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:44.620]   were there now that they're there I'm very happy I don't use Firefox ever now it's just
[01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:49.700]   a dog a tad poor I use a lot of tabs I like that well and I and I'm not sure I'm not
[01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:53.500]   and the first thing I do when I put any of these on is I put on and that's why I'm interested
[01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:56.180]   in this you know the readability stuff is that the first thing I put on is that click
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:29:00.140]   to flash you know like you know all those things like okay I'm gonna turn it all it
[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:04.580]   off and I'll turn it on when I want it but I'm sorry has a very nice flash turn off now
[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:09.500]   there the news for five has a new extension yes that's a big feature of it some new new
[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:14.420]   extension or the new extension architecture yeah yeah so they're not basically they've
[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:17.940]   invited now developers to start developing you know extensions for and that's going to
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:21.700]   take a lot to come out but yeah it's more like the developer program where you have to
[01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:26.500]   get a certificate in order great signed plugins plus has to be as it has to be vetted or is
[01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:31.980]   it just simply to find no thanks you're signed yeah so Lisa are you what do you use Safari
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:38.060]   Chrome I love Safari yeah but I have to say that I've definitely been swayed by Chrome
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:44.980]   and I am a bit of a tab or what does that mean you have lots of tabs up saccharin sweet
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:52.420]   and soft drinks she'll do I'm a fresca guy myself I'm a fresca slut what does that mean
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:58.260]   you have a lot of tabs I open a lot of tabs and I'm just devastated when it crashes because
[01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:04.420]   in Firefox perfects all yeah but I mean it's just like it's just devastating because I do
[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:10.100]   a lot of you know I look at a lot of photographers and I always kind of have them open and I'm
[01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:15.820]   a bit messy about it and I want to see your desktop is doing it now are you doing it now
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:19.980]   you're out of the air are you in an air how do you have how could you even be a tab or
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:24.740]   on a MacBook Air no you can't you can't but I have an iMac at home and I've got I've
[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:31.620]   watched I always have two screens and I've got it going on do you do dot what are you what
[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:35.700]   are you what are you going to do occasionally I'll use Firefox if there are certain signs
[01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:39.900]   I have to use Firefox on but I don't like five I don't I'm not at the moment I'm not a big
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:43.620]   extension user although now that Safari has got that I might take a start like taking
[01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:48.820]   a look at that Andy what is your choice I'm sorry Sam kind of a triple threat I mean
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:53.420]   I heard that about you so there you go song dance and acting I'm sorry my head child is
[01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:58.820]   available on our request the Red Opera George Hamilton of Mac Breakthrough Safari is my
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:02.500]   main browser because it's the cleanest it's the simplest also because of the click to
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:08.140]   flash plug-in I like I've loved Chrome ever since the stable build was released I like
[01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:14.220]   the speed I like the history bars I love the way it handles multiple tabs I can't I cannot
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:17.660]   get my head around the fact that when I want to move a window I have to aim the point to
[01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:22.380]   really care for me because there's no title bar but there's like six pixels between the
[01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:27.060]   top of the tab of the edge if you came it really well you could sort of move the window
[01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:30.260]   and I think that's sort of an obvious thing that a fee that it should feature should have
[01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:34.820]   Firefox I've almost completely stopped using it the only time that I actually launched
[01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:41.820]   it is when I wanted to do some web development because my CSS HTML plugins work I'm used I'm
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:45.700]   more more it's more than I'm used to the way that they work in Firefox than any other
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:52.860]   tool uses it but I Firefox is dead to me right now it's it's dead to me I left out one big
[01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:58.100]   thing which is a the new bigger battery should give us a little more juice which we don't
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:02.340]   know they just said call time but then I looked at the stats on the page and it looks like
[01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:08.980]   an hour more we're all sick of around big bulky I would be very glad if I can get a day
[01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:15.580]   out of that thing etc and it would be certain I don't know what you're talking about oh
[01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:21.420]   and he's got his dick took his mophia threw it out the window I can't fit my mophia in
[01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:26.860]   my pocket we'll see it's bulky to bulk it but it's okay mofa but there's like there's
[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:30.540]   like longer what I want to know is it longer battery life or is it truly useful battery
[01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:36.100]   life the only time I have this in a mophia is a day like today where I'm up at 730 having
[01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:39.940]   breakfast with somebody I'm going to be going then to an airport I'll be going until about
[01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:43.460]   nine or ten at night because for that kind of thing where I want to make sure I can still
[01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:47.780]   get access to email wherever I go that I need a all day battery for a Barry will give
[01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:52.140]   me an extra 45 minutes that's nice I'm glad I have it but it won't let me use the phone
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:57.380]   all day it's a mophie day you get up and you say ah it's gonna be a mophie day so a chum
[01:32:57.380 --> 01:33:01.140]   mophie day I'm traveling I have two mophies you made before you know in a lot of a double
[01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:05.140]   mophie well the other thing is I'm always I always want to charge have one on the charger
[01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:08.940]   so I'm always charging one what I like about is having external charge for a battery that
[01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:12.460]   then I can pop my computer my camera so I don't I mean I'm or my yeah exactly this
[01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:16.380]   is like the external shuttle tank where you know yeah gets into orbit then when but then
[01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:20.980]   when it's no longer charging just jettison it is out of fault to the Atlantic it works
[01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:25.780]   but I got into a whole discussion with someone you know you're geeking out when you get into
[01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:34.620]   a whole discussion waiting for a plane talking about mophie strategies like do you stick it
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:38.140]   on and let it and let it run at 100% the whole time and take the mophie out or do you let
[01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:42.300]   or do you try to live on the battery and then only turn the mophie on as a as a parachute
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:46.740]   that's what I get and and and we were talking about the pros and cons but it's a straight
[01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:50.820]   this is like this is this is that like two headed like charger that targets makes I like
[01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:54.220]   so much and when I really need to charge up real quick like and charge up the mophie
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:57.520]   battery and with one of these prongs and charge up this with the iPhone with the other
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:01.500]   problem and basically tops up and like half the time the only thing I'm bitter about the
[01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:06.380]   new mophie is the micro the micro connector to see this is you like this this is my maturity
[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:13.380]   test I had the end of that joke and I did not say it good boy Andy and I'm sure the 8%
[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:17.940]   of everybody listening had it had the how to end that joke and they're saying oh Andy
[01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:22.780]   you have no guts I have no guts no you have guts you have brains to and that's the issue
[01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:29.580]   like close dancing so who's gonna buy I know this is stupid ask you guys who's gonna buy
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:39.320]   an iPhone 4 Alex Lindsay yeah I guess I should say how many of you are gonna buy I'm gonna
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:45.840]   stick with one for now okay one I for for see one one Lisa you can't get it for a while
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:50.040]   but you can buy it here and keep it I might sneak over the border mmm honestly she's gonna
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:57.700]   break the law to get an eye I yeah I felt with the 3GS it was painful the weight and and
[01:34:57.700 --> 01:35:02.440]   now it's I mean it's a month it's slim but it's just it's just that glass on both sides
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:06.200]   when other people have it just makes you do they show the new case there's like a new
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:11.960]   Apple rubber like a bumper grommet case I like I like to go clean I just I like it it's
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:20.720]   like skin on skin oh I just got the chills Donna you're gonna buy it you never get you
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:24.880]   know you never let the kill to get the chills when I talk like that
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:31.400]   you're gonna buy it yeah well the UK is UK the tier one releases so we get it on the same
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:38.280]   dates as the US so yeah I'll definitely have to any did you have an iPhone 4 tell the truth
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:42.960]   I'm in that window in which I my standard responses I cannot confirm who denied that I
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:48.400]   have I guess you couldn't until June 20 I have I have I have to institute a new rule as of
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:52.520]   last year that if I'm in a window in which it is possible that I might have one early
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:57.200]   if I have one I will say I will say I can't confirm it and I because I can't talk about
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:01.520]   if I don't have one I will also say the same thing because that means that that preserves
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:04.640]   the answer for the next time I have something really so I can say I guess you don't have
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:08.120]   one because you didn't have enough to screen time and you could have lied and said oh yeah
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:11.360]   a lot of screen time and I really like that screen and you you'd instead so I did see
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:15.800]   I did talk about my experience like actually at the show it's I can I can tell you that
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:19.720]   I had next to nothing in terms of hands on experience I don't want to mislead people
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:24.480]   and I really know I'm talking about this so I only I found out about the the demo area
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:28.760]   I'm embarrassed to say I was sitting like behind the press area because I wanted an aisle seat
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:32.880]   and I did not get advanced notice of like where the press where the area was and so I
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:37.760]   kind of like left without knowing there was there enough time and so you're using a 3G
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:42.200]   as now I'm using it I can confirm that I'm using 3G as now so you have 17 questions
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:48.480]   like will you upgrade I will definitely upgrade for the camera for the screen it looks like
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:51.720]   a worthwhile upgrade I think the screen alone I think iBooks is going to be one of the
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:57.280]   killer demo apps for the you don't think it'd be too small to read even high res it's not
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:02.480]   it's not so much I quickly got used to even on the 3GS and even on like the earlier even
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:06.440]   on like the the Nexus one reading books on that small screen because so long as this
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:12.280]   detail and because of app because Apple handles fonts so well they really know how to render
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:16.720]   text so that's very very easy to read and now that when you get better than like laser
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:21.960]   writer resolution with enough space that they can actually do anti aliasing it's the same
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:28.040]   size screen as the current iPhone gets a little bit no the same size of physical dimensions
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:35.600]   the same some disappointments Mr. Gray the guy who lost the phone didn't show up I was
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:39.960]   hoping Steve would bring him out would have been great to bring the phone out I think
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:44.760]   I think I think I think it should be he should have come out like with a visible limp and
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:54.840]   like say you may go now I was suspiciously like French or fresh stuff yeah John Hodgman
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:59.840]   did not come on stage to bid farewell but I do have it on good authority that there's
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:06.840]   a new Apple team I was like clustered bombs going off in my pants
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:21.640]   sorry that the ad will have to bear with that here the electric spoof a little

[01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:11.780]   an audible whore I love my audible books today on Maury I'd rather listen to a book that
[01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:20.460]   have sex actually that's sad but true that's my personal problem audible dot com slash
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:25.860]   Mac break a place for you to find great books look at this one this looks interesting soccer
[01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:36.060]   nomics the World Cup starts on Friday England versus USA go USA yeah now you know I'm not
[01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:40.820]   a big soccer guy now so if I someone tweeted me before and said don't forget to mention
[01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:48.300]   the game to Leo or football football that's right Lisa you know better yeah it's football
[01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:55.100]   is there is Canada big football stronghold no no no no we're all about the hockey and
[01:40:55.100 --> 01:41:02.860]   and living through the Olympics I literally live by the rink the hockey rink and it was
[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:06.740]   it was hard because you're you were a skater very serious skater fact Olympic hopeful for
[01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:12.100]   a long time it was been tough um did you feel a little yeah there was a twinge but honestly
[01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:19.780]   watching Olympic figure skating is the most painful thing ever why because it's it's one
[01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:23.380]   shot and you know these people have put so much effort into it you know better than anybody
[01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:28.180]   really yeah that that and it's just like that one second and it's gone it's so easy to make
[01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:33.940]   a mistake that changes everything yeah I mean I I concentrated mainly on what was going around
[01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:38.900]   the city and sort of the free events and the this sort of experience of it all rather than
[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:43.700]   the actual sporting because it was really hard for me as an athlete to just watch I saw the
[01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:51.940]   Bob sled live and I was right by the crash actually the USA and and I put that footage
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:57.780]   up like my 5d mark 2 footage of it and I got so much you're not supposed to do that no
[01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:03.580]   trouble but it the IOC owns everything they were on it like yeah yeah I'm excited I am
[01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:07.900]   not a big soccer fan but for some reason the World Cup just really excites me I just I mean
[01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:11.900]   I am a fan I like watching a lot but I just don't get to mention it I was a little bum
[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:15.420]   that I wasn't going to be in in Africa during the South I didn't I didn't have the last time
[01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:20.700]   I was in Africa and it's so much fun to watch go to a sports bar and Zimbabwe watching football
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:24.940]   so this book doesn't come across the wrong way but it's it's like it's like a child's birthday
[01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:29.740]   party you're excited to see how excited all these other people are like I don't fall the sport
[01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:34.460]   but it's like oh wow there's another like naked fat guy painting his body and like in the same
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:37.980]   colors you still don't understand all sides I've never known exactly what I want now when
[01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:41.500]   my son comes back from university next week so and he's a big football fanatic so I'll be watching
[01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:45.420]   it with him oh I can't wait to watch it I can't wait so this book might be of interest to you soccer
[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:52.700]   nomics why England loses by Germany and Brazil win and why the US Japan Australia Turkey and
[01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:57.260]   even a rocker destined to become the kings of the world's most popular sport why does Scotland suck
[01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:06.860]   why does it you know this is hard to hear 1966 in this century almost wouldn't it be a sick joke
[01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:11.420]   of if if America became the biggest uh soccer you know that would just that wouldn't be and
[01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:14.940]   somebody told me it can't because it's not good for network advertising there's no where to put
[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:20.780]   an ad yeah so it can't yeah it just can't be big here anyway I'm sure they'll talk about this in
[01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:25.260]   soccer nomics but I'm sure Andy has an even better I just noticed this on the front this is the
[01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:28.940]   problem with audible you get there and you go oh I want to read that oh I want to read that I want
[01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:32.220]   to read that if you're one of those people who loves to read but doesn't have time to read audible
[01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:37.260]   makes it possible on the iPhone the iPad hour on Android and boy have you seen the Android app
[01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:41.660]   isn't that slick Andy they did a nice job on the Android app uh that's still in beta but I've
[01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:46.300]   been using the big beta supposed to come out this week yeah bendor doesn't have a real built-in music
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:51.500]   player but other people can pick up that that that drop spear and career yeah I mean that's the
[01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:56.460]   beauty of it right and the audible app is is you know on on iPhone it's just there it's one of
[01:43:56.460 --> 01:44:00.940]   just one of the one of your things in sported format yeah uh on on Android that you can see your

[01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:12.460]   badges for how you've been listening and stuff like that uh I really I quite enjoyed it but anyway
[01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:16.700]   that's that's not here to there the point is whatever you're listening on and there are 500
[01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:21.260]   devices you're gonna love audible books audible.com/macbreak is a place to go you can

[01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:38.540]   that happened Harry Potter they did they do have Harry Potter they sell it only through iTunes though
[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:43.260]   you can't buy it on the audible site for some reason can we make a version we could make our own
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:50.540]   Harry Potter all gonna do I can start an all-American cast cast and boy Harry Jim Cherry
[01:44:51.260 --> 01:44:57.100]   is it really that is that is that that painful though no it's okay it's okay
[01:44:57.100 --> 01:45:00.860]   I'll do I'll do I'll do I'll do it boom Harry Potter
[01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:08.140]   um you know who does the best version they have a Jim Dale on on audible you get it through iTunes
[01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:12.780]   but it is an audible recording and it's just incredible Jim Dale but Steven Fry does it in the
[01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:17.420]   YouTube version and I have to say I'm a little partial he doesn't do as many voices but I love
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:23.660]   Steven Fry so but that you can't get it's the only in the UK because of these this weird
[01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:29.820]   Balkanized world that publishing companies live in you know so I did that with my mind
[01:45:29.820 --> 01:45:34.780]   yeah you do that let that be a lesson what do you do he restarted my computer with my mind
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:41.500]   I forget that part of my mind no we're both putting safari five on yeah
[01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:45.420]   like I will never understand why you have to reboot a computer to install a new browser
[01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:52.700]   browser that makes I know anyway Andy do you have a pick uh I have a provisional conditional pick okay
[01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:57.260]   something I read it I well see I'm reading it right now and I'm halfway through it
[01:45:57.260 --> 01:46:03.660]   and I have this sometimes I recommend an audible books that I'm reading digitally and sometimes
[01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:08.940]   it's actually on the ones that I'm actually I'm actually downloading this is called Little B
[01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:15.100]   a novel by Chris Cleve as a how do you find this stuff well because I was in one of the
[01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:19.740]   probably my favorite bookstore in all of Boston called the Brookline Booksmith and the
[01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:23.100]   and the great thing about independently owned bookstores is that you don't go to the New York
[01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:27.740]   Times bestsellers you go to the books bookshelf that has here's the books bestsellers in this
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:32.220]   bookstore and here's the rack of individual picks from the people who work here and I have
[01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:36.380]   the I have a three flip rule in bookstores where I will read the first two pages and then I will
[01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:41.820]   flip twice and see if it grabs me this grabbed me from the very first page I want to read the
[01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:46.940]   first 12 pages and unfortunately for the booksmith I'm so sorry I will buy other things in your
[01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:53.420]   bookstore I bought it digitally instead of like buying it but see you're missing Ann
[01:46:53.420 --> 01:46:58.300]   Flosniks incredible let's listen to a little of Ann narrating Little B that have this effect
[01:46:58.300 --> 01:47:05.420]   me I could pin a tiara on my short fuzzy hair we should explain that she's a 16 year old Nigerian
[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:10.140]   refugee right it opens up where she gives this wonderful description of being being an immigrant
[01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:14.460]   being a refugee saying I wish I were a British pound because everyone is so happy when you're
[01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:19.420]   there and you sort of disappear at oh it's just this is really compelling story the I'm I'm
[01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:26.540]   recommending it provisionally because it's it goes in really tough directions yeah and I can tell it
[01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:31.580]   I have not finished it I'm about little more than half I've heard and it's like if if the payoff is
[01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:37.980]   not pleasant it could be not pleasant it's it's a whole upper septa in one hand like this and
[01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:44.700]   police officers would still walk up to me and their big shoes and say love the ensemble madam
[01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:48.460]   now let's have a quick look at your ID show this is what you don't get when you read it yeah you
[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:53.580]   don't get the performance and they get such great actors to do these points just just the the
[01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:58.700]   crafting of every sentence of this book even if like I could not I didn't have the ability to process
[01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:03.340]   the English language and I was just listening to the melody of the writing in this book I'm just
[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:07.900]   enjoying it page after page paragraph to paragraph you could do these early so you do such good
[01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:12.300]   accents and voices and you have such a beautiful just reading voice yeah you should do audible
[01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:19.340]   books you'd be great I'd listen to anything you read Harry Potter Harry Potter except yeah you

[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:42.300]   still not on there so uh no um this is totally absurd app that I you know I download it I don't
[01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:45.820]   think we recommended I don't think I recommended it I was I look back I did some surgery because

[01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:59.660]   I hardly what is it uh you have to you have to kind of see it hold on let me see if I can uh
[01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:07.740]   get done hold on so what what you do is you take a photo of someone and then you put a funny
[01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:14.460]   you can put a mouth over top of their mouth and then it just says silly things you know I've
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:19.420]   just like fun it's uh and for some reason I'm having trouble with my audio with it but it's um
[01:50:19.420 --> 01:50:25.420]   uh it but it it's hard to explain wow they do mention that in order to make this work that's
[01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:29.980]   free but then you have to do in-app uh like I bought it I bought it I think I paid for it I
[01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:38.060]   shoppers yeah and and and I'm somehow succeeding in uh uh not having it actually somebody back
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:44.700]   Von Dutch tells me that Merlin's uh buddy of Merlin's made this app did he yeah it is absurdly
[01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:48.140]   funny and it's hard it's hard to tell until you get it but it's worth at least download the free
[01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:52.300]   version and play with it take a photo and you and you over and you can see you can kind of see it's
[01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:57.580]   no cam plus no no it's no cam plus but I figured someone else was gonna talk about that so
[01:50:57.580 --> 01:51:02.380]   so but you can um you can see kind of the what what's gonna happen there for some reason I'm
[01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:07.340]   having trouble getting teeth on malachina yeah but you can have like them have like uh you know
[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:11.980]   missing teeth or big fangs or whatever and then you can either put audio in or they've got some
[01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:17.660]   really funny audio pieces that they've already put in there and I got to say that for a silly
[01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:22.460]   stupid little app it totally shut down our office for about 20 minutes when I got it like everyone
[01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:26.460]   we were taking pictures of everybody and having them just go you know you know just saying stupid
[01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:34.060]   things um and kids go craze I mean yeah this is a good kid it's for a kid app it makes um makes

[01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:58.620]   the new iPhone yeah exactly it by the way I didn't mention that I didn't ask myself yes I'm gonna
[01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:04.620]   buy a freaking iPhone so if you want to entertain kids anyway that's the and we're glad that you're
[01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:09.020]   gonna get an iPhone you're coming back to the fold well I will see well if we let him back oh
[01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:14.300]   exactly oh oh it's that way is it we must assemble the council Alex yes we've been we've been Lisa I've
[01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:18.060]   been have I been thrown off the island well you threw yourself off the island you I've been very
[01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:22.460]   happy with my Nexus one but then I'm lucky because the open ocean that open ocean it's a wonderful
[01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:27.500]   the freedom of bobbing in the Atlantic do whatever you want not being on an island now you just want
[01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:32.140]   to come back you know now the island looks a little bit better from where you are I'm sure if the right
[01:52:32.140 --> 01:52:36.700]   I reserve the right to move around to whatever the current best phone is and it looks like I have
[01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:42.060]   to say the iPhone 4 is gonna be the current for a moment best phone we'll see what happens I think
[01:52:42.060 --> 01:52:46.220]   I think somebody you know if HTC is gonna have to take a look at these screens and see if they
[01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:52.220]   can do it because that's clearly the difference I mean right there is the difference and if I had
[01:52:52.220 --> 01:52:58.540]   cam plus on an an android platform I might stick around people keep saying that but it's just not
[01:52:58.540 --> 01:53:04.220]   the same no it's just not the same is this your pick of course it's my okay just checking
[01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:10.860]   shameless Leo don't worry about it you deserve to have any pick you want this is a c a m

[01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:28.140]   classics which is just incredible yes yes and obviously I'd like you to buy this not because
[01:53:28.140 --> 01:53:36.060]   I developed it but because it's renewed my faith in taking and sharing pictures and I really
[01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:42.860]   believe that it's it's the best way to capture moments when you don't have your 5d mark 2 if
[01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:50.300]   you don't have a 5d mark 2 and please please enter the contest where you can win my dream camera rig
[01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:56.540]   it is incredible and I'd love for someone who's into photography to win this or I will go to
[01:53:56.540 --> 01:54:00.700]   something that would be depressing if somebody who's not in the photography wins 10,000 dollars
[01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:06.140]   with a Canon cameras you get it you just by buying the app you get entered into the no it's it you

[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:35.580]   thank you Lisa this looks really cool and I have to give a shout out to bird brain which is my
[01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:41.900]   favorite new twitter app where you can actually track your followers people who've unfollowed you
[01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:48.300]   oh dear oh you've blocked so you can take revenge and last night I just I felt the power of it
[01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:54.620]   it's like you don't follow me now I know I'm on to you so is it a twitter app or just a stats
[01:54:54.620 --> 01:55:01.820]   it's both it's both yeah yeah bird brain so was it's not like the opposite of stalking
[01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:04.940]   we're tracking people who are no longer interested you at all too depressing
[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:11.100]   than that too depressing would unfollow Lisa that's why I use twitter kind of
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:15.500]   twitter I get an email I get an email every time I post I think it says these five people after
[01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:19.420]   you sent that email I don't want to decide to quit do what I find entertaining is I always
[01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:24.300]   always look at it and I go really you're really yeah yeah really yeah well all the things I said
[01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:27.980]   on twitter you quit because I said that yeah I think I use that for two days and that was it I
[01:55:27.980 --> 01:55:34.700]   couldn't I find it very fast really you know perhaps what if I say this show yeah how many
[01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:42.700]   can people get rid of here mr. Don McAllister rice screencasts online that kind of you're gonna go
[01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:49.180]   with an iPad app I've been looking for a really good twitter client for the iPad yeah needed it
[01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:55.340]   yesterday with sort of live tweeting throughout the the WWDC and someone recommended an application
[01:55:55.340 --> 01:56:01.980]   which I'm going to embarrass myself by trying to pronounce but it's us FuRA HD no OS F double
[01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:08.940]   O RA HD for the iPad I think there's a version for the for the iPhone as well but it is really
[01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:15.340]   a fully featured really beautifully put together application that enables you to use twitter so
[01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:24.540]   there's just that's so it's pretty it's really pretty yeah so spell it again um OS F double O RA HD
[01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:30.220]   for a I wonder what that means I don't know we had three times the devil appears yeah but it's
[01:56:30.220 --> 01:56:33.900]   got everything in everything that I want and it's really easy to read as well because I think
[01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:37.180]   readability is a big thing with Twitter you know if you if you spend a lot of time on Twitter it
[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:41.900]   needs to be nicely presented and I've been very impressed with it up to now I'm installing it
[01:56:41.900 --> 01:56:46.780]   right now i'm 299 to buy I have tried every twitter app under the sun and yet to find the perfect one
[01:56:46.780 --> 01:56:50.300]   so well this one's got nice badges at the bottom as well so you can see how many you know you
[01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:53.420]   mentioned come in and message it direct messages that was one of the problems I was having with
[01:56:53.420 --> 01:56:58.140]   twist riff it which was the one I've been using up to now yeah but um this is really really nice
[01:56:58.140 --> 01:57:05.660]   oos fura from Saeed Marouff it is 299 and it is on the iTunes store for iPad and iPhone and
[01:57:05.660 --> 01:57:10.140]   Ian Nato your pick of the week sir mine is an update to a pick that I probably made about a year
[01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:19.180]   and a half ago it is called a smart hud 3d plus speedcams I know they keep adding things to it but
[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:24.460]   it's it's always been my favorite like a car dashboards pedometer app for oh i'm yeah yeah for
[01:57:24.460 --> 01:57:29.020]   the iPhone and i've got like sort of home every double here and now they're not going very fast
[01:57:29.020 --> 01:57:33.740]   right now exactly we're all you know i'm more sedate paid right now so it used to be just a very
[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:38.860]   very clear and very very precise pedometer but now they've got the speedometer you've got trip
[01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:45.820]   trip logs and and the duration you've got warnings about of nearby speedcams that's this little window
[01:57:45.820 --> 01:57:49.180]   in the bottom here it would also give you if you're actually moving and had a better connection
[01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:54.380]   internet a live map like this in a 3d projection so you can see like the roads going on in front of
[01:57:54.380 --> 01:58:01.260]   you and they've also integrated uh iTunes the ipod app has always been really well integrated we
[01:58:01.260 --> 01:58:05.340]   can tap a button and get playback controls now you have like the current track and playback
[01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:10.060]   controls right there at the bottom of the screen uh and it looks actually even a little bit more
[01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:15.820]   impressive when it's all agglomerated onto the smaller iphone screen i've actually been using it
[01:58:15.820 --> 01:58:21.100]   on the ipad so like velcro to my dashboard and it is just the and then it's just like the coolest
[01:58:21.100 --> 01:58:26.220]   nice on the ipad it's really big yeah exactly because you just want especially when you think
[01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:30.780]   that i don't want a big cluster of cluttered information when on the sort of an application i just
[01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:34.540]   want to be able to glance get the information i want and be have my ass back on the road in like
[01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:38.220]   one fifth of a second what's it called again a smart h u d
[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:47.980]   plus a smart hood a smart hood and plus speedcams plus plus yeah they now they they had the one
[01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:52.620]   version now they have like three of them one of them will have the speedcams one of them will have
[01:58:52.620 --> 01:58:57.020]   live speedcams where instead of just simply downloading things ad hoc now we'll simply have
[01:58:57.020 --> 01:59:00.700]   a live well someone just reported like five minutes ago there's a new speed cam operator they're
[01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:04.780]   like a button you can hit if you see one you just go you just like hit a button and said speedcams
[01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:09.980]   i believe in the purpose of speedcams to ensure the safety of all motorists and therefore i will
[01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:14.460]   not condone such activity by using that feature but i believe that is a feature of the sound i
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:20.460]   have used i've used myself they have an ipad version or is it just a big big uh i have not seen an ipad
[01:59:20.460 --> 01:59:24.540]   version yet but it looked pretty good that was yeah again that's that's just doubled okay but
[01:59:25.340 --> 01:59:31.500]   i'm so impressed that i actually only found it when i was looking for uh versions of this
[01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:36.460]   application for android because again i was using the the uh the nexus one for two weeks just
[01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:40.460]   cold turkey not using my iphone and that's one application i really really miss there a couple
[01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:45.580]   of different spadometer apps for android but none of them are nearly this pretty or put nearly so
[01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:51.100]   much useful information without becoming a distraction on your dashboard uh and so it really is one of
[01:59:51.100 --> 01:59:57.900]   my if there are five apps that define my use of the iphone asmart hudy is one of them very cool
[01:59:57.900 --> 02:00:04.540]   indeed well i was uh embarked um yesterday as i mentioned i was giving kind of an in service for
[02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:09.180]   the high school teachers at the school my kids go to and i and i wanted to put a lot of uh
[02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:13.580]   applications on the ipad that would be useful in school of course i use the elements and stuff like
[02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:19.900]   that and i saw somebody's tweet it looks like usfora has just crashed i'm not kidding oh you know what
[02:00:19.900 --> 02:00:25.020]   maybe it died something's gone weird i couldn't charge it something's gone weird once again i did
[02:00:25.020 --> 02:00:31.340]   that with my mind leo you are powerful you're the man who stays at pads mmm yes i don't try to show
[02:00:31.340 --> 02:00:37.340]   off you've been displeasing me lately uh this is uh something i saw somebody tweet about i think
[02:00:37.340 --> 02:00:42.140]   i actually have several that i found like solver which is really cool it just won the uh ultimate apple
[02:00:42.140 --> 02:00:49.260]   web blog so award it's a kind of natural language uh calculator so you type in uh there's some really
[02:00:49.260 --> 02:00:56.540]   neat apps for for math but this one you you type in uh the problem actually let's do it on the ipad
[02:00:56.540 --> 02:01:01.420]   there's an iphone version but in in natural language and it and it kind of it saves it and
[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:04.860]   it's just it seems like for somebody who's doing some calculations but that wants to know what the
[02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:10.140]   calculations are instead of just entering in the number uh uh you actually enter in kind of the
[02:01:10.140 --> 02:01:14.860]   whole problem and then it does the calculations around it and it saves it all and has some very
[02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:19.340]   nice storage so that's one s o u l v e r but i thought this one was really neat and i think you
[02:01:19.340 --> 02:01:25.580]   might like it um andy because i know you like comics uh one of my favorite books is james joise
[02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:30.380]   ulysses but it is not the most accessible book especially for a high school student this is a
[02:01:30.380 --> 02:01:35.980]   robert berry's comic adaptation of james joise it's graphic novel adaptation it's actually quite a
[02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:42.700]   good adaptation with full discussion notes really beautiful on the ipad uh but it's a comic book
[02:01:42.700 --> 02:01:49.100]   but of ulysses i'd show you but my ipad seems to have died um but uh this i was very impressed by
[02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:57.580]   this this is called ulysses scene and it is free um if you have a high school kid or even a younger
[02:01:57.580 --> 02:02:04.220]   kid who needs to read ulysses one of the great novels of english literature but yet one of the
[02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:09.580]   most inaccessible this has a reader's guide discussion and a very accessible comic that kind of brings
[02:02:09.580 --> 02:02:14.940]   it to life so there's a couple of apps i found quite a few there's really amazing array of uh
[02:02:14.940 --> 02:02:20.620]   of educational apps now out there do you use some with malachi uh he has a flash card it's a kid's
[02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:24.700]   flashcard one and we you literally just hand it to him in the back seat and he just you hear this
[02:02:24.700 --> 02:02:30.540]   you hear this one hundred oh two and he well he's he's a smart kid and he just he just constantly
[02:02:30.540 --> 02:02:33.900]   running through and he just obsessed with this little flashcard thing and he'll just keep on running
[02:02:33.900 --> 02:02:38.620]   and then what's interesting is after he started playing it he became obsessed with knowing what
[02:02:38.620 --> 02:02:42.140]   everything around him is that's the thing that i thought was interesting is that kids get to that
[02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:45.980]   at some point in time but it turns something on inside of him and became a learner but he was like
[02:02:45.980 --> 02:02:48.940]   he's he's looking at what is that what is that what is that what is that what is that what is that
[02:02:48.940 --> 02:02:52.700]   what is that but it's it's like this constantly like obsession now with knowing what all the
[02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:58.140]   things are because i had it has some very powerful educational use so i think it's i think it's
[02:02:58.140 --> 02:03:01.420]   its biggest use to be honest with you i've been trying yeah maybe i've been trying to decide
[02:03:01.420 --> 02:03:06.300]   whether it could replace a laptop and i think a student still needs a writing machine but but
[02:03:06.300 --> 02:03:11.100]   if you had a keyboard with uh with pages i i wouldn't try to replace a laptop i'd do this and a laptop
[02:03:11.100 --> 02:03:15.900]   but this carry this to school and have all your books on it right and have i mean it just it seems
[02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:19.740]   to me this would be a reason if the school is going to decide which they're going to supply
[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:23.580]   if you're gonna have one or the other maybe the ipad yeah but i do think you need a writing machine
[02:03:23.580 --> 02:03:28.300]   i think you need it i think you still need a truck as steve jobs called the um pc you still need a
[02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:33.180]   truck if you're a student for for instance just opening a web i understand well you know what i'm
[02:03:33.180 --> 02:03:36.300]   recommending to the school you guys are gonna hate me but i think they should get netbooks running
[02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:42.300]   a bunto lennox because the cost is half uh they give out mac books to incoming freshman right now
[02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:45.820]   and uh and the one of the problems they have is these kids are playing games all the time
[02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:50.780]   so having lennox would kind of slow that down just slightly like i do is remove the web browser
[02:03:50.780 --> 02:03:57.260]   you've got that problem solved no browser and who needs it hey guys great show thank you so much
