[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.480]   We'll take a look at what he said, what he implied.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.960]   Is Pokemon Go coming to the Apple Watch or not?
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.560]   Renee Richie has a scoop.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.320]   A whole lot more.

[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.680]   Well, unless something--
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.800]   this is kind of straight out of John Oliver.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.200]   Unless something happens on Tuesday afternoon,
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.360]   in which case it would be kind of stale,
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.360]   by the time we do it Tuesday morning.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.200]   Hey, he's back.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.960]   Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.960]   He, Alex.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.240]   Good to see you.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.840]   Good to be here.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.280]   Yes.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.000]   For once, Andy and Aco might have a one up on you.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.520]   Andy and Aco's also here from Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.280]   And I know from his Instagram, he is in proud possession
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.480]   of Obama Hershey Kisses.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.720]   I do not have any Obama Hershey Kisses, I will admit.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.320]   Straight off Air Force One.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.400]   I will say that they are like Schrodinger's Hershey's Kisses
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.200]   because I don't think many people actually open these up.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.520]   I think that they are like, OK, I've got the gift.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.960]   This beautiful box with Obama's signature on it
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.400]   in the presidential seal.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.040]   Like, I can buy Hershey's Kisses at the airport.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.760]   So my theory-- my theory A is that they're actually
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.160]   made out of wax to make them stable for 100 years.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.080]   Or second, as a joke, they put a little coupon that says,
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.120]   this coupon is good for one presidential pardon
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.680]   for any crime below murder.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.960]   Knowing that in eight years, no one has ever found it
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.040]   and then actually cash it.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.480]   There could be a golden ticket in there.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.160]   You do say in your Instagram, why do they even bother--
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.080]   you could show this, Carson.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.760]   Why do they even bother to fill these with candies?
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.440]   Because you're right, no one is going to open that.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.520]   You're going to want that pristine.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.400]   That's a collector's item.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.680]   Imagine 100 years from now.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.800]   The candy will be stale, but the signature is freshes.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.760]   It's a nice little souvenir.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.440]   You should have special like--
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.880]   It's great.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.720]   You should have special like, quit nerds candy boxes.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.760]   You got it.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.520]   With your signature, the Twitsy one.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.360]   I should do that.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.520]   You're right.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.880]   You got a very nice tour.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.280]   It looks like there's the presidential.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.360]   So is that the West Wing?
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.880]   Yes.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.840]   And yes, when you tour the White House,
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.000]   you find yourself replaying every scene from the TV show.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.880]   When we're walking down the part--
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.240]   I don't know what the name-- the walkway
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.720]   that the president uses to get from the residence to the office,
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.400]   I was singing, You Make Me Egg, Fu Young.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.920]   Let's see where he and Mrs. Partlett were at that for mass.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.120]   Yes, exactly.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.600]   I love it.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.920]   I love your caption here.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.400]   A big fan of my "Sun Times" column
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.720]   invited me to visit his house when I was in town.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.360]   He moved from Chicago a while ago, but he keeps reading me online.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.960]   I love that.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.360]   Very cute.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.040]   Also, you're Renee Ritchie of imore.com.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.960]   And he looks like he's bundled up for a typical Montreal
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.360]   winner.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.400]   Wow.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.120]   It's the first cold of the year, because you're not prepared.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.480]   By February, this will be fine.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.600]   But right now, those Arctic winds, they sting.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.920]   It hurts, doesn't it?
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.400]   It does.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.720]   My blood got thin over the summer.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.560]   I didn't really know that cold could hurt until I went to Toronto.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.160]   And then I understood.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.200]   Minus 40, you go outside your face hurts,
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.320]   and you feel the liquid in your head starting to freeze.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.280]   So you want to run as fast as you can.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.480]   Yeah, terrible.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.400]   Let's see here.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.360]   Has anybody got the actual production AirPods yet?
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.800]   People are getting-- oh, there you go.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.360]   Renee's got them.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.120]   Because that's not fair because you had the pre-pro model too.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.040]   Now you have a fresh model.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.200]   Yeah, and the retail-- I mean, they're everywhere now.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.640]   People are getting the pre-orders already.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.440]   People who ordered right away have gotten shipments already.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.240]   So they're out there now.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.960]   I heard the stores are sold out, though.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.320]   They're getting incremental depending
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.960]   on where you are, depending on how big the market is.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.120]   Sometimes depending on the weather,
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.280]   because the weather hasn't been
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.240]   in Dusse for rapid shipment right now.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.720]   You can find them in stores and they
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.600]   will be trickling in over the rest of the week.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.880]   I wonder if I should wander down to my Apple Store.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.480]   What's the best way to handle that?
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.840]   Yeah, it just gets the Apple Store early
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.040]   and to catch the morning shipments.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.400]   And then if you miss out on those,
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.840]   I mean, they let people buy two at a time.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.560]   And I don't think most people really want two at a time.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.880]   So you're dealing with a lot of eBay scalpers.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.480]   But then check again after lunch,
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.680]   because that's when the second shipment will arrive.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.600]   Best buy, some carrier stores get them in.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.480]   So if you know a bunch of news sites on Twitter
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.400]   that you can follow,
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.880]   sometimes they'll let you know immediately
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.680]   when they're available in your snack.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.720]   I've been done in our chatroom saying
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.640]   that Best Buy had them last night.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.920]   Yeah, and I think AT&T or Verizon had them this morning.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.920]   You can also, if you don't have any
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.440]   for sale at the Apple Store,
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.720]   just like keep walking the sidewalk outside,
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.320]   you'll probably find three or four of them.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.480]   They're all left.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.120]   Yeah, especially in your jeans.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.960]   Mr, you want to spritz out that you're wax,
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.240]   but that's about it.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.240]   I haven't lost one.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.880]   And I like,
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.720]   Georgia will tell you,
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.560]   'cause she was mentioning this,
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.480]   I'll lose an iMac.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.320]   Like I'll come in,
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.360]   I don't know where the iMac went,
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.200]   what happened to it.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.720]   And I haven't lost one in three months,
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.040]   and I was petrified that I would lose it.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.880]   But because they get,
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.320]   they just suck back into that case,
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.720]   and it's such an enjoyable,
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.720]   like they built the experience so enjoyably,
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.680]   you want to put them in there
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.760]   and you want that sort of feeling.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.280]   So you're tacitly rewarded for putting them away,
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.600]   and then you have this giant capsule
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.680]   and it's much harder to lose.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I'm worried about like,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.360]   so I wear like a really thick scarf,
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.440]   like in the winter.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.720]   And sometimes like when it's super, super cold,
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.640]   like I will just say,
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.760]   I need this as my titanium against death.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.440]   And I'm worried about like brushing against
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.400]   like the dangly part of the headphone
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.240]   and being knocked off
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.240]   like when I'm paused or something.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.440]   So I'm glad that Apple will sell you just one left
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.280]   or just one right if you lose one though,
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.320]   for like 70 bucks.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.160]   I'm worried about hoodies.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.960]   Like I was very careful taking a hoodie on and off
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.480]   because that felt like it could hit it.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.920]   But it was loud enough playing
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.920]   that I knew the second it had been dislodged.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.880]   Yeah, I'm not even excited about the long little thing
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.720]   sticking out.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.880]   I'd rather it still my ear.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.480]   Renee had him when he was down here
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.320]   and it didn't look as bad as I expected it to.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.160]   No, it's not the look,
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.960]   it's just that I'd rather have it more self-contained.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.400]   And I'm sure that there's a reason for that,
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.680]   but it just has a microphone
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.880]   and it's probably also a antenna, right?
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.400]   Yeah, and they wanted that for the boom.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.200]   Like the mic is a really good noise canceling.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.880]   And they wanted to.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.200]   I think frankly, the idea of two mics like that
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.440]   might actually really sound great.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.320]   You can choose, you can force it to use one mic
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.160]   or the other,
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.480]   otherwise it'll dynamically adjust depending on where
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.320]   it's getting the best quality from.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.400]   Oh, interesting.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.720]   Oh, that's really interesting.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.600]   So if you talk out of the left side of your mouth,
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.080]   it'll use the left one.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.800]   Oh, I don't have a right side of your mouth,
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.640]   it'll use the right one.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.760]   So if you're lying or remembering,
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.080]   it'll know what side to use.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.080]   (laughing)
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.120]   That's interesting.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.080]   That's very interesting.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.200]   Tim Cook has spoken.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.360]   The Forum, I guess it's an internal employee forum.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.200]   Apple Web.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.760]   Apple Web.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.080]   He was doing a Q&A.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.000]   And they asked him about last week's tech summit.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.840]   Here's the question and answer.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.240]   TechCrunch had this.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.080]   They had a leak, I guess.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.800]   Last week, he joined other tech leaders
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.240]   to meet President-elect Donald Trump.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.840]   How important is it for Apple to engage with governments?
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.800]   That's a nice way to put it.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.320]   He says, "It's very important.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.960]   "Government can affect our ability to do what we do."
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.960]   This is Tim Cook writing.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.520]   "They can affect it in positive ways.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.400]   "They can affect it in not so positive ways.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.880]   "What we do is focus on the policies.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.320]   "Some of our key areas of focus are on privacy
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.600]   "and security, education.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.840]   "They're on advocating for human rights for everyone
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.640]   "and expanding the definition of human rights.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.360]   "They're on the environment.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.880]   "And really combating climate change.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.400]   "Something we do by running our business
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.600]   "on 100% renewable energy."
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.040]   Remember this is kind of the somber expression Tim had
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.960]   in this meeting.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.080]   And of course, creating jobs is a key part of what we do
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.080]   by giving people opportunity,
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.880]   not only with people that work directly for Apple,
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.440]   but the large number of people that are in our ecosystem.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.720]   We're really proud that we've created
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.120]   two million jobs just in this country.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.960]   A great percentage of those are app developers.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.240]   Oh, so they don't actually work for you, Tim.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.120]   This gives everyone the power to sell their work
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.000]   to the world, which is an unbelievable invention
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   of itself.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.440]   I mean, I think that that's hard to say
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.400]   how many jobs are created by the app ecosystem.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.200]   I mean, I'm sure jobs were created by the app ecosystem,
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.880]   but are those newly employed people?
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.680]   Probably not.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.120]   We have other things that are more business-centric,
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.280]   like tax reform.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.120]   Yep.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.880]   Read that a little more carefully and you'll know
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.760]   that he's asking for repatriation
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.520]   of all those billions Apple has in Ireland.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.120]   At lower than 30% tax rate.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.400]   Yeah, not at the full tax rate.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.560]   I mean, the target rumor target is 10%.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.880]   Trump floated 10% during the campaign.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.600]   And something we've long advocated for,
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:21.600]   a simple system, tax system, and we like it.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.080]   I don't know what that means.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.480]   I think a simple tax system, you know.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.360]   Well, yeah, when the tax system is too
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.080]   so complicated that Apple is saying,
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.800]   we just can't hire people to do our taxes correctly.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.640]   We can't figure this out.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.240]   Well, I think their version of a simple system
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.880]   is one that doesn't tax them in place of purchase
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.280]   or place of sale and in place of headquarters.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.320]   Yeah, I know.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.880]   It's a simple system for corporations.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.320]   It's much simpler for corporations
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.600]   than it is for individuals.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.440]   And we'd like intellectual property reform
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.400]   to try to stop the people suing
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.160]   when they don't do anything as a company.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.360]   Oh, I agree with that.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.440]   Patent trolls.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.240]   Does Apple, I guess Apple, oh, yeah, Apple had a big settlement,
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.240]   right?
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.240]   $73 million or something.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.640]   Many, many, many times a year there, too.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.040]   When it sounds like they're going to,
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.520]   the Supreme Court looks like it's going to review
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.080]   the idea of where these suits can happen
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.480]   so that East Texas gets kind of--
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.480]   Right.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.480]   No more venue shopping.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.320]   A lock-up docket.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.200]   There's a large number of those issues Tim goes on,
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.720]   and the way that you advance them is to engage.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.400]   This is what I was actually saying last week.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.600]   This was after Macbreak Weekly,
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.440]   which happened on Wednesday.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.680]   But we were talking about it on this week in Google,
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.240]   and I said, "These guys go because they have to go.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.160]   They would be irresponsible not to go."
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.840]   Personally, I've never found being on the sideline, Tim,
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.040]   says a successful place to be.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.120]   The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.280]   You don't have to smile.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.560]   You should write that in.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.200]   You don't have to smile or be happy, but you got to go.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.000]   You got to participate.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.800]   So whether it's in this country or in the European Union
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.240]   or in China or South America, we engage.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.840]   And we engage when we agree, and we engage when we disagree.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.560]   I think it's very important to do that, because you don't change things
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.400]   by just yelling.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:10.840]   You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.240]   In many ways, it's a debate of ideas.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.920]   We very much stand up for what we believe in.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.680]   We think that's a key part of what Apple is about.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.040]   We'll continue to do so.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.240]   That very diplomatic answer from Tim Cook.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.160]   Dr. Doom of Laet Veria is a great leader,
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.640]   and we're going to look forward to talking to him about all the issues.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:32.360]   But Tim, of all of the CEOs that were there,
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:37.320]   was clearly the least happy, at least the pictures I saw.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.000]   And I was told on Twitter we had-- Stephen Kovac was on.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.040]   He's with Business Insider, and he actually was waiting in the lobby
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.960]   at the Trump Tower to catch some of these CEOs after the fact.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.400]   And he said a lot of them snuck in.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.920]   They went in the back way, so you didn't see them coming in.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.280]   And then Tim-- was it Tim Cook?
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.760]   I think bolted for the elevator.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.200]   Bolted.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.680]   Literally ran.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:11.120]   Literally ran rather than be way late and say something.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:11.920]   Wow.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.600]   But that's also, I think, that they don't want to make a photo op.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.760]   Kanye was very happy to put his arm around President-elect Trump
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.080]   and smile for the cameras.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.160]   That was a photo op, and I think that the CEOs were not anxious to do that.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.600]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.960]   And when you look at where people were seated in relation
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.840]   to the president elect, the faces that people would recognize.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.360]   And certainly, the CEOs that have been written about the most
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:45.320]   were basically-- were certainly placed as close to the president elect
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.160]   as possible to make sure that they're in the photo.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.080]   You don't want to have-- you don't necessarily
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.400]   want to have a president of Oracle that nobody has really
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.840]   written about or the general public has not really seen in a long time.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.640]   The value is that he's sitting down with that person that you see releasing
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.320]   the new iPhone.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.240]   Don't you like the new iPhone?
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.200]   That sort of thing.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:13.120]   And Tim Cook was right next to Peter Thiel, who was right next to the president elect.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.640]   So--
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.440]   Yeah, good seat at the table.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.200]   More importantly, he was very near the kids.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.120]   I think that's more of a garnish of what people think about.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.360]   And somebody in the chatroom said, oh, the reason Tim was running
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.520]   it is he had a taco bowl earlier from the Trump grill.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.760]   And that's not nice.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.260]   Go ahead.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.160]   I'm sorry, Alex.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.160]   No, I was going to say that I think that what Trump has also kind of shown
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.560]   is that he's pretty malleable, so actually meeting with him might actually--
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.440]   No, I think so.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.000]   It often seems like his opinions are shaped by the last people he talked to.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.960]   So get in there and talk to him.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.080]   That was my point exactly.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.880]   Well, yeah, because it's not just because of the tax thing.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.320]   It's also we're looking at big shifts in policy.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.120]   We're already looking at the huge threat to net neutrality.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.400]   And given that--
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.720]   And you really want a chance to say, here is--
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.000]   I don't know who has told you what, but here is why we think net neutrality
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.840]   is an incredibly important thing.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.880]   And that if people from the cable industry have said that it's totally unfair
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.240]   and totally wrong and totally silly to have Netflix have the same bandwidth
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.880]   as our branded Hulu, then we should have a talk.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.400]   I understood.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:23.280]   But didn't that same article say that Tim, after the actual summit meeting,
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.040]   so to speak, had some private time to have a little bit of a chat?
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:27.840]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.240]   Oh, interesting.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:33.240]   I think it was the-- I don't know which-- I think it was the business insider article, maybe.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.240]   Ah.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.800]   Well, and I would hope so and take those moments if you can get them, right?
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.320]   Who knows how often you're going to get the ear of the president.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.640]   And--
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.880]   There's no point in not talking.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.520]   There's no point-- and you can see all the issues that Apple cares a lot about.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:55.320]   One of the issues we care about is the Macintosh and Tim was also at Great Pains
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:01.440]   in the same question and answer session on Apple Web to say that Apple is not
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.960]   abandoning the desktop.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.960]   Don't worry.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.160]   I don't-- let me see if I can read.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.080]   What are you laughing at?
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:18.200]   No, it's just that sometimes it's like we have great things in mind for the Mac desktop.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.840]   Just like we had great things in mind for the new MacBook just late.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.920]   He says, "Some folks in the media--"
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.000]   Yeah, my bad.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.320]   "-- have raised questions about whether we're committed to desktops.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.240]   If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.200]   We have great desktops in the roadmap.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.040]   No one should worry about that."
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:46.840]   Yeah, I mean, the best way to describe it right now is if you have several kids and you love
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:51.240]   all those kids, but one of them just has a monster singing hit and looks like they're
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.240]   about to have more and more monster singing hits.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.880]   And you've got to take them to the studio and you've got to fly with them and you've
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.400]   got to follow them on tour.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.120]   And it doesn't mean you don't love the kid who's in college and doing really well.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.040]   And it doesn't mean that that new baby isn't requiring a lot of attention.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.080]   But that kid has just got hit single after hit single and is taking up a lot of your
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.080]   time right now.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:14.640]   And the other flip side of that is that when you're the kid who-- I'm sorry, we only have
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.160]   four tickets to Hamilton and we're not taking you.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.080]   And well, welcome to Thanksgiving.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.480]   Actually, we need you to sit in the living room because we didn't want to bring in another
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.640]   chair.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.400]   When you're the absolutely always the last person to be invited and you're not invited
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:34.360]   to lots of things and you're being told, "Don't worry, we have great things planned
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.360]   for you next year."
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.520]   We're waiting for a put up or shut up moment.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:47.800]   The thing that Apple is going to have to deliver in 2017 had better be pretty damn good because
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:55.000]   they're-- it's not incorrect for people to wonder what kind of investment Apple does
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.880]   have in the Mac platform.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:05.000]   If the Mac does have a future in the roadmap beyond five years because they've been slighted
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.480]   for a long, long time and again, there's faith will manage for a certain amount of time
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:16.520]   at which point you really have to show me through an actual announcement even if you
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.520]   can't have hardware.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.480]   Show me here is what we're-- here is what we've built.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.320]   We're not bringing to shipping-- I'm not going to shipping until six months but we're going
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.960]   to have this for you next year.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.960]   Here's the--
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.680]   And I think that ecosystem is really important.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.400]   I think that one of the things is it may seem like we only need-- you know, everyone's only--
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.880]   Apple only needs iPhones or only needs iPads or so on and so forth but you lose your power
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:40.160]   users to Windows or you start seeing erosion there and that can lead to a lot of other
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:47.160]   decisions being made at a very high level of people who are influencers if people start
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.160]   to really jump.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:54.600]   And I know there's a lot of people including us that are looking at the Surface Studio,
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:00.800]   the Surface tablets and really thinking that this is our-- this may be our future if Apple
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.600]   doesn't sort out touch screen, power, that type of thing.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:11.160]   Credit by the way, Matthew Panzareno at TechCrunch for getting this internal conversation
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.480]   and I presume it's accurate.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.680]   Here's the question Tim was answering.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:19.520]   We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.600]   in the spring.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:28.080]   Our Mac desktop strategic for us and Tim answers, the desktop is very strategic for us.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.520]   I don't know what that means.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:35.440]   It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:41.120]   That's kind of an acknowledgment that the MacBook Pros really didn't have a-- weren't
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.320]   really great on the performance scale.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:48.080]   The largest screen is the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, fastest performance.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.760]   So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important in some cases critical
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.960]   to people.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.800]   This really is directed at the MacBook Pro complainers.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:02.240]   By the way, the comments section on TechCrunch after this is universally Panz everything,
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.240]   Tim says.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.920]   It's like, come on Tim.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.320]   The current generation-- this is actually interesting.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.680]   The current generation iMac is the best desktop we've ever made.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.360]   Okay, so no mention of the Mac Pro.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.360]   Oh, the Mac mini either.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.360]   The mini either.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.520]   And it's beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.520]   I agree with that.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.080]   It's a very nice display.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:28.000]   Although aren't they selling now these LG 5K-- are those LG's 4K not 5K?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   No, there's 5K.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.280]   They went on sale today.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.040]   They're not quite the same as Apple because they're matte and it kind of looks different
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.880]   when you put it next to a-- A lot of people want that.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.880]   I ordered one.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.040]   Yeah, that's tempting.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.520]   Some folks-- I'm going to get an LG logo.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.200]   Oh, and I read this on folks in the media.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.840]   So-- And then this is-- Go ahead.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:49.840]   It's a huge challenge.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.040]   I mean, when you-- and it's not-- like consumers shouldn't have to worry about this
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.320]   at all, consumers should just get the stuff that they expect, especially because Apple
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.080]   made all these things appliances.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.880]   If they still had cheese graters and easily accessible Mac minis and we could upgrade
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.440]   graphics cars and CPUs and hard drives to a hard content, then we could still maintain
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.440]   our own computing environment.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.320]   But the minute they sealed the ball up, they took absolute responsibility for upgrading
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.000]   and maintaining those product lines.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.720]   And they failed to do that for two, three, four years going on now.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.320]   And that's absolutely their fault and their problem.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.440]   On Apple's side, though, they are successful in too many areas right now for the way their
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.640]   company is built.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.240]   And Microsoft never succeeded at mobile.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.160]   So they can put all their feathers behind surface.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.240]   It's fine for them.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.560]   And Google is super successful at mobile and they're just building out their post-mobile
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.560]   and they don't really have a desktop strategy.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.560]   Speak up.
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.520]   They have a notebook, Surface Chromebook strategy.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.800]   But no one else has spread sort of as thin as Apple is.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.160]   And Apple is a company that is not designed to be thick.
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.800]   They are incredibly focused.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.880]   They don't just add product units.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.600]   Like there's no Mac unit and iOS, sorry, iPhone unit and iPod unit.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.120]   And you only have the same amount of people now giving attention to five or six different
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.320]   product categories.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.200]   And we're seeing that that may not work.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.200]   They might have to make hard choices.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.840]   I might have to make like about how much products they do, about how they organize or run their
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.840]   company.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.440]   But year after year after year, we're seeing that they just, the iPhone absolutely gets
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.080]   updated because the iPhone has to get updated.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.640]   But everything else sort of seems to have to fit in around that.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:14.160]   And plus it's the, again, it's the burden of having to be the sole manufacturer of everything
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.760]   that's out there.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:24.080]   If certain product lines don't, they really can't provide the advantage of saying whatever
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.480]   kind of computer you want.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.480]   It's out there.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.480]   You can get it.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.480]   Don't worry.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.480]   It'll suit you.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.120]   They really have to not only decide what they're capable of manufacturing, but also what they're
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.920]   capable of selling.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:40.960]   So this is, and frankly, it's time to ask the question if being a hardware, first hardware
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:47.120]   primary company is going to keep on working for the foreseeable future or if there is
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:53.880]   going to have to be sort of an, just like on the carton of carton eggs, best if used by
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:59.200]   X date for the strategy of we're making money on selling hardware, which is certainly
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:04.760]   lends credence to the idea that Apple really, really, really, really wants to get it to services,
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:09.800]   stuff where all they have to do is sell electrons and they don't have to maintain supply lines.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.640]   You can always manufacture, well, they can't manufacture more electrons.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.520]   You can convert matter into electrons, but with disasters results sometimes, but it's
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:23.160]   a lot easier than manufacturing, making sure you're manufacturing every iPhone and every
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:28.000]   Mac for everybody who ever wants that sort of stuff anywhere in the world.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.720]   Well, and I do think that they keep the control of the iPhone and keep the control of the
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.560]   iPad probably makes sense to Apple.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:39.240]   I still think that the old, if we look way back to the Motorola and the power computing
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:48.200]   days, making the OS, the Mac OS, available to other manufacturers to customize, I think
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.960]   it's such a small part of their income now.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.280]   It's something that they might be able to experiment with.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:58.840]   Obviously, it's very unlikely, probably 10% or less, but I think that it is a, I think
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.960]   that that kind of experimentation to allow people to stop worrying about it, stop putting
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.560]   the engineering resources into those things and continue to make them if they want.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:16.640]   I think that allowing people to experiment with it now that it's not the golden cap,
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.280]   the golden cap, so to speak, or whatever, it's not the golden egg.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.280]   It's not what the company survives on.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:26.560]   The company's got also has plenty of, I mean, when they had the power computing issue and
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:33.760]   the Motorola knockoffs that were happening, primarily what happened there was that the
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:39.280]   power PC groups, the G3, G4, they actually went in two different paths.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:45.320]   The G3 built a larger L2 cache which suddenly made the computers fast.
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.520]   Computers that were supposed to be cheap, much faster than the ones that were supposed
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.720]   to be fast.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:53.760]   That was going to be devastating to Apple.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:00.360]   I think that Apple doesn't have to worry about that that's paying all the bills now.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:09.080]   I think that Mac OS right now is still probably one of the best desktop platforms to work
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.720]   on and it'd just be great if we had hardware that could match it.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.720]   Well, maybe we will.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:18.000]   This is the implication from what Tim's saying is we're going to have new desktops.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.320]   But if I think we see the direction that the laptop went, I think that for a lot of pros,
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.320]   it's concerning.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.320]   It's going to be simplified.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.160]   Well, get gross, can you use the 5K iMac even though it's an all-in-one, right?
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.600]   Yeah, but like you said before, the cheese grater was such a great thing because you
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.880]   could expand it for years and years and years and years.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.400]   If Apple doesn't want to make a new one year after year, I think it's better for them to
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.080]   make a cheese grater than it is to make a cylinder because a cheese grater will serve
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.520]   people year after year after year.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.720]   We're using more and more PCs and Linux boxes for what we do because we've got to put
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.240]   three or four graphics cards into them.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:57.160]   There's all this customization that we could do to really build these very high performance
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:02.200]   machines, but we can't do it with a Mac OS because we have to, you know, we have a little
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.760]   trash can that we have to work with.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:09.480]   What about the accusation that Apple's doing this because it's really a profit center for
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:16.600]   them and upgradable machines are much more of a commodity.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.960]   But a 5K iMac, you know, that's a...
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.960]   I think it's more commitment.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.160]   I don't think Apple's worried about that.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.400]   I'm not too excited about that.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:28.400]   I don't think so.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.400]   I think that there...
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.400]   It's there looking for this design process that, you know, looks a certain way that can
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.320]   be something that you're showing off on your table.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.400]   It's not something that you hide away somewhere.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.560]   So I think that the design principles is...
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.400]   I think the form is getting a little ahead of the function.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.400]   I think that's the issue more than anything else.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.400]   I know with you.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.400]   I think...
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.400]   Exactly right.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.400]   You know, and I think for instance with a new laptop...
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.400]   Is the cheese grater is not beautiful?
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.400]   Well, I think it's beautiful, but it's...
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.400]   I thought it was great.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.400]   We did a revenge on it and we needed an eventador.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.400]   The concept car is slime, but you need the production car.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:03.080]   The tube is clearly form a function over... I mean, form over function and it's... I mean,
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.080]   that's a flop.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.080]   Let's face it.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.080]   And there's a flop belt.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.520]   And I'm gonna have five of us.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.520]   We have three of them.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:15.280]   You know, we have... I mean, for us being able to put, you know, three, five, eight cards
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.400]   into a single chassis is something that we're... you know, that we move on to do with that
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:25.040]   grapple by the way, because as Hell's Kitchen is pointing out, this as... really slick
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:29.560]   as the Surface Studio is and has a great proof of concept that a touch OS is a great thing.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.320]   I mean, I really love this.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.040]   The power... it's not a powerful machine.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.040]   It's essentially a laptop with a very, very...
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.040]   It's a great...
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.040]   It's a great...
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.040]   You have drive.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.440]   Well, remember that power is a very, very fluid word.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.560]   We're not just talking about CPU strength.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.680]   We're talking about what you can do with it.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.640]   And that's where different form factors really come into play.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.440]   So that's... there are a lot of people for whom the Mac Mini is the greatest computer
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:00.760]   that Apple makes because they can buy three or four of them for the cost of a 5K iMac.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:04.400]   And that means that they can have four people working on a problem at the same time as
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.560]   opposed to one person working on a spreadsheet, but that the numbers on the spread... the graphs
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.240]   on the spreadsheet look really great in 5K.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:17.400]   So if there's any real danger, I think, to consumers right now, or things that people
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.760]   should be thinking about right now, it's not that Apple will drop the Mac.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.960]   I don't think that that's going to happen in the immediate future, maybe even in the
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.360]   foreseeable future.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:34.080]   It's Apple deciding that a $600, $700, $800 gray box with rounded rectangles, with rounded
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:38.880]   corners that you connect to your own screen and your own keyboard is not something that
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.200]   makes sense to the company that they will say, "Well, we're all going to be...
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.720]   the iMacs and Mac Pros from now on.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.760]   We're going to do an education version of the Mac Mini, but that's only going to be to fulfill
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.920]   regular contracts because we're starting to get our lunch eaten in the educational market."
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:29:00.280]   So it's not the only risk that Apple could ever stop making the Mac because, again, I
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.560]   don't think that's going to happen.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:06.920]   The problem is if they stop making Macs that you need for your uses, whether you're a power
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:12.760]   user or an intro user or somewhere in between, that's what gets you looking at the other
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:19.080]   sections of the Edmund Scientific Catalog, so to speak.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:25.480]   Moving on, this is, again, from the Apple Web Post.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:31.920]   By the way, before we do, what are our predictions for the Mac announcements?
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.640]   Will they be this spring?
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:38.560]   Will the iMac be this spring and then we'll see what the Mac Mini and the Mac Pro...
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.120]   I've heard they will not announce...
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.520]   You don't think they'll announce new Mac Mini and Mac Pros this spring?
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.520]   I don't know.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:49.960]   I have heard that there's a lot of attention on the Mac right now, and especially design
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.440]   attention on the Mac right now, and that's not unusual.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.880]   Apple does float all these things, and then it makes strategic decisions about when and
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.880]   how.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.080]   A lot of it is bound by Intel or AMD or other people's roadmap, so it's not entirely in their
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.080]   hands.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.800]   But I believe all those things are being worked on.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.480]   The iMac is their best selling desktop.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.840]   We buy primarily the vast majority of us buy MacBooks.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.240]   Some of this is weighed by what we buy.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.320]   We bought Mac Pros by the hundreds of millions.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.000]   That'd be their first product every year.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   We just don't.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.080]   They sort of weight things according to the demand, which is not a fair way to do it,
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.320]   especially for creative people, but it's the way Apple is currently balancing.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.960]   So iMac for sure this spring, and then I think Mac Mini and Mac Pro will be decided.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.440]   Did you hate having to buy this LG display?
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.160]   I think it's bad for Apple.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.720]   It's not very appily.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.640]   I mean, this is on the Apple site.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.000]   The price is not appily.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.920]   There's under a thousand bucks.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:45.160]   It's Apple's doing half price on all or deeply discounted prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.160]   3.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:52.160]   It's got four USB-C ports in the back there, one charging and then three data, I guess.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.720]   By the way, Apple extended that discount to March 31.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.880]   You have an extra three months to do it.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.920]   So if you want to buy, buy in the next three months.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.520]   974 bucks is half off.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:04.400]   I forget what the exact number is for the display, but everything is up to 50% off right now
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.400]   on Apple.com.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.840]   I'm very tempted, but I don't have an Apple desktop to attach it to.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.920]   Well, no, I mean, and the bigger problem is that the interface is the application for
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:12.920]   most people.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.400]   You can change all the pipes you want behind the scenes.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.400]   Nobody really notices.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.840]   And for me, the screen is how I relate to my computer.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.400]   And right now I'm looking at an iMac and it has an Apple logo on it.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.840]   And in my other room, I have a Thunderbolt display and it has an Apple logo on it.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.000]   And every time I use it, I'm reminded that I use an Apple system.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.520]   And if Apple sees that, then people are looking at, oh, LG, what else is LG make?
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.280]   LG is a American PC as far as they can tell.
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.320]   By the way, it's a dangerous room.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.280]   Nobody says that it's a 1299 list.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.440]   So this is reduced from 1299 to 974.
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.400]   Still a very hefty discount.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.400]   Does that count?
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.920]   But yeah, I think it would be who of Apple, even if it's not a huge profit maker to actually
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:54.640]   own that entire experience and keep making the display and the routers and the things
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.640]   that people.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:59.240]   And if you're making a new Mac, make a cheese grater, would you please?
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.760]   Or with that generation, she's great at all the flexibility with all the modern.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.040]   I don't care what, yeah, make it look different.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.000]   Make it look like maybe it lie flat and the cards stick up.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   I don't care.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.600]   Just give it the, I want all the drive bays.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.760]   I want all the slots.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.640]   Many multiple graphics card slots that you can put in new cards for.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.880]   Well, look at Alex.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.800]   He's put in three graphics cards and some of his machines.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:20.800]   Yep.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:21.800]   A lot of horsepower.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:23.800]   It's all for VR.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.800]   It's plenty of my say.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.360]   And there's no reason not.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.160]   And this is where Apple is a little bit of trouble because really they're using basically
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.120]   stock PC components.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:39.640]   So that's the problem is there's secret sauces, the operating system, but basically they're
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.440]   using those are basically.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:45.440]   I mean, when you look at the stuff that they're using, so like the CPU's they spend a lot
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.640]   of time months and months and months with Intel making it do the things that they want,
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.320]   including go to sleep and power nap.
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.000]   The storage controllers, their own.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.440]   They're doing that in Mac OS.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.440]   They're not changed.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.240]   They're not buying a different CPU than I would buy it Dell.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:03.160]   They're at Intel working with them on the CPU and their storage controllers custom and
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.200]   they're fusing a lot of things on the motherboard in ways that they want to do it and they're
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.720]   designing a lot of their own stuff.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.080]   So no other company unless they put in that effort to go and assemble computers that way,
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:17.160]   they can make them chunkier or use more powerful parts, but they don't typically have like
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.200]   the say they don't make their own timing controller so they can put out a 5k display
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.200]   faster.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.200]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.200]   Okay.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.200]   So they're tuning them up.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.560]   Everything they can to make them more than just some of their.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.840]   But the value add is much more apparent in the NIMAC than it is in a cheese grater.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:35.160]   Yes, the cheese grater would be more except, you know, like they never use standard graphics
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.160]   cards.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.160]   You had to wait for the Mac version.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.160]   Which is annoying.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.160]   The superbummery.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.160]   Yeah, please.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.320]   At least make the connectors standard.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.920]   I could change the firmware, make the connectors standard.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:50.040]   And you talk to them and it is such a low priority for any video company to make Apple
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.400]   graphics cards because they don't sell anywhere nearly what the PC graphics.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.480]   By the way, getting time on the fab is hard.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:59.120]   I am going to start a petition.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.480]   Make Apple great again.
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.320]   Bring back the cheese grater.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.320]   D R A T E. Let's start a petition.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.320]   Oh, I like that.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.320]   Change the option like that.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:12.080]   Leo, we're all friends here.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.160]   We all love you.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:18.400]   You can tell us honestly, is this just to launch a really successful hat line?
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.400]   Uh huh.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.360]   I'm going to have red hats.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.600]   Make Apple great again.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.600]   Hashtag man guys baseball caps.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.600]   Uh huh.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:36.520]   I just all I'm asking Twitter is for a custom emoji and then I'll be happy.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.520]   So I'm very curious.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.000]   So when is your it says two to four weeks on the apple site?
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.880]   When is your LG display come Renee?
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.320]   I chose pick up in store because I'm not sure where I'm going to be because it's the
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:49.240]   holidays but I'll pick it up on December 29th.
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.240]   Happy birthday, Carsten.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.320]   It's what I'm going to use for Mac break weekly going forward.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.320]   Oh man.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.320]   So tempting.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.320]   Yeah, it really does.
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:01.040]   It really does point out to again power is making sure that you've got the tools that
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:07.960]   make help you to work more effectively for Renee like having a 4K or 5K display is really
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.640]   the the honey in your tea.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:15.440]   For me, believe it or not, it's having this really good $200 ergonomic arm on my $300
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:20.360]   gel monitor that let's be put it absolutely wherever I wanted to go that it's a silly,
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:24.480]   silly simple thing but I've actually got become so much more productive.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:30.320]   This desk has become now my favorite place to write as opposed to before the days before
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.760]   arm where it was at some I laptop.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.320]   I'll just go on the sofa or I'll just stay in bed or I'll just go into the kitchen and
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.120]   now I this is the fact that now I've got to go someplace and put on shoes and pants.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.040]   It has had this knock on effect.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.960]   So that's why diversity of hardware is really a big issue.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.960]   It's interesting.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.200]   Writer Renee is super happy with a 9.7 inch iPad Pro and the keyboard where editorial
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:58.000]   Renee has all these metrics filling up the screen real time all day and then Mike Asargent,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.280]   one of our staff is like he just wants it because it'll have 4K video in the middle and room
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:07.760]   for all the toolbars on the outside of it so you can edit without having to worry.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:08.760]   It's a lot it's paying them.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:13.080]   We have a lot of 4K monitors.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.280]   I think most of us are now Asus.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.280]   I can't.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.280]   I have to look back.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.280]   I think it's Asus though.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.280]   I think it's Asus is the peak.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.120]   You're now getting to be like 350 bucks or something like that.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.240]   So we buy them like chiclets.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:29.160]   There are just lots of them because we build arrays with them.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:34.160]   Like three across and three down and that kind of things where we have lots of information
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.520]   if we're doing a whole bunch of streams.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.560]   I have a hard time being sold on spending a lot more than that.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:45.320]   If you know what you're doing you can get most of these monitors to be very close to
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.080]   color accurate.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:54.520]   I definitely get that there are people who are doing something super, if you're a designer,
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:59.560]   if you're a print designer for the gap or something like that they'll be talking about
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.640]   incredible small changes in the yellows or the reds or whatever.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.600]   I understand that to some degree.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.960]   But I think for 99.99% I have a hard time.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.200]   I mean the 4K monitors now are so cheap and they're so good.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.760]   I mean just I will say I don't like going.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:18.920]   I mean you get used to 4K and you really want everything to be that sharp.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:24.680]   I love the fact that this is where like when you when you when Apple or anybody releases
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:30.040]   a new computer or new laptop is, oh God, you can attach six displays to it.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.160]   Why would you want to have six displays?
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:37.040]   Then now you're a year later you're like, I actually have this extra screen that I'm
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.040]   not using.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.120]   Wouldn't it be nice to have one so that over here so that if I were actually wanted to
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.720]   face like the TV while I'm going?
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.760]   I'm not really a 5K guy.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:51.560]   I really am like a multiple screen guy and there are times where I will want to have
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:56.920]   the big work display but then there's a second display here that's got a net a YouTube video
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.600]   that I'm watching as I'm trying to learn how to solder together this thing that I'm trying
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:06.320]   to put together and another one over here for for for social media and metrics and stuff
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.320]   like that.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:13.360]   It's a I actually mentioned in the demographics and the sort of like professions that are
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:17.600]   multiple screen people versus one big well Obama.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.800]   I just want to get this Andy.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:25.280]   This is the Dell 43 inch.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.760]   Where is that John by the way?
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.240]   Does father Rob did he father Robert co-opted I think?
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.120]   Does he still have it?
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:36.880]   So you could these are for 1080p screens and it has inputs so you could have four different
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.880]   inputs into there.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.000]   I want that in my office.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.640]   The day trader version.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:49.760]   I saw that at CES there was a company that had my and my been Samsung who was trying to
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:54.840]   figure out trying to try to at least demonstrate the curve display where it was designed to
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:59.840]   be again like three or four screens one one two three four.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.680]   But the problem when you have like a normally when you have like a huge screen like the
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.640]   one you showed is that if I'm looking this way now this version of the screen is at an
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.640]   angle.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:11.800]   Rest if you have a screen I would like I would love to have a 90 degree just curved glass
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.400]   display where no matter where I go.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:19.000]   And then when I'm doing racing games I'll just like move scooch up my chair and there
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.640]   I am looking for checking for passing.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:25.160]   I don't know kidding that that would probably be the $5,000 display that I would actually
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.040]   consider buying.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.960]   This was this was under a thousand I think or is around a thousand looks like it's like
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.960]   1300 bucks.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:31.960]   Yeah it wasn't that.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:37.000]   Not that I'm looking at Alex is already looking it up.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.560]   It's not super high res it's not I mean it's not.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:45.320]   It's the day trader monitor exactly.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:51.280]   But what we do with these monitors we we we're monitoring live streams typically and I'm
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.240]   looking at this and the problem with that you can get HDMI a four HDMI's into it.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.320]   Because right now what we do is we have them we have a bunch of little Mac minis that are
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:03.520]   all feeding these what a multi viewer black magic makes these like 16 up to one but to
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.520]   16.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:10.000]   But the problem is that 4k signal coming out is very sensitive to long runs whereas just
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.800]   pumping all the stuff we need to into the monitor would would actually be cheaper and
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:14.800]   more effective so.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:16.800]   I'm very excited.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.240]   You want to try it you just come over here.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:23.320]   I have to cry it out of father Roberts fingers which means you could go to hell.
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.320]   Yes.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.720]   It's possibility I just want to raise that issue he's got friends in the Vatican.
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:28.720]   Well wait a minute.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.960]   So does Alex come to think of it.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.720]   So never mind.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:34.720]   Go.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:40.840]   Actually let's take a break then we'll another quote from Tim Cook in that actually I think
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:46.880]   the most interesting quote from Tim Cook in that Apple Apple Web Post.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.560]   Hi it's Tim.
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.560]   Roll tide.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.360]   Wait a minute no no he's Auburn.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.280]   What is a war eagle and he doesn't tell people what company he works for.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.280]   Sorry Tim Cook.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.880]   He's Tim Cook war eagle.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.880]   I'm going on a little trip for the holidays I bet some of you are and I'm bringing the
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:08.520]   best carry on bag ever with me.
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.680]   It's the away bag.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:17.800]   Now I'll tell you why it's the best carry on in a second away makes great high quality
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:22.880]   smart suitcases for just 225 bucks and up.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.600]   They use high quality materials.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:30.040]   They're lightweight but they offer you a lot lower price than the than those big brands
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.320]   because they don't sell in stores they sell directly to you.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:36.400]   The away bag available in nine colors and four sizes.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:40.840]   I've got the carry on they've got the bigger carry on the medium and the large and they're
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:47.040]   all less than 300 bucks and they all come with a lifetime warranty and I love what else
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.240]   they come with and I'm going to show you right here.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:54.880]   They all come under the you know there by the way these are these are now I won't buy luggage
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.880]   that isn't a spinner right four wheels.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:02.600]   So you know instead of dragging it you you just you could push it with a finger along.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:10.040]   But if you look under the handle here I love this two USB ports and a high capacity battery
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.360]   inside.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:15.920]   So instead of having to find a plug socket at the airport next time I'm just going to
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.160]   plug my phone and tablet right into that.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:23.320]   It's got a TSA approved combination lock of course prevents theft but as required by
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.680]   the TSA lets them in.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:31.960]   I love the spinner for 360 degrees means you can you can just push it along with a finger.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:35.600]   I know you've been to the airport and you've seen people with these spinners and said gosh
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:40.040]   I wish I had one of those as you drag your bag behind you.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:45.560]   Also inside I love this for the geek it's a patent pending interior compression system.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:51.760]   You buckle in the bulky items it forces the air out and that way you can get all of your
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:57.840]   clothes in a carry on and that's the key to great travel is not checking luggage.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:02.080]   There's even a removable washable laundry bag to keep dirty clothes separate from the
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.080]   clean.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:07.200]   Lifetime warranty risk free 100 day trial period.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:12.400]   I will be hitting the road once again with my away bag next week as I go to visit my
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:15.160]   mom there's the medium.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:24.320]   I will say that only only amateurs check their personal exactly exactly.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:28.080]   But if you have to you can always get look at all the colors to get the large and do don't
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:34.640]   get black I was stupid I got black every bag today on the carousel is black.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:40.280]   Get a color that is a little less great green you know no that's then you'll know it's your
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.280]   bag.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:47.480]   A way has a special offer because you're listening to Mac break weekly $20 off your order if you
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:53.800]   go to away travel.com away travel.com/macbreak and use the promo code Macbreak and check out.

[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:19.600]   me my bag for my trip to see my mom.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:25.200]   The charger in the bag is so important because you land you forget to turn off your phone
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:30.400]   always forget to put on airport and airplane mode and then when you land because it's been
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:35.520]   on looking for a connection it's dead and now you can't get an Uber not that's not that's
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:40.840]   ever happened to me or even happened to me last week so yeah so yeah it's just like
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.840]   a case of emergency you know you just got it right there.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:49.800]   So also there's the added benefit of being able to lord it all over all the people.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.360]   Oh no bad.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:55.480]   It's so funny when you're when you sit in there and you got your phone plugged into your bag
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.800]   they really do give you a look they go.
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:02.200]   Please sir may I have some ampe my my ampere.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.200]   My ampere.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.760]   So jealous.
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:10.200]   Tim Cook continues on good actually I think this is a good question for one of the employees.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:15.360]   What do you consider to be apples biggest differentiator and what can employees do to
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.880]   foster and advance those efforts?
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.520]   We're making money and they ain't.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.400]   Yeah that's a good one.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:26.800]   But Tim didn't go there he said our greatest differentiator is our culture and our people
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:31.520]   they are the foundation by which everything else comes about.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:36.080]   You know by the way the way this is written is very colloquial and I could tell this is
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:40.960]   not something that was written by a P.D.R. department that Tim I would be willing to bet
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:49.080]   money was at the keyboard typing this as opposed to some PR because the some the grammar
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:54.160]   is a little awkward in certain places it's it's clearly it sounds like his voice it sounds
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.160]   like him.
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:46:00.360]   It's not that for me it's not the grammar the short effective sentences.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:04.720]   There isn't there isn't a lot of color to it it's always well no I mean no it's just
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:09.640]   no it's just everything I don't mean to be diagramming his sentences but they are the
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:15.320]   foundation by which everything else comes about would not be written in a press release
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:20.440]   I could tell you right now that's a little awkward but that's fine I want to be awkward
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:24.000]   because it means he wrote it without great people in a great environment that people
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.840]   can live in we wouldn't have intellectual property and again you probably wouldn't write we wouldn't
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.600]   have intellectual property.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:36.200]   I understand what he's saying but right we wouldn't have the best products we wouldn't
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:40.480]   have the inventions or features I mentioned earlier I think it's that change the world
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:46.520]   attitude and boldness that's deeply embedded in our culture that good isn't good enough
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:50.600]   all of this is fuel for everything else we do from a strategic point of view we can also
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:55.720]   focus on things where software hardware and services all come together and bring out the
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:59.560]   magic that only apple can okay that's a little bit of a bring out the magic is a little.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:02.080]   There's also no Oxford comma there's very bizarre.
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:08.240]   Right, software comma, you can't actually diagram the sentence.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.600]   I know you know how to diagram sentence?
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.320]   No but you would come on over and you could do it for me.
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:15.760]   I know let's go to the illustrator.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.640]   Well that is for Eagle so you can have the quarterback sack the comma.
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:19.640]   War.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.080]   Here's our career in a seat in here.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:25.480]   Eagle this is why you need touchscreen Tim or pencil support.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.360]   Imagine no touchcreens not about artists it's about teachers it's about you know people
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:33.520]   working in corporate it's about all of those things being able to do exactly what you're
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.520]   doing there.
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:37.880]   Yeah that's our secret sauce he says it shows up in a lot of different places and it's something
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:45.560]   that we look for in new employees that is what what are they looking for a new.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:49.120]   The value of the strength focus on things where software hardware and services come
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.880]   together and bring out the magic that only apple can.
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.700]   You can rarely see precise this is I really like this paragraph.
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:02.220]   You can rarely see precisely where you want to go from the beginning isn't that true right?
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:06.640]   In retrospect it's this feels like Tim and his personal philosophy.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:10.740]   In retrospect it's always written like that but it rarely is like that the fantastic thing
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:15.720]   about apple employees is they get excited about something and they want to know how it
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:19.060]   works what it will do what its capabilities are.
[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:23.860]   I think he's talking about autonomous vehicle I think he's talking about the car project
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:27.640]   here if they want to know about something in an entirely different industry.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.680]   Also the watch was like this.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:33.840]   They start pulling the string and see where it takes them.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:40.720]   Now I think in here we got to insert if they're Johnny I've otherwise they ask me first.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:46.560]   They're focused on their Tim is it okay if I pull your string yes go ahead they're focused
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.600]   more on the journey which enables so many great things to happen but I think that this
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:54.280]   does kind of this is an interesting and very important way for a company to be run is not
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:49:00.380]   it's not quarterly profit focused but let's find hey this is something interesting I think
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:04.640]   Google does this too this is something interesting let's dig drill deep on this and see if there's
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:09.720]   something here as opposed to you know give me the business plan first.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:13.720]   And I've talked to folks who used to work at Apple that say that they've gone through
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:17.680]   the entire process of developing whole products that they would die to have in their house
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:20.480]   and then all the sides there's no business for it and they turn it off.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.360]   Yeah by the way that's right doesn't say that we're going to bring it to market just
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.720]   as you have the chance to work on it.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:31.640]   Just in the past couple of years pulling that string on watch and fitness led to research
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.480]   kit and research kit led to care kit.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:40.560]   Now that I think is something that speaks to Tim Cook I don't think that speaks to customers
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.640]   particularly.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:48.760]   And maybe why the watch hasn't had a hasn't really become a category this is great but
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:52.560]   the customers really care about research kit and care kit I don't know.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.560]   Doctor's too.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.600]   Yeah that's sort of where he doesn't care about the ROI point of view.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.600]   Yeah yeah.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.600]   Making the better place.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.360]   We've got a ton of things on our roadmap that I can't talk about but I'm incredibly excited
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:06.400]   about the result of pulling that string okay you could drop the metaphor now and not being
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.800]   bound by the box.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.080]   So okay don't drop it yet.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:14.640]   Oh no it's the string that the string is bounding the box so when you pull the screen.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:19.320]   Oh so it's like it unties the big ball of the string it's tying the box together I get
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:20.320]   so many people.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:25.200]   I was in the room where they were Leo would have done the big box big big bucket cheese
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.200]   each.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:32.160]   Were you really you were in the big bucket cheese room and of course I was telling the
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:39.160]   two people I was with there was a big block of cheese that was available for everybody.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:43.160]   I promise it's the last one of those I'm going to do.
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:44.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.160]   Creator protects us.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.160]   Sickness.
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.200]   What kind of cheese Swiss?
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.200]   American.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.200]   American.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.200]   With so many things.
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:57.480]   But I do think I'm glad you called out the research kit and health kit and care kit.
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:03.840]   I think those are there it's if it's hard for me to sometimes see evidence of their we're
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:09.880]   here to make things that change the world statement of their commitment to that.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.040]   That's totally taken care of by health kit.
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:15.200]   This is this is no it's no small undertaking.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:19.120]   Yes there's a good business potential business model for it.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:22.880]   But this is the sort of stuff that saves lives and improves daily life.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:23.880]   So that's the point.
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.600]   I think it's the most important thing that Apple's doing right now.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:29.480]   Let me just all erase this box with the string.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.040]   It's a bad idea.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:34.040]   What is an eraser on your pen?
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:38.960]   Plus I honestly I think with the Patriots blocking I really don't think that your screen
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.360]   plays good.
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:47.200]   With so much especially with Bronco for the next seven weeks.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.200]   I mean.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.200]   Boom.
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.200]   Keep healthy.
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.200]   Boom.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.720]   You got your line here you go boom.
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:53.720]   It's like the quarterback.
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:54.720]   It's like the family.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:52:00.040]   With so many things that we've done we don't do it because there's a return a see look and
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:01.040]   return.
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.040]   Uh huh.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:04.240]   And return on investment.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:07.760]   We don't do it because we know exactly how we're going to use it.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:11.920]   This is that's it's like that that proves to me Tim wrote this right like with his own
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.800]   little pinkies.
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:17.640]   We do it because it's clear it's interesting and it might lead somewhere.
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.440]   I like that a lot.
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:22.640]   A lot of time it doesn't.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:27.480]   But many times at least somewhere where we had no idea in the beginning.
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:28.920]   Tim definitely wrote this paragraph.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:29.920]   That's a mess.
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:33.360]   But let me erase all that stuff.
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.600]   All right.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.360]   Um anyway it's nice.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.400]   That's why Tim doesn't want to do a touchscreen Mac.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:40.840]   You'll just use it to make fun of it.
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.200]   Right.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:47.360]   I have to say Tim don't you want to do that Tim don't you want to do it like that.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:48.360]   Come on Tim.
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.480]   He's doing it on his 30 inch iPad.
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:51.960]   Yes that's true.
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.960]   He probably has a 30 inch iPad doesn't he.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:58.760]   This is kind of this kind of is this is a 28 inch iPad really in some ways.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:04.520]   Um all right that's that's that's the that's the extent of Tim's pronouncements.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:09.960]   I do think that this is a nice thing for a CEO to do and I'd love to see see more of
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.560]   that.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:21.160]   Speaking of repatriating money of course you remember the EU has told Ireland there's
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:24.400]   a $14 billion fine.
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:30.960]   Uh Ireland you need to collect at least $13.6 billion in back taxes.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:38.120]   Uh Apple is appealing the appealed yesterday saying I think quite rightly the commission
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.880]   retroactively changed the rules.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:44.560]   We did everything in good faith and I just think this completely undermines the entire
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:50.200]   rule of law within a country for the tell to tell Ireland that you have to now go back
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:53.920]   into the past and charge someone for something that Ireland doesn't even believe in.
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:58.120]   It's one thing to say you have to change the rules in the future but it undermines every
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:04.600]   contract every rule that every country makes with other in the EU with corporations.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.360]   Um it's just it is it is absurd.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:12.640]   This is why you know the EU is having trouble keeping people you know in the fold is because
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:15.400]   they do things that are nuts like this.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:20.080]   Apple's statement said the EU quote took unilateral action and retroactively changed the rules
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:25.760]   disregarding decades of Irish tax law, US tax law as well as global consensus on tax
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:30.000]   policy that everyone has relied on.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:37.400]   Uh the US Treasury even said that the EU is making itself a Supra national tax authority
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.440]   that could threaten global tax reforms.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:47.240]   Um so uh you know I don't know how long it takes to resolve stuff like this but I bet
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:50.000]   it's a long time.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.560]   And even Ireland says we didn't give we didn't give Apple any favorable treatment.
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:55:01.640]   Um in fact they're accusing the EC of selectively targeting Apple.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:04.080]   Oh no maybe Apple's saying that.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:08.200]   Um so that's that's certainly possible.
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:12.960]   Uh Google too has to deal with a lot of stuff that is that's there are a lot of there are
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:18.440]   some anti-Apple laws internationally there are some anti-Google laws internationally uh
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:23.440]   what a kettle of fish they're stuck in.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:29.680]   The EU and Marguerite Vistiger who is the commissioner responsible for this told uh
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:36.200]   Ars Technica the commission will defend its decision in court.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.800]   So and I'm not and I'm not arguing about its merits about whether they should or shouldn't
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:41.000]   tax more or less.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   It's the fact that they're going back so far.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   You can't change.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   Yeah you can't change.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   That is just it is just crazy.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.600]   Yeah like it is just just no anyway.
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:52.400]   Well you can't make some environment where businesses can't make decisions.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:56.360]   Yeah you can't make it anyway.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:00.720]   I'm kind of stunned that you know people could be so stupid.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.720]   Sorry.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:07.240]   It's like it is just like people of authority could be just absolutely boneheaded.
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:12.760]   I mean it just it is like a new level of boneheadedness in the EU which is hard for them to you
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:13.760]   know surpass.
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:18.680]   One of their commissions insisted on destroying Internet Explorer long after Chrome and Firefox
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:20.080]   had been mostly damaged already.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.960]   I mean it's not always rational.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:29.440]   Yeah I came up with that crazy uh browser ballot which uh we didn't have here in the
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:33.120]   States but if you saw it if you're in the EU as you know when you first installed windows
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:37.400]   you had a choice of all these different weirdo browsers in the industry.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.600]   Nobody saw it because they were running Chrome.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.600]   Right.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:46.200]   And what we do see in the States all the time is the cookie banner that every European
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:51.200]   site has to put up saying hey we use cookies is that okay with you and uh talk about a
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:54.720]   worthless waste of energy and time.
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.360]   Yeah because it keeps coming back and it keeps coming back and it just it gets in the
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:02.640]   way of the coding involved the waste of users time and what does it accomplish.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.440]   It doesn't accomplish any cookies.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:10.400]   Well I would at least posit that it reminds people that these things exist exists and
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:15.640]   if that's not necessarily the good reason to have this in total I think it's good to remind
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:20.960]   people that by the way you are being observed when you are on the Internet maybe you should
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.960]   at least be aware of this.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:22.960]   It's not like that.
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.680]   That's first of January 2nd once a year.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:26.680]   The cookies are just persistent state.
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:32.120]   It's not uh it's not a it's not a it's like a website saving the page you are on or the
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.320]   product you bought or your password.
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:35.320]   Log in status.
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:36.320]   Yeah I don't.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.800]   That's that's one application of cookies.
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:43.000]   Whatever the application you use you still have to put this warning up and I think it scares
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   people unnecessarily.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.400]   I don't I don't buy it.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:48.880]   I don't frankly buy the cookies are that big a problem.
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:52.840]   Well cookies aren't aren't that big a problem but tracking is a big problem.
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:57.040]   Well let me let me let me let me refine what I was about to say.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.160]   I don't think cookie I don't think tracking is a problem.
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:04.760]   I think that not being aware that tracking exists is a problem.
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:09.920]   And that's when if I'm not saying that it's important that we have these cookie warnings
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:17.040]   up there but I can see at least one upside to it that if if how do you think a website
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:23.320]   preserves the fact that you have checked and dismissed the cookie warning with a cookie.
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:30.040]   I'm also tracking is done with JavaScript and tracking is used cookies anymore.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:36.200]   And there's you want to have fun on the web turn off all cookies and see how exciting
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:38.800]   the Internet can be.
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:41.760]   Every time you get to a page it's like the first time you ever saw it's like it gives
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:42.760]   a web Alzheimer's.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:43.760]   Who are you?
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:45.640]   Hi nice to see you.
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:46.640]   Did you ever been here?
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:48.840]   Resid to check out your card is after you my son.
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:53.800]   Check out your card is that yeah yeah you couldn't have a shopping cart without it.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:57.320]   Here's a here's a here's a much better deal on airline flights because we don't know we
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:59.520]   don't know that you're willing to pay more.
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:01.520]   Okay Andy.
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:02.520]   All right.
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:03.520]   Okay.
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.320]   Mark Gurman.
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:13.760]   How Apple alienated Mac loyalists even marks turning on Apple inside the company the once
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:17.120]   iconic computer is getting far less attention than it wants it.
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:20.040]   I'm guessing Tim was responding to this.
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:22.080]   This came out December 20th though.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:23.840]   So what is that was that today or yesterday?
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:26.920]   Yeah I think Tim did his thing before then before.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:27.920]   Okay.
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:35.960]   Mark does talk about different options that Apple considered including a gold Macbook Pro.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:39.600]   That would have been nice.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:43.560]   The company tried to create a longer lasting battery for the Macbook Pro.
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:51.440]   They wanted to use higher capacity battery packs shaped the inside of the laptop.
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:55.200]   The design would have boosted battery life in the run up to the Macbook Pro's plan debut
[00:59:55.200 --> 01:00:00.720]   this year the new battery failed a key test according to a person familiar with the situation
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:05.680]   rather than delay the launch and risk missing crucial holiday shopping season Apple decided
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:06.920]   to revert to an older design.
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:13.680]   You know probably after the note eight note seven debacle Apple was probably trying to
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:18.480]   do well and it's also a Macbook Pro is not the Chris the holiday shopping like there's
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:21.680]   pent up demand for that product whenever you release it the holiday shopping is usually
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:24.800]   the cheaper end but read on because it says the change
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:30.880]   required roping in engineers from other teams to finish the job meaning work on other Mac's
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:35.880]   languished the new laptop didn't represent a game chimming changing leap in battery performance
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.640]   and a software bug misrepresented the hours of power remaining they fixed that intent
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:46.480]   to to by removing the information about how many like that wasn't unique to the Macbook
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.000]   Pro that utilities been in need of people who try to get the utility fixed for years and
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.520]   this was just got at the attention it needed.
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:56.440]   Another sign the companies prioritize the iPhone mark Grumman continues Apple reorganized
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:01.640]   its software engineering department so there's no longer this really makes me sad a dedicated
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:07.160]   Mac operating system team there's just one team and most of them are iOS first giving
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:12.280]   people working on the iPhone and the iPad more power that explains where Sal went Sal
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:19.640]   so going I'm sure he was on that Mac team there's no automator or apple script on the
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:31.560]   iOS is it no no no anyway this is kind of confirms what we suspected I think when the
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:38.120]   company was developing the Mac the first 12 inch Macbook Apple tested two primary prototypes
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:44.520]   one known internally as stealth fighter was lighter a second slightly less ambitious
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:51.400]   design notice stealth bomber was heavier as you know we got the lighter model but with
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:54.280]   engineers developing it might have been called MacBook stealth that was one of the names they
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:58.440]   were still if I like it but with engineers developing and testing two competing concepts
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.000]   they had less time to figure out how to cram all the electronics into a thin slab of aluminum
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.800]   and as a result they shipped as much as a year late or months late anyway in 2015 for the
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:15.400]   2016 Macbook update some Apple engineers wanted to add touch ID would have been nice a second
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:24.840]   port which we've all asked for instead we got rose gold anyway this is actually a depressing
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:29.080]   article I'm not going to read anymore because this is the new happy Mac break weekly so I mean
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:33.640]   Mark has excellent excellent sources of information but what you do with that information
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:37.560]   like different people will draw different conclusions from it and Mark paints a picture that's absolutely
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.600]   supported by his data but it's also different than some of the other conclusions there's
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:45.720]   interpretation involved yes yes and again I've heard that there's quite a lot of attention on
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:51.720]   on Mac and Mac design and stuff lately and some of these decisions some of these decisions are
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:56.680]   like the timing is right about the holidays but also if Apple delayed the Macbook Pro to the spring
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:00.520]   they have to deal with everyone saying oh there was no MacBook Pro released in 20 like all of these
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:04.040]   are judgment calls that when you're running a product decision you have to make if the balance
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:12.440]   he does talk about the Mac Pro this the tube and says it was very it was darn difficult to make
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:17.320]   and then for political reasons they decided to make it in America in Texas
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:26.200]   and three years on some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving it back to Asia
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:31.480]   where it would be cheaper and frankly the skill set would be there to make a product as
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:38.680]   complicated with as much sophisticated machining and and materials work but I have a feeling
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:43.880]   that with our new president that would be even more difficult politically right
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:49.080]   it would be a firecracker yeah I mean that's just gonna that would give I could see the tweets
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:53.480]   already Apple moves jobs out of America yeah should be going to the direction yeah
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:04:01.400]   exactly well they're very good and then something about failing Apple and stupid or dumb
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:07.160]   boycott yeah well actually that's kind of a consideration we've seen now twice that
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:13.480]   issues it's a huge consideration no it's not it's not just oh well going in law
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:18.680]   public back I exactly there someone makes one tweet and suddenly you will lose about 18 million
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:25.560]   18 billion dollars in value a good billion and then stock market in place also it's I can't
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:30.920]   am I it's I'd be very it's very very interesting to consider all the different strategic thinking
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:36.120]   this going on about how to interface with this new version of the White House is coming in January
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:43.960]   german does say that they're considering putting the touch bar on stand-alone keyboard which the
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:48.680]   number of people have asked for he says Apple decide whether to release these based on how
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:55.320]   well the features do on the macbook pro this is the sad thing mac fans shouldn't hold their breath
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:02.600]   for a radical new design in 2017 though instead the company is preparing modest updates USB
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:09.480]   C ports a new AMD graphics processor for the iMac and minor bumps in processing power for the
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:15.800]   12 inch MacBook and MacBook Pro and once again what do we not see in this list the mac mini
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:21.000]   or the Mac Pro some of the stuff like we've known for a while that like it's been widely
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.600]   speculated for a while that the MacBook Pro was supposed to ship a wwdc and it didn't and they
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.800]   got it out when they could but you know if they'd waited longer they would have had more in it
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:32.360]   and the iMac was probably scheduled to ship this fall and that's the bump that it gets you have
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:37.240]   the iMac it's already running skylake you if cable is ready you get that in there but USB C
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:41.480]   and Thunderbolt 3 is what you're betting your future on so you put those like Apple the very
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:44.840]   logical company when you look at it especially in hindsight you see the decisions that they make are
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:49.000]   defined by the products that are available technologies that are available and what their
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.320]   market wants from them and that's the iMac we were always going to get the iMac update we're
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.840]   always going to get so i'm not sure if it's depressing or not it's the next iteration of iMac
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:00.840]   until there is a radical new design and what their radical design isn't really theory yet
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:05.640]   i'm hoping they're not as radical as the mac pro macbook pro no it's not it's but that's a thing
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.920]   right like if they just back up it we're disappointed and if they change something major we're just
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:14.600]   a minute i mean i still think that if they left the you know if they left the left side of the of
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:19.240]   the macbook pro alone and just put usb c's on the right side everyone would have been like like
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:24.600]   literally 90 percent of the upset would have been gone and done a big and done a big cpu and speed
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:28.360]   upgrade yeah just upgrade that everyone would have been like that's great and then the next one
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:35.880]   they can do something except they could leave our our um mag adapter alone um but um it's uh but
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:40.280]   anyway but the uh but but i think that you know a little bit more of a progression between hard
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:42.920]   pieces of hardware and i think that one of the reasons they're jumping so much is because they're
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:46.600]   not planning to update it anytime soon so they're gonna do whatever they're gonna do and then that
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:50.920]   they're not going to touch the macbook pro form for another three or four years
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:57.560]   the spaceship launches next year we're going to talk a little bit more about that and uh well
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:01.560]   we got lots of little tidbits and if you're of course your picks of the week coming up in a bit
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:08.680]   but first a word from pearl did you know that rearview cameras are going to soon be mandatory on all
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:14.360]   new cars i think that's really a good thing uh but if you don't have a rearview because believe me
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:20.360]   if i i can no longer drive a car i can't park if i don't have a rearview camera i can't
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:26.200]   i literally can't uh i'm so hooked on my rearview camera but maybe you have an older car that doesn't
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:33.000]   have a rearview camera i've got a great solution for you rear vision from pearl auto it's the easiest
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   to install it's the best because it has two cameras it's a camera frame that goes around your license
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.320]   plate if you can install a license frame like frame you can install this and then you see it has
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:48.680]   that uh obd two port adapter that you plug in and you mount your phone on your dashboard event they
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:54.600]   have the mounts for you put the pearl app on your ios device or your android device and now you're
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:08:02.040]   going to get two ht cameras rearview cameras including audio and visual alerts to help you
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:05.960]   drive there's one that you can see directly what's behind you and then there's a wide angle one
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:13.080]   that lets you effectively see around corners now every time i we live in petalim a lot of people
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:20.440]   with pickup trucks and SUVs a lot of soccer moms whenever i park i can't see oncoming traffic
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:27.080]   i can't and i'm a little gun shy because i've been hit uh by cars pulling out from uh you know
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:33.640]   blind parking spaces so this is so awesome to be able to look at your rearview and see cars coming
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:40.040]   basically see around corners night night vision as well as day vision the camera frame is solar
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:44.440]   powered so you don't have to do anything to wire it for for power it gets its power from the sun
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:48.360]   uh bluetooth again to your phone and that's great
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:54.680]   tony install it we uh you know tony has an older a bmw beautiful bmw is tricked to that beautifully
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:09:02.680]   hachini or hachini but uh but he didn't have a rearview camera 10 minutes he had it set up
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:09.400]   and loves it loves it and and uses the magnetic there's a couple of different ways you can
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:13.880]   mount it but he used the magnetic vent mount has a pivot ball joint and holds your
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:18.760]   holds basically holds your rearview uh right there where where it would be in a car equipped
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:23.240]   with rearview and we've got a special deal of course we always try to negotiate these deals
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:34.280]   with the uh advertisers here $50 off at pearlauto.com/twit this would be a really good gift
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:41.000]   for a teen you know often we give teens the hand me down cars the cars without the rearview camera
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.880]   who needs a rearview camera more than a teen i can tell you right now it'll save you money in
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:59.720]   the long run trust me it's very very clever very good pearlauto.com/twit pearlauto.com/twit for 50 bucks
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:06.040]   off good holiday gift this is a very expensive show for me i just want to say i know it always is
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:13.320]   i i almost always buy your guys picks right but i needed a new i needed a new bag i know i
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:19.080]   know camera oh we pick our advertisers carefully i know but but don't listen to the next ad because
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:24.280]   then you'll be buying a new house i am buying new house oh then listen to the next ad yeah there
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:30.360]   we go all right i'm really disappointed by this uh but it's not the end of the world but a florida
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:37.480]   court has now ruled that we always thought that a password in your mind was protected
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:44.280]   uh by the unlawful right uh the right against unlawful search and seizure but a court in florida
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:52.360]   says that investigators can compel a suspect to reveal his iphone passcode
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:59.560]   uh guy was uh i mean creep i don't think it's just your main of the issue i mean he's a creep
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:07.320]   he was doing up skirt photos with his iphone um in the past uh most courts have ruled that a
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:14.120]   fingerprint can be compelled but because you have a right not to testify against yourself it's not
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:20.200]   unlawful search or seizure so right to not self incriminate uh you should not be compelled to
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:26.280]   give up a password that would be self-incrimination um but the florida court of appeals second district
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:33.640]   has said nope um this is the fifth amendment uh right against self-incrimination not the
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:39.640]   fourth amendment i always get that wrong uh judge black uh referred to a famous supreme court decision
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:46.120]   doe versus us 1988 in which supreme court justice paul stevens wrote that a defendant could be made
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:54.040]   to surrender a key to a strong box containing incriminating documents because it's physical
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:59.640]   but could not be compelled to reveal the combination of a wall safe this was a hypothetical uh on the
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:05.720]   part of justice stevens judge black kind of descended we question whether identifying the
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:10.200]   key which will open the strong box such that the key is surrendered is in fact distinct
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:16.760]   from telling an officer the combination to the safe in other words he disagreed with the supreme
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:21.800]   court more importantly we question the continuing viability of any distinction and this is the key
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:29.720]   here as technology advances so he's saying in effect hey since 1988 technology has changed and so
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:33.720]   we don't think that you the fifth amendment protects you against giving up your password
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:37.960]   eff disagreed i think they got it wrong said mark ronalda staff attorney
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:42.520]   not the first time it's come up in courts i think other courts have done a better job of
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:47.000]   evaluating the fifth amendment and the constitutional rights that are at stake
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:52.920]   and then this one will probably go all the way to the supreme court i hope so yeah and i think that
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:57.080]   the current makeup i think would probably uh turn it down
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:01.640]   depending on what the issue really is it's to prevent
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:08.280]   the state from doing you know essentially torturing you it in confessions out of you
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:13.480]   getting confessions out of you in also you know that you have the right not to self-incriminate
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:19.560]   i think that one thing that apple should add is a is a feature called an auto kill
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:24.440]   that is basically another code that you put in that just wipes the phone out wow you know i think
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:27.400]   that then you could be held in contempt i don't know if that would necessarily
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:33.160]   no i don't think you would do it now i don't think you do it now but i think that like for instance
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:37.800]   if you're if you're in a situation where you know and this there's a variety of situations you know
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:44.120]   there's there's a variety there's companies for instance that when you leave the united states
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:53.480]   if if they take your laptop away from you you need to the company policy is to never take it back
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:57.400]   so if they take it out of your site if they touch it you know open it start typing on it
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.720]   they literally don't want the computer back so you upload everything to the cloud you you know
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:05.400]   you typically make sure you don't have anything on it that's sensitive you write it out with zeros
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:10.040]   and then you basically you know if everything goes fine then you have your computer but if
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:16.680]   if if tsa or a foreign group takes it away from you you immediately you say you don't want to back
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:21.560]   and because they're you know these are obviously technology companies that are very concerned about
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:28.600]   espionage and so the in the other side of that is if you're in a situation where you could feel
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:32.040]   like you're in a position that you're going to be in trouble you could literally just you know
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:36.360]   type in a code and it just wipes it out you know there's not a lot of work to be done to uh to
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:40.200]   reset the camera you know reset it and it's not just for criminals it's for people protecting
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:49.560]   themselves from the government yeah i don't i'm signing with the eff on this partly because it's
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:58.680]   you you get the president by saying well this this person has the most uh let's not listen
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:02.840]   let's not ruin the the the flavor of the show by saying this sort of evidence is on this phone but
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:07.720]   yeah the sort of thing where it's there we just need to get rid of this guy yeah we need it we need
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:14.280]   and this is someone who needs to be gotten rid of uh but then it becomes like uh we see a lot of
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:20.760]   misapplications of uh of warrants where uh court can get a warrant based on uh you're supposed to
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:24.440]   say here is what we're looking for here is why we need to get it here's the person that we're
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:29.480]   trying to get from and we've had situations where an issue a warrant has been issued we will be able
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:35.160]   to tell you exactly why we needed this warrant once we see what we get from after executing this
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:40.120]   warrant we've had warrants that have been executed on a house so that anybody who happens to be inside
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:44.760]   the house has to turn over their phones and uh and collect evidence that way and that's the
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:50.520]   leads things stack up on each other however i got i have to admit that i am bothered by the
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:57.640]   it is it is a different world than today than it was in 1988 where uh there was a time where
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:04.920]   the fifth amendment meant that if i know that i was if i know that i was there in the room and i held
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:09.080]   a gun this person said and i pulled the trigger and i killed this person i can't be compared i have
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:13.080]   the option of saying i've refused to answer that question you can't be forced to confess but
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:19.640]   and also but and also you can't be forced to perger yourself by but you can't put yourself in put
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:25.160]   someone in a situation where you will get a conviction based on just uh based on that kind of trickery
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:31.880]   this is different though where it's like uh if i keep all of my stuff on my phone and on my computer
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:40.120]   imagine have the the password interferes with the ability to collect evidence of any kind because
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:46.280]   essentially it's it can be uh it's it's it's it's absolutely unobtainable by any means remember that
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:51.400]   the difference between getting the combination to the safe and getting a key to the safe is that
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:57.560]   do i do i compel you to get give me the key in which i put the key in the lock i and i lock it
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:02.760]   or do you refuse to give me the combination by which means we get out the we call the fire department
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:07.640]   we got that huge disc saw and we saw it open and we still get that evidence uh that doesn't mean
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:13.240]   that i stood that i'm not uh that i think this was a good idea again i still i side with the AFF but
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:19.240]   i predict that it's something that i'm going to become more bothered with as time goes by
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:24.600]   where it's now not possible to get collect evidence of any kind and investigate any crime
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:31.240]   because it's behind a password that a person has the legal right not to divulge i think i do i
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:36.360]   just think it's the sort of thing where we have decided to be we've decided to be a society where
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:42.040]   we give people freedom we give people more power than the government has over that person
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:46.200]   and we are going to have to be okay with the idea of having fewer convictions on certain crimes
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:52.040]   uh and i hope that people have the determination to say okay we this principle is worth uh letting
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:57.320]   a few guilty people go free for although you have to consider what they're doing in the uk
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:07.400]   to solve this they're jumping suspects to get the phone uh so uh one thing that was interesting
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:12.040]   amelio's for the first time when i flew back from actually from from petaluma i saw people
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:15.720]   turning off touch id before they went through custom oh interesting and then turning it back on
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:20.440]   afterwards and i used to never see that and now i've seen it a couple times they're aware of it yeah
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:24.920]   and the one thing is we have we have legal precedent for privilege like there is that there's of course
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:28.840]   legal privilege and clerical privilege but also spousal privilege where we've decided that the
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:33.960]   relationship between uh uh between two spouses is so close that we don't want to compel testimony
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:37.640]   from one or the other and there could be an argument made for a digital privilege where we
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:42.040]   decided that these devices are now digitally assisted memory that they're the closest thing we have
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:46.520]   two extra ram for our brains and we're just going to declare that this is privileged information
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:50.200]   and where and then you can't jump somebody for the device it's still on the device whether they
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:55.560]   have it or not and that's going to be a huge moral and ethical decision to make but there will be a
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:59.880]   time when these things and eventually we'll get to implants where these things have such real-time
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:04.520]   private information about us that it simply cannot be treated like a normal object or a safe or
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:08.920]   anything else that we've experienced before yeah and the other aspect is this is something that a
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:14.600]   lot of people in a lot of different uh situations in America are confronting right now there are
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:20.440]   things that you're okay with so long as you trust the current political climate but then you realize
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:25.400]   that oh well we've been handing there there are people who were in the field of immigration that
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:31.400]   have been handing information over saying well we're we our policy is to try to find a way to give
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:39.480]   a undocumented uh what they call it illegal immigrant or undocumented worker uh i know that's that
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:44.680]   could be a contentious thing i don't want to get into that but uh if you turn over this information
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:52.680]   to us we will we will we we want to give you a way to become a legal and legal resident of
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:57.480]   our an acknowledged resident of the country we you be moved here you've raised kids here your kids
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:02.600]   or citizens we're going to we don't want to break up families we don't want to lose a hard worker or
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:06.840]   a hard contributing citizen we will give you a path to that and there are a lot of people that are
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:12.360]   now i wish i had not given that information to to local government because that now could be
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:17.080]   handed to here's a list of people that need to be rounded up to suite as soon as new people come
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:23.320]   into these positions so as it becomes a thornier and thornier issue because you don't want to be
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:31.080]   that person who says i i'm not going to i'm i'm going to now take my i-pot out of out of mothballs
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:35.640]   because now whenever i enter a public place where i think they're going to be hundreds if not thousands
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:42.040]   of people i want to switch off my phone but still be able to watch uh to watch videos and listen to
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:47.480]   music and read books but on the other hand you don't want to be looking back eight years to
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:51.320]   this up the decisions that you didn't really think about it years ago and realize that your life
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:55.400]   would be a lot better right now if you would been a lot more careful a lot more uh... what more
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:21:00.120]   sisters and paranoid here we go from uh... wired magazine
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:04.120]   uh... the electronic frontier foundation
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:12.760]   has released a for bought rather i should say a full-page ad related to this topic your threat
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:19.000]   to the technology community your threat model just changed asking and suggesting that the uh...
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:25.320]   technology community scrub their logs you cannot be made a serende data you do not have
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:30.440]   use end-to-end encryption and h t t p s for every user transaction communication and activity by
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:35.320]   default if you get a government request to monitor users or sensor speech tell the world
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:38.520]   and fight for user rights in court and capital hill on beyond
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:42.280]   and and this is in response to the election of donald trump
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:45.560]   i'm thinking this might be a little hysterical but
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:49.640]   well a lot of things are changing we already have apple and google another
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:54.840]   top tier uh... companies saying that look we will not for help uh... any government
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:59.800]   compile we will not help the the trump government compile a list of muslims that need to
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:03.080]   in the world make a database national database national database although the
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:06.280]   trump campaign denies that they want a database so
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:11.880]   this is it's one of those things he did he did on the other hand i did the research
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:17.080]   a year ago during the campaign say yes we will create a database of muslims
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:22.360]   he has since retracted that uh... and it feels like the tech community
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:26.440]   is i mean i don't know we had a lot of national security letters really previous
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:30.040]   administrations that's exactly right i mean if frankly i would describe your
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:33.080]   logs eight years ago i would not like a administration
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:37.080]   yeah at this point a particularly if this person has already said this is what i
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:41.000]   want to do this is this is why i was truly deeply this is why i'm deeply deeply
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.760]   deeply concerned about first amendment issues is why i'm deeply deeply concerned
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:49.240]   about live laws that let's not what he was serious about what he was just
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:53.240]   seemed like a good thing to say at the time but it's about regardless of all that
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:56.360]   it's significant that they're preemptively saying no we are
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:00.600]   okay if if the if the united states asks us to help them create this database we
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.400]   are preemptively saying we will not be involved in that
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:08.040]   and that is essentially be starting the starting the process of
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:13.800]   drawing that line in the sand saying we we we do business in america we require
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:16.600]   these so the government for a lot of the stuff that we do
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:19.400]   we would like the government to help us do things better and
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:23.560]   probably however that meet however we are not going to do things that we
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:28.040]   simply will not do uh and i agree especially with google it
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:31.000]   especially google and apple they will not negotiate away that these are
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.720]   things though that uh to bernay's point they should be doing and they should
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:39.320]   have been doing all along and it may be it may be there's potential for it to
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:43.800]   get worse uh trump has made campaign promises that
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:48.600]   uh would cause some to worry about mass surveillance and
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:53.000]   so forth this is this is a good big opportunity for apple too i mean
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.440]   there's so many dimensions idea of personal privacy i have to admit that
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:00.680]   a year or two ago i really i was certainly thinking of well of course
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:03.640]   you don't want the you want to be private against uh government
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:07.640]   agencies as well i but i thought that was way way down the list but
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:12.200]   i am one of these people who's now thinking maybe maybe i want
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:15.480]   google to be really really proactive in saying that
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:21.000]   here is how hard here is how little information we actually retain about
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.520]   our customers and so we are we are ensuring you that there is
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:28.440]   we do not have any information of value to hand over
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:32.280]   to and over zealous uh and i'm talking about the national administration i'm
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.200]   talking about local administrations that simply want to get things done very
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:40.280]   very quickly and easily by simply saying hey we don't have
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:44.040]   the we this not technically we don't have the legal power to power you to
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:47.640]   do to uh to require you to do this however we're asking you to hand over
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:50.440]   this permission because we think would be very very handy
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:54.520]   to apply machine learning against a huge database of information
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:58.840]   uh to figure out where we need send services and where we need to
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:01.720]   ignore services
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:09.800]   uh let's see new screen savers for the apple tv
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:14.920]   do buy greenland lus angeles and more i haven't we seen a china uh a shang
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:17.720]   high rebasing when we're i thought that was going to be at least
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:21.480]   number six on the list yeah well they're these are so beautiful
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:24.440]   so well done they are one of the apple tv on all the time
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:27.240]   i would love to see a documentary about how any of these are made because
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:32.040]   there are times where i really do wonder like how uh i think that i can see
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:35.800]   like a great great way to filter on some of the sunset
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:40.120]   ones but how do i think any of these beautiful pictures
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:44.120]   just there's no there's no fault no in study photographers well i asked
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:48.680]   Vincent LaFoure because you know he did a book of aerial uh photography which is
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:52.520]   beautiful and he's done drone and helicopter shots
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:58.520]   and he was very cagey and i got the strong sense that apple doesn't want
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:03.240]   anybody to know or who did it it's all in d8 it's all in d8 yeah
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:07.800]   so he he was able to say that he had he had advised apple but he wasn't able
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:12.120]   to say much more so uh and i know i think y'all excelency knows a little bit
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:15.000]   about that kind of thing that you know these companies don't they want
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.240]   the preserve the magic yeah yes but i agree i'd love to know it
[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:22.040]   because everything's easy yeah they do yeah so it's not
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:24.040]   yeah
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:31.480]   um niantic decided not to do an apple watch app for pokimongo you must be
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:34.280]   in tears rene richie totally not sure well i mean so
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:37.080]   nine to five mac is a highly respected outlet i they do
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:40.680]   were fantastic work they're incredible news organization
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:44.280]   uh but this i i have heard the exact opposite of this from people who
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:49.960]   are in every position to know so the the story from jordan con is that and we
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:53.080]   knew niantic was doing its own band right
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:56.600]   uh they did i mean they made pokimongo plus which is a band that you wear
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:59.400]   it's already available in the monday is it available
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:02.360]   yeah it's been available for a month i've seen ads for it i just never saw
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:06.120]   anybody wearing one uh and every time i tried to order one i couldn't
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:08.920]   until i didn't care anymore it's the same thing you look at twitter it's
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:11.320]   like it's available at best but i get it now or it's available at game stop
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:16.440]   get it now but you're saying that that that is not
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:19.880]   a reason for not doing an apple watch app and in fact they're still gonna do it
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:22.840]   might well i mean the the original story from nine to five and again their
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:25.720]   phenomenal news organization they could well have better information than i do
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:28.200]   on this was that uh niantic had canceled it
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:32.040]   uh and so i started asking around and people that are that are
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:35.480]   again every position to know and they may not actually have it running right now
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:39.960]   said that no no it exists it's scheduled uh and my understanding is that it was
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:43.080]   just a non-trivial app to make and that's because they didn't just make a
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:46.920]   version of pokimongo for the apple watch it's tied into the workout system so
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:50.120]   that if you want to use it you will get credit for the exercise like that all
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:52.280]   you're using it but more importantly it's tied into
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:56.360]   health kit and the health kit isn't it is apple's most
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:59.960]   complex privacy system because it's got bi-directional privacy and they're
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:02.280]   incredibly careful about what sort of information
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:05.880]   leaks out of out of health kit and normally that's not a problem because
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:09.240]   again it's for like maybe like a blood sugar meter and they want to make sure
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:12.280]   that your insurance company doesn't learn that you may or may not even own
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:15.640]   a blood sugar meter but in this case it's just because it's using that as a
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:18.280]   sink they still have to go through all the privacy hoops
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:21.160]   and fine tune that and they want to make sure it's a really great experience
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:24.280]   because when the original pokimongo launched a bunch of servers went down it
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:28.440]   wasn't the best first one experience so suffice it to say that there's a lot of
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:32.760]   people on both sides working really hard and I think there's two things to sort
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:36.440]   of show this the one is that nantec themselves might only tweet it saying
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:40.600]   all systems are go and it's coming soon and then a new version of pokimongo
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:45.240]   came out yesterday on android today on ios that has apple watch code in it
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:48.440]   and that i think is a really good indicator that it's that it's in progress
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:52.680]   only rene cares that deeply about all of this but we thought we thought we
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:56.920]   mentioned it's a phenomenally successful mobile
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:03.160]   okay it also points to it also i love it i'm not i'm just it's
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:06.920]   it's but it's a good example of sometimes we think that apple is
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:10.440]   screwing up because they're not doing this when it's so obvious or sometimes
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:13.720]   as apple fans oh why can't someone does this other company
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:17.320]   do this thing that's so obviously working with apple oftentimes there are these
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:20.440]   little tiny details that you would not know unless you're working inside this
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:24.520]   industry uh about here's what you here's what we have to do as soon as we
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:28.440]   as soon as we put health information in here here's everything we have to do
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:33.800]   uh someone who had as someone who when my when my dad was in long-term
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:38.120]   nursing care said i want to put i will i will donate my time
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:42.440]   hardware and services to add an entire separate wi-fi network
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:46.920]   to so that visitors to the facility even long after i've reason to come here
[01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:50.440]   can you know use facebook and and then so the patients can Skype with other
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:52.840]   people because i got to know the staff pretty well
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:55.560]   and i was in meeting after meeting after meeting where
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:58.920]   again no no complaints about the bureaucracy it was here's
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:01.800]   we want to make this happen here's what we have to do to make this happen
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:05.320]   and it wasn't to not it wasn't just the idea of having to
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:08.920]   have a totally separate network that could not in any way be on this
[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:10.920]   the network of medical information is being
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:14.920]   transacted but it has to be established that there is not possible for there to
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:18.840]   be crossover between these two things and so like like it's just this is
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.240]   something that i'd like to keep in mind for my
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:24.200]   whenever i'm like jeez why is apple not doing this or
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:28.280]   god why can't google do this it's apple sometimes there are just reasons that
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:32.280]   are absolutely obvious if you're inside this inside
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:35.960]   oh but if you're outside the shell you just think oh these people have a clue
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:40.760]   so nine to five does say that that that this doesn't mean that there won't be a
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:43.480]   watch benefit they refer to that tweet you refer to
[01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:47.000]   rene and say nyanics now in the hook to liver but
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.040]   that they were saying that they were gonna nyanic was going to do this
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:55.400]   the next plus ingress band first for ingress then for pokemon go
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:31:01.400]   with collectible mods related to the various games
[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:04.360]   everybody wants hardware profits hardware profits are really really
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:07.320]   delicious for a lot of companies but they come with their own sort of
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:11.160]   headaches and i think it's it's sort of a win-win if they get the apple
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:14.120]   watch Jordan concludes his article saying ultimately nyanic could
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:18.520]   both ship the pokemon go apple watch app and it's ingress wearable
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:21.640]   but this behind the scenes decision making is whether those led to questions
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:24.360]   about the apple watch app and again this is a follow-up article their first
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:27.160]   article a couple days ago said it was canceled okay
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:30.680]   okay so i think they might have better information like they might have it
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:33.960]   might actually be canceled and people i know just haven't heard about it but
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:36.680]   as far as i can tell and as far as what nyanic is saying
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:42.120]   uh and as far as p i it's all systems go are you playing super mario run
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:46.200]   oh sure yeah absolutely sure
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.480]   the highest grossing and i'm not sure they're having a car give it to my
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:54.680]   do my running for me that's that's much better than pokemon go as far as i'm
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:57.080]   concerned yeah it just does it and you just everyone
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:01.720]   so while you hop around um actually it's free but it's not really because you
[01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:04.440]   only get three levels correct me if i'm wrong ryanne because
[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:08.040]   yes i play three levels and then it said that'll be ten bucks if you wanted
[01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:10.680]   yeah it's a i mean that this is a sort of thing where you
[01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:13.480]   you again you can't win and part of that is apple's fault and part of that is
[01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:16.360]   our fault and part of that is just the that apps are a commodity now there's
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:20.600]   there's no scarcity for apps anymore there's just hundreds of millions of
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:24.040]   them and we don't value them the way that we use to value a nintendo cartridge
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:27.480]   or a box of photoshop because if we don't want to pay it we'll just go get
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:30.200]   the next free demo and have ten minutes of one with that it doesn't really
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:32.520]   matter does but nintendo didn't want to do the
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:36.040]   in-app purchase where you buy like you you pay money to get mario back on the
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:38.920]   maze faster or you get a different color hat or something yeah thank they
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:42.840]   wanted to do yeah well actually they are doing that though because
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:48.680]   you can buy decorations right that's all well there's no there's no
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:51.720]   there's a one-time in-app purchase that unlocks there's a ten dollar and
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:55.160]   end purchase yeah but then there is a store where you can buy
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:58.200]   other stuff for your yeah that's all in-game though i mean that you just
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.920]   collect a little coins and you don't buy it with money you don't know there's no
[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:04.280]   pay to win okay yeah there's no pay to win but a lot of people
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:07.480]   played the first three levels and then got that ten dollar
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:10.840]   you know upgrade and they went to apple store and they said this is the worst
[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:13.800]   game in the history of games i give it one star because i can't give it
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:16.280]   like they need a commune more clearly this is a demo
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:19.960]   if you want to play the game was called sonic the hedgehog yeah right
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:24.200]   yeah uh and then others are you know uh if and done complained yesterday he
[01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:27.640]   said well you don't get to do anything it runs all you have to all you can do
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:30.520]   is jump and there's various jumping you can do long
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:35.320]   holder double tap and so forth i found it pretty fun actually
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:38.680]   the the big disappointment for me and we talked about this last week
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:41.000]   is it's not you can't play unless you're online
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.240]   which means i can't play it on an airplane
[01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:46.360]   which is extremely frustrating yeah
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:49.960]   yeah that's all right i got the new field runners and i had the same problem
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:53.480]   where they're doing that too well the new the new one i guess had
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:58.120]   um it i know i just know that i i got on the flight and i started taking off
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:01.160]   and i was like okay i'm ready to play and then i was like i can't get i can't
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:03.560]   get it well maybe you have to download
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:07.800]   content i don't yeah i don't know so this is field runners attack you're
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:11.160]   talking about and i haven't played it yet i've been but i like you you got me
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:14.040]   started on field runners i love field runners
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:17.800]   um and this is the new field runners which is how is it different it's
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:22.200]   field runners is a tower defense game that we just love it looks like it i
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:27.400]   haven't gotten to play it yet because i play game like on so um so the uh
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:31.960]   oh it's kind of clash of plans meets field runners is what it is
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:38.920]   oh too bad so i think that it requires that that and so it's uh my uh yeah
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:43.080]   my solitary i just went back to the old field runners by the way talk about
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:47.000]   in that purchases this is one of them gym games
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.160]   and the more gems you have the more fun the game will be
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:54.120]   whenever i see a gem you know what's interesting is i find that the old
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:57.720]   field runners uh the field runners too is actually a
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:00.600]   for me i mean i've spent a fair amount of money on it
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:03.480]   i mean i'm not massive amounts how do you spend money on it
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:06.760]   well you can buy more of the little points that you need to buy the
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:08.760]   things that you want to play during the game
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:12.760]   which is what what i like about it is is that you just um
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:17.480]   you you can definitely play the entire thing and play all of it all the way
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:19.960]   through i did i didn't even know you could buy something
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:23.080]   right and so you can but but you know the the gold that you get for each of
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:26.520]   those games you can go buy 20 000 of those you know instead of instead of
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:29.640]   earning them right um and so you know and i i earned a lot of
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:32.120]   them and i didn't i was very stingy and then i
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:36.440]   um i got into one level and i started you know i just but i just paid you know
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:38.760]   i just bought 20 dollars worth of them and then it's called it a day and then
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:42.040]   that's lasted me like a year so so it's been you know it's been
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:44.440]   because you know you win some back you get them and it's all
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:47.800]   and but but it just being part of that currency to kind of pick it up
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:51.960]   um you know they definitely got some money out of me um to to do that but
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:55.480]   without it being this thing that stopped me from playing
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:58.120]   which i think i think the model was was actually pretty good
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:00.440]   and i haven't looked at the new one enough to know
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:05.000]   so um i am not of the proper generation to judge
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.880]   super mario run not having played mario in my youth
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:13.880]   it was my first like i didn't get the pong in the atari and the division
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:16.680]   generation yeah but i had the super i had the nintendo entertainer system
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:19.800]   super nintendo the game boy all those things i grew up with almost every mario
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:23.320]   game and uh this this just to me as a mario game like
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:27.640]   the nintendo is so good at melding the the controls of the device to the
[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:31.400]   experience of the game and sort of this feels like it's not the mario game
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:33.880]   that you're used to with the buttons and the jumping and the running all you
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:37.160]   could just jump yeah but i mean they really nailed that
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:40.360]   experience and it makes me i i just wish so much that they would make mfi and
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:43.480]   nintendo controllers because that's the experience holding that game pad and
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:46.920]   then their apps on the apple tv and that's that's hundreds of millions of people
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:50.200]   that they are on an ipad that's hundreds of millions of people who could still
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:53.800]   buy nintendo hardware those controllers and just play those don't even make the
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:56.920]   new stuff keep the new stuff on the switch but put out like everything from
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:01.640]   donkey kong to super mario brothers it's super mario world just have that i
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:05.000]   am so waiting for the nintendo classic edition
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.240]   to after ever i hope they wake more of them because that's i real that's the
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:12.040]   first game's console i've been super super excited
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:16.280]   to act alone and it's not it's not just nostalgia some of it is that
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:19.720]   just like you'll you'll i'm willing to i'm willing to pay to see any movie that
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:24.040]   harris before to zen because i just like him and the character he plays
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:28.360]   and sometimes i get to see the new mario let's see what mario is up to right now
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:32.520]   so yeah because i was i was the sort of person who had to stop and had to put
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:38.120]   it take the batteries out of his gameboy because i could hear this music when i
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:43.880]   put it when i wear closed eyes so it's maybe a fan it's it's it's a different
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:47.880]   game but it's very similar i mean you still have to save princess buttercup
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:50.840]   or whatever her name is and since peach yeah i mean that's there was a little
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:53.240]   bit of pushback on that because a lot of people say we're all the generation
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:56.600]   now we're mario and peach should both be an option from the get go okay
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:00.200]   whatever and then uh yeah i love the you know it's got the sounds somebody though
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:02.920]   i have to say somebody in the chat room last yesterday when i was talking about
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:06.680]   it said leo you clearly know nothing about nintendo
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:10.680]   so the sound was great i mean the music is great i thought it's great he's his
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:16.280]   mario it's all things there it's got it's it's the level of crest i think nintendo
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:20.120]   that has game designers that are as good at what they do as apple's designers
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:24.600]   are at what they do they're just so well done and the music that's in these
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:30.040]   games the the mario theme it's you if you go to youtube and just look for
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:33.880]   mario covered and it's not just oh isn't that amusing they're playing this in
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:36.840]   symphony orchestra these melodies and the way that
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:40.680]   the it progresses it works when you have just a guy playing it on
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:44.440]   acoustic guitar we have a jazz combo playing it and this is the something that
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:47.640]   like something they compose for the background while you're just collecting
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:53.000]   points and trying to get points as i said it's it's games are designed by nintendo are
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:59.880]   just gorgeous art objects i love them it's the one it's the one big argument i had when
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:06.360]   roger roger ebert was talking about how i don't believe that the games can be can be art
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:10.440]   and that's when those the art those are three had by email okay let me show you
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:16.760]   yes it was yeah i also think people should know and this is from apple and cider that
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:21.720]   the game the reason the game connects the internet it's pretty clear in an interview
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:28.200]   mashable had with chigero meiomoto is its anti-piracy uh he said security for three
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:32.280]   paragraphs and then yep the guy at mashable who gets all the credit in the world said by
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:39.480]   security do you mean anti-piracy and meiomoto says yes but that it also is more than that because
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:43.720]   it's using a significant uh not non-trivial amount of data
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:50.760]   somewhere between 40 to 75 megabytes per hour of play which and the recent pokemon go updated
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:54.360]   similar and what they've done is moved a lot of sprites off the local install to make that
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:58.360]   smaller and faster and then a lot of the renders get done on the server and push down to you
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:03.000]   yeah so you want to play this on wi-fi uh unless you know you have unlimited data
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:09.320]   and you won't be playing it on the airplane but i will once you're once you're in in the air and
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:15.400]   you're paying the exorbitant go-go tax then you're fine actually yes it's also a safety thing because
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:19.480]   a game like that when there's when you're telling people to please turn off your devices because
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:24.200]   you've closed the cabin doors that adds at least 15 to 18 minutes please i just got clear this level
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:28.920]   no and that's the pilot who's doing like the pilot hit in the back row
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:33.640]   the deadhead we're we we've got we've got a an indicator
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:40.520]   but we're gonna have to just have a make us come here it's amazing my 11 year old godson we
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:43.960]   passed mario street when we drive to his house and every time we pass me he goes
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:50.680]   and like he's 11 but it's still part of his culture i love it that's cute that's really cute uh apple
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:58.360]   has uh activated last or next day deliveries for last minute christmas shoppers uh they have done
[01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:04.600]   this in the past they announced uh that you can go uh to the online stores ladies december 23rd
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:10.600]   and uh get a mac put a mac under the tree if you wish orders right now you're quick
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:14.840]   go ahead i was gonna say right now if you're quick the series one and series two watches just
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:18.920]   hit the refurb stores if you want a really good price from apple on the watches nice get that series
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:25.880]   two i think it's worth it faster better battery life uh you can uh go as late as two p.m. on december
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:34.280]   23rd for next day delivery so they do use uh same day courier deliveries and select
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:40.520]   metropolitan areas they do use post mates so if you have post mates in your area and an apple store
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:48.520]   you can even get it same day anything else we want to talk about before we go to our picks i think
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:56.200]   not gentlemen prepare your picks and while you're doing that Alex Lindsay listen carefully because
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:02.120]   it's time to buy a new house or refi roll house i can't wait to see what the offer code is for this

[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:49.960]   gonna try it you should try it uh you know you know you used it Brad Sams used it from uh
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:57.080]   a windows central and now the rot.com and he said it was awesome and the best part you know there
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:02.360]   there is one part where they can't be completely online and that's signing the papers obviously
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:07.480]   the banks don't want you to actually physically sign papers when you buy ass but what they do that
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:12.680]   is i think awesome is they send a notary with all the paperwork to your house so you still don't
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:16.760]   have to get up from the couch you might want to put on pants that's all i'm saying but you don't
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:21.560]   still because the notary comes in and walks you through the whole thing notarizes it and you're
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:28.600]   done i think you should try it let us know what you think i'm yeah i'm we're in the process right
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:33.880]   are you i hope you're buying out here you're going back to Pittsburgh a sandriffle all right
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:40.280]   yeah so all right so you know a lot of bargains down here they tell me you cannot buy uh this is
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:46.920]   a disclaimer a lot of bargains i know he's joking such a deal it's so sad such a deal it's like
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:52.520]   for $150 000 you can buy a shovel and a tarp to cover the hole that you're sleeping in after you
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:56.840]   did the hole with the shovel we were looking at one and it was like it was like i was like this one
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:01.160]   just you know it looks so rough and and and carly did it was like that was the best you can get for
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:08.840]   1.1 million big sir upper it's a lot people ask how i got to petaluma we wanted it by house you're
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:13.480]   living in san francisco abbey was one year old and we wanted to not have a razor in the city but
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:19.240]   razor in the country and so we just started driving north until we could afford a house and we went
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:27.880]   straight through marin believe me kept on going yeah kept and that was uh 25 years ago oh wow
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:35.160]   i if i told you at the time it was quite a stretch but we got uh our first house in petaluma
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:42.600]   if i could buy a house anywhere in california for that price i would buy five because it's like
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:47.560]   but on the other hand as housing prices went up we've made some money so that's good
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:53.320]   i you know i don't think our real estate agent was ready for the fact that when i said well i'd
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:57.000]   like to come in and you know we're gonna prepare for what we're gonna do to the house so we'll
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:03.720]   do a 3d scan of the whole house oh nice oh yes oh man which was it like a bulb droid what app did
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:14.200]   you use for that we're using uh we're using a um matter yeah so it runs on an ipad and it uh
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:19.320]   you set it down and you go out in the other room with your ipad and you hit you hit go and it just
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:23.880]   slowly turns you know and it uh it'll actually build the whole tour of the house and then it will
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:31.160]   oh my god and then it also builds an obj oh my god i'm so sorry that that sounds impressive but if
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:36.840]   there is not like a laser line that goes up and down and around you know there's no one that
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:41.880]   you gotta make it's it's it has sensors on it but it's not there no you can't it's not visible you
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:46.280]   gotta make they get a little raspberry pie put it next to Alex add those in post you just add those
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:52.920]   exactly exactly Alex Lindsay what's your pick of the week so i'm actually wearing my pick um you
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:57.960]   probably can't see it uh no it's just part of the point um so if you look really closely in my ear
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:04.840]   you'll see these little what what are they so um so if i pull them out here i notice you weren't
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:08.920]   wearing headphones you pull them out um i just realized but i'll pull them out for a second um
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:19.160]   isn't Alex a funny looking person he just so what the what so that is a um i was um we spent a lot
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:26.040]   of time in uh locations that have a lot of guys with security and um oh this is how they do it so
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:32.040]   i walked up to one of the guys uh one of the guys uh and uh i asked him you know i saw these
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:38.040]   headphones a couple times you know these really really uh low um kind of uh low profile and what
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:42.760]   and uh so i i i after seeing it three or four times in a couple different parts of the world i asked
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:47.400]   the guys um so uh let me make sure headphones and first i walked up and they were a little like
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:53.160]   what are you talking to me for you know and um anyway but to a to a person they they these are
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:59.160]   called ear heroes and um so earhero.com and they make them for sports as well but these ones are
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:04.040]   i mean this one is the security one um and uh they don't have so the one thing we're so i'm
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:08.920]   still trying to work out is all the mic um setup there is no mic kind of built into this it's just
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:14.920]   it's really listen only um what's nice about them is that you know they're not 150 bucks so it's
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:21.960]   not the cheapest set of uh headsets um but you can hear everything around you so you put them in
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:27.080]   especially if you're listening to a podcast you're listening to a uh music is not the best thing for
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:31.320]   it it doesn't have a lot of bass um it's but it's but it's really built for intelligibility around
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:36.680]   a spoken word so obviously these are designed primarily for comms so mostly what you're doing
[01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:41.320]   is you're plugging these into a radio and and um you know so that you're you're able to basically
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:45.960]   hear everything around you but also hear people talking to you at the same time and then the mic
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:49.720]   system is usually a separate you know that's typically when someone's you know holding up their
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:55.640]   their you know uh hand or or or you know grabbing onto their collar or whatever so that's a separate
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:49:00.920]   system this is just the the listening system um and always like in the movies when the secret
[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:07.000]   service agents are talking into their cuff like that somehow's covert like twitters on the move
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:12.040]   yeah right it's like come on no one talks into their cuff unless they're a secret service agent
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:15.960]   well and and they have a lot of them have them on uh not when they say it's over with that but
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:19.240]   a lot of folks that do security also have them here and they'll grab on and talk and they'll
[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:24.600]   yeah it's not necessarily i mean once you're wearing these even even these are you know light uh there's
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:29.320]   another layer of this which is wireless um that you can put in your ear um that's i'd be afraid of
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:33.640]   losing it in my ear no they have like a little it actually has a thing that you think is an antenna
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:38.040]   that you that you that is there to pull it out it's a tampon string oh right on that thing yeah
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:43.640]   so uh so anyway but these are i i've been testing these and and they're much more comfortable i find
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:49.240]   than the standard ifb um they're actually much harder to see unless you pull them into the front um
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:53.160]   than uh you know when you're when you're looking at stuff uh then then your standard ifb kind of
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:58.600]   coiled up you know piece and the fact that you can hear around it really gives you the ability i
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:04.520]   find myself listening to you know npr or twid or or marketplace or whatever walking around um
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:09.400]   at Whole Foods buying food and i just have it on the background it's like it's like i've now recreated
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:13.880]   the audio for the you know for the for wherever i'm at listening to whatever i generally mostly
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:19.400]   listen to spoken word anyway of some some sort and so um the other thing that's good about these
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:23.160]   they don't block your ear right so you can still hear ambient sound also i'm saying is you're
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:26.280]   hearing everything around you you're you're reactive you're walking up and it's just like
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:32.440]   this little soundtrack in the back in the back of your uh um uh i wear my i do that with my hearing aids
[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:36.360]   because which are about that small right you can listen to your audiobooks they're not again the
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:41.080]   audio is not great but and they're a lot more expensive than your heroes but i'm not like that
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:46.280]   they don't interfere with the sound yeah you still can see yeah i guess i really like the this idea of
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:51.880]   wearing them essentially they whether you're necessarily listening to audio at that moment or
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:57.560]   not and also and and you don't look like uh you don't look like hey i've got these things in my
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:02.760]   ear so but i'm but i'm not paying attention to you whatsoever and 150 bucks there are there are
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:07.960]   earphones that uh in the ear earphones that are at least 20 dollars more expensive than that
[01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:12.600]   well and and they don't sound they're not going to be as sexy as hell no i know for audio but
[01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:19.560]   for spoken word but that's sexy as hell i got to say they they're pretty amazing so anyway so i i
[01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:26.120]   i uh was um you know anyway that we we spend a lot of time and money on on um our headsets because
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:31.000]   we spend a lot of time in comms um you know for what we do and so we're always trying it so this was
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:34.760]   this is the best i found so far and it's great it's great also because one of the nice things about
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:40.600]   i wish more people did was this is actually a short little you know connection here so that so that
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:44.920]   you can you know put this into a some other kind of system and you're not committed just to the
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:50.760]   head to the to the one that they sent you so it's uh very well designed um and uh again primarily
[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:54.760]   for security and and and so on so forth but i think for people who are who want to have something
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:59.480]   kind of very low profile that also if you can hear out that is still wired um i think that's a
[01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:05.640]   pretty uh it's pretty nifty so i want to get your covert tactical ear hero well that's the one i
[01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:08.200]   have i mean that's what that's what this is yeah because we didn't see it the whole show
[01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:12.680]   right well that's the main thing is it well and and i think we're going to kind of convert it to
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:16.760]   when we use when we work with high profile folks a lot of times you know we used to have the big
[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:21.560]   coil to your thing and and this is going to be you know we're going to get a bunch of these
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:28.360]   then you know just look like strange people hanging around for no reason i would i would want the big
[01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:33.960]   headsets myself just well we do a lot of stuff where you're talking to you're talking to folks
[01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:38.920]   you know um people are having a two-way conversation with someone that's on skype or on hangout
[01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:44.040]   or whatever and you want them just to feel like they're i mean yeah yeah yeah like oh he's listening
[01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:47.880]   to somebody else yeah that makes sense yeah yeah i mean the the issue is is that it's it's like when
[01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:55.640]   you're when you're doing um uh when you're doing something like skype um the uh you think that you
[01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:59.640]   want to just leave it open leave the speakers open with some iac and those are the way they tell you
[01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:05.080]   you know for hangouts or whatever the skype is worse than hangouts but yeah they really uh it even if
[01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:10.360]   it works it's constantly cutting out and it's and even if it doesn't cut out it is degrading the
[01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:15.480]   overall audio quality as it tries to do echo cancellation and it's just really not you always
[01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:23.400]   almost always want to wear headphones when you're talking on on skype or learn my lesson yeah and
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:29.720]   the anaco pick of the week sir uh impromptu pick of the week a really good zippered hoodie yeah i
[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:36.680]   noticed you putting that on is it chilly uh there and uh yeah it's about uh it's about uh 2022
[01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:42.920]   degrees and after 10 minutes or sitting in the uh in the outer office i'm like okay this break time
[01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:47.800]   putting on another layer of socks and the really good the one that i only wear when i just need like
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:55.000]   i'm shoveling snow or i need the tactical tactical uh weapon against against the coolest uh i have a
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:59.400]   really oh goodness gracious like we should we should ran i should like commiserate about
[01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:05.080]   it's gonna be worse when like when when out moves back out it's like great it's going to be people
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:11.960]   who are like never experience anything lower than 50 degrees or higher than 73 degrees versus the
[01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:20.280]   people who are like hi do i'm just your set it is i'm actually kind of blue here uh but my pick of
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:27.640]   the week is really really timely for this week uh a lot of everyone my few traditions uh with my
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:34.040]   tech column is the last second gift guide uh things that you can buy like the day christmas day
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:40.200]   when correct guests are coming coming up the sidewalk and you realize that oh they brought stew i didn't
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:45.160]   know they were bringing steward i need to get a gift for steward and one of the best things you can
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:52.120]   give for anybody who is uh anyway interested in in comics or not in comics but they like the
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:58.760]   marvel films is a gift subscription to marvel unlimited this is one of the greatest subscription
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:05.720]   services of any kind ever uh it is for about 60 bucks a year you can buy a gift from for 60 bucks
[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:14.120]   for one year and you get access to 17 000 digital comic by marvel uh where but basically everything
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:20.760]   they publish hits the hits this service about six to six months to a year after it hits the stands
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:28.120]   sometimes even less time and they are diligently filling in their back catalog so if uh if you are
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:34.440]   really into what marvel is doing right now it is probably the only affordable way to keep up with
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:41.800]   one of their uh like annual like event series because each marvel comics are four bucks per copy and
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:48.360]   the event itself is eight issues but you have to buy another like 13 or 14 comics a month just to
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:52.920]   follow what the story really is uh so if you're willing to wait this that's how not i read marvel
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:58.920]   comics i just can't afford to spend to take it i can't take the risk that i'm spending 80 or 90
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:03.160]   dollars to read the story and there's really no ending to it i don't really like it but i'm perfectly
[01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:08.680]   happy to spend uh 70 dollars a year and then read it six months later but not only that but it means
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:14.360]   that you can read all of john berns fantastic for you can read i think that while simonson's
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:21.320]   Thor is up there uh all of uh fantastic really every era of fantastic for from jack kirby all
[01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:26.520]   the way up to kirkman uh you can when when you read online someone talk about oh boy i wish i wish
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:32.840]   the fantastic for were still were as good as uh uh when kirkman was writing it or i wish uh uh it
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:38.760]   wasn't a great win-dance slot first took over uh spiderman you don't have to buy 20 dollar trade
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:44.760]   paper books you can just click into your tablet uh download uh the all the issues from that run
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:50.520]   and then just read them page after page after page uh and uh you have access to the entire library
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:56.280]   you can read them live and dream it so to speak uh issue by issue i think that you can download uh
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:02.680]   as many as 12 uh issues from your personal library as you build your library to uh your device
[01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:08.120]   whether it's your iphone your ipad uh android or whatever uh after that you have to start removing
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:13.400]   things from your ipad but you will not be you will still have great stuff read after they uh after
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:17.400]   you board your after you're bored your plane i really think that it's it's one of the things that
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:24.200]   makes uh reading comics in this day and age uh just fantastic uh as i said i have a lot of complaints
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:27.880]   about how marvel publishes their stories now they tell those stories but they're pretty
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:31.960]   much all negated by the fact that well if you think that comics are too expensive if you think that
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:37.160]   you for know how many you have to buy to get the story if you can if you can if you're okay
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:41.720]   with waiting six months and essentially read them all for just 70 dollars a year and it's all you
[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:46.600]   can eat and you can and you can also buy gift subscriptions you have to kind of scroll down to
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:52.440]   find it on the page on the link that i gave you uh but you can give a gift subscription and that's
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:57.160]   the sort of thing where again when you find out that your your cousin brought their kids and everyone
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:03.240]   is giving gifts to the kids it's an easy thing to just run upstairs destroy run run a distraction
[01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:07.960]   play uh with with your spouse while you run upstairs and make the make the gift subscription and make
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:11.960]   the purchase and then come back downstairs for the sheet of paper with an op with a code on it so
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:16.440]   really great stuff i've been using marvel loaded since they only had like 4 000 costs in the library
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:23.880]   and i'm a really really happy customer very nice indeed rene richy i'm already playing your pick
[01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:29.800]   of the week i am playing it on windows but it has the uh the downloadable content that apple is
[01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:36.040]   giving or mojang is giving you the christmas yeah so my pick is uh this so as much as nintendo is my
[01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:41.400]   generation minecraft is sort of too late for me and i never got back into the game into minecraft so
[01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:45.960]   i'm not where lio is either but minecraft came to apple tv this week and it's sort of been one of
[01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:50.120]   those things that is long that was long promise and people been looking forward to it and it turned
[01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:54.040]   out really really well we had one of our editors lorey gill take a look at it and she really really
[01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:58.040]   liked it you do need one of these which is a controller and i recommend the steel series by
[01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:05.480]   nimbus yeah you know i have i had a series series strata um excel uh and i was trying to play it on
[01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:10.840]   the apple tv and it worked sort of yeah it's a nimbus that you really want i think the problem
[01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:16.200]   was i had the iowa the android version or something yeah i want to get the nimbus that's the one i
[01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:20.520]   want to get huh yeah and it's a good controller it's a good experience it looks good again it
[01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:23.960]   fits the control scheme for the platform it's not a huge departure from anyone who's played on
[01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:28.360]   any other platform it's just nice to be able to sit in the living room and if you have an apple tv
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:34.040]   just put it right on the apple tv and and just enjoy minecraft to the full extent of the virtual
[01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:39.640]   lego universe sit down here in the christmas pub and just uh watch you play i really i have to say i
[01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:45.000]   like the now the problem with it is that minecraft for the apple tv is twenty dollars
[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:50.120]   which i mean that gets back into the economy where people people want to make money i mean
[01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:54.440]   they they the tradition of video games is you buy the game for whatever you like sixty dollars
[01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:59.800]   twenty dollars whatever it was and their companies who are really locked into that model uh and i'd
[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:03.720]   hate to say you can't do that with video games anymore because games are super expensive to make
[02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:07.800]   and i want them to continue making big blockbuster games and we'll spend 20 bucks on our ticket to
[02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:11.400]   go see the new star wars movie that's done in two hours and this will give you arguably longer
[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:16.920]   entertainment value than that will yeah so it's the perception issue really um but i don't think
[02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:21.080]   it'll change unless there are a series of really really good twenty dollar games that people just
[02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:24.440]   get rewarded for the experience they're willing to get the game packs that they throw in the
[02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:29.560]   downloadable content they throw in is actually great like this christmas uh this thing is really
[02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:34.840]   great so it's you know it makes up for it a little bit you it's funny because you could get it for
[02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:40.280]   ten bucks on windows this is by the way the pocket edition of minecraft yeah without realm support
[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:45.240]   they say that's coming later and without xbox support they say that's coming later but the the
[02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:50.360]   windows version is going up to twenty six bucks soon and you still have to pay three or four bucks
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:55.720]   for the downloadable content so which i did know happily because hey it's christmas in minecraft
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:01:00.120]   land windows and windows in office can't fund everything at work or soft anymore all the little
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:04.680]   snowflakes just so it's a lot of fun and it gets people into the living room with
[02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:08.280]   especially at the holidays not everyone is staring at their phone that everyone is locked in their
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:13.880]   room with their consider you playing video games yay well i mean like you you can't like you can
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:18.280]   just watch your it's almost a joke right like the kids playing minecraft while watching youtube
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:22.840]   videos of someone playing minecraft uh but this at least lets you sort of join in the experience
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:28.120]   with your kid if you really want to i don't know is this a is this a gingerbread man i just harvested
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:35.080]   i wonder if i can eat it it's a santa pikachu i guess i know my worlds are colliding
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:40.040]   a good thing you can go to a lego store and buy minecraft lego which is really the world
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:45.080]   turning back on itself yeah isn't that that's really strange yeah so how much is the nimbus
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:49.800]   because i think i'm going to buy one i think it's forty nine if i remember correctly it's like
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:56.600]   forty nine uh dollars but it's a really well built like anyone who's had a uh uh a sony or an xbox
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:00.680]   controller uh we'll feel right at home with this it's exceptionally well made i've had mine since
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:05.000]   the apple tv launch and it's still perfect condition works really well double thumb sticks
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:10.680]   all the controls you you would imagine on a normal gamepad my most important question before i buy
[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:16.200]   that handle being thrown to a good floor in disgust well i mean if you aim for the tv it's
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:22.280]   better because you can break everything at once you won't have discussed with minecraft there's
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:27.640]   nothing disgusting about minecraft unless you do something stupid like to fall into lava with all
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:35.480]   your stuff i thought you would never do that not that i would ever do that or thank you everybody
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:45.720]   you guys are great yay this is our last show of uh 2016 uh uh next week is the best of that we've

[02:02:51.320 --> 02:03:01.400]   then be back on january third no yeah third for uh the 2017 edition uh break weekly i know
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:06.600]   you never you know it's no you're no now Leo that's not a that's not a bad thing if like have you ever
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:13.960]   thought that thank god i didn't have to think about it is not is no longer 2016 yeah i don't i at this
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:19.160]   point i'm not even expecting that i will still be alive on january first it's not a great year for
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:24.760]   anybody no yeah anybody could pass at any moment oh we haven't seen 2017 yet so i'm not gonna say
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:29.800]   that's my that's my that's my fear we it's it's conceivable we'll look back and it's totally
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:37.320]   on how wonderful 2016 was oh you think that you think that in 2016 2017 someone will bring
[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:43.480]   david back to life and then kill them all over again oh no i think i'm thinking they got out when
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:50.680]   they knew the opportunity was there there's somewhere uh performing and enjoying
[02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:58.920]   uh a christmas classic like uh like this you see what's coming out of here thank you so much uh to

[02:04:03.160 --> 02:04:07.880]   legitimately great i think that people some people are like sarcastic about it but oh i'm not
[02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:12.680]   what the greatest the greatest vocalist of the 20th century with one of the also i think when
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:17.160]   the greatest pop vocalist of the 20th century yeah it's just they're both pop vocalists but yeah
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:26.280]   bing Crosby and david boe i enjoy this unironically no it's a little weird
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:34.040]   it's a bing Crosby special it's a little bit weird when bing Crosby goes to the door and says oh it's
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:42.440]   david boe come on in david and let's sing a song again but it's it's absolutely a beautiful version
