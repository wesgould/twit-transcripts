[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Andy and Renee are here. We've got lots to talk about,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   including those new revelations about the CIA hacking tools that showed up on WikiLeaks.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.600]   How private is your smartphone? A couple of revelations from last week's Apple shareholders
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.240]   meeting. Maybe there are new Macs in the future. And why Renee doesn't think there's going to
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.440]   be an event this month to introduce new iPads. It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.240]   NetCasts you love. From people you trust.

[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.480]   Mac Break. It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover the Mac, the windows. No, no.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.240]   The Google, no, no, no. Just the Apple. Just the Apple. We cover the Apple, the iPhone, the iPad,
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.440]   the Apple Watch, the Apple TV, and of course the Macintosh joining me now.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.480]   From his Fortress of Solitude in Snowbound Montreal, Canada, it's Renee Richie of iMour.com.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:13.040]   Irenee. It's actually freezing rain found today. We got hail last night and then it just started
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.560]   melting and then I got back to my car and it was covered in literally a quarter inch of ice.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.240]   And you do that trick where you roll down the window and then you wait for someone to pass by
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.840]   and you punch through the window and they all freak out. Oh my god. Yes, that's the worst kind
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.400]   of whatever winter is the freezing rain. There was a great video where a guy pulls up to Tim Hortons
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.600]   places an order and then when they come to the drive-through he punches through the freezing rain
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.760]   window and grabs a coffee and everyone is just startled. Googling in now. Also here.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:47.280]   Also here. There's our story to tell you about now, one that's taken social media by storm.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.880]   Kitchener. A Kitchener. Tim Hortons. Oh no, this is a deer crashing through the window.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.000]   I know that's a different story. I don't need to just coffee. I'm going to judge that deer.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.800]   It's a different story. I got to say though, that's the best intro I have ever had.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.200]   There's our story coming out of Kitchener. How about the guy who drove the Zamboni?
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.600]   Drove the Zamboni into the Tim Hortons. That's another, this is very Canadian.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.320]   Yes. Yeah. And Hortons is a center of a lot of our news.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.920]   He actually did it through the drive-through, so that's okay. I saw that we have these massive
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.000]   caterpillar trucks that clean the roads and every night you go by and there's like three or four of
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.600]   them trying to go through the drive-through and these, they look like military machines.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.680]   So funny. That's so funny. Also here, Annie and that go Chicago Sun-Times.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.200]   He's no stranger to snow, sleet, rain, dark of night, but he makes his appointed rounds
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.360]   every day. Yes, yes. The long deep weekend of the soul.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:49.760]   Here we go. Thanks to our chat room who has provided me with video of a man smashing
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.920]   through a window. It's a Reddit. All right. Let's see. Let's see. Punching through the window.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.200]   Ice. Can you, can you, can you pull it up? Do you know how to do it? No, he doesn't have the,
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.000]   he doesn't, oh, does that mean? That was my page? No, that was you. I don't have Reddit.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.240]   There you go. That's you. Do you have the video?
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.680]   He's lowering the window up and down, up and down. And, and you see there's a sheet of glass
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:26.400]   that is really just ice and then Hulk smash. That's actually all been there. That would be
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.200]   very funny to drive up to a drive through into that. I'll have a cup of coffee.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.120]   I don't want to say. It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like cars, cars in Canada have developed
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.840]   like the same genetic, evolutionary modification as like lizards and snakes, where they have the
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.320]   second eyelid transparent that covers the real eyelid so that they can deal with more coffee, I
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.080]   guess. Oh, let's see. I'm going to try to start with a happy story. We could cover the
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.600]   giant WikiLeaks of CIA hacking documents, Apple devices losing their luster in America.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.680]   That was a bad reporting story too. I mean, those initial tweets about that were terrible.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.840]   The vault seven release? No, the the WikiLeaks thing, because the New York Times had a good
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.280]   story, but then they tweeted that they had that the CIA had found a way to crack into the apps
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.680]   themselves into signal and WhatsApp and all these. Oh, yeah. That was really misrepresenting it,
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.280]   because what if you read it, the capability the CIA had was merely to capture it pre-encryption.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.120]   So, yes, but if you have a key to a water, a computer or a Trojan, you can watch somebody type
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.000]   the message. You don't cat, you can't catch it in transit, but you can catch it if you own the
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.840]   phone. That's very different than very different. In encryption and signal.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.440]   They have to they have to own your phone. They can't just do a yes, you know, they can't catch
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.440]   your alt signal, traffic, just traffic of people who's phone them. But if they own your phone,
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.040]   dude, it doesn't really much matter what you're what you're doing. Yeah, you're right. That was
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.200]   kind of a misrepresentation. You had to read it more carefully to understand.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:02.720]   And it's certainly not as big of a threat, but this was a big wicki leak. 7,818 web pages,
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.000]   943 attachments, several hundred million lines of computer code belonging, they say
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.480]   to the Central Intelligence Agency. The story here really is that in the past,
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.800]   in the United States, it's the NSA, the National Security Agency that's done all the hacking work.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.440]   They have very, very, very good hackers. You may remember in the movie,
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:30.400]   what is the one with Damon and the Affleck finding, Will? How'd you go to say speakers?
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.680]   No, no. What's the name of it? You know, Will. Good Will hunting. Good Will hunting.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:42.960]   He gets a job offer from the NSA and has a very eloquent refusal. But even then,
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.440]   they're looking for brilliant mathematicians, right? Because the NSA has the greatest tools
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.280]   with story, apparently, according to the New York Times is that the CIA never liked it,
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.000]   that they had to go through the NSA revealing operational details to get hacking tools. So,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.600]   they just hired a few hackers of their own, like a thousand.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.120]   Kids, what's taking the job breaks on a job?
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:09.200]   They're also buying commercial exploits. They're also working with MI5 and other intelligence
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.960]   agencies. Like, I don't know if they were swapping, swapping techniques, but the report said that
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:20.240]   they're getting some from other intelligence agencies. So, this, just another indication that
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:26.400]   if there is any way to break into any sort of device to get past any sort of method of maintaining
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:34.000]   a secret, the CIA and the NSA and MI5 are really working hard to get it. And it's not even just a
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.920]   political story. It means that if they have found a new, if there is a new way of getting at the data
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.640]   inside your, inside of your iPhone, that means that there is a vote. It's not because they work
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:51.120]   with Apple to develop a worm for it. It means that there is a vulnerability that anybody can exploit.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.240]   And the only people who are paying clever mathematicians and programmers more money than the government
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:02.000]   are private illegal industries. So, that means that there's a lack of security that affects all of
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.760]   us. So, I'm sure that Apple is reading every single comma, every single keystroke of this document to
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:14.080]   get some sort of a hint as to how people are getting into an iPhone or an iOS or a macOS device
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.600]   and make sure that that stops working. Of course, it was only a month ago that a hacker leaked out
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:27.040]   celebrates iOS bypassing tools, which showed how celebrate was able to get into iPhones.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:37.360]   Really, the issue that you raised about hacking into WhatsApp and signal and Telegram, as
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:43.920]   discussed in the New York Times Renee, is that if somebody has access to your phone, and so the
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:49.360]   really the more interesting tools would be the tools that allow a bad guy to get into your phone
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:58.000]   and stay there. And if those tools exist, of course, and leak out, the risks are huge.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:07.760]   WikiLeaks said we did not release code until, quote, a consensus emerges on the technical,
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.000]   political nature of the CIA's program and how such weapons should be analyzed, disarmed, and published.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.200]   So, they're not saying we won't release the code. They're just saying we haven't done it yet.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:23.840]   And WikiLeaks has been a little bit under a cloud of late, as apparently Julia Assange has
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:32.720]   some political agenda as well. But one code named Weeping Angel uses Samsung Smart
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:39.200]   Television to listen in. And according to WikiLeaks, even when it appears to be turned off,
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.920]   the television operates as a bug recording conversation since sending them over the internet to a
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:49.840]   covert CIA server. This is one of the programs developed. Dr. Who referenced, like, don't blink,
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.440]   don't ever blink. Weeping angels. It might be because it was British intelligence that developed
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.240]   an anti-filling weeping angel. Isn't that interesting? Is that a doctor who reference?
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.040]   Yeah, it's those they exist out of quantum time. So if you look at them, they can't move,
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.480]   but the minute you look away from them, they can kill you. So you can't even take your eyes. Oh,
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:18.240]   my God. Terrifying. That is bizarre. Swamp monkey. I like that one's what does swamp monkey do?
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.640]   Drain them all drain them all. Hey, what is eggs mayhem?
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:29.200]   And I love Ricky Bobby straight out of Talladega. Nice. Eggs mayhem sounds like a Twitter troll
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:36.160]   account. The the leaks we'd seen before the NSA tools all had ran that two two names,
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.240]   two random words names. It was clear they had a computer program because you don't want to
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.240]   assign a code name that that kind of gives in information about what the tool is for.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:50.000]   So there were wild kind of random combinations. It sounds like the CIA has not been quite as
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.600]   careful in their naming protocol. Golder surfer. What is that? The loss of raptor.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.160]   Shoulder surfer. I wonder what it does. I wonder what philosophy raptor. This is all gizmodo has
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:06.080]   been going through these documents. These are all revealed by gizmodo. I guess there's some good
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:13.120]   reading there. Yeah. Well, it's a serious subject, but I'm always impressed and a little bit glad to
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.680]   see that no matter how evil these tools are, the team did find a way to collaborate on a really
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:24.560]   cool logo for it. They all wanted the patch to throw on their jackets. So they at least have a
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:30.960]   design sense that is worthy of emulation. People teams. But yeah, it's I mean, the problem with
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.640]   wiki leaks really any leak is that you always have to factor in who people rarely leak information
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.760]   without some sort of an agenda. Sometimes the agenda is to the benefit of the people that are
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.680]   leaking the information to. But you always have to keep that in the back in the back of your mind
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.920]   is there a reason why this information is being leaked out. Is there a reason why it's being leaked
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.600]   out at this precise moment? Nonetheless, it really does underscore that you really have to take an
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.360]   entirely fresh new attitude towards the devices you bring into your home. When Samsung came out,
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.320]   when it's admitted that they it's possible that they're collecting more information than is
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:13.040]   on an engineering basis necessary to do voice recognition for their TVs that maybe realize that
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:18.800]   maybe I should have an entirely separate Wi-Fi network just for smart devices. And so that could
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:28.160]   make sure that this TV, whatever TV I buy only knows about this one network. And this network is
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:33.040]   shut off unless this TV is saying I will not proceed unless you allow me to I have not connected
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:38.960]   the internet in one year. I need to check for system updates and then you put out go into the
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:46.720]   go into the into the office, turn on the five year old 8 to 11 dot B Wi-Fi base station that I took
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.840]   out of the trash, keep it up long enough for this thing to check in with mom and download an update
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:56.560]   then turn it off again because you have to operate under the assumption that it is
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.600]   transacting data that you do not approve of and that you don't want and you won't let out your house.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:09.520]   The there's one called fine dining that lets a hacker look like they're using VLC or playing
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:15.120]   the game 2048 when actually they're using the interface to do some serious hacking. There's
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:22.320]   magical mutt. Don't new bit up so hard next time is the advice in the documents.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:28.320]   Now if you're curious what the what if if Wikileaks had an agenda with this, you know, I it's hard
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:35.360]   to imagine that Wikileaks would be able to fabricate this, you know, 7000 pages, but but the timing and
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:41.200]   the and the nature of the release, all you have to do is go look at Alex Jones info wars to see what
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:49.120]   the agenda might be because according to the release, some of the tools were Russian tools that the CIA
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:56.240]   had stolen. And of course, Alex Jones, who's the king of the false flag operation, even to the
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:02.800]   point where he says that the Sandy Hook massacre was a false flag government or plan, which is
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:09.360]   obviously insane. He says, Oh, you see, this is what happened. The CIA stole Russian tools and then
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.480]   faked a Russian hack of the election. And I wouldn't put it past Julian Assange
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:23.120]   for putting that story forward either. So as we're always as from now on through the looking
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.360]   last with this kind of stuff, never the last and the other thing I see why I see this a lot and I
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.400]   really want to know what you guys think. What happens is this, you know, bits and pieces like
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:38.160]   the Samsung TV thing that for sure will be featured on local news tonight. And what happens is normal
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:44.800]   people who aren't, you know, super sophisticated and are not reading the details are that's their
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:50.080]   takeaway. My Samsung TV is spying on me. And every time I talk to normal people on the radio show,
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.000]   I did a San Francisco radio show that was one of the calls in the San Francisco radio show.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.840]   I know I hear my Samsung TV is listening in on me. What should I do? There's a huge amount of
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:07.040]   paranoia now throughout the country from people who say, well, am I being spied upon all the time?
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:13.200]   Are we? You have to worry about what doors are unlocked and open on your network now. That's for
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:19.360]   sure. But it's also important to understand that it's the technical, the technical problem of
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:25.600]   recording every scrap of audio that comes in through your kitchen, through your Google home or
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:31.440]   your Amazon Echo is a huge waste of engineering. It's not something that they would build into the
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.320]   device unless they were kind of forced to do so. You really have to, it's upon people like us to
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.680]   say that, no, no, no, it has enough CPU power to recognize when a trigger word has been spoken.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:47.280]   And the reason if you want some idea of how limited the power of this resource is,
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:52.880]   realize you can't just arbitrarily choose what your trigger word is. You have to use the word
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:57.600]   they give you or choose between one of three. And so it really is only listening after it's
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:03.920]   been told to listen. Right. I tell people that I think that I think that's going to be part of the
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.720]   the responsibility of the makers of all these things. If Apple were to make a device like that,
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.880]   they need to have something just like they have a whole section of their website to explain,
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.040]   here's what our eco policy is. Here's how recyclable each of these products are.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:22.240]   It's also going to be important for these companies to say, here is how we are listening to you. And
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:29.440]   here are the limits of what can be done. And we will not, and we will, we will put a canary on
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:34.960]   this page. So if you ever see that page go down or change, you know that something has changed or
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.800]   they've been forced to make a change. But yeah, they're going to have to be part of the marketing
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.880]   because I would like, I would like for the coming generation or the current generation
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:50.560]   of consumers to understand that you have a phone that just the fact that you are not even operating
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.920]   this phone, but your phone is on your body in this presence means that there are, there can be boxes
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:02.080]   that simply collect every scrap of data. I'm sorry, collect, collect every identity of every phone
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:09.520]   that's in this area. And although this isn't as as scary as a hidden box scraping your phone for
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:15.280]   contacts and messages, the fact that it can say, well, let's see, Andy was here, then he was there.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.320]   And who else was there, these three people who are also with in the same location as Andy three
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:25.120]   weeks ago, aha, that's the sort of stuff that makes you at least aware that these things can happen.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:30.080]   And maybe you should buy a copper lined bag to put your phone in when you're not when you're not
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.480]   using it. Yeah, it's interesting to I think like vendors have a huge responsibility here. We saw
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.640]   originally with Touch ID Apple went to the trouble of making a secure hardware channel that was
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.880]   very hard to break into, where some other vendors just put full res fingerprint images in a read
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:48.000]   in a world readable directory, at least at first. And now on the new MacBook Pro, they've put the
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.360]   camera indicator, there's a little light that goes on when your camera is in use. They started
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.440]   embedding that into secure enclave, making it much harder for anybody to exploit that. And for example,
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.360]   turn on the camera, turn off the light. And that same sort of thing I want to see here. Like,
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.600]   I want to know that TV is not off. Not not that all these speakers that we have, they're just one
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.960]   exploit away from being turned on. And I'd like to have something that I know from, you know,
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.120]   from a reasonable hardware perspective, simply can't be done without my awareness. I think that's
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.160]   there is more that need to be applied. That was one of the brilliant things that the design of
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.720]   Apple's first eyesight camera, that their first, their fireware camera you put on top of your monitor,
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:24.640]   that instead of a little light that tells you that, Oh, the camera is on the camera is off,
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:31.280]   you can actually twist the front of it to put into place a white physical barrier over the lens,
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:36.640]   so that it doesn't matter what's happening electronically. Photons are going to be stymied by this piece
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:42.160]   of physical metal in front of it. So yeah, I mean, I would love to there to be a mechanical
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:49.520]   kill switch or electronic kill switch that says this type in this button doesn't simply tell the
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:56.800]   software inside this device to mute the the the microphone. It means there is now no electrical
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:01.520]   connection between the microphone and this thing. Maybe even the best way to do it is you can stick
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:08.640]   a quarter coins a coin in there as a screwdriver, twist it and actually unplug the microphone and
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.960]   actually put it on it put it next to the thing. So you know that, okay, this is the microphone,
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.320]   it is not connected to anything. So I know this thing is safe now.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.480]   Yeah, with an Amazon Echo, there's a button on it to mute it, but you have to trust that Amazon
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:26.240]   is actually doing that. And I think that some people have the concern that somebody just mentioned
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:31.120]   this in the chatroom. See, this is this is the problem with this kind of conspiracy thinking and
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.600]   paranoia is there's no end to it. It goes deeper and deeper and deeper. And so some people are
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:40.720]   saying, well, what if Amazon has other keywords that they're listening for? So you don't, you don't
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.840]   know you're triggering it. It silently triggers and records to this point. Remember that
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:53.360]   there was a murder case, a 2015 murder case in Bentonville, Arkansas, the police had subpoenaed
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:59.600]   Amazon Echo data. They'd already received data from the water company, the local water company was
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:06.400]   what kind of call it, the hot tub murders. A man was found murdered in a hot tub. And part of the
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:12.240]   evidence the police want to use against his buddy who was in the house at the time is this massive
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.960]   use of water in the middle of the night. The presumption is he's washing away blood. They also
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:22.080]   asked for the Amazon Echo data. The Amazon was fighting it using a First Amendment defense.
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:29.760]   They have now because the defendant has agreed to let police review the information on the Echo,
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:36.080]   Amazon is handing it over. So they fought but not for very long or very hard. But I have to think,
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:41.920]   you know, there can be this is a fishing expedition on the part of the police. They're hoping that,
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:46.400]   you know, maybe the guy when he's being murdered, shouted, Echo, the murderer is
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:53.840]   How do you dispose of a body? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. The witnesses say that the
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:21:01.200]   Echo was playing music that evening. So it wasn't use. It's just it's tantalizing. And again, if you're
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:06.000]   if you're investigating a murder and you want to come to justice and you know that there is
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.400]   you know, your tech savvy enough to know that there must there might be some sort of a buffer
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:15.360]   that is at least, you know, examining this incoming stream for for trigger word.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:20.080]   Is it possible that there might even be eight seconds worth of audio that could be could be
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:24.240]   forensically useful? You really have to go and try to get that data. I think that that's part of
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:30.560]   your responsibility. But there's a and also the iPhone data or the whatever the phone the guy's using.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:36.960]   Right. But the the it's it's interesting because now you get into even get into the next legal
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:42.960]   step, which is can we instead of asking for it instead of a case by case, we're gonna issue warrants
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:51.120]   for it. Can we make the legal claim that from a legal point of view, a microphone that I as a as
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:58.160]   a homeowner will fully place inside my house? Is that like my putting a window in my house where
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:05.920]   it's okay for it's okay for for a police officer to park across the street and operate binoculars
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:11.920]   and look through the window. If that's clearly they're clearly not equivalent things. But again,
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.760]   if you think that this is a really valuable tool, like I would love to be able to activate
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:20.560]   an echo microphone inside someone's house without having to really go through all the steps that
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:27.120]   would be necessary to break in and plant a bug there. That's how tantalizing this stuff can be. It's
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:32.640]   it's it's that's why you really have to fight for the principle and make sure that although you
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.280]   don't deny law enforcement the tools they need to do their job, you make sure that you're not
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:42.080]   sacrificing something more important. I'm willing to let them fight for that. I'm willing to let them
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:47.680]   again send an actual piece of meat where in a car to a judge to tell talk to another piece of
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.240]   meat where in the legal system and explain why you need this exemption. I would be very, very
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.880]   concerned if just as a matter of course, you can just well let's flip on every Amazon echo of
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.240]   every white male between the ages of 17 and 33 within a five mile radius of this place and see
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:08.640]   if and make just look some software that looks for the that looks for the phrase. Yeah, I done it.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.120]   It's a fair cop. I done it. I did. Yeah. Well, that's why you want to pick a company that's
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.280]   going to do what it can to protect your privacy even if it's futile in the long run if the
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:23.680]   you know, but you know, if you think about it, your iPhone has the same capability. All it takes is
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:28.320]   a trigger word unless you've turned that feature off to get a serious listen.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.160]   I was talking to a friend the other day and he was debating the merits of an illegal U-turn when
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:37.040]   there was nobody physically around to see it and then you're wondering, but really, are there
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.320]   physical people anymore? Are there cameras? Are there satellites? How far are we away from when
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.800]   we're just continuously monitored all the time everywhere? Well, let's say he got dinged for it.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:50.800]   I mean, this is a trivial case, but if the police wanted to, they could get his phone,
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:55.680]   have tracking information from his GPS, a recording perhaps of him saying, "Should we do it?"
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.760]   You know? Yeah, that was the old thing is like, they do they catch you doing something wrong or
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.360]   do they decide they want you and then find something wrong? Forget, forget pre-crime.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:09.600]   They don't need to worry about that. They got you. Yeah. And it's recording all the time.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.640]   So, but my question again, should we be paranoid? Yes, I mean, like, there's,
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.560]   it's not even just paranoid. Like accidents happen. We have all these tools and technologies,
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.240]   and we've seen companies do dumb things just by accident. Like Samsung was collecting information,
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.600]   they should now they turned it off. But you know, these things are just their tools,
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:30.720]   they're in our house and they're open microphones and they're open video cameras and we should,
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:34.480]   you can make fun of Mark Zuckerberg for putting bits of tape on his computer or you can think,
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.960]   you know, I have kids, I have family in here and I'm going to make sure that the camera is unplugged
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.800]   unless we're using it or it has tape over it unless I'm using it or this microphone isn't on
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.840]   unless I'm using it. I think that's, that's not paranoid. I think that's a rational choice that
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.840]   you can make. It's the continual perpetual fight between convenience and security and we all have
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.240]   to make that judgment on a case by case basis. Both encouraging and discouraging. Go ahead,
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:00.240]   Andy. I'm just saying I have black tape on all of my, all of my cameras, not because I think that
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:05.040]   anybody's going to snoop, but it's just prudent. Also, because the number of times where I have,
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:10.000]   like a Webex briefing and they didn't tell me that they were going to be looking for video and
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.840]   and so like I've got my, like I just woke up 20 minutes ago, T-shirt on, I haven't shaved.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.920]   It's, it's, I have a camera.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.960]   Do you tape your iPhone too, Andy?
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.600]   Not my iPhone. Why not?
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:27.040]   But I just, I have a, I, I'm worried about times when the camera might be on and it's not on,
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:33.040]   given that, you know, I use the iPad everywhere and I use my MacBook everywhere and it's such a
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.520]   simple thing for me to do. There is no downside to it. I can, when I need it, I can easily just
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.920]   peel it off, put it to the side, then put it back on again. There is no reason for me not to do that.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.600]   And so, so if the feds are listening to, you want to turn on the camera on his phone,
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.520]   it's not just, it's too like some of us work at home and every once in a while,
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.120]   you do see a significant other who's not aware that you're having a video conference walk around
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:58.080]   in the background. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And like, I mean, it's just, it's everyday little privacy things.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.920]   Yeah. Close the door.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.560]   Put a lock on the door.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:10.560]   Yeah. I mean, even paranoid's have enemies. I just, it's, I don't know.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.400]   Well, just a good way to do this really, unless you throw out all the technology.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.520]   And we have no privacy coming. Automation is going to take our jobs. I just don't know what
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.240]   to do with the future. It's going to, but that's, it's not Star Trek.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:26.240]   That's just a, just a touch on this. I mean, though, there is, that's the reason why you really
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:33.520]   have to be aware of the principle and fight for the principle because let's say that you might
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:42.000]   have been comfortable with Obama having an incredible, but having an incredibly rich
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.400]   wiretapping program, surveillance program in place. Well, you know, I do, I, I believe,
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:52.640]   I trust this person. I trust this administration. I trust the people that he hires to use this
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:58.800]   responsibly. And then you have another administration that, regardless of who they actually are,
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.680]   you personally don't trust. And then, well, are you okay with this person having it?
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:09.120]   And then let's say Hillary runs again. Now you're like, okay, let's imagine, let's have an
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:14.800]   imaginary third candidate. That is like, that is like, I believe that I should be something,
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:20.800]   I like the kind of Kim Jong Il's jib. I don't like his haircut, but I love the way he runs.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.200]   Great jib.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:26.960]   I don't, I don't, I don't see why I can't just execute people that I don't like.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.560]   If I have people who are politically weird to me, I don't see why I shouldn't be able to eliminate
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.400]   them, then you realize that, well, because you said nothing for two or three different
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.960]   presidential administrations, now you've got this person who has all of this apparatus at his or
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.640]   her disposable disposal. And you wish that you had said, I trust Donald Trump to be out to use
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:52.000]   these tools responsibly. But in principle, I don't think any agency should have that level of power,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.720]   because I'm worried about the person who, I'm not worried, I'm not worried necessarily about
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:03.760]   Obama taking away my guns. I'm worried about a president in the future using whatever weakening
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.560]   of the First Amendment issues, excuse me, Second Amendment issues to then take away my guns.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.960]   Well, and furthermore, I mean, this has all been through three administrations now.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:18.720]   This started in 9/11. And this, you know, it hasn't been slow. It's been, everything began really in
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:24.160]   September, you know, 12. Just the US. And that's the other point, right? I mean, look at these tools,
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:30.880]   these CIA tools that they're in cooperation with GCHQ. Yeah. And, and I'm sure Canada is doing
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.280]   something similar to it's not just the president is every employee who has access to these things.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:42.960]   Right. So I mean, I was with the fun begins. Yeah, it's, I don't know, I had both encouragement
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:49.600]   and discouragement yesterday. We interviewed Mark Rogers, who's a sec ops for DEFCON. So that's
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:56.000]   pretty good for 15 years. But he's also does security for chief security for a cloud flare.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.560]   Really smart guy, a hacker, admittedly black hat in his youth, white hat now. He had a couple of
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:10.400]   observations. One was, because I asked him, well, wouldn't the NSA have everything that went on
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:14.480]   during the election? He said, probably they had it. But you have to understand they're collecting
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:20.640]   so much data now, even with this new Utah data center, they can't keep it all. So he said,
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.800]   after about a month, they're destroying this stuff. And I think he probably knows he's probably,
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:29.520]   you know, well connected. So that was kind of encouraging in some ways that, you know,
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.040]   they have to kind of, they probably, they probably do some sort of triage and say, well,
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:36.480]   we'll save that. But we're going to throw out Leo LaPort stuff. But that Renee Richie,
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:42.480]   let's keep his communications because he's from Canada. And then, so that's one thing that was
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.880]   somewhat encouraging. I was also a little discouraged because he'd also worked for 10 years for Vodafone,
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:53.120]   the British telco. And I asked him, well, you know, what kind of conduit is there between private
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:58.720]   and the government, you know, and he said, well, having worked with a telco for 10 years and not
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:03.920]   specifically naming Vodafone, I just know that everybody's given up anything that the government
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.760]   wants. And as somebody said in the chat room, you Apple fights these requests in public,
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:13.840]   but in private, they hand it over. They don't have much choice to their, you know, they, no,
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.960]   no company in the US anyway has much choice. So you could pretty much assume that there is a big fat
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:26.880]   pipe between your private business and your, your government. And I think it may, I don't know if
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:32.480]   it's too late, but I almost think it's over. Right. Well, there's this remember the historically
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:38.400]   law enforcement has had the ability to get to power company records to get to phone records.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:43.280]   And we I think I think the rational might, excuse me, my personal reaction to that is that,
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:48.160]   again, in the course of an investigation where they can prove that, yeah, you know how they,
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:56.000]   you know how that the husband left a voicemail message about, hi, honey, it's 1023 pm right now
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.080]   at 1023 pm and I'm 150 miles away and would take me about two and a half hours to get here
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:07.520]   at its 1023. I just thought I'd call you now at 1023 pm to tell you that I won't be home for
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:13.520]   another 90 minutes because I can't possibly get home in less than that because I am, as I said,
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:19.520]   150 miles away at 1023 pm. Let's just check those phone records to see what time phone calls
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:25.440]   came in. That's a new, you can't lie. Turns out he left that message. Yeah, exactly. So we don't,
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.720]   we don't think that we, again, I think we're okay with the, the having certain tools. It's just a
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:36.000]   problem of understanding what happens when you keep going, keep going more and more and more.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.720]   It's the, it's like the class of problem of the frog in the pot of water,
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:46.080]   that's warm water, then it's boiling water. And by the time he realizes in danger, he's dead.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.920]   Worse than that, at this point, it's gotten to the point where I'm more worried about government
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:54.560]   surveillance. They have about terrorists. The whole thing was to protect us against terrorism.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.800]   And maybe it's done such a good job that we haven't had anything to fear.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:03.920]   But then when we become a, but they won, they won. And now we're stuck with this surveillance
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:10.080]   state. And that isn't going away regardless. No, I see, I'm, but what worries me is more,
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:16.400]   even more than the idea of the surveillance state is if things get so difficult or so easy,
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.920]   there's so much public support for let's keep us for the campaign promise of, oh, we're going to
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:24.480]   keep you safe from the terrorists, that it's like, we are now going to make it illegal for you to
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:29.520]   encrypt your conversations. Yeah, it feels like it started with good, good motivations.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:34.480]   And then they said, Hey, this is great. We will never be another crime again. It's not forget
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:40.400]   terrorists. We know everything. I think that again, if they keep increasing the water, the heat of
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:46.800]   that pot of water, we could find yourself in a situation where now Apple is Apple and Google
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:53.760]   are required to retain to include back doors that are required to not use technologies where
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:58.960]   they don't they don't have the ability to get into their own devices, that there's going to have
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:04.000]   to be some way of breaking through whatever encryption or whatever protection a consumer tries to put
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.720]   on it. That's again, that's that's not that does they don't do that in one jump, no more than,
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.840]   yeah, I'm about to go into a political thing. So I'm not going to, they don't do that in one
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:18.800]   leap. They do that in a series of leaps so that you're just taking one small further step to say,
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:23.360]   well, you know, now that we've established that we can have government people in place in every
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:27.840]   large company that doesn't charge a communication store, observe things, wouldn't it be you don't
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:33.680]   want to have this guy, this woman like in an office, what if we were just to automate things by having
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:38.320]   a backdoor and we only have the keys to it, and we can do this remotely. And then again, because
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.680]   it's it 10 years later and we've been warned, companies been warned, I was like, you know,
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.960]   that does make sense. We so easy for us to just have some sort of a master key that of course,
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:51.280]   you'd have to email us to ask us for it on a case by case basis. But yeah, yeah, we'll put it back,
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.680]   we'll weaken the security of everything we have. So that's that's the thing that we're that we
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.960]   should be worried about, not paranoid about, but at least aware about. Well, and that's my big
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:04.240]   issues. I see people frozen in paranoia. And what I really worry about is is that people will start
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:08.800]   to shoot technology, they'll stop carrying smartphones, they'll turn their back on the internet,
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:14.640]   we'll go back to a pre technology age, because people are so paranoid and so afraid. And maybe
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:18.880]   that's just and maybe that's justified. Well, they have to ask me because I think we've made
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:23.040]   great progress technology has a is a great tool for good. And it makes me sad. And this is what
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.960]   we cover. This is what we do. And we're, you know, to some degree evangelists for this stuff.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.960]   I thought that but then I realized that it wouldn't matter. Like, you know, there's just so much
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:35.280]   satellite and surveillance and cameras and microphones just ambient now that it's really the little
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:40.240]   brother. Yeah, it doesn't matter. Even if I was a smartphone, everybody in this room has a smartphone.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:44.240]   Yeah. And you know, if you have, if you go to a park to have a conversation, there's multiple,
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:48.640]   you know, surveillance cameras everywhere, anyway, on the bank machine across the roof,
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:53.440]   and the parking lot across the street. I think though that you have a nice park near you that's
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:58.800]   pretty deep remote and you'd be pretty safe to go out there and have a conversation. I'm thinking
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.080]   totally. I'll take him a good 10 minutes to retest anything over there.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:09.440]   All right. I didn't mean to get specifically started this show saying we are not going to cover
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:14.080]   this depressing subject. The movie blew thunder warned us about this in the 1980s and we didn't.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.920]   Well, that's what that's partly why I also feel like all is out there somewhere.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.920]   It's because when you see fiction doing this, sometimes that makes me think, well, this is just
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:28.320]   a natural, this paranoid rut is a natural tire track for our human minds to go into. It doesn't
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:32.960]   necessarily mean that there's something we should worry about because fiction's gone there before
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.560]   us. You know, it is a well worn rut. It is a natural thing for us to be paranoid.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.920]   I hate to say this, but we've had this problem for years. Like people want the minute we had
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.200]   fingerprint technology, they wanted a fingerprint everybody. The minute we had DNA technology,
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.680]   we wanted to DNA check everybody. And we had people of character and principal and integrity
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:52.000]   stand up and say, no, they said we understand that this would help you, but this is an intrusion on
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.560]   everybody's celebrities. And it's just something that we as a state are not prepared to tolerate
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.840]   and we lack those individuals now. It doesn't matter what party doesn't matter what country
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.360]   we lack those individuals of character. And that that is our biggest problem right now.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.880]   Meanwhile, Apple stock at a record. Hi, congratulations. All right, we're going to take
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:14.000]   Warren Buffett's buying. Wow, I watched the highly recommend the becoming Warren Buffett
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.560]   documentary on HBO. If you have access to that, really, really great documentary, it makes you
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:23.440]   feel pretty darn good about Warren and pretty happy that he's made so much money last month on
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:29.920]   Apple. Here's a guy. He's given it all back, you know, I mean, he made the largest single
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:36.080]   charitable donation in the history of all time. Something like $34 billion to the Bill and Melinda
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:40.000]   Gates Foundation and continues to donate everything he makes. It's very clear when you watch the
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.280]   documentary. He couldn't care less about the money. He has breakfast at McDonald's and his wife gives
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:51.600]   him the exact amount of the breakfast. And he says, if the stock market's down, I buy the Egg McMuffin
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:58.480]   with sausage because it's only $2.15. He saves 30 cents when the stock market's down. This guy
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:03.840]   lives in the same house he's lived in for 40 plus years. And so he doesn't care about the money.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:08.720]   As he cares about the game, he loves playing the game. He's winning, by the way. And the money,
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:13.680]   he's going to give to Bill and Melinda to use for charity, which I think is amazing. It's a great,
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:18.160]   great documentary. We play tower defense. He plays Wall Street. Yeah, pretty much that's it.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:23.360]   It's like his mind. It was like the perfect tool for winning on Wall Street. And that's just what
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:27.920]   he does. And he loves doing that. And he's happy. And he's very simple guy. It's really interesting.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:32.880]   You know, he doesn't take pleasure from almost anything. Very clean with the great grandkids.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:38.720]   And he's a sweet guy. Yeah. All right, let's take a break. We'll come back with a little bit
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:47.360]   more in just a moment. I wonder what Warren Buffett's anti-spy-not strategy is. He reads
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:53.680]   newspapers. I bet he has a flip phone. Maybe a Nokia 3310. Our show, for those of you who do
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:58.160]   want to be online, I read a great article. Oh, this was such a good article in ours,
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:06.480]   Technica this week about Wi-Fi got so bad. And it's very interesting. And I learned a lot about
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:13.440]   how Wi-Fi works. For instance, the Wi-Fi network is not a collision. The ethernet's collision base.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:19.120]   So if two packets collide, they wait for a random amount of time and re-send. Actually,
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:23.840]   it's kind of how Wi-Fi works. Two Wi-Fi access points, even if they're not yours. Let's say you see,
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:28.720]   what do you see when you go to the Wi-Fi on your Mac? When you drop that down, you see a bunch of
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:36.240]   access points, even some very weak ones. Anything that's visible to you has priority. So if you're
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:40.240]   Wi-Fi, and this is why we don't let people use Wi-Fi when they're on Skype with us, if your Wi-Fi
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:45.760]   has another season of the conversation going on, it steps back and stops until that only one
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:51.280]   conversation at a time. So if you have nine Wi-Fi access points in your area that you can see,
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:58.880]   they, you all take turns. No wonder your Wi-Fi sucks. And then, of course, we're doing more with it.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:06.000]   We want more. We want more speed. Something had to break. And what it was, and it's a, I think it's
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.040]   a year they're celebrating their anniversary, one ERO, they call it, of ERO, E-E-R-O. They were
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:18.240]   the ones that broke the log jam with the first real mesh Wi-Fi system you can set up in your home.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:24.880]   The single router method is just not working. So the way ERO works is you put an ERO unit
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:31.360]   throughout your house, each one's about 1500 square feet of coverage. So a couple of units for
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:36.080]   most homes, three units for a larger home, you can even do more. Or if there's a challenge,
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:41.200]   like my mom, it's not that our house is so big, but she has a studio out back and I need to get
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:47.760]   out there. So I set up a four-ERO system for her, and it's amazing. It's amazing and easy to set up
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:53.680]   too because you do it all with the ERO app on your phone or your tablet. The world's first whole
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:40:00.880]   home Wi-Fi system blankets your entire house in fast, reliable Wi-Fi. It's not a repeater system,
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:06.160]   it's much, much better. It's mesh. In fact, one of the great things about ERO, I was talking about
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:12.240]   this also with my graduates yesterday is ERO is one of those class of Internet of Things devices
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:20.160]   that was overbuilt. They have more processor and more RAM than they need because they know over time
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:24.400]   they're going to want to enhance the software. And they do push out new software automatically.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:29.120]   We just got 2.0 about a month ago that improves the mesh even more. Of course, it does all the
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:34.800]   things that we tell you to do like WPA2 encryption. You know, you have all the features, it even has
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:39.840]   some advanced features that I use for my server. You can reserve an IP address, you can forward,
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:44.240]   port forward, all that stuff, but easy. And if you're not experienced like my mom,
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:50.640]   the stuff she sees is very simple. The ERO Wi-Fi system, amazing. One year warranty,
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:55.360]   it'll work with whatever your existing modem is and your existing Internet service. There is a
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:41:00.400]   30 day money back guarantee. Set it up and try it. It's also beautiful in your house. It really,
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:06.560]   it looks great. You don't want mine having ERO all over the place. ERO, the original whole
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:12.160]   home Wi-Fi system to celebrate its first birthday prices have been permanently lowered. I love this
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:20.560]   three pack, three euros enough for 4,500 square feet, $100 off, $399, two pack, $299. That's 50 bucks
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:28.960]   off. Get your ERO going. Get your ERO on. And you will never hear that complaint. Hey, the
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:37.680]   Wi-Fi is down. Why is Netflix buffering? What's going on? ERO.com. You can also get it at Best Buy
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:44.480]   in Amazon. Nothing but raves. Nothing but raves for your, I mean, if I set my mom up with an
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:48.160]   ERO that tells you something, because I don't want to hear from her, she's in Rhode Island. I want
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.760]   some, by the way, which is cool. I don't have my phone with me, but I can look at her network.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:56.240]   So if she did call and say, I'm having trouble, I can say, oh, yeah, let me look. And I can see
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:00.320]   if one of the how I can literally see her the bandwidth speed to each of the ERO points.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:05.760]   I can see if they're all up. It's really nice. The software is really good. ERO.com.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:13.280]   We thank them for their support. Any invitations yet for the spring iPad event?
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:17.200]   Anybody? I've been thinking about this. And the more I think about it, the less likely I think
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.640]   there's, I mean, there just doesn't seem like anything big enough to warrant an event. If you
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.480]   look at, you know, iPad Pro updates, those are new processors and, you know, basically bouncing
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.720]   out the feature set, even if they do a 10.5 inch iPad Pro with that, I don't think that's ready.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:32.960]   And I don't think by itself, I mean, like last year, it took several things. It took the
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:37.760]   baby Pro. It took the iPhone SE. And even that was only a town hall event. I mean,
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.160]   not only a town hall, but it was a very small capacity event and you're absent any really big
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:47.360]   shattering products. I think, you know, we'll just as soon, I mean, I'm sure they'll be new
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:52.960]   products, but I don't know if Apple's going to unwrap town all the last time for the third time
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:57.920]   in a row. So no event. I don't know. Maybe I mean, I might be, I might get an invitation the minute
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.600]   we stop recording this. I just, I keep thinking of what could they introduce this fall that would
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:06.800]   warrant this spring that would warrant an event. Yeah. And that I like that I agree with you.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:11.200]   You make a good case. And they have a lot of different ways of getting the information out
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:15.200]   there. They could easily just simply say, let's rent a hotel suite in San Francisco, excuse me,
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:21.120]   let's let's set aside a couple of days in Cupertino. Let's get a hotel suite in New York
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:25.760]   for a couple of days. And we will just simply hand brief, let's say two or three dozen people
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:31.600]   about this and make sure they get, they get it'll be so much simpler, it'd be so much more direct.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:37.680]   They don't have to concentrate on crafting a keynote level message. They can just simply say,
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:42.400]   you know, they they've dealt with Renee enough one on one. They've dealt with me, for instance,
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:48.320]   and and Gruber enough one on one to know what we're interested in. They could easily do this
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:51.600]   with these sort of announcements on a very low key way and just have press releases about it.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:57.840]   I think that makes a lot of sense. I'm with Renee. I don't know for sure one way or another.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:03.680]   I would guess that there is not going to be an event in March. And I would not put any money
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:08.080]   against there and being no event in the spring. Again, anything that would involve someone having to
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:13.040]   anything that would involve a live stream of any kind. So they do a briefing with you guys.
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:16.640]   They do a press release. Oh, you know, they get all the coverage, the same kind of coverage.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:22.080]   You know, the verge and and gadget and everybody Mac world. I'm more. They'll all
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:26.400]   love it. I'll get me wrong. But yeah, a lot of work. Well, and then you got to fly down in San
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:32.080]   Francisco. I think that makes a lot of sense. And it also let's be honest, take some of the
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:39.120]   glitter away from WWDC, which is in June and from the iPhone 10th anniversary edition, which is this
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:45.360]   wall. So yeah. And usually, I mean, they don't always have the spring event. They had it when they
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:50.880]   introduced the iPhone, the original iPad, the iPad to the iPad three, they skipped it for two
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:55.680]   years and they brought it back for the Apple Watch official launch, along with a new MacBook.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:59.120]   But every time they've done it, it's been because they've had substantially new products that they
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:03.120]   just felt they had to give stage time to because every time they hold an event, it's a huge thing
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:08.800]   for the company. It's a lot of resources and a lot of planning. And again, iPhone is in the fall
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:13.360]   and it's unclear that there's anything. I would love to have it. Totally love to have it. But it's
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.960]   unclear that anything that would actually require them to get 100 to 200 people together in the room.
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.520]   Yeah. Definitely. You definitely reflect on the fact that this is not a pick up
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:27.520]   COIO basketball game. You don't just say, you don't just have the janitor unlock the doors and
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:31.520]   make sure that they can they can sweep up at the end of it. It really is like putting on an off
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:36.960]   bread way show, at least the way that Apple does it. So yeah, if I think that they're going to be
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.400]   very carefully weighing whether what they're going to get out of having an open event like that.
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:44.160]   Million dollar podium just to make sure that the phone returns around.
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:48.320]   We didn't really cover it. But last week, while we were doing the show, Apple was having its
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:55.600]   annual shareholders meeting in Cooportino. And at that meeting, Tim Cook said some encouraging
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:01.280]   things. He said, we're not abandoning pro users. You will see us do more, he said,
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:05.920]   with Max and professional software, creative and pro markets, very important to the company.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:10.880]   He said, this is the last shareholder meeting. We'll have it one infinite loop next year.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:22.240]   Apple Park at the Steve Jobs Theater. There was a shareholder proposal to diversify upper level
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:27.200]   management. The shareholders decided they'd prefer the results they're getting and didn't want to rock
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:34.240]   the boat. So they rejected that. Yeah, it's a hard case to me. Apple's an old company. If
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:38.160]   Apple was formed today, they'd have a very different looking, upper executives, because of the people
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:41.760]   around. But that doesn't take them off the hook for the board of directors. They've had women in the
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:47.120]   upper upper division in the past, but it's all white men right now, right? Except for sure.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.800]   Well, I mean, it's been the same. It's not that it's all women. It's been exactly the same people,
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:54.400]   more or less for the last 10 or 15 years. But again, they could change the board of directors.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:59.600]   If I am the least qualified to speak to how difficult or easy this would be, but if
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:05.280]   I would dislike it for optics sake, and that's the horrible way to phrase it. But I think Apple
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.640]   could do a lot just by changing their board of directors and Steve Jobs famously changed the
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.920]   entire board of directors one day. And if you suddenly had a board of directors, that's not the
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:16.320]   diversity purposes. No, but I mean, if there is something that you think is a benefit and you
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.920]   believe that diversity is really powerful enough and you don't have a lot of movement in the upper
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:24.240]   senior vice president positions, then the board of directors is the place you go. Yeah, but I think
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:29.440]   the shareholders are looking at Johnny I've and Eddie Q and Craig Federighi and yes, Angela
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:36.400]   Arendt's who is the senior vice president for retail and this is things are going well.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:43.040]   Why rock the boat? There are a few women on the upper level management, Lisa Jackson is a vice
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:47.360]   president for environmental policy and social initiatives and Denise Young Smith, an African
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:54.240]   American woman's VP for human resources. Again, he was Cuban. I mean, it's not what a modern
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:48:01.200]   company really has. Yeah, if you look at the board, there are two women. But you know, it's Al Gore,
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:07.280]   former chairman of Genentech, Arthur Levinson, James Bell from Boeing, Tim Cook, of course, Robert
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:14.320]   Iger from Disney. And there are a couple of women, Susan Wagner from Black Rock and Andrea Young from
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:23.920]   Iger Mean. Well, that's that's that's that's historical. You can't get around a certain fact that if you
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:30.880]   believe that diversity amongst a community of professionals is important, there is nothing
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:35.840]   stopping you from doing that. The talent is out there, the brains are out there, the people who
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:40.400]   will work well with that group are out there. You just have to figure out what you're doing wrong
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:48.400]   to not not get them in and and fix that problem. So this sounds a lot harsher than I'm actually
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:54.320]   intending it to be. I mean that if it's if they don't have if Apple doesn't have a diverse board
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:49:00.480]   or diverse management, it's because they don't think that's super important to them. They could
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:06.880]   definitely do it, I think. They said that's and that's not and I really need to I wish that I wish
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:12.560]   that I were writing this because I could stare at a sentence and change it 90 times. I firmly
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:17.600]   believe in the basic truth of that statement that if you if you need to hire 10 engineers,
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:22.160]   there is nothing stopping you from hiring five. There is no excuse that says that we could not
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:27.760]   simply we could not find five talented women to fill these positions. It's because you did not
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:31.520]   want to work hard enough. You didn't think that was a prior enough priority to actually do it.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:38.400]   That said, I'm not saying that is as simple as it's as simple as that. But again, if Apple
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:45.840]   if Apple felt that this is part of their definition as a company, they could do that. Again, this is
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:49.360]   remember this isn't this isn't this is a vote that the shareholders took. The shareholders are
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:54.640]   going to take a point of view of we're only here to make sure that X dollars coming in
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:50:02.240]   brings brings back to us a factor X times Y of dollars coming back out. But again, it's every
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:07.280]   single tech company from the large to the small has to face that fact that unless you're a group
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:14.560]   of a group of friends that are that are that are basing basing your business on social connections
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:18.320]   and you just don't happen to have a whole lot of male friends or female friends or non-white
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:24.800]   friends. Once you get to the scale of Microsoft or Google or Apple, you have to at least confront
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:32.400]   the fact that the reason why are hiring of women of people who are non-white men is dismal. It's
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:36.080]   because we this is not a problem that we're making it a high priority to solve.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:47.840]   Cook didn't mention anything about iPads, but he did say like new iPads, but he did say the iPad
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:55.680]   Pro has been nicely received. So that's good. He repeated the assertion from the
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:51:01.760]   analyst call it his company couldn't quote couldn't make enough of the Apple Watch Series 2
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:08.080]   and that last quarter was the best one yet for the wearable. He said the AirPods are a cultural
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:16.480]   phenomenon. I don't know if that's really okay. How are they selling though? And I maybe I have
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:22.160]   a bad pair, but I still not in stock. Yeah, I continue to have problems with my AirPods dropping
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:31.760]   calls and I got that weird problem again where I was making a call and the voice with the
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:38.400]   boys that was pitched in the past, I've had it too high. It's like the bit rate gets screwed up in
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:43.280]   the Bluetooth. Nobody else is reporting this though. So maybe I just have a bad problem I have is
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.640]   that I can't use them with Slack, but I can't use Bluetooth with Slack. So I can't use to well,
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:54.320]   that's not yeah, that's normal. He noted that Apple Pay quote hit an air pocket.
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:52:01.520]   Now that's bizarre because an air pocket could lift you up or it could plummet you to the ground.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:06.320]   So I'm not sure what he means by that. I think he means it's usually with the cap. That's what
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:11.280]   the captain says to say, please don't look on the left hand side of the plate in an air pocket.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:17.600]   Now here's the air pocket. An air pocket got sucked into our number two engine causing
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:25.520]   blades of air to shear off and embed themselves into of air pocket to that's no air pocket. That's
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:32.480]   a hot pocket. We just thought it would be nice to land in Dulles instead of San Francisco today.
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:37.760]   Just for a change. The weather's better. Had an Air Force base that on a disused runway.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:45.920]   He also mentioned 20 million subscribers to Apple music. Now that you can compare to Spotify's
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:55.920]   announcement this week that they hit 50 million paid subscribers. That is more than twice Apple
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:53:00.960]   music. It's interesting. The Spotify is still growing. And we talked a little bit about this
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:06.480]   on Twitter on Sunday and two of the panelists, the young members of the panel, both were
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:14.080]   avid Spotify users. I love Spotify. I'm not a subscriber, but it really is a great system.
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.400]   I just think it shows the market is still growing.
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:25.520]   It is clearly. But the problem really is can Spotify survive? I think they're losing money.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:32.160]   The record industry has a stake in Spotify, but at any point they could pull the plug.
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:37.040]   Same for any of these independent services. Apple music can continue because it's Apple and
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.400]   they have other revenue streams.
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.640]   I think the key to it.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:47.600]   I think one of the reasons why one of the few things that Spotify has going for it is that
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:52.240]   I think the record industry does want to have a streaming service that's
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:56.560]   not enough that they can push it around. They can't push around Google. They can't push around
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:03.040]   Apple. Both those companies have so much inventory right now to say that I don't want my product
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:09.520]   to be on the defining music service of what is on nearly most of the phones in the world and the
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:13.520]   defining music service that's on the rest of the phones in the world, you don't have that ability.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.760]   They need to have a safe house to go back to.
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:24.160]   Back to AirPods. You reminded me of one of my favorite tweets from last week,
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:31.680]   Julia Love, who is a journalist at Reuters, I think, a new Silicon Valley courtship
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:36.800]   rituals, teens sharing AirPods on the bus. I do that with my wife, actually.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:44.880]   It's not adorable. It's like those old movies on Turner Classic movies like Andy Hardy and his
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.560]   date. I'm not sure.
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.320]   I'm listening to what I'm listening to.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:51.280]   Sipping from Ice Cream Soda from Two Different Strong.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:57.040]   Yeah, so cute. We were walking. We were on a hike and she wanted to listen to a book and I said,
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:00.640]   "Hey, let's listen to it on my phone because I have my AirPods with me and you can have one.
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:04.240]   I can have the other." It worked great. That actually is one of the...
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:06.400]   Heather, your heads together are pulled out of one person.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.760]   Yeah, it's no good if you use it. We've done that before the wires and it really doesn't work.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:16.640]   This is really a great solution. So I'm not surprised. By the way, Julia Love should be writing
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:19.280]   about courtship rituals. That's awesome.
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:32.080]   Let's see. What else? Second gen Apple TV is obsolete. No more hardware support.
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:35.440]   If you can see a new Apple TV, we need to see a 4K Apple TV, don't we?
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:41.360]   I mean, yeah. It's arguably not the biggest problem Apple TV has, but yeah,
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:45.120]   new hardware is good. One of the biggest problems we have with that box is like,
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:49.280]   "Who is it meant to be for?" They could have done a 4K box, but it's already expensive compared
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:55.200]   to competitors. When you're using iPhone quality chip sets in a set-top box, it's a lot of overkill
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:59.440]   and there's price tag that comes with it. I should point out, though, that the other guys are doing it.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:03.920]   Roku's got a 4K Roku Ultra. I have a shield, which is admittedly quite expensive.
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:06.080]   They're using T-Fills at goods that Apple's not using.
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:09.360]   Apple maybe needs to make a dedicated Apple TV chip.
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:18.080]   Oh, interesting idea. I think they need to make it special. I really can't see a big
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:22.160]   difference between the Apple TV and a Roku. I don't know how to recommend
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:26.800]   there's one difference. You get iTunes and you get Apple music, right? Outside of things that
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:33.760]   Apple can prevent other companies from doing. That's not a really proud way of innovation.
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:39.600]   I'm actually considering buying a second Nvidia Shield for the bedroom because
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:44.720]   every time I'm using the... I got the latest Apple TV in the bedroom, I've got the Nvidia Shield
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:49.040]   in the living room. I just keep missing the way that... AI keep missing the way that the
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:54.800]   shield works upstairs. Also, if there's a way to turn off that stupid, stupid, stupid,
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:59.280]   having the TV app as the central concierge when you hit the home button, you can't turn that off.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:03.440]   It's a Canada. There's a setting. I hate it. I never...
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.640]   I know.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:09.360]   I never... That was a blatant power grab by Apple that I really dislike.
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:14.880]   It's stupid. It's so easy to simply... I was expecting there to be an option somewhere.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:18.560]   Okay, well, what if there must be an option to say, "What do I want the home button to go to?
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:22.400]   Do I want it to go to the Apple launcher or do I want to go to TV?" And it's like...
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:28.640]   There's the historical thing about how in user interfaces, they always count the number of clicks.
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:32.320]   It takes the user to get to from where they are to the thing they want to do.
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:37.360]   And there's always this... It always takes me two clicks because the thing that I want to get to
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:44.240]   is never in the TV app. Never, not once. It's always like, "Ugh, never." So I have to tap it again to
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:48.640]   get to the YouTube app or tap it again to get to the Hulu app. You can change the home button.
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:53.120]   It makes me... Behavior. You're just looking at it. I've done it because that drives me crazy too.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:56.240]   I can't find it. It's in there. I'll find it for you.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:00.960]   I'll keep looking. It's in there. It's probably, as is often the case with Apple's settings,
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:05.120]   somewhere that you would at least expect it. There you go. There are all the settings to find it.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:11.040]   I do think this is going to become important. I'll tell you why. Not because the Apple TV is an
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:16.080]   important business, but almost all the new TV is being sold are 4K. So people are just not going
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:23.440]   to look at devices that don't support their new TVs. And there's no other way to get iTunes and
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:29.360]   Apple Music into your home theater system. So if people don't, if they do what Andy didn't buy
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:34.400]   a shield, they're going to start buying the same movies. There's no appreciable difference between
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:40.480]   Google movies and TV or Amazon's movies and TVs availability. It's the same. I don't think there's
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:45.920]   any exclusives to Apple to iTunes. Maybe in music there is, but not in television and movies.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:49.200]   There's no portability though. So you can't buy it. You can't move stuff you bought on one service
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:52.720]   onto another. Well, there is because that's why you buy it on Google because then you can play
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:56.160]   it on YouTube, which means you can play it on everything, including your Apple TV. Apple's going
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:59:00.320]   to lose this market very rapidly. The market's shifting and they're going to lose it.
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:04.080]   I don't disagree, but I don't trust any of them. I thought Amazon has crossed
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.400]   platform till they decide they don't want to support a competing TV box.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:13.840]   Well, I agree. Well, no. It's on Roku. It's on my Nvidia Shield as of the last update.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:21.200]   I do see your point that they have the ability to stop supporting anything that is not their
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:28.080]   own store, but Apple is not and they are right now and they don't see for now. They don't see any
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:35.600]   indication of skipping that over. Google also, I'm saying that under no circumstances,
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:41.120]   can I recommend anybody buy content from the iTunes store? There is no upside whatsoever to it
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:46.480]   and a huge downside to it. I'm not going to, I can spend because, especially because I'm a cable
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:50.720]   cutter, with there is a series that I really, really love and I don't want to just add a
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:56.480]   subscription to my sling account or whatever. I will buy the entire season and own it in HD
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:02.000]   and I have no faith whatsoever that I will ever, I can't be spending hundreds of dollars on
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.600]   something that requires me to buy an iPad or requires me to own an Apple TV. That's
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:14.480]   stupid. That's offensive on a basic level. I don't happen to believe that Google is going to
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:20.640]   cut that off anytime soon because if you want to be more simple about it, their business
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:24.720]   model is that it is to their advantage to have YouTube, the YouTube app on every single platform
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:28.800]   they can get that will help them to sell more content. Apple has never created the
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:33.840]   indication that we were going to help you to become platform agnostic. We will let you, we feel so
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:38.320]   good about our services that we will let you use them on any device whatsoever. No, there's a
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:42.800]   certain amount of lock in and not always a whole bunch of benefit. So I will never, until the
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:47.120]   situation fundamentally changes, I will always recommend actively the people not buy
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.920]   copy protected content from the iTunes store. Unless it's an iPad. I don't disagree. I do
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.920]   blame DRM as a main culprit but a lot of people don't have a choice still. Up until recently,
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.400]   we only had iTunes and then we got Google and I just gotten it on. So it's not always.
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:05.280]   Many of us have a library of stuff that we purchase on iTunes. I can guarantee you I'm not
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.360]   going to have to decide that library. I might still rent from Apple because that doesn't really
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:13.120]   matter but when I buy stuff, I am not buying it on iTunes, that's for sure. I don't know.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.760]   A lot of people still buy the platter and then rip it because they can still do that.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:23.360]   Right. Me too. Me too. I either rent because I just want to watch it once or if I want to own it,
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:28.080]   I will buy it even on DVD if I have to. I would much rather have the standard resolution
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:33.520]   rip that is definitely going to work that I can put on my server and move on to any device I want.
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:40.560]   Right? As we speak on my NAS, last night I had bought a brand new 128 gigabyte
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:49.680]   thumbnail drive, USB 3 put into the USB slot and was moving my entire music library on it
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:57.600]   and a whole bunch of TV shows and movies because I now I like the idea of I can basically move this
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:02.320]   between have this library that instead of syncing before I leave for a bunch of travel,
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.040]   I'm going to be doing next month. I can just simply decide that if I have a Raspberry Pi and this,
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:12.800]   I can basically plug this $20, $30 box into the HDMI port of the TV wherever I go to
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:18.320]   and have my entire music library and like a hundred hours of TV and movies and the TV movies
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:25.520]   are going to be there because I was able to put it into some sort of non DRM format and similarly,
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:30.960]   I could just simply plug it into my MacBook and just watch this all the time. That's the sort of
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.600]   flexibility you get when you're not locked into one system. The DRM is not good for anybody,
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:41.840]   but again, at least get a buy in a format where it will be not going to be locked into buying the
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:45.120]   same phone for the rest of your life or the same tablet for the rest of your life or the same TV
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:50.320]   box for the rest of your life. Ultraviolet, I'm going all in. Most I would guess most people aren't
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:57.680]   really going to buy and rip stuff though. That's probably an enthusiast thing to do, right?
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:04.400]   It's yeah, I that's that's definitely next level sort of stuff. But again, you can still buy,
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:09.200]   I do recommend Amazon is a little bit slower to support has been a little bit slower to support
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:16.480]   other platforms than they once were. But because the fact they're not supporting Apple TV is a
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:22.400]   really black mark on on their business there. I admit on their committed platform, but Google
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:27.520]   seems to be we will if we can if we can put our YouTube app on it, we will let you have your entire
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:32.560]   DRM library on it. And that's good enough for me. I admit I did yesterday order the Blu-ray of
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:37.440]   Once-A-Pina time in America when I learned that you could get the original four hour and 11 minute
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:50.320]   cut for our an 11 minute cut on TV. That is that as an aside, I love how freaky that movie is where
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:56.480]   there is an ending, but you're free to decide whatever you whatever happened. Have you seen the
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:01.760]   full version? Because you know, the theatrical release was cut down by two hours and made no
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:07.520]   sense as a result, right? I've not seen it the full version. No, it's it's fantastic. It is.
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:14.240]   It's like a $12 dollar d Blu-ray purchase. So I thought, you know, if this is the only way I can
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:20.080]   own it, this is what I'm gonna actually sorry, $26, but still a good deal. I got I got $26.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:25.040]   Yeah. Yeah, I had a spring for I didn't know the whole story of it, but
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:31.280]   it was released in its full version at Cannes, the film festival, and got a 15 minute standing
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:36.800]   ovation. And then of course, Hollywood got it and said, we can't release a four hour movie.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:41.680]   We're gonna cut it down in half and released as one would expect and it completely
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:46.080]   incots comprehensible mishmosh, which didn't get very good reviews as in fact was mocked.
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:50.720]   You know, it's it's often considered like this horrific, you know, bizarre movie.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:57.840]   So I've never seen the full on cut versions. I'm looking forward to it. It's it's it's it's
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:04.400]   supremely intricate the way the plot works. So that it's it's kind of like it's kind of like if you had
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:10.480]   the usual suspects and you decided to cut 30 minutes out of it. It's okay. You can make it
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:15.440]   into a conventional who done it, but then you'll have a really conventional who done it as opposed
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:19.440]   to something brilliant. I yeah, I learned about I don't know how I stumbled on it from this website
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:24.160]   Cinephilia and beyond once upon a time America butchered film rising up as a phoenix and it talks
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:31.200]   about the whole story of this and by the way has a PDF of the screenplay. Yeah, which is
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:37.760]   I think 400 pages. Heaven's Gate is my wet whale because there was this wonderful book called
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:45.520]   Final Cut that was the vice president at the United Artists, the the company that got in many
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:52.640]   ways cease to exist because of the failure of this movie wrote this beautiful first first person
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:58.240]   like a story about here's here's how this disaster happened from my point of view and there was the
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:04.720]   three there was like a three hour 20 minute version that debuted at Cannes. There was that
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.720]   people didn't understand and then when it flopped a can they cut it down to like two hours and 20
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:14.640]   minutes for release. But the original version that they screened for the studio was five like five
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:21.440]   and a half six hours. And every time I see I saw the the the article release version that didn't
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:26.720]   make sense but looked like there was something there I saw then the the the the Cannes version
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:31.920]   that still didn't make sense but it made more sense. And now I'm just like I've heard floating
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:37.680]   around the underground video there is like the six hour no way in hell it could possibly be a
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:42.240]   released version. And I keep thinking that there must be a version of this movie that's actually
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:46.720]   brilliant because it was mocked right but Chameeno is a great director so there must be something
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:52.560]   there. Yeah. Yeah. It's well or when water world comes out and it's uncut glory that's when I'm
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:58.720]   gonna get excited. Yeah. Well I had no time to turn this into Mac Mac movies break weekly but
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:03.760]   the the the I had the same experience with the abyss where I remember seeing it on video shortly
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:08.160]   after it was reaching a release and was it was okay it was kind of a fully kind of just not really
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:13.120]   a very James Cameron action movie. And then when they restored it for laser disc and they put back
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.200]   in everything that was in the original cut and they also finished a sequence that after they
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.080]   realized they had to cut it down they say okay well we're not even gonna do the effects for this
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:24.480]   last sequence. It became one of my favorite movies of all time James Cameron or no. So it's
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:29.440]   there's always like it's like the gambler like I've lost $15,000 but if I just keep gambling I'll
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:35.360]   make it all back. There is a point to this though which is that digital technology has at least
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:41.040]   given us a chance and and nice home theaters and great TVs to experience these movies as they were
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:48.480]   intended. I doubt I have to look but I very much doubt that Amazon offers once upon a time in
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:55.200]   America and it's four hour 11-minute version on streaming. Yeah it's too bad like for instance
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:08:01.920]   Amadeus is only the whatever whatever package the studio offers to streaming services they only
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:08.400]   offer the restored edition which I think is really really damages the original theatrical cut.
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:13.760]   And so that's why that's why I did I had a bite on Blu-ray and then despecialize it at a cut out
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:18.400]   all the scenes they added in. Wow. Just so that on my home library I would have what I think is
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.000]   the real version of Amadeus because they don't have the original version available.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.640]   Saw that on Broadway with Franklin Gellow one of the great my greatest Broadway experiences.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:32.480]   It was an amazing amazing show. Here Andy just for your delectation is how you turn off that crap
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:39.920]   TV hub. This is an Apple insider. You go into settings, remotes and devices and then there's a
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:45.600]   home button setting there which you can set back from TV app to home screen on our app TV.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:51.360]   Okay. Hallelujah. That's the first thing I did. I was not thinking it would be under remote
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:58.160]   exactly exactly right. That's always the TV is a device. Okay. It's you know it's to me it's always
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:03.280]   it's the same thing on the iPhone you know you find things in the strangest places you just have
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:07.600]   to read through all of those settings. We're gonna take a break. Christmas tree the entire structure.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:15.680]   Christmas tree the entire structure. Oh my my watch is ringing. It's oh I like this it's local
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:21.120]   marketing should I answer it? Actually it's it's funny my mom lost her phone the other day and I
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:24.240]   didn't know it because she was talking to me on the Apple watch for the first time and she was so
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:29.840]   happy. She's like I my watch rang and I answered it now. I'm talking miss ago and then we showed her
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:33.120]   how to quickly tell it to page her iPhone and she went and found her iPhone. That's I do that
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:39.920]   almost every day every day. I felt like a space like a secret agent. It's good to have a son
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:44.560]   who's in technology. Well she just texted me. She was like I took a phone call on my watch.
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:55.120]   Sadie. Guess where I'm calling you from my wristwatch. Yes. My son's been up for me.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:59.520]   From Cara Swisher is going to be on Twitter. I think this Sunday from her excellent
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:06.160]   recode decode podcast. She's talking to Ron Johnson who was head of retail at Apple and of course
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:15.760]   created the first Apple stores. But Johnson said Steve said the genius bar is so idiotic
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:21.840]   it'll never work. It'll never work. So if you want to hear the genesis of the Apple store
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:29.440]   recode decode this week with Cara Swisher and Ron Johnson. So this is this is a quote
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:33.600]   Johnson said he said to me it's Thanksgiving weekend coming up. Why don't you write down what
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:38.240]   you would do for a store? How would you approach retail? Tell me about it. So I went back wrote
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:42.080]   this 10 page thesis of why Apple should do stores which they should be like blah blah blah. I get
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:46.560]   the call. Hey, can you come back? I walk in jobs goes hey, thanks for coming back.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:51.280]   I said what do you think of my thesis? And he goes well I didn't like it very much but that's
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:57.280]   okay. Let's talk. And that's how he got the job. I remember the day I came in and told Steve about
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:01.760]   the genius bar idea. He says that's so idiotic. He'll never work. He said Ron you might have the
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:05.200]   right idea but here's the big gap. I never met someone who knows technology who knows how to
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:10.960]   connect with people. They're all geeks. You can call it the geek bar. Johnson defended the
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:14.480]   genius bar said kids who were in their 20s today grew up in a very different world. They all know
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:20.080]   technology and that's who you're going to get to work in the store. The next day jobs called
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:26.160]   Apple's counsel to trademark the phrase genius bar. What a great story. We'll have more in just a
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:31.760]   moment. Andy and I go for the Chicago Sun. Sun times and by the way, thank you. I P T L. We're
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:38.160]   trying a new video system instead of Skype because we've had so much trouble with the lip sync
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:43.440]   lately and Skype Skype changed their codec about I don't know a few months ago from silk to
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:48.240]   something else and it's been terrible. And we thought we'd try this new thing. I P D T L and
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:52.880]   it's I think working. What do you think you said you're hearing some clicks? I'm here some clicks
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:56.800]   from your end but it might be through the browser. It might be a plug that I've got here. We don't
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:00.320]   hear about this. And for me, your lip sync's good. Your picture is good. Your sound's good. So I'm
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:11.760]   very happy. I'll get glass of water while Fuffy. Yes, he's doing ventriloquism tricks. Ladies and
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:17.440]   gentlemen, also with us Renee Richie from imore.com, which also has an article on how to use the Apple
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.840]   TV app and change that and I should have I should have linked to that sooner. Sorry. I'm still on
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:28.720]   the old but no. Actually, Skype works fine with you and I think it's I don't know what it is. It's
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:32.800]   but it's nice to have an alternative. So we may be using more of this IP DTO.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:36.960]   Our show today brought to you by texture. If you love magazines and who doesn't?
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:44.080]   Some of the best journalism in the world is still being done in magazines. I like magazines
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:48.640]   because often the magazine articles are are written for somebody who's going to sit down and
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:52.800]   take the time to read it. You know, the New Yorker, the National Geographic, love the images.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:58.240]   Vanity Fair. There's always a great piece in Vanity Fair. There's always a great article
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.800]   in Rolling Stone. Actually, they're doing amazing journalism these days. The Atlantic, I read cover
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:06.960]   to cover, but I don't want to actually subscribe to all those magazines. That'd be hundreds and
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:12.240]   hundreds of dollars. And if I buy a newsstand issue, that's actually even more expensive,
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:17.360]   but I was so glad when I found texture. Texture is an app. It's like Netflix for magazines. It
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:22.880]   lets you subscribe to 200 more than 200 of the best magazines in the world for $10 a month.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:28.640]   All your favorites, you can't actually favorite any individual magazine. It'll download automatically.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:33.040]   You get the current edition from the newsstand, but you also get back episodes back. What do you
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:38.000]   call them? Back issues. You also get things you can't get in print, like videos, the sports
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.320]   illustrated swimsuit issues in there, but also videos, right? National Geographic's images
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:46.320]   look so much better, frankly, on your iPad than they ever could when they're printed.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:50.400]   And then I get also stuff that I wouldn't probably subscribe to, like Variety and Billboard
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:57.280]   at age. Those are magazines for my business. And the behalf of them there available to me is
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:02.160]   really fantastic. If you like housing, you'll love dwell. If you like fashion, you'll love Marie
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:07.600]   Clary, Vogue is in there, everything's in there. Texture was selected as one of Apple's top
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:13.520]   iPad apps for 2016. It's certainly one of my favorites. And when I travel, I'm going on a
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:18.000]   fly now to see my son tomorrow. You better believe I've got texture on my iPad loaded up and ready to
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.880]   read the texture app. It's entirely digital. It's environmentally friendly, no more coffee table
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.880]   clutter. And you're going to get all the magazines you want. Search them. Yeah, that's another thing
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:32.560]   you can't do with a print magazine. Mark what you like. Check out back issues with you bonus video
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:37.520]   content. And they have curation too. They'll help you find articles and magazines you maybe
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:43.040]   don't even heard of have heard of time magazines in there. It's great for investigative journalism,
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:50.240]   politics, fashion news. Yeah, gossip, of course, I get my people magazine fixed too. I love it.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:55.680]   You will too. That's why we've got a 14 day free trial for you. Two weeks free. When you go to
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:02.240]   texture to ext, like text, get it, get it, get it, texture to extu are e.com slash
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:06.240]   Twitch two weeks free. Give it a try. I think you really will like it, especially if you've
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:10.480]   got a trip coming up texture.com slash Twitch. I didn't mention this, but you can have five
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:17.360]   different devices with one texture subscription. So I have it on my iPhone on my iPad. Lisa's
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:21.040]   got it on her iPhone and iPad and that still leaves one over. So it really works out great.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:27.760]   texture.com slash Twitch. Also, huh?
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:34.080]   Team Vogue has been awesome lately. Teen Vogue's political. It's so funny. Those teens are woke.
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:40.320]   They're schooling. Yeah, there's a love it. Apple board members getting stock grants.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:46.560]   Each of them worth $253,000. So nice little just like here you go. Of course,
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:50.800]   if you're like Warren Buffett, you're going to hold that stock, hold that stock.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.720]   That it growth through the magic of compound interest.
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:16:02.800]   That's that seems like that seems like a small amount. They pay get paid also though, right?
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:07.440]   But I think it's always an honorarium sort of. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:13.040]   Stipened. Yeah, it'd be I'd be cool. Actually, you also get little perks because for instance,
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:19.920]   Al Gore's got a new version of his movie and inconvenient truth, which they screened this
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:26.080]   week in Palo Alto and of course, Al Gore's on the Apple board. And Tim Cook shows up to to
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:33.040]   introduce it in the theater. Silicon Valley film debut of an inconvenient truth truth to power.
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:38.160]   It is opening remarks Cook said while there are signs all around of the climate crisis,
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:41.680]   there is plenty of reason to be optimistic, renewable energies are developed and deployed
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:47.520]   around the world. And actually Al Gore praised Apple after the after the showing the screening,
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:51.680]   commending them for using 100% renewable energy in some countries and pushing hard to do the
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:58.560]   same on a global scale. Of course, their new Apple spaceship campus is 100% solar. And of course,
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:02.720]   Greenpeace last month declared Apple the greatest tech company for the third straight.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:07.920]   You're in a row. You were going to say perks like an updated version of aperture.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:12.720]   Ah, yeah, well, that would be the secret perk that no one's talking about. Literally.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:18.400]   Aperture update just for you as a board member. It's the goal. He has your update.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:24.240]   All right, we got to get back to this conversation we had last week. We remember the Wall Street
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:29.280]   Journal said lightning will be replaced by type C. Well, they didn't quite say that. Now Ming
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:34.240]   Chico says they got it wrong. Was it sloppy reporting or just they didn't understand?
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:39.120]   This doesn't make sense either. But Ming Chico says, no, they're going to keep the lightning port.
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:43.440]   But on the other end of the cable will be a type C adapter and not have a type C power brick.
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:48.480]   In their I have for the I that's what they have for the iPad Pro 12 inch for the supercharging.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:54.320]   Yeah. And I have a dozen of those cables. I mean, that would not be a big story.
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:59.440]   But people here. I mean, we don't like it's a it's broken telephone, right? Like you hear a
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:03.040]   little bit and then you add it in with all the other stuff. So last week, both of you kind of
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:06.400]   said, well, it would certainly be painful for Apple if they had been enlightening, but it would
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:10.800]   be it would also be a good thing and the proper thing to do in the long run. Do you think you're
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:16.080]   going to maybe that's not what we're going to get? And then we did a good job of hedging that they
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:21.600]   were maybe you had that was USB on the other hand. I would like to see USB C, but I can also
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:25.680]   understand why Apple be very reluctant to cause that much pain. And he's mic is off. Oh, and he's
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:32.720]   muted. Yes. Unmute. So press that button. He said before the show, one thing I learned with this
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:37.600]   new software where the unmute mute button is nice. I was telling you that I like the way that when
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:41.920]   you go into like full screen mode, whatever it's it makes better use the screen real straight,
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:46.000]   but it does not put it doesn't put a mute button on the screen as it does with Skype.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   But yeah, I thought I was just going to say that I think that's Renee and I were in complete
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.280]   agreement that neither of us believe that we want to be blamed for getting this wrong.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:05.920]   Only only that I don't I don't see Apple as having a problem with dropping lightning after
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:10.400]   after five years. If they think that, hey, if we're going to be putting USB C on every single one of
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:15.600]   our devices in the future, why would leave out the iPhone? Yeah, I also I also see them thinking
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:21.120]   that it's okay for us to make the lightning connector into well, we want to have a we want to have a
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:27.600]   connector that we absolutely control and we can change at any given moment. If we want to decide that
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:36.000]   gosh, we thought we thought that we could if we truly want to have a phone without any bezel
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.960]   whatsoever, we need to be able to modify that connector so that it will still accept lightning
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:47.440]   cables, but it still will fit in whatever space remains after we have a sheet of OLED that has to
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.600]   cover up every single square inch of the front of it. But yeah, I don't think Apple would be
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.880]   pretty broken up about the idea that Oh, oh, no, you mean that we're gonna sell lots and lots of
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:04.800]   $35 cables to people? Oh, that's terrible. What will we because we already have the fire marshal
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:10.240]   on our on our butts about blocking the exits with all that money anyway. Dang, we're gonna
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:15.840]   have to just put in the floorboards and oh, yeah, the other thing is a rounding error for Apple.
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:20.400]   Like they just want the control over that but also lightning in USB C is an implementation detail.
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:24.320]   They will use whatever gives them the best advantage at any point in time and they will as they have
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:28.640]   in the future, we were lentlessly fearless about changing that, you know, moments and all of this.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:33.200]   They're gonna have to do it at some point, right? Feel the flow of the USB C or they'll be something
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:37.200]   else anyway. Well, that's the real problem. I'm not you switch to USB C five years from now,
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.640]   you have to switch again to whatever the next thing is where I went through. We all do that USB
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:48.080]   A to USB, many to USB micro. It's awful, right? And it bears mentioning that even in like,
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:52.720]   even in the Android space, you don't know if you're gonna have a micro USB, most of us switching to
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:58.080]   USB C. There's things are in some I would really love to have the ideal of having one
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:03.200]   one power brick to rule them all. But I know that I'm always going to be traveling with at least
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:07.760]   three different kinds of cables all the time. I grussell holly today was just looking at because
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:11.840]   Nintendo switch turns out doesn't just charge off the power bricks the way you might want it to,
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:15.680]   even though you plug it in. It's incredibly sensitive and there's very and this is like a
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:18.960]   brand new device and it doesn't work with all the power bricks that everybody already has and
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:23.120]   you want to throw your hands up in there. It's micro USB or USB C on the charger or that?
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:26.800]   Well, I think on the I you just plug it in with whatever the adapter is into a power brick,
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.680]   but it's incredibly sensitive to the voltage and the average and all those things to make it
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:35.040]   up on a wide variety of them. That's too bad because it only gets three hours. I bought one
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:39.920]   mine times this week, but it only gets three hours battery life and I'm thinking for a plain
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:43.120]   trip you need you're gonna want to use an you know like an anchor battery or something.
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:46.080]   We can make these gizmos maddening will figure out a way to do it.
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:56.000]   More of more Apple hardware plans based on completely flimsy evidence, a patent application
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:02.240]   that shows an Apple pencil holder for iPads again references used with iPhone. Of course,
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:06.160]   you're going to make a patent you're going to cover all your bases. I don't think that that
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:14.320]   means there'll be a pencil. Although Tim might have kind of let slip a little something that the
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:20.320]   iPhone well this just goes back to the iPhone 7 which did not support the pencil, but maybe the
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:25.680]   iPhone 8. I mean the pencil supports anything Apple wants it to so Tim Cook probably has used
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:32.080]   it but you have to give up 3D touch if you do a pencil right? No so the difference and this is
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:37.040]   a little bit complicated but Force Press is a name for a blanket of different technologies
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:40.960]   implemented in different ways. So on the Apple watch I believe it shoots sideways and that's why
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:44.560]   it's a binary state. It can't tell where your finger is on the display. It can just tell that
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:48.240]   you're putting pressure on the iPhone it shoots up and down from the LED light and that's why it
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:52.400]   can do both pressure and position. So you have both those things on the trackpad that has four
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:56.560]   sort of mechanisms that it uses to balance those things out. So it's all wide range of technology.
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:00.960]   The Apple pencil because the technology for Force Press doesn't support really large screens it
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:05.360]   can't accurately measure deformation on a 9.7 inch screen. For example they put all the
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:08.640]   pressure sensitive stuff in the tip of the pencil. So you could take the tip of the pencil and
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:13.440]   stick it on an iPhone and you'd still be able to read it off the pencil. It's just a question of
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:19.520]   whether Apple wants to do it or not. I had no idea was that complicated. It's they make stuff look
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:26.080]   so easy. Yep. Wow. I don't I don't know why I'd want a pencil on a phone to be honest.
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:29.440]   I like the idea of a note. It's like the world's smallest way count out. I've always loved that
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:33.760]   idea. The Galaxy Note and that's really was beloved partly because of the stylus.
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:37.440]   Digital field notes. I mean the idea has a lot of appeal. I never really used it but I'm not an
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:43.040]   artist. You're an artist. When they when they it's not it's not just that I would I would love if
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:47.920]   they if they had the pencil support for the iPad Mini because now when I'm in briefings whether
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:52.560]   it's like a keynote sort of thing or even just a one-on-one I prefer not to take notes to hand
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:59.520]   write my notes on my iPad because I just don't know how free form the idea when they present ideas
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:04.960]   to me. I don't know if there's it's gonna lend itself to type type type outline type type outline.
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:09.040]   Sometimes you just have to like and there's something that you didn't think was important
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:13.200]   but it really is important and so you find my rather than saying hi this is important make
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:18.000]   sure you check out this out. I can just put more and more exclamation marks next to it as I go.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.000]   It's a canonical feature where don't even sweat what people are going to do with it.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.240]   Figure out that people will find their own interaction with it. Well some people will use it as an art
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:33.120]   tablet. Some people will use it just so they can have meaningful input while they're wearing gloves.
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:37.440]   Some people will use it as a note taker. If there's no any way they could do that I'd love to see
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:42.320]   them try. I think that Apple is not but Apple's not it let's throw through a pencil at the wall
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:47.200]   and see if it sticks they're gonna have they will probably think that and we've made a shorter one
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:51.600]   that will fit inside of the special folio that we're selling and we have this new APIs and we're
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:57.360]   going to give you guidelines on how this all works. So I'd love to see it and that Lord knows that
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:03.680]   everything that that we're hearing about the iPhone 8 for instance points to they've got to have
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:09.040]   some sort of differentiation between competing phones and also the previous year's phone and
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:15.360]   it's getting harder and harder to do without really dramatic hardware features because every
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:20.640]   single feature that people have proven that they want and they value enough to pay money for
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:24.960]   is already kind of universal across the board. So now they have to figure out a way how do we make
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:32.320]   this so materially different from the iPhone 7 plus that people who have the are happy with
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:38.720]   their iPhone 6s will absolutely want to upgrade and so the people who have maybe have been tempted by
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:41.760]   some of the press around like the camera on the pixel phone let's say
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:46.400]   side no no no I'm gonna stick with my iPhone because god I really want that pencil support
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:52.240]   so a lot just a lot of math here now yeah speaking of the Nintendo switch good news the
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:57.920]   controllers the little side controllers the Joycons and the optional pro controller all work with
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:02.720]   your Apple back there so you can have the good one and you can give your least favorite friend the
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:10.560]   one that has a controller in the rear position they connect as individual controllers so even when
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:16.480]   they're attached to the dock for the two joystick experience Mac OS only recognizes them as a single
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:22.160]   controller I have no idea what I just read but if you have them you will know what that means I
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:27.440]   presume one is positioned for your thumb and one for the fleshy part of your palm they are they're
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:32.720]   a little tiny frankly I think the only way I'll be using the switch is as a portable device with
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:41.680]   those docked plain Zelda how much fun was that what was the what was the site that said it's great
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:46.480]   it plays Zelda does little else but at least it's very good at playing Zelda well many have said
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:52.160]   it's the best Zelda ever I have I have shameful admission I've never played Zelda I haven't either
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:56.480]   I played all the marios but no the Zelda yeah that's funny Florence I on same thing she said I
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:02.640]   had them on the right age as are you but I was so involved in merit with Mario I never got to Zelda
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:06.240]   I think it's two different styles of gaming or something I don't know what are you laughing at
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:14.400]   no no it's just it's it's it's like that it's like the 10 year college rionian where it's like oh boy I
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:19.120]   I really wanted to go after Zelda but you know I was in this relationship with Mario and
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:23.760]   our two or three years into it our we bought controllers together I just felt like I had too
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:31.760]   much invested I'm a little old to be getting into Zelda at this age but I'm gonna never never
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:37.680]   tooled I'm trying and Mario's coming I'm sorry me yeah Mario's coming me and Sonic the Hedgehog we
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:43.520]   still got a good thing going by the time WWDC is over and everyone has time to play again all the
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:51.280]   games will be out there you go yeah there you go if you use Lightroom mobile another reason to
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:57.040]   use it on your iPhone it now shoots not only raw which is done for some time but then it updates
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:03.600]   on both iPhone and and Android to shoot HDR shoots three shots very quickly but you have to have a
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:09.120]   modern phone iPhone six or later and one of the more modern Android phones to do it because it's
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:14.720]   you know hardware wise taking three shots instantly is hard to do 2015 iPhone or that's not that
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:20.000]   no in fact the iPhones yeah yeah the iPhone is pretty pretty good for it is the Android phones I
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:25.120]   think only the pixel is very limited yeah which ones would work with it it's only very very
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:29.200]   recently that there is even an Android hardware that can shoot at that kind of a burst rate or at
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:34.880]   least reliably right where if you if the software asks please shoot the next three frames as fast as
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:39.040]   you can do it then all right of course you have the Facebook app loaded so we're talking about one
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:44.000]   frame every five seconds but so long as the leaves on the trees aren't moving we're good I'll show
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.120]   you I don't know if you can see this over my shoulder or not but yeah I guess you kind of can there's a
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:54.560]   drop down you can choose from automatic which is the default professional or HDR now and then I'll
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:29:00.720]   show you I'll take a picture and you can see how fast it does the HDR so let's uh watch you gotta
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:07.120]   wait don't blink that was three shots and then it composes them almost instantly and this is an
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:13.600]   iPhone 7 plus so it's pretty good they're not you know like blown out HDR although I I haven't
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:19.520]   looked deeply you may have uh oh uh wait a minute the uh actually hadn't finished your HDR captures
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:23.520]   are processing check your process here so it does take a little while I has to upload it
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:29.680]   process it and then download it again um can you control have you played with it Andy can you
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:35.840]   control it is there a slider for how much HDR it's buying or um I only downloaded it last night it
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:40.640]   took a good took a couple shots of my office haven't tried it that much works really nicely it's uh
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.560]   right now we're going for those really good subtle HDR effects where you don't really notice
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:49.280]   that anything's that happened uh but isn't it's just puts a smile on my face to see that
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:55.440]   now every all these uh all these app manufacturers and all these OS manufacturers are shifting away
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:30:03.600]   from let's figure out a magical way to make to make better uh processors and better uh image
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:08.080]   sensors because they're all gonna be buying from the same source anyway and now it's like gosh we
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:14.560]   now have we now have a super overpowered phone that has way too much CPU to do the things we ask of it
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:21.120]   what if we were to just redline the CPU to do as much clever processing as possible uh that's
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:27.920]   that's why uh uh the HDR mode uh on any phone is gonna if you have if you have a two-year-old phone
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:33.200]   with Lightroom that has the HDR mode on it you can take pictures that are about as excuse me
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:37.040]   it's the possibility you can take pictures that are as about as good as something with the next
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:42.320]   generation image sensors the next generation processors uh it's really really great stuff
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:47.440]   i really encourage everybody to try out Lightroom Mobile it's free it works even it's free it even
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:51.280]   works if you don't have a subscription so you can still use it as a camera app and it really is my
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:58.320]   preferred app for uh if you want to put the iPhone into what you might call real camera mode where
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:02.800]   you want to have some control over what happens like let's say you're taking pictures of your kid
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:08.000]   and he's acting here she is acting like a little maniac as usual uh one of the one of the consistent
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:15.360]   quirks of the iPhone camera app is that the last thing it will try to do to it will always try to
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:19.200]   make up for a lack of light by increasing the shutter speed which means that you'll always have
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:23.600]   a blurred little maniac uh but if you go into Lightroom Mobile you can say no just give me
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:28.720]   whatever you do shoot at one one five hundredth of a second and you will have frozen motion no
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:32.880]   matter how you do and then you can they can improve the exposure later on this is an hcr because
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:37.200]   it's pitch black in the back here and it's very bright in the front and did a i think a pretty
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:41.520]   good job but it doesn't seem like there's any sliders well maybe what's this there's an edit
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:44.960]   button but i don't know if there's any sliders that i think that's i think it's what you get what
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:48.400]   you see is what you get i don't i don't know actually i didn't even try to see if exposure
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:53.760]   compensation works yeah remember that this that's that's very much in vogue it's not uh HDR used to
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:59.520]   almost be like a style where oh boy that looks really HDR-ish now it's not so much that it's not
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:05.440]   so much to make sure that the background of this shot in your studio is well lit it's that if you
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:10.880]   are sitting where you are right now your human i would be able to see a very there is some light
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:14.960]   hitting the back wall of your studio would not be bright but you would be able to see it and so
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:20.720]   that's what's trying to do is trying to do very naturalistic HDR on my uh cheap i again i don't
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:27.040]   have an expensive my personal daily carry phone the one i own is a mid-range $300 phone and really
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:32.400]   i have to admit that the improvements that have been made to camera apps through more naturalistic
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:40.240]   HDR have almost equalized it with uh expensive phones uh that were released a year later costing
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:46.880]   twice as much i hope i hope i like lightroom and and wrestle brown told me this uh from adobe that
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:52.000]   their intent for lightroom mobile is to effectively give it all of the features of lightroom eventually
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:57.680]   i mean you've got curves in here you do have selective editing now i mean there's a lot you can
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:01.440]   this is this is pretty incredible and when you're working with a raw photo there's a lot you can do
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:05.520]   right i mean this is yeah it's capturing so much data there is a little bit of a learning curve it's
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:10.240]   not like snap seed or the photos app where right it at ask you the question do you want this to be
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:15.440]   brighter or dimmer and just we'll do make some decisions for you but it's the only one that says
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:20.640]   that gee i've just i don't know why there's sort of like a bluish cast over this thing i don't want
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:25.200]   to change the tint i just want the blues to be less noticeable right and you can just here here's a
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:30.400]   palette of the seven major colors in this picture do you want just take the blues and desaturate that
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:34.800]   little and boom perfect it's pretty it's pretty amazing i mean this is uh this is a power tool for
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:39.360]   for a serious photography and the main i think the main reason you would possibly use the
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:43.920]   hdr's things like sunsets where you don't you're not looking for a painterly you just want to be
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:47.520]   able to see the sun and the beach at the same time and i i think this is going to be a great but
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:51.520]   that's what i'm on about it's not it's no longer about oh i'm taking a picture of a sunset or i'm
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:55.200]   taking a picture of the inside of a church where there's there's candles and there's light streaming
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:59.200]   in it really is becoming let's make this as naturalistic as possible so it really is
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:05.760]   apping the effect of having a large camera with a large sensor right fantastic yeah very exciting
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:10.080]   i'm so impressed with the stuff what a great thing to to tie in with the iphone seven plus
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:15.760]   we have a great camera yeah and yeah i mean the iphone is still the best camera out there yeah all
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:21.120]   and i'll start start to finish the best camera out there and so when you start off with uh it was
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:25.280]   a company that's really trying to get the best sensor in the best image processing and then you
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:32.080]   add in all of this uh synthetic processing after that oh boy it's like saying how about i how about
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:37.120]   pie and let's put ice cream on top of that and now let's put fudge sauce on top of all of that it's
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:41.600]   like i thought i was happy with this great pie then i was really happy with the ice cream and now
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:47.840]   i feel as though i am one of god's beloved this day thank you very much uh i guess i should mention
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:56.960]   this rumor that just came in from apple world today they've noted that uh there's a availability on
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:01.280]   the you know how you have the apple store and availability uh check if you've been looking for
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:08.240]   12.9 inch ipad pro it's been unavailable uh two to three week shipping time what's really interesting
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:13.120]   they say clicking on the check availability link for the 12.9 inch ipad pro shows april fourth
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:19.920]   availability for any color storage size or connectivity choice and they're tying that to a rumor that
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:26.640]   seems to have no basis except for that to the idea that it might be an apple event on april 4th i
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:30.720]   think that that does not make a lot of sense especially since apple events don't necessarily
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:36.080]   in fact often don't coincide with day and date of availability but april fourth the day to watch
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:42.720]   if you're looking for a new ipad not long to wait and any events a good idea if you had the money
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:47.120]   sock decide and you're gonna buy it wait not a bad idea to wait at least in the end of april yeah
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:51.600]   i don't know whether there's an event or not there might be new hard words certainly wouldn't
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:59.440]   not it wouldn't again we're seeing this wonderful wonderful be able to hedge bets it wouldn't not
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:06.800]   be a bad idea to consider yeah it's it's never by in march of september until lessened until
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:10.800]   there's an event yeah yeah yeah and i wait till the end of the month i feel like we're gonna see
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:18.640]   something and and probably i mac updates right i mac to kaby lake perhaps uh yeah and the 21 point
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:23.440]   uh was it 21.5 whatever that version is going to be interesting because intel just didn't make
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:28.480]   the skylake version of those chips apple was forced to keep it on uh was it has well broadwell
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:32.720]   whatever it was before skylake last year uh and i don't know if they needed or not this year i
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:36.960]   forgot to check so we'll be as soon as you see what they did yeah let's take a break uh when we come

[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:00.320]   them for their support of macbreak weekly. Annie and i kick us off with your pick of the week.
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:07.280]   My pick is kind of a double pick. One of my favorite youtube channels is tech moan. Tech
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:14.000]   tech. Tech moan. As in moan about what you don't like about things and it's this guy named Matt who
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:23.120]   is in uh who is in England who writes who buys a lot of like vintage technology that you probably
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:27.120]   have not heard of and then does is really in-depth explanation of the history of it and one of his
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:33.200]   things is one of his favorite things that catches his eye are like out-date like obsolete recording
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:39.840]   formats that you have never heard of like uh the the precursor to like the audio cassette that's
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:45.920]   like the size of a paperback book and holds 20 minutes he'll go into it's such a such a good
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:53.680]   videographer and he recently one of his last latest video he bought a like a one of those sort of
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:59.120]   like music systems that you would buy for a store or for an office or for a warehouse that you loaded
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:07.680]   up with about the company leases you the unit and a pile of these records of like just you know
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:12.720]   elevator music that goes on for seven hours so it's like an inside it's like an eight disc changer
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:18.880]   and part of the great stuff about the video too is that he has to buy these things and often
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:22.400]   they're broken so he has to fix them and even though he's not a technician he's not a repair
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:27.200]   person so essentially he's you see an edited down version well here's what I had here's what the
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:32.960]   state it was in when I got it and here's how I had to fix it and so again it's he has a patreon and
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:38.400]   I was so it's sort of thing as soon as someone this is a music machine I mean what does it sound like
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:43.120]   this this latest one well this this is the actually this is the other pick he is part of it it's called
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:48.400]   the seaburg 1000 but as part of it he said that there is a there is a company that licensed the
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:55.680]   music and so you can actually for free stream as if you have a seaburg 1000 music like elevator
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:42:01.040]   music system in your home office so we listen to this exactly please let's let's let's let's
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:08.240]   do some 19 70s and 80s we're here in night and day on the seaburg 1000 but yeah I'm sure it
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:13.520]   is nothing but music wow this is wild I don't know we're not maybe it's not playing what am I
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:21.280]   there you go so this you would hear this is the guy stuff you'd hear in the 60s in a department
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:30.480]   store 60s or 70s that some the latest one was there was the the ET theme as a disco song that was
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:37.120]   my god released as part of the system of in at 82 and so is that copyrighted what's the story
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:42.560]   with it I guess well the cup I guess the company that streams this has licensed the music so you
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:47.840]   can stream it for free you can also buy an app that has a preloaded I after I after I watched
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:52.480]   his latest video that had like the the machine and and oh by the way there's also a website that
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:57.360]   has the stuff just as a Joe I went over that's like and I found myself just like keeping it on
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:02.640]   because this is it was the there's some sort of contractor next door or the neighbor was there
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:07.840]   was all these storms so the bus all was going because it was so funny because at the time I
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:12.160]   remember hearing this stuff it was like oh god this is awful but now it's kind of camping fun
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:17.280]   it's it's fun it's entertaining you also get to play name that tune where it's like oh my god
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:22.960]   that is a bostonova version of smoke on the water played by a 20 piece orchestra oh my god
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:28.400]   it's hysterical and it's also cover up whatever noise is going on outside that is less pleasant
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:31.520]   it's not so dangerous right it's it's supposed to kind of well it's
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:37.840]   I'll of course the he does he also like reads like part of the uh the sales literature about it
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:42.960]   oh it will also help to get your get your workers more motivated and keep their energy level up
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:49.120]   and but so I actually have this thing bookmarked in their times where I will just keep it running
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:54.160]   in the office when I'm just going through email I just need something that is a little bit pleasant
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:59.120]   but not distracting enough that I can't focus on what I'm doing and it's free now these are 29
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:03.520]   second clips though they're not uh or am I just looking at the wrong part well this is if you want
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:08.880]   to buy the cd okay if you want to buy the cd's you can you can buy them on cd but the streaming is
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:15.120]   just the most the songs like two and a half minutes long the if you go to the whatever button says
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:20.240]   stream it live or scoothing stream the whole thing it really is like oh it's even got a little player
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:26.320]   oh that's hysterical there see so this just this will go forever it will just keep going I
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:34.000]   don't know I have I have not had this the moral strength to listen to this for more than a couple
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.920]   of hours but I for at least a couple hours it will run so this is the spot there's a little spoken
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:42.880]   word at the beginning right at the very beginning there's no ads it's just no ads that I can hear
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:50.240]   it's just my new Pandora it's like maybe you can use it like drive kids away from your house
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:53.920]   that's what they should do you know a lot of times they have music playing outside
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:45:02.800]   7-11 yes see I was it's such a culture gap like no no two nights ago I was up until 4am listening
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:07.360]   to all my who's good do albums like over and over again which is a bad thing to do if you need to get
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:12.640]   to bed because who's good who is pretty intense but you know that I'm on the neighborhood I'm sure
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:17.440]   like all the kids like think that that's the music that I'm listening to oh does old man or not
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:24.000]   goes listening to the heavy swing big band it's not even bad music you know what music is modern
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.360]   day music is pretty kind of it's in a fence it's inoffensive but it's done at a very high level of
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:34.160]   execution like I said if this were like a ten dollar a month streaming music service I might be a
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:39.520]   little bit more sarcastic about it but as a thing that's on my list of bookmarks as something to
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:45.120]   listen to when I need some pleasant noise uh it's pretty good but a hard hard hard recommendation
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:51.120]   for techmoan channel I'm seriously it looks fun especially as I mean just that what I've just
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:58.800]   the fun is like oh my god that all the ways that companies try to deliver HD content before there
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:04.160]   was blu ray and streaming all these schemes that kind of work but didn't really all the different
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:09.600]   ways now I can buy raise the lost arc on video formats that lasted about two months you know
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:14.560]   again it's just really really super super entertaining stuff and I'm super super happy to be giving
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:21.040]   them how much money I'm giving them by patreon for highest recommend techmoan.com and the seaburg
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:27.600]   stories right there on the front page and then they have a link there to the seaborg 1000 background
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:38.320]   music library that could stream to your home wherever you are. This is hysterical wow thank you Andy
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:44.960]   great pick uh my pick of the week is something I pick every time there's an update and there often
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:52.000]   is is a nicest writer this is you have to be an old time Mac user to know about nicest this was
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.840]   the best third party third party word processor available on the Macintosh for years then
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:03.360]   they stripped it down just like apple did with you know iMovie and and they made it kind of a
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:07.600]   dumb product but they have slowly built it right back up and it now has I think all the features
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:12.800]   that the original nicest writer pro had you may say well I got pages I don't need nicest writer oh
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:19.040]   but nicest writer is a Mac classic highly recommended 80 dollars in the app store
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:26.160]   for a single license you can also do more and you can get a demo if you want there's still
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:31.920]   nicest writer express which is the kind of simplified version that's free but if you do a lot of
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:40.720]   word processing and you want a power tool nicest has always been the king of the hill and it's still
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:47.680]   just fantastic I really I really like it it has a full grip search which is I use that all the time
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:55.600]   and BB edit yep really handy it's got a macro language that is a real programming language and
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:02.480]   very very powerful I don't know anybody who uses it still but I like it and I just like I like
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:07.200]   having it on my Mac just because that was the good old days nice writer express is not free I'm
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:13.920]   sorry it's twenty dollars thank you chaperon nicest nisus.com your pick of the week Renee Ritchie
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:18.960]   so mine is sort of a strodingers pick because it's neither alive nor dead right now and what I mean
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:25.520]   by that is Sonos has announced a new speaker it is the Sonos play base now some of us have the play
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:31.920]   bar which is sort of a traditional sound bar for home theater and that you can mount on a wall or
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:36.560]   you can put in front of your TV this is made expressly for TVs that are like furniture that are on top
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:43.280]   of cabinets or on top of you know TV stands and things and it goes right underneath it and the
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:47.920]   nice thing about it is it's really well it's huge yeah it's big and there's a video there's a great
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:52.160]   video that they actually show you how they had to engineer it with this weird s sort of funnel
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:58.640]   to get a proper acoustic ventilation but the reason I'm mentioning it now is that it's only
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:02.080]   going to be available in April but if you are already a Sonos customer you can get advanced
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:08.080]   pre-ordering if you want this today starting today when you go to Sonos.com so you'd use this in
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:12.160]   lieu of the sound bar or yes yeah it's in lieu of the sound bar it's just because you want something
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:15.200]   that's a little bit bigger a little bit more powerful a little bit the sound bars you wouldn't
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:19.280]   need the sub with this then right this does the same i think you still would because the picture
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:24.080]   has the sub in it i think this is just giving you better sort of sound bar quality and it's giving
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:28.480]   you that full solid finish instead of having sort of a speakery finish on the front 700 bucks is
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:34.000]   not cheap and no Sonos stuff is on the other hand if you're a Sonos user you know and you love
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:39.920]   look at that this got this worn in it wow yeah yeah no it's super fascinating it's super cool and
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:43.760]   you know if i was doing it again today i might get this instead of the sound bar yeah i have a
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:48.720]   sound bar unfortunately yeah i mean i'm a little i mean i i just love here relationship with Sonos
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:53.360]   where it's just so easy to use but it uses the spittive connector not HDMI and i'm happy about that
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:58.720]   because all my HDMI stuff inevitably gets false hdcp copy protections then i lose my mind if i
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:03.200]   throw my tv out the window no this doesn't do that but also it doesn't support 7.1 yet and it feels
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:06.400]   like that's something that they could add just let me buy two more of you please let me buy two
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:10.720]   more of your speakers and go 7.1 i have and i think you need this if you want surround you need this
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:16.320]   plus it's plus the two play ones that's what i have yeah then we have all the way i have play
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:20.960]   threes because my room is oddly shamed around well that's fancy your face i have an octagonal well i
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:25.360]   have a studio sort of a setup like it's an open concept but it's an octagon which is kind of hard to
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:32.720]   like sonos is rapidly becoming the clips or the bows of internet radio and internet streaming sound
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:38.960]   and the thing is if you had a small apartment for 699 this is your fault this is your stereo because
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:42.800]   you're gonna of course get all the sonos streaming as well as the surround the tv surround and a
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:46.080]   lot of stuff and if you want it to you could add a play one or something to your bedroom or to the
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:50.080]   bathroom or something and have a connected speaker system that just fits exactly your needs in space
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:55.200]   have they announced i know they announced that they would this year have integration with
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:51:00.480]   amazon echo that still has not happened i've seen since since then that they said not just echo
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:02.560]   but we're gonna work with google home we're gonna work with everything
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:08.160]   when is that when do we know when that's happening i have not seen a date for it yet i'm waiting for
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:11.920]   i mean what's interesting for us is that previously we were seeing a lot of stuff that was syri or
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:17.760]   echo for example and now we're increasingly seeing a lot of our own writers just use both of them
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:21.360]   now and they use them for different things and in different context so i mean as we want to be
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:26.000]   agnostic why would we don't want to tie to any one company yeah yeah that makes sense if you can
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.320]   do it that makes sense i'm not sure how they're going to do it but i but i but the demo the video
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:36.400]   showed you being able to say to your echo echo play uh sanatra in the living room and it would
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:40.400]   just know where to go and how to do it that would be awesome to be like old old school spy stuff
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:47.040]   where you say like echo sonos one activate yeah yeah rene richie you'll find him at i'm more

[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:39.600]   the fact we're on demand everywhere frankly anywhere you get your podcasts just subscribe to mac
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:44.880]   break weekly. we saw in our recent survey that the number of people subscribing has dropped just 5%
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:50.560]   but i thought that was kind of interesting uh last year was 80% of our listeners subscribed
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:56.720]   got it every week this year is 75% and i think that that comes from the fact that now you've got
[01:53:56.720 --> 01:54:00.320]   many other choices and you've got a podcast app and people probably just pick what they want to
[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:04.640]   listen to but would you do me a favor and subscribe we like that that way we know you're not gonna
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:10.880]   miss one unfortunately i have to give you some bad news now break time is over so get back to work
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:16.240]   i did that in the wrong order get back to work because break time is over
