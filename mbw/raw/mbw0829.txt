[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.360]   And there's a little bit of Apple News.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.360]   Alex Lindsey is here, 090.media and officehours.global.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.640]   - Good to be here.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.800]   - There's no zeros and officehours.global.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.960]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.800]   - Hi, how's it going?
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.760]   - Ah, it's going good.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.600]   Going great. - Great, great.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.040]   - Now that I've recovered from the COVID
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.720]   and I could be in the big studio again,
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.600]   I don't have to worry about infecting people.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.440]   I'm happy to do it.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.680]   - Can you say we had a great show this morning?
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.520]   - Did you have fun?
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.360]   - I had a great show.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.200]   - Oh, we had a good.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.520]   We had a second hour on surround
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.080]   and it just collected a huge number of audio experts.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.360]   So the first tower is just like super geeky audio
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.880]   and then the second hour is talking about super geeky audio.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.720]   - Yes.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.800]   - Actually have a surround question.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.880]   For users of iOS 16, we'll get to that in a second.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.960]   Also with us from WGBH in Boston.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.120]   Mr. Andy Inako.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.560]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.720]   - Hello, Leo.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.480]   - Looking fresh and shiny today.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.240]   - Thank you.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.560]   It's because for the first time in like 18 weeks,
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.880]   I'm not wearing a black shirt.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.760]   - Oh, there, that's it.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.600]   That's it.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.640]   I thought maybe your skin routine had changed.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.960]   - This is, I finally switched into my
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.280]   kicky, light, high spirited summer color palette,
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.840]   which is sort of a dark moon.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.680]   - Yeah.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.600]   Very, very, very kicky.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.400]   Also Jason Snell from Six Colors,
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   who is so sick of us by now,
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.920]   'cause he's been on only.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.920]   - It's like a month.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.760]   - I mean.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.920]   - One month and he was on Twitter
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.840]   and he's on Mac break weekly and blah, blah, blah.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.680]   And you know what?
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.720]   You're gonna get a lot of airtime today too.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.920]   Before are we going to that?
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.920]   On Sunday, you said you were using the Opal Camera.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.720]   Are you still using the Opal Camera?
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.560]   - I am.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.880]   - How do you like it?
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.720]   - I like it.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.880]   I mean, I think there's a question
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.160]   if you've got on iPhone
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.400]   and macOS Ventura, if you need something like this,
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.640]   it's a, for those who don't know,
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.600]   it's a standalone camera that uses.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.000]   - $300.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.480]   - Yeah, it uses really nice camera parts.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.320]   - A Sony sensor.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.480]   - Yeah, one-inch sensor.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.080]   - But to be a webcam,
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.160]   and it's designed as a webcam
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.200]   and you can put it on your monitor
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.560]   and some lines on my monitor here.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.400]   - Yeah.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.280]   - And that's all good.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.520]   But you know, the iPhone is also a very good camera
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.160]   and with iOS and then Chura,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.360]   you're gonna be able to do that.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.920]   You're gonna be able to just use your iPhone
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.520]   and use it as a webcam if you want to.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.000]   But then again, you gotta put your iPhone up there
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.400]   and clip it on and get it set and all of those things.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.080]   So for some people,
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.000]   I mean, I'm doing a video show every week.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.440]   So it seems like a good investment.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.440]   - It's worth it, 300 bucks.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.800]   It's not a one-inch sensor.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.120]   I'm sorry, it's a 7.8 millimeter sensor.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.200]   But, and how's the,
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.320]   you're not using the microphone 'cause that's--
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.000]   - I'm not, I'm using a Shura SM7BA.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.320]   - But it's got some controls and it looks nice.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.840]   And you know, it's the pitches,
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.560]   it's sort of a, don't use an SLR.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.880]   Because that's ridiculous.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.600]   Just use sort of an SLR optics in a little webcam.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.920]   And it's a 4K webcam.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.760]   It looks great.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.200]   So I'm happy with it so far.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.080]   - Yeah.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.040]   You were a little pink on Sunday,
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.200]   but I don't think that was your fault.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.120]   - I'm color blind.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.440]   So I was trying to adjust the colors and I did it badly.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.000]   - So you brought somebody in, the professional.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.920]   - Also to be fair, Jason's one of the few people,
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.640]   nerds that I know that actually goes outside a lot.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.920]   (laughing)
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.800]   He goes to football games, he goes to baseball games.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.360]   - Oh no, that's, I mean, that's like,
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.040]   that's at mere hours out of the year
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.040]   that I'm outside Andy.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.640]   - I'm not saying you're any kind of Adam Anks to hear,
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.400]   but you're still compared to like the neutralized,
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.080]   the blue and the green and the skin tone.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.320]   I think that you're much healthier.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.480]   - I think the thing about the Opal,
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.800]   it's also interesting is it has Mac software,
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.560]   which a lot of other cameras do not have very much software.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.560]   - Yeah, I think it's Mac only right now.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.400]   - Right, yeah.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.280]   - Even so yeah. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.200]   Cool.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.040]   All right.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.040]   - Although with continuity camera,
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.440]   I gotta think they're gonna pivot.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.440]   (laughing)
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.280]   - I have to say, I always use camo with my iPhone 12
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.840]   and it just really looks so good.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.360]   I don't, I was trying those sorts of other things.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.040]   - And continuity camera is, I mean, I love camo too,
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.600]   and camo has settings and Opal has settings
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.000]   and that's the problem with Apple stuff
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.680]   is that Apple doesn't have settings.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.360]   They just want you to take it the way it is.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.440]   And like I'd mind zoomed in a little bit
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.440]   and you can zoom and pan and stuff with camo.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.240]   However, being the home field advantage
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.440]   being the platform owner,
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.280]   the fact that you don't have to launch an app
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.880]   and set it all up and all that,
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.400]   you can literally just put your phone
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.560]   while it's asleep up as a webcam
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.680]   and it just works, it just comes on and does the right thing
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.520]   and that's pretty powerful.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.640]   So it's a lot less fiddly than something like camo.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.000]   - Very nice.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.340]   Good.
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.560]   Now we can get to Apple's quarterly results.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.480]   They came out Thursday, their fiscal third quarter 2022,
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.480]   a record for a June quarter of $83 billion.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.760]   That's only 2% up over year over year,
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.200]   but this, you know, up is up.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.040]   - Damn it.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.880]   - Time.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.600]   It is a record, but is it a record?
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.120]   (laughing)
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.400]   Is it a wow or is it more, well,
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.760]   it wasn't as bad as it could be.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.560]   In fact, Apple, quite a few times I think, said a,
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.840]   what did Luca Maestry say, a cocktail of headwinds?
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.040]   - Cocktail of headwinds, yes.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.160]   - Some mixed metaphor of the week is cocktail of headwinds.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.000]   - You could.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.840]   - How do you get a,
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.680]   - It's like a hurricane.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.000]   - I don't know.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.320]   It's weird because, you know, it's by Apple standards.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.880]   Everything is by Apple standards, right?
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.960]   'Cause like these results came out and the Wall Street people,
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.440]   I was listening to like CNBC or something and they're like,
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.280]   oh thank God.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.000]   And really they're just so relieved
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.280]   because the tech stocks have been so bad.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.600]   And to look at, especially the iPhone number,
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.800]   which was iPhone was up 2% year over year
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.120]   and that's half Apple's business.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.000]   And I think that Wall Street people are like,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.040]   oh good, the iPhone isn't catering.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.360]   - What a relief. - Life is okay at least.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.040]   And by Apple standards, I mean, again,
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.640]   it is a record third quarter, third quarter's not their best quarter,
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.720]   but it's a record third quarter, so yay for them, I guess.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.760]   But Apple's recent quarters have been amazing
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.720]   and there were a lot of downs in their individual product categories,
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.720]   some of which can be ascribed to what they warned us about three months ago,
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.680]   which is that there were a bunch of factory showdowns,
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.280]   showdowns, yeah, one factory said stick 'em up to the other one.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.160]   No, there were a lot of factory shutdowns in Shanghai
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.440]   where most Macs get assembled due to COVID
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.080]   and they warned that they were not going to be able to make as many Macs
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.200]   as people wanted to buy.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.320]   And while that is kind of a nice problem to have,
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.960]   that there was so much demand,
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.240]   the problem with that is you're leaving money on the table.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.920]   And they said that they were going to leave between $48 billion on the table this quarter.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.480]   They didn't, they said they came up a little short of $4 billion,
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.720]   so still almost $4 billion that they left on the table.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.160]   And when they were asked about that Mac,
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.360]   Mac sales after like five record Mac quarters in a row
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.320]   were down 10% year over year.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.800]   And when asked about that,
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.440]   I thought the most interesting thing in the whole call with analysts
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.080]   that they do after they release these results was Tim Cook saying,
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.720]   "Oh no, we're happy it was 10%, you should have seen it before."
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.320]   And you get the sense that those factories were just coming online
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.880]   at the beginning of a quarter and they were way behind on selling Macs
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.760]   and by the end they caught up enough to get to 10% down
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.120]   from a scary number that's even worse than that.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.640]   So, you know, some of this is about like global economy
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.240]   and about them leaving Russia and all sorts of other things that they did.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.240]   And their softness and wearables especially.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.640]   But again, you know, for it to be a record
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.240]   and also for their biggest problem to be they couldn't make them fast enough.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.600]   It's not a, I don't want to belittle that problem,
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.560]   but like that's not the worst problem to have.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.120]   And foreign exchange and stuff like that.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.080]   So, you know, it's weird to talk about it
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.920]   because was it not Apple's strongest quarter?
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.840]   Yeah, but it was also like an Apple record quarter.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.200]   And I don't know, it's hard to get too caught up in it
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.040]   because it was, it's a lot of money.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:18.920]   It's just a lot of money.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.440]   Only one of the M2 laptops is in this quarter, right?
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.560]   The MacBook Air is not.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.320]   Right, the MacBook Air did not ship in time for this quarter at all.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.800]   Okay.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.640]   And I think that the areas that are soft,
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.200]   I think one thing that I noticed I was looking at the wearables as well as the iPad
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.360]   is one of Apple's problems is they make those very durable.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.320]   Like it's, you get the watch and you're kind of like every time they come out,
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.600]   like, well, this watch works pretty well.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.160]   And my kids are still using an iPad Pro,
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.080]   I bought them the iPad Pros when they first came out,
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.160]   the 12.9s or whatever.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.640]   You still use them every day.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.880]   You know, and I think that, and I also think that that's also speaks to
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.920]   a lot of developers aren't taking full advantage of the new features
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.040]   that are available in some of the newer iPads.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.520]   And so what the iPad does, it seems to do for five years, you know,
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.480]   and that's a little bit of also Apple even needing to push those technologies
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.480]   that they want to sell them more.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.080]   It's actually not been a good year for iPad in general.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.080]   This quarter down two percent, previous quarter down two percent,
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.680]   14% the quarter before that.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.200]   So iPads...
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.760]   But following a year of really explosive pros on the iPad where they sort of figured it out.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.120]   I think what baffles me about this, and they don't disclose how they know this,
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.760]   but they say that this is true and it's illegal, you know,
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.560]   if they lie, they would go to jail.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.600]   So I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.040]   They talk about switcher numbers and expanding their user base,
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.680]   and that's one of the things that they emphasize.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.640]   So like even though Mac numbers were down, they said more than half to Alex's point,
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.200]   more than half of the people who bought a Mac in this quarter were switching.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.360]   Were not Mac users.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.480]   That's kind of amazing.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.320]   And then they had a record number of iPhone switchers for the quarter.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.560]   And again, the numbers are a little hazy and I don't know exactly how they're slicing it.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.800]   But they make those claims a lot about iPad and about Mac and about iPhone
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.640]   that people are switching and they're expanding their install base.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.560]   And their growth isn't just coming from an old Apple user, you know,
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.960]   recycling their old computer and buying a new one.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.960]   Well, and look at Intel's results this quarter, which were terrible.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.200]   In fact, AMD exceeded Intel in market cap just this week,
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.400]   which is kind of mind boggling.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:30.440]   So I think the Apple Silicon, I think you could, is it safe to say that this is a
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.080]   victory for Apple Silicon as much as anything else?
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.520]   Yes.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.760]   Apple certainly ascribes it to that.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.240]   The Mac sales being a record for the last.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.520]   And but just people switching.
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.920]   I think a lot of, you know, sure.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.000]   We talked last week about John Kruper and his contention that, you know,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.520]   the apples should be included when you talk about the best laptops and so forth.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:57.400]   And but for whatever reason, it wasn't, you know, picked as the best laptop by Wirecutter.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:03.400]   However, I think real users look at battery life, they look at coolness,
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.920]   they look at performance and go, yeah, maybe it's time to buy a Mac.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.760]   I'm not, I'm not at all surprised to hear that.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.040]   And I think that one of the arguments for a long time was, well, it's a P, it's,
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.200]   it's not a Mac, but it's got, it's way, you get way more for the, for the dollar.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.280]   And that Apple kind of eroded that where you're getting a lot of performance
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:27.400]   and again, battery performance, ship performance, screen performance for a relatively low amount of
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.160]   money. There's still the Apple techs.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.760]   I mean, it's some but not much.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.160]   Yeah. Well, if that's a dollar, Mac, book here is a pretty, you know, that's, but it's,
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.840]   there's not a lower version, but when you compare it to another thousand dollars,
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.520]   you see that's right. That's where that's, you know, compare them dollar to dollar.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:49.240]   You know, Apple may have an edge at this point, you know, now they don't make a $1,300
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.960]   XPS 13 over, you know, not mentioning the Mac book here, which was three or bucks last.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:59.880]   Yeah. But this is why you really, really wish that Apple or these other companies could really
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:05.640]   break down these numbers because we've, to Apple's credit, we've seen that step before,
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.640]   like quarter after quarter, where, hey, we've got a lot of switchers from Windows, which is
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:14.680]   significant. It's, it's maybe emotionally significant, maybe not significant in terms of
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.760]   increasing their market share, but still significant that they're not after, they're not
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.480]   shedding off Mac users, which means that whatever they're doing, whatever their five-year plan is,
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.600]   they're making their current users happy, and that's going to be a big part of it.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:33.400]   But I keep wondering, like, are they, it's one thing to convince someone who had $1,500 to spend
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:41.080]   on a Windows notebook to spend $1,800 to $2,000 for a Mac book. Are they convincing people who had a
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:51.720]   budget of $5,000 to $700 to spend $1,000 to $1,300? Do the people who, who spend the, do the largest
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.840]   segment of the population who are buying laptops, are they seeing so much value in the Mac that
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.760]   they're willing to spend a little more to get that extra Apple advantage? That's something that I'd
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.760]   really love to know. And someone who buys a lot of PCs, I think there is also something else going
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:10.120]   on. Somebody in our chatroom, Eric Duckman says, "New computers are overrated. I have fourth-gen
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.600]   Intel machines. I don't know if they're Macs or PCs, but I think that that's actually the case.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:20.600]   I have a lot of older PCs, and they're not appreciably slower." So people are, I don't think people are
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:26.120]   looking so much at performance these days as other things. For instance, battery life. I mean,
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:33.480]   when you're talking 12-hour, all-day battery life, that's a real value. And I think that maybe PC users
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:38.680]   are going beyond performance these days as well. And don't forget when the Intel transition
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:45.320]   happened on the Mac to Intel. It was a different era, and everybody kind of, a lot of people bought
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.240]   Macs at that point because they thought, "Oh, this is safe. I can run Windows on it too." And they didn't,
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:55.000]   but it was enough to get them across. But with this Apple Silicon transition, you pick up all of this
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.760]   battery life and energy efficiency. And the compatibility is a lot, it's just not an issue.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:06.280]   So many things are web-based. Yeah, it'll carry anymore. Yeah. The ability to run the iOS apps to a
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:12.280]   certain degree, and it just kind of doesn't matter. And so it ends up being more about battery life
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:16.760]   and maybe aesthetics in that 999 MacBook Air sure looks pretty good. And maybe you've thought
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.200]   about buying a Mac before and now it's just like it doesn't matter. It's not a big deal. And I think
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:25.160]   that works in Apple's favor. Quality components, better keyboard, better trackpad, better screen.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:32.120]   All of those kind of ineffable quality of life differences may end up making more of a difference
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.520]   when performance is less important. Go ahead, Andy. Yes. And to that point,
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:42.200]   Gartner Retrus Research report on the laptop market was really, really interesting a couple
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:48.920]   of weeks ago showing that, yeah, nobody is going, we're expecting serious downturns for the rest
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.640]   of the year, at least, with Apple being hurt the most. They were just expecting their sales to be
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:59.240]   pretty flat. PC sales to be a little down, but not disastrous. But then you look at Chromebook sales,
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.800]   which they're expecting to fall off by 30 freaking percent. And that to me is very,
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:10.760]   very significant because yes, there are all kinds of reasons why 2020 and 2021 might have been
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:16.280]   artificially inflated numbers for the Chromebook. But it means that there is no Chromebook revolution
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:23.560]   going on. I mean, I think a lot of us in this chat would say that for most users, a laptop that
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:29.880]   just runs Chrome or Safari really, really well. Almost everything else is kind of secondary,
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:35.320]   given how much time people spend inside a web browser for one reason or another. But one would
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:41.400]   have expected that if Chromebooks were at the cusp of a new revolution in the 2020s,
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:45.320]   all of these people buying new Chromebooks for practical reasons would realize that, hey, look,
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.880]   I'm using my Chromebook a lot more than I'm using this laptop I spent $2,000 for three or four years
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:56.280]   ago. The fact that it's cratering means that and the fact that Apple's MacBooks are expected to be
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:01.240]   pretty much unaffected, excuse me, flat as opposed to back in the growth. I think that is another
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:06.600]   serious point in favor of Apple strategies. People and I think that this is the verge from last week.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:11.960]   People aren't buying as many PCs and Intel is feeling the multi billion dollar burn. They
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:17.320]   lost half a billion dollars in the laptops on their webs. Yeah, there's the burn right there.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:23.000]   It's certain. I don't know if you correlate that to the increase in Apple
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.920]   switching, but I have the feeling it is. I think it's related.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:32.280]   I think that when you start for almost any company and oftentimes individual, if you start value in
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:38.680]   your time, then Apple gets really cheap. The amount of time you spend fiddling with PCs and
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:44.120]   Chromebooks, and this is, I've worked at companies where the IT support department for the PC site,
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.680]   it's the same number of Mac and PC users. The support for the PCs is like nine people.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:56.360]   The support for the Mac site is like half a person. It's there. It's a different level of cost and
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:03.080]   a different level of time. I know for me, for a while, I was really using a consumer PC with Oculus.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:07.480]   I finally just gave up on the whole thing because I was like, every forced update.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.800]   No fund is it. Every forced update. I was like, and you can get out of that with an enterprise
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.720]   version and all this other stuff. But for an average person, when you have updates that are
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:22.360]   breaking a bunch of stuff that you're using all the time, I don't know how anybody thinks that
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.840]   that's okay. I know they have to do it. I don't know how much faith I have. Certainly corporations
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.840]   have metrics and they measure all this, I understand. They pay attention to it.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:39.800]   But the individual, the homo-economics, I think probably isn't making this deep calculation about
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:45.640]   well three years from now the overall cost of ownership. I think they go to Costco and they
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:51.160]   look at the price on the shelf. I think they're getting past, I think that we are getting smarter.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.680]   Next generation is moving past Costco because they're actually using them and they're actually
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.520]   using it at home and they're actually using them for themselves themselves. I'm not saying they
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:05.480]   do the calculation, but it is a lot. The hardship of owning a Mac is lower.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.440]   And we used to say, well, you pay a lot extra, but now it's not clear that you pay a lot of extra
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:15.000]   for an average person. If you're, if you are, what I will say is that, I mean, we own a bunch
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.480]   of PCs and I mean, I think there's more PCs than, oh, and I know than there are Macs. The
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:25.640]   main thing is if you are a savvy user, there are tons of things that a PC can do that a Mac can't.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:30.120]   There are tons of things that there's flexibility and all kinds of things that you want to use.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:34.520]   But anytime someone says, well, I'm a home user and I haven't used a computer a lot,
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:40.280]   I'm somewhere between an iPad and a Mac. Let's keep you out of the dangerous forest.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.840]   That was interesting. I said nine to five Mac had a big feature article on,
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:52.360]   should you buy an M2 MacBook Air or an iPad, an M1 iPad? And I thought that that is a decision.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:57.720]   Well, I mean, I talk to people all the time and I go, what are you doing?
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.520]   And the first thing they say, well, what should I get? And I'm like, what do you do?
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.920]   And they're like, well, I surf the web and I do where document is.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.840]   And I'm like, you should just get an iPad because then you don't have to worry about it.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.400]   There's so many things about the Chromebook, but an iPad is such a better.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:14.280]   I'm serious. It's really good at keeping doors from opening and shutting.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:20.680]   But that's about it's best. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I can't have them. I hate that.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:29.800]   All I'll say is that a nitpick on an earlier point that maintenance on a Chromebook is not
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:37.640]   exist on its zero. I use. Well, your poor kids are voices on them by the school district
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.280]   and they're not the best Chromebooks ever in blah, blah, blah. And they have.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:45.160]   They do get free watches that are notable. Look at that. That is a good Chromebook.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:51.160]   They got there right there. I've got a pixel book and it is one of my like main computers.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:57.080]   I do so much work on this because it is so useful. Assuming that you don't get the $200
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.360]   cheapest possible. That's the problem. Yeah. People say that. And that is the problem.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.560]   Yeah. They're over economical.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:10.680]   Homos. Well, no. Some of them. I think that by the time you get to you can get a really nicely made
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:17.560]   Chromebook for $400 to $500. I think a lot of people really do just associate Chromebooks with
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:21.720]   well, this is the lowest common denominator. This is we just need to get more screens inside the
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.800]   house. We need to get more screens inside the office, but we can do we can fill that that remit
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:32.920]   for $200, $300 a seat instead of $500 or $600 a seat by the time you get into the price of a decent
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:39.000]   Chromebook. And really we're talking about Samsung makes a $700 win. One year hold up to $1000 though.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.120]   Let's put let's be fair. Right. Well, this yeah, $800 to cost me. It's kind of a basic
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.520]   figuration. This is the Chrome. People listening an audio book. This is Google's pixel book,
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:53.000]   which they stopped making, but still one of the nice. This is almost Apple like in design.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.040]   And yet you could you could you could buy this configured as an i7 Intel processor
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:04.440]   with lots of storage for like $1200, $1,300, which is definitely, hey, I'm a senior executive. I can't
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:10.600]   be seen at a conference with conference table with anything but the very, very best laptop out
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.840]   there. But you know, it's it's out there. That's why I'm saying that I really do think it's significant
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:20.040]   that it's not the Chromebook as it's found its place. It's a very important place. It's a wonderful
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.840]   piece of technology. It's a wonderful operating system. The fact that Chrome OS flex can now be
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:29.640]   installed on all kinds of computers that are perfectly useful, but they've just been abandoned
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:36.360]   by Apple and Microsoft also a very, very important role in tech in the playing field right now.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:41.800]   However, it is significant that it hasn't really taken over the way that you would think that a
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:48.440]   computer that's this useful, this inexpensive would. And so that's I think that is kudos to
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:53.640]   the iPad kudos to the Mac. Although I don't don't advocate Chromebook sales. They consistently
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:59.080]   number one sales part lot because of schools, but still right Chromebooks have done fine. I don't
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.600]   think anybody's seeing. Oh, no, no, they're doing okay. I'm just saying that as someone who often tries
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:10.360]   to think often often tries to think about, oh, I'm going to beer stroking mode about what does this
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:16.440]   say about about our relationship with with technology. It is interesting that we're still very, very much
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:22.200]   locked into a conventional, mostly a laptop running a conventional desktop operating system.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:29.960]   iPads are also extreme. The 300 the basic $320 iPad is one of the biggest steals in technology
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:37.160]   right now. It's such an incredibly good value. But to with a lot of good reason, it really isn't
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:43.400]   a notebook. It isn't it isn't a boring keyboard trackpad screen. Because as I as I keep saying,
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:49.240]   as big a fan of the iPad as I am, iPads are awesome. They can do anything that a notebook can do
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:56.040]   until it can't, in which case, oh my God, are you screwed? I mean, just simplest things ever.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:05.400]   So that's why it's it's an interesting calculus to navigate. Yeah. Services down still growing 12%
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:12.120]   year over year, but that's the slowest growth rate. Since this graph was started, which is what 2018
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:16.920]   this is, by the way, credit to Jason and six colors. These are that we're using their beautiful
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:21.400]   color graphs. You are beautiful color graphs that you generate every year. Thank you. Every quarter.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.720]   Yeah. Services is funny. It actually was down sequentially for the first time in two years, but
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:30.600]   its weakest quarter is this quarter for whatever reason. Apple has scribed a lot of it to softness
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:34.680]   in the ad market, which I think is really interesting. An analyst tried to do the whole,
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:41.160]   you know, you guys are doing app tracking transparency, which makes it hard for Facebook to do ads about
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:45.400]   apps. And so you get to do all the advertising inside the app store, which is a first party ad,
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:51.000]   but you make money with it, which Tim Cook basically didn't answer because what is it going to say?
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.200]   There is no answer because it's the right. It's true. Yeah. It's absolutely true. So, but they did say
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.200]   one of the reasons that Apple's been down because of that revenue. They're increasing where they're
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.840]   putting ads, right? They announced that this week. Yeah, there's new ad spots as well. So,
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.640]   and it's like we don't we talk about services and everybody thinks, oh, it's Apple TV plus and it's
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:16.040]   Apple one and it's Apple fitness and Apple news, but part of the services container is
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:21.400]   search ads. So, you know, it's the biggest portion though. It must be the app store, yes?
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:28.200]   I think so. Yeah. I think so. I mean, they don't break it down, but it has to be. And maybe this is
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.960]   this. An Apple care too. Apple care is probably making a lot of money. Yeah. This might. Yeah. So,
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:37.160]   yeah. Okay. So if you can't sell max, you can't sell Apple care. So maybe that's part of it. I would
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:42.200]   bet though that recession or we shouldn't call it recession inflation. I don't know what it is.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:49.640]   Macro economic issues. Cocktails of headwinds are definitely impacting the app store. Don't you
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:54.200]   think people probably are spending less money in the app store? You know, when times are tight,
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:26:00.360]   you don't go out and buy 300 Simpsons donuts. I know for a fact. I will say that that
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:04.920]   looking at that number I had I thought about it this morning while I was looking through that.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.760]   And one of the things I noticed is I'm not buying very many apps. Yeah. And I was trying to think
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:13.320]   I was like I'm buying way less. And it actually for me, and I don't know if I'm, you know,
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:18.600]   carrying the coal mine or just crazy, probably both. The crazy. You're the crazy.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:23.320]   You're the crazy in the coal mine is. I have become super sensitive to subscriptions.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:28.120]   And so if I see an app, yes, and it's going to be a habit subscription, I just don't download it
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:33.480]   because I'm like, I'm like, oh, I can't add another monthly fee. You know, and so I think this
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.640]   this idea and Apple pushed it. Apple pushed all these developers to go to subscription
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:42.120]   because you and I get it. I get that they make more, you know, they have a stable income. They can
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:46.040]   pay for their bills and they can do all those other things. I understand the model, but as a user,
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:50.600]   I'm finding that I don't want to play anymore. And I it has to be really good. And what I do now
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:56.040]   I'll install it. I'll sign up for a subscription and I immediately cancel it. So I wait one day.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:01.000]   I don't know what superstitious I wait one day and I cancel it so that it will go away if
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.760]   you don't use it. If I don't pay attention, it's just going to die at the end of the month.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.040]   Then I'm only paying for that one. And it's just I do it for everything. And then I just
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:14.840]   re-up. Oh, I do use it. I do use it. I use it. I just renew it. But then I delete it again.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:19.000]   Like I just go. So I look at it as I'm using I'm paying for the use of the ones you choose.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.560]   Like one time. Yeah. Because otherwise, if you don't now, I will say that's also why I'm very
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.560]   sensitive to Apple losing control of the app stores because I want that central place.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:33.240]   One thing anybody has any kind of subscription outside of the app store.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:39.880]   The only one that I pay for is audible. But I'm like, I am not touching anything because I can't
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:45.160]   manage it. Like I can manage it inside the Apple App Store. And I can't manage it outside the App Store.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:49.240]   Yeah. I think you might be right. We talked about this on Sunday, didn't we, Jason, about a
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:55.160]   subscription fatigue. And I got a lot of email and comments from listeners who said, yeah,
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:02.520]   subscription fatigue is real. And I don't know if it's related, but you see streaming services.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.880]   Peacock had zero new subscribers this quarter, for instance.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.280]   Well, I think people are starting to make their they have to make start making decisions. Like,
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.880]   I'm looking at all the streaming services I have and looking at it and going, well, do I need
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:16.840]   all of these? And I started trying some off. I never signed up for Paramount because I was like,
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.600]   you're too late. Like I want to. I'm already full. But you know, like, you know, like, you know,
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.440]   peacock. So that's the problem. Yeah. But peacock, you're too late. I'm not going to do that either.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:29.480]   And so, you know, but I hit him. It's all hit. Well, yeah. And it's and you have just enough hits.
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.320]   The funny thing is like, there's like Netflix, I'm always like, I'm going to get rid of them.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.640]   And then I'm like, then I forgot about them. I didn't even have Netflix for like three months.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.240]   And somehow I changed my credit card. I had to change my credit card or whatever. Anyway,
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:45.240]   I think it's my Netflix in trouble because they haven't come up with a new
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:51.160]   hit series like Stranger Things. They're pushing this gray man now.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.960]   They're hoping this will become the next. Sorry. No, I am the target.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.880]   Like I am the target audience. Like you're like, I'm the guy that watches the
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.760]   craze on fire in the Jason Bourne. We've established Jason Bourne. Jack Bauer. I'm all in.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:12.840]   Like that's the my kind of movies too. And it was real. The dialogue was embarrassingly bad.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.320]   The, you know, some of the actions scenes were way over. I mean, like, over the top in,
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:21.160]   like, too under. So there's this thing that people do that is too undercranked.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.920]   So it feels like it's going way too fast. They do it to add more intensity. But if you undercrank
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.000]   too far, it just feels like a cartoon. And that's what they're putting around.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.440]   Yeah. Yeah. Like just things like that's not doesn't feel like it anymore.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.040]   And it's like the Russo brothers. And this is the problem that all the streaming networks have is
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:42.200]   the hand, they hand off all the control to the producers or the showrunners or whatever it is
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:46.120]   because they're just so, they're so happy that they're there. And so the Russo, they got the Russo
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:50.520]   brothers from, they worked on Avengers and now they get to now Netflix gets to do a movie. And they
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:55.720]   said, here's $200 million. Yeah. Do whatever you want. And the Russo's did something with it.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:00.440]   I think this, this going back to Apple though, this also has something to do with something we've
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:06.680]   talked about as Apple started to win awards that producers right now, if you're a content creator,
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:11.240]   you're getting money thrown at you from a variety of places, you're going to look and say, well,
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:16.840]   will my movie do better on Netflix or Apple TV plus? Guess what? TV plus right there,
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.520]   there's there behind you. They're probably offering certain amounts of money if not more.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.880]   Well, and it's the money to you, but it's also, you're looking, this is a stepping
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.760]   promotion. You want to, you want the money for the production. Like how many are you getting $75,000
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.040]   a minute or are you getting $250,000 a minute or are you getting a million dollars a minute?
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.240]   Like those are the all things that they're. Jason, you covered this. You have a podcast in the
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:40.760]   streaming. Yeah, downstream, every LFM. And yeah, it's true. And I also, I did for years, I did a
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.840]   podcast with Tim Goodman from the Hollywood Reporter and we talked about this a lot because he talked
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:50.280]   to the creators of this and it is two things, right? It's the money. And it's also, there's also ego.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:55.320]   And it's a little bit of both. And if Netflix is going to offer you way more money than somebody
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:00.200]   else, but you feel like nobody, your show is not or movie is not going to get promoted or it's going
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.920]   to get promoted for literally a day. And then no one's going to hear about it again for maybe a year.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:11.960]   And so, okay, I'll take the money, whatever, but I think what ends up happening if you're a creative
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:16.520]   person in Hollywood is you start to talk to your agents about calibrating that like,
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:20.120]   where do you want to be? Where do you want your stuff to be promoted? Because it's not just about
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:25.480]   the money you get this time. It's about the money you get potentially next time, right? And so,
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:30.760]   I think Apple TV Plus is an interesting example. One of the reasons Apple wants to win awards
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.160]   for its shows and movies is because of ego, sure. And because it makes them feel like they're
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:39.720]   legitimate. But it also makes the creative talent who wants, who they're trying to woo,
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:46.280]   feel like, oh, if I go to Apple, I'm not going into a black hole. Apple had a best picture winner.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:51.240]   Apple had Ted Lasso, which swept the Emmys. Apple has done really well in getting their,
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:55.480]   because there are fewer shows and movies for them to promote, they make more of an effort for each
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:01.320]   one of them. And if the money is even comparable, I think you go with that. And all of the streamers
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:06.280]   have to compete on that level too of making the visibility of the stuff. Because if you just,
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:10.120]   Netflix writes you a check and then it gets thrown in the pile and nobody knows
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:14.040]   that it's even there. Like that's good for your bank account, but it's not good for your next
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:18.840]   gig. Isn't that the decision, Scorsese made? He went to Netflix to the Irishman. I think it
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:24.120]   kind of sank without a trace. And now he's, where is he? Is it Apple, right? I can't remember. Yeah.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:30.600]   Next project is Apple. Yeah. So right there in a nutshell, there's the story. I think the long
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:37.320]   term, I know Apple's year over year services only went, only went up 12% this year. And that's
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:43.080]   important because Apple really has said this is financially where we want to really put all our
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:48.920]   chips. I still think the long term benefit to them is going to be great. And if you are going to be
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.960]   in a crunch where people have to reduce subscriptions, the Apple one subscription seems like a no
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:59.560]   brainer, right? One thing, you get all the stuff. It's like, like Prime, like Prime, they're playing
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:03.560]   a different game from everyone else. They've got a bundle and they're doing a whole bunch of
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:07.480]   stuff and they're really concerned about their ecosystem rather than any one specific thing.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:13.960]   You know, Netflix needs to make money on Netflix and HBO, Max needs to make money for Warner
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:17.560]   Brothers Discovery, right? Like, and then there's Apple and Amazon who are like, you know, we'll
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:22.920]   throw it all in a bundle and, you know, the value proposition is entirely different because,
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.680]   you know, like, I don't use Apple news, but it's in my Apple one bundle and every now and then I'll
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.920]   use it to read a Wall Street Journal article or somebody gets Prime and, you know, they're for
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.040]   the shipping, but then they get Lord of the Rings and it's just they're not playing the
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:38.040]   same game as everyone else. I call it the Kaiser Sose model.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:44.760]   Wait, wait a minute. You know, you don't always pay you more than the job was worth. He's always
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:50.360]   making money on some other deal. You know, like, it was never like a straight on, like, I'm gonna
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:54.040]   buy something and sell it with for a markup. It's always like it's aggregated across a whole
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.240]   bunch of things. That is exactly what it is. And in fact, something that we also talked about
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.840]   recently, Leo, is that the Apple rumored to do more sports rates. We did, they got the
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:06.840]   MLS. They might get NFL Sunday ticket. And it's it is the Kaiser Sose model, which is, you know,
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:11.800]   the NFL could do their own Sunday ticket. They've already got a product called NFL Plus. They could
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.800]   roll it in there and charge for it. It would all be direct. There'd be no middleman to come right
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.800]   to them, but they don't do it because there's somebody else out there who's playing a totally
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:24.840]   different game. And they're willing to pay more than it's worth because it's Apple or Amazon.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:29.000]   And those are not coincidentally the two companies that are rumored to be bidding for NFL Sunday
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:35.800]   ticket. And in that other game, getting eyeballs from people who watch the NFL in America is worth
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:41.080]   more than the money to give them for it. And so, and it's hard to compete with Amazon and Apple
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:45.400]   for stuff like that because they're not playing the same game. And if Apple ends up with NFL,
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:53.720]   and then they get to use MLS as a proving ground for high frame rate, ARBR, like, you know, MLS is
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:58.920]   is a proof. I believe that taking over all of MLS is going to be great for MLS. Major league
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:04.760]   soccer, which is the US football. So major league soccer. We have we have a soccer league in America
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:09.000]   surprise. Yeah. Well, you're right. And Alex, I'm glad you mentioned that because that's one of the
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.440]   things I know the deal came in very late. And there was a lockout in baseball, but they're Friday
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.800]   night baseball deal. That's one of the things that disappointed me about Friday night baseball,
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:23.480]   and that I hope may be over the off season. They will put more money into, which is I'm disappointed
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:30.360]   in it technologically. I feel like Apple could do a lot more to push, you know, 4k higher frame rate
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:36.760]   and changing it to not feel like it's just a cable TV baseball broadcast imported into Apple
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:41.080]   TV plus and the problem that they haven't done that yet because because they're working with
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:45.320]   other broadcasters, they're not the only ones owning that game for MLS. Actually, that's not that's
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:50.360]   that's not true. Friday night baseball. Those aren't they own those games. They aren't anywhere else.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:54.520]   They're being but they're being produced by MLB network. That's the problem. They're produced by
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:59.000]   MLB. That's the problem. If Apple comes in and says, okay, now we're going to use a different
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.320]   kind of camera. Yeah, higher frame rates. You know who's doing that sort of as you have. Have you
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:09.240]   watched any of the US football league games? USFL, they've got drone shots. They're actually a drone
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:16.120]   in the whole. It's crazy. But I guess they got helmets. It gets you excited about the potential
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.240]   is and that's what you're saying. And I think that's exactly right.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:24.520]   And then suddenly Apple is delivering something on their platform because everybody in sports is
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:30.040]   looking at 120. So like there was a tent in Japan and you know, the Japanese are really
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:34.200]   interested in 120. They are 20 frames per second. You're talking about it. And they were viewing
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:40.920]   parts of the sports in 120 frame per second 8k, you know, HDR on this. It's stunning. It's stunning.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.920]   It just looks like a window. I didn't see it, but I. But you can't deliver it over cable or
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:49.560]   over satellite. You have to stream it. But you can stream it. Yeah. And yeah. So you can now,
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:54.760]   if only you had an Apple TV with a chip that was able to do 120, which already is in the last one.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:37:02.760]   Oh, wow. So so so it's all there. And all Apple has to do. I mean, is turn it on. And so the and so
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:07.800]   you could end up with this. And then what happens when you start, you know, during the game, there's
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.640]   VR and AR opportunities. There's all kinds of other things for glasses. There's all kinds of
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:15.800]   things that they can start doing that. It's just anytime you work with a broadcaster who's already
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:21.000]   doing it or a company that's already done it, they have a machine. It is so hard. I mean, I do this
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.400]   all the time is work with them. It's so hard to get in because they get paid to have it sort of do,
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:31.880]   you know, to do the thing. And they don't want to change a lot of things and, you know, oh, we do
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:36.840]   1080i. Like, like, let's just stick with 1080i, you know, and getting to 1080p is a big deal,
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:44.120]   let alone 4k for these productions. And now Amazon has gotten to 4k on, I think 4k 60 for the
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:48.600]   Thursday night games. But the, but you know, and then you have to build the whole pipeline. You
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:53.480]   have to have all the things that Apple has to be able to do this to innovate to innovate the way
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:59.080]   sports is covered. You have to have the devices, you have to have the transport system, you have to
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:03.880]   have, you know, the contracts. So Apple is like slowly tying all these bits together to,
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:09.960]   you know, arguably the most valuable real estate on TV, which is live, because live is still
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:13.960]   something you have to, you know, you can't skip the ads because there's just, you can, you can
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:19.560]   walk out or whatever, but, but otherwise they're there. Apple's deal with Major League Soccer
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:25.640]   starts next year and it's for 10 years. Yeah, it's 100% exclusive. And it's everything. It's
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:29.560]   everything. They are producing with the league. They're producing every game. It will be some
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:32.920]   somewhere else so they can really push. So you've got to figure this is unlike the
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:37.400]   Friday night baseball. This really, I think your right Alex is the opportunity for Apple to shine
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:42.760]   and show. They have a lab for the next 10 years. Yeah. That no one's going to complain about because
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:47.000]   MLS wasn't getting that much coverage. Right. They weren't getting that much TV distribution.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.520]   They're going to be in it. They're going to be actually going to make me want to subscribe to
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:54.360]   Oh, absolutely. Well, well, it's going to come with your comes with Apple TV. One
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:58.520]   happens. No additional cost. Yeah, I bet. I bet. That's not true. That's not true. They're
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.440]   actually going to have free games. They're going to have games that are for Apple TV plus subscribers.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:06.520]   But to get everything, it's going to be like a channel, a package where you have to buy in.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.520]   Or if you're an MLS season ticket holder, I think you get a free. Yeah, you get you actually get
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:14.760]   an Apple one account if you're an S like if you did that with ML if you did that with MLB or NFL,
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:20.040]   people would be out with pitchforks and torches, you know, because they're taking away their thing
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:25.000]   and putting on Apple TV. But with MLS, it's going to just expand that market dramatically for soccer
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.800]   and it's brilliant for MLS because they need that kick in the butt. And it's brilliant for Apple.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.160]   Yeah. And first year may just be them figuring out how to do it. So we may not see any of the
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:37.400]   things I just talked about, but I bet you. So I have somebody who can say,
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:45.800]   I'm sure they've got that guy on under cancer probably is on tap for that. But yeah,
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:49.400]   I hope they do that with baseball too, because they only do two games a week and
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:54.920]   straight in the space ball. Very disappointed. Very disappointed. To do something that doesn't
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:59.160]   look like every other baseball game. If they get out from my MLB though, right? They got to
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:03.160]   start producing themselves. I don't know. I mean, maybe, although the MLB network could probably
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.680]   still produce it for him, you probably want to hire somebody who actually knows how to do
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:12.680]   this kind of production. But you know, but push, push that would help to push them further. Yeah.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:18.680]   The commentary is so bad on Friday. I turn it on and I go, do you guys act? Did you guys ever play
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:22.520]   baseball? Like I'm not sure if you played Alex, that is that is state of the art for national
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.600]   baseball broadcast right now. Unfortunately, is it's like a podcast that happens at a baseball
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:31.880]   game? And if you watch ESPN Sunday night baseball, it's the it's the exact same thing. And it's really
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:36.520]   too bad. It's like it's like national baseball broadcast. They think that nobody who watches,
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:41.320]   watches a national baseball broadcast likes baseball. So they have to distract them with other stories.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:47.000]   So tough. And I don't get it. I don't get it. You fire up your tune in radio pro. You get the local
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.760]   play by play guys. So who are always great? Because they're homeless.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:56.040]   MLS and they haven't done this with MLB and they should. But with these MLS games, they've said
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:03.160]   they're going to do local radio as an additional audio. And that's one of those ideas, right? You're
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:07.640]   streaming. You can have that kind of control. I don't know why Friday baseball, maybe it's a
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:13.320]   right thing, but they should they should roll in the local radio. That audio that audio at
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.360]   basketball and football, everything of that that audio is available at the stadium. I mean,
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.960]   it's like plug in, plug out because they're there. Right? They're covering it. All you got to do is
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.920]   get the feed and you can you can just draw it right. The big problem with baseball is it's such
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:27.480]   an old fashioned game that people who are baseball fans are such traditionalists that you don't want
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:31.320]   to mess with it too much. But what I would say is you don't do that. You don't do that. You're
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:36.280]   terrible. The thing is, is that if you get really good commentary, the great thing. Oh, you got to
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.080]   have good commentary. I grow up. But I'm saying you're not going to have somebody in the chat
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:46.040]   for saying you need black light baseballs. No, you can't do that. The thing is is that if you get
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:52.280]   people who really know the game and and they're commentating between baseball is really great
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:56.920]   because it's so slow in the sense that you can fill it with the reason the commentary is more
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:02.760]   important for baseball than any other game. Maybe cricket is is that they're both really slow. There's
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:08.360]   a lot of time between plays. And so there's all this like story telling there. I grew up in my father
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:14.200]   and his best friend. They could literally give you the starting lineup from 1955 until, you know,
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:18.360]   1975, like literally all of them. And they sit there and talk about what all this means and all
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:22.680]   this and all this and it was like this the game just blew by because I could barely keep up with
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:26.440]   all the information. It's really interesting. But you need but and we've given up on those kinds
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:31.480]   of commentators that that are that are giving you what I don't want them to do. They don't
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:35.880]   do crazy things. They just need to pack it with information. So between those things. I want to
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.960]   push back on that a little bit. I think that one of the challenges local broadcast do that.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:46.200]   National broadcast tend not to. I do think it's a lack of imagination on the part of the networks
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.240]   who are afraid. Blamed TBS. Blamed TBS. Blamed TBS.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:53.000]   People don't like baseball. Jackpot. It's all his fault.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   And I wouldn't even blame the announcers because you know what some of those announcers are really
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.520]   good. They could be good. But they are being told what kind of show like Hunter Pence does
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:08.760]   apples west coast games. And he recently sat in on some Giants games. And he was great. And yet on
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:14.760]   the national broadcast he's so restrained and kind of not. You know, it's just the same.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:20.440]   Those guys reading the stats cards. You know the guy behind him with the statisticians behind
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:25.080]   them giving him a card. And then it's kind of it's it's just lacks all the life. Because that
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:29.080]   stat is sponsored by some betting company. And so they have to read it. And it's the whole thing.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:34.920]   I mean, yeah, this is not a podcast about baseball. But I think your point is it wouldn't it be nice
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:39.080]   if Apple in any of these places where they get to innovate everything.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.520]   Yes. It should actually make it look like it could only be on Apple TV.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:48.680]   And you look at and you look at like the NFL. I mean, they spend years on every new camera,
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:53.240]   every new thing. You'll see just you'll see something like sprinkle into like those the goalpost,
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:58.840]   the the the the pile on cameras were being used without being without making it to broadcast for
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:03.320]   two or three years before they put them in. They're constantly pushing that outside envelope. And
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:08.040]   those those games you watch something beautifully game, which is kind of the the best live sports
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:13.720]   you can see in my opinion. Like it's just so packed with production quality. The that there's just
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:18.440]   they you've got people totally explaining what's happening. They're explaining how it works. They're
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:22.840]   writing over top of the the screen. They're doing all those other things. And it just it
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:26.920]   deepens that whole experience. And I think Apple could keep on going with that and add VR and add
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:33.160]   other things and and again, I do think I agree with you, Jason. I think that why make something
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:38.120]   lukewarm when you can make it great for the people who are excited about it and let them know why
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:42.440]   would you watch baseball if you didn't like it. We always said that tech TV tech TV there was
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:46.520]   always this push to make it more appealing to people who don't like tech. And it's that well,
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:50.360]   would you do that? That's nuts. Why would you do that? Yeah. So I want to I want to throw some
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:54.680]   praise on a on a service that has been demeaned while we're talking about this peacock got an
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:45:00.920]   exclusive game this year. That's a Sunday morning game. And they put a they put to broadcast
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:05.320]   group together for where it's Jason Benetti, who is one of the very best baseball broadcasters.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:09.400]   He's a white Sox broadcaster and he has been doing his p.m. just got hired by Fox actually.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:14.520]   And you'll see him in the postseason for Fox as well. Great guy. His his broadcast is him
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:20.360]   paired with two people who are experts from each team. Either a play by player commentator or
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:25.240]   somebody else who is around the team. And so it's you get a really good announcer and two experts
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:30.840]   because part of baseball's appeal is the narrative around like the the very long season and 100
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:35.720]   and 62 games and all of that. And I think the peacock Sunday morning broadcast has actually been
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:42.200]   really good. And it's that would be more of a model. I think maybe that Apple should play with
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.840]   and the thing that we did. I did a bunch of live streams about 25
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:50.840]   basketball games. And one of the things that we did is we took an ex player from the team that
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:56.200]   we were covering in a social media person who really knows basketball and really likes that team.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:02.360]   And it was unabashedly just that's okay. And the thing is is that and it was awesome because
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:06.680]   and and and also there was no rules. So there was like he shouldn't have done that. And that was
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:11.720]   like on his own team. Like that was a dumb move talking through it. But someone who had been there
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:14.440]   and then someone else who could hold the hold the space. And then we gave him a
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:18.760]   illustrator and all this other stuff. And it was you know, and I was like, I'd much rather watch
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:22.680]   this than any broadcast. Honestly, I think some of it is also a ders of talent. There.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:27.080]   There's so many games now players and there's a lot of players that know a lot of things.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:30.920]   Yeah, but you know, Vince Scully, a really talented play by the match.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:34.120]   You got it. You got it. Those guys. I think they're not enough of them.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:38.360]   I really like. No, there's there's 30 teams and you could probably name about 20 broadcasters
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:42.680]   who are at that level. Yeah, maybe maybe 30. But I know a little bit about this. I was good
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:47.240]   friends with the Giants guy Hank Greenwall for years because I worked in the Giants radio station.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:54.440]   And his son Doug Greenwald, who has been working his way up. You start in single a ball and you sell
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:58.920]   ads and you do the play by playing. He's been working as we went to Syracuse where all the great
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:05.240]   play by play guys go. It's really hard to get to be a Vince Scully or Hank Greenwall.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:09.800]   It's tough. When you're behind the scenes, you realize it's insane data. Like how much data
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:14.520]   that's coming at you that you have to call out and make it all work. There's this ineffable
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:19.080]   skill. And they give a sound calm. Yeah, there's just some and it's got storytelling and it's a
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:23.800]   love of the game. And there's some skill. It's just, you know, and the and the greats
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:29.640]   in all sports, you know, are you can you can name them because they're so great. So yeah,
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:37.720]   by the way, Apple, Luca Main Street did announce has 860 million paid subscriptions across his
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:42.760]   services, Apple Music, Apple TV, plus Apple News, iCloud. That is an app store. That actually
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:47.880]   includes all app store subscriptions. They consider their Oh, that doesn't. Oh, never mind then,
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:52.280]   but it grows. It's a big number that keeps getting bigger. That's why they say it is.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:56.840]   It is a big number that keeps growing. And so when you're looking at services,
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:01.240]   please be aware that Apple is building its subscriber base incrementally all the time.
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:07.880]   Yeah. And I can see now why Apple's really focused on services as being the revenue gross
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:11.640]   tool because they, you know, you can all, you know, especially if you can't get enough parts to make
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:18.600]   enough Mac books to sell them. It's just super stable. Like just monthly salesforce.com or whatever.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:22.200]   So yeah, it's just there's a let's take a break. When we come back, I want to talk about what
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:26.360]   happened with wearables because that is interesting. And maybe you're right, Alex,
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:31.000]   people just don't need to buy them every year. I don't know. Alex Lindsey, Jason Stell,
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:38.440]   Andy and I co we are talking Macintosh and baseball. And you recommended that
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:42.040]   Ron Shelton book the church of baseball and listen to that about the making of Bull Durham.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:47.400]   Oh, what a good book. What it makes me it makes me love baseball all over again.

[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:06.760]   You know, I'm thinking I am on last, not, not, I'm on a, not a seven, a six, Apple Watch six.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:12.440]   Although I have to say because of all the, see, see, you're right. I haven't, I didn't feel any
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:18.440]   need to upgrade. Although now because of all the rumors about this year's Apple Watch, maybe I will.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:27.160]   Is that why wearable sales are down? I think it's a, I think that Apple's having a harder time
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:31.080]   convincing people that this new thing is way, way better than the thing you've got on your wrist
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:35.240]   right now. I think that's a casualty of the fact that we don't spend a lot of time on our
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:39.080]   watches. We spend a lot of time on our phones, because in a lot of times looking at the pictures
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:42.840]   we take on our phones, wishing that gosh, wish they wish that camera were better. We spend a lot
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:47.800]   of time on our laptops. And suddenly we're doing a lot more video conferencing and we wish this,
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:53.160]   this handled live streaming a lot better. And that's a failure point. Watches continue to work
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:58.280]   until the battery pillows out and explodes out the screen, at which point you are very
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:03.480]   amenable to buying a new watch other than that, unless Apple, until Apple comes out with an amazing
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:08.760]   new sensor. And the FDA approves the use of that sensor for something that will make you the star
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:17.720]   of yet another Apple. I was about dead. And then the visit the hollow, a ghost force version of
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:25.080]   Steve Jobs elevated in front of me and go to dig a bunch. And then Han Solo saved me until they
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:28.760]   can do that again. I don't think there are there aren't all hold on elbows on the ribs saying,
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:32.680]   hey, buy upgrade upgrade, get a new watch kit. Yeah, yeah, this is not I mean, that's always
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:37.480]   been the case. But if you look at year over year, thanks to Jason Stell's Fine six colors.com graph,
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:43.880]   year over year where wearables revenue change, it's been positive every quarter until this quarter
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:49.880]   where it was down 8%. Apple ascribes this, they say that this is the place where they felt like the
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:55.160]   economy, the macro economic conditions right now really were most visible. And I think that goes
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:53:00.200]   to what you said, which is in times where you're questioning what your budget is for technology
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:05.720]   purchases, one of the more expendable things might be wearables, home and accessories, which is the
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:12.040]   full name of this category that in the accessory market and in an Apple watch or AirPods or a HomePod
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:15.560]   or whatever that that's a place where you know, you okay, I'm going to buy the computer, but I'm
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:20.520]   not going to upgrade or buy a new accessory. And they said like in contrast, the iPhone showed no
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:25.320]   signs of the economic climate, but wearable, which is weird. They think it absolutely did.
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:29.560]   It's much more expensive than any of those things you just mentioned. Yeah, but more important,
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:34.840]   right? More more necessary in a lot of ways to have your smartphone with you than it is to get a new
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:41.320]   watch or upgrade your your pods or anything you want to do. And I do find that until I had COVID
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:46.920]   and I had needed, I was interested in my blood oxygen level or whatever. There's not that much that
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:53.240]   that I use that I couldn't use in the last three or four versions. Like I am, I use the stopwatch
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:58.680]   all the time. You know, so I use that, you know, so the timers or whatever, not stopwatch,
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:03.800]   but timers. I have gotten somewhat attached to the exercise thing like, hey, you're now walking,
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:07.880]   are you taking a hike, you know, and that kind of thing. But but outside of that, I have to admit,
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:12.120]   it's mostly for time. And I really like all the time that options that I have in my little thing.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:15.480]   But once I got to that, I don't know, like I'm kind of curious, like, what are they going to
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:19.240]   add that would have me need? And I went two or three years without upgrading because I was just
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:23.000]   kind of like, well, this is doing the thing. So I think it's it's a crazy thing that we've got
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:27.160]   into the habit where it looks sounds weird that people aren't buying a new watch every year.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:32.280]   Apple was smart though. They made sure that the AirPods battery was not replaceable. So you'd
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.920]   have to buy one every other year. Yeah, there's that.
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:41.880]   What do we know what proportion in the wearables category each product represents? We don't know.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:46.440]   No, I mean, I'm sure there's an analyst who's made an estimate of it that they don't disclose
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:51.560]   that except in the Vegas of of words where they'll say, oh, Apple watched it well or AirPods did well,
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:55.960]   they don't talk about it. And I don't know if it's affected at all, but I know that a growing number
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:55:03.080]   of people, including me, have become really frustrated with the pairing. Like with with, I mean, when
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:07.880]   when we first got the AirPods, it was it was like magic. Like you open it up and it just worked.
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:14.600]   Now it's like, I don't, you know, like I have a phone opened. I'm trying to make a phone call.
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:21.320]   That's probably the device I want you to talk to. And it's just not connecting, you know, like an
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:26.040]   inside. And then I had one that said, it's I couldn't get it to connect. So I finally reset that thing.
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:29.560]   And then it said, you don't own these. And then I had to figure out how to get past the you don't
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:34.520]   own these thing. And so the thing is, is that whatever Apple has done to try to make this smoother
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:39.400]   or whatever, it is not smooth. That's interesting. And it is really, it's a big selling, really painful.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:43.400]   And it was a big selling point. And I get frustrated by it all the time. And now I have a lot of devices.
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:48.840]   I have multiple phones. I have iPads. I have computers. But I'm only using one of them. And
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:53.960]   especially the part that I get frustrated about is really the I'm holding a phone, making a phone
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:58.280]   call. This is the one that I want. Oh, that drives me nuts. You know, like it's like, that's actually
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:03.000]   everything else. Use AirPods. Yeah. And and and I moved, you know, I I recommended it a couple
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:09.480]   weeks ago, but you know, I moved to the the the the shocks open open because yeah, the after
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:14.280]   shocks open comms because number one is that it's only paired to one phone and it just works every
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:18.040]   time I turn it on. It's dumb. It's not smart enough to say, Oh, I don't want to use this.
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:24.120]   Going around. Yeah, no, just stay with also. Also, I it's got a it's got a little boom.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:29.640]   And my the folks on the other side of the call say they can barely hear anything else other than
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:34.600]   that way better than the than the AirPod pros. Nice. And so I mean, we tested it head to head and
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:38.360]   it's just night and day. And so I want people to actually be able to hear me on the other side
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:43.240]   regardless of how convenient it is. And and so I started, you know, I moved away and I, you know,
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:46.840]   I don't know. I mean, I'd have to see something pretty great to move back to the AirPods, to be
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:51.400]   honest. And suddenly that I hit that headphone jack's looking pretty cool.
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:57.320]   I love my head. Yeah, I still have one in my bag. I always have one in my bag because I have
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:01.480]   I have I have the little adapter and I have headphones and that that's my record because,
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:07.080]   you know, yeah. I've had a weird problem. Maybe you guys can help me.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:13.240]   For some reason, and this happens over and over. Lisa says it happens to her too. I cannot swipe up
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:19.160]   on the Apple Watch. And the only fix I've tried all the online fixes turn haptics on and off
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:23.640]   unless of the only fixes to do a complete reset. Has anybody experienced is that just me?
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:28.040]   This is the series six not a serious problem. I can't swipe up or down which really kind of
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:31.880]   limits the usefulness of the Apple Watch. I'll be honest with you. I can still hit the
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:37.160]   stem and get to the apps, but I can't swipe down to see notifications and I can't swipe up to,
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:41.080]   you know, put it and do not disturb or things like that. That's so that's just maybe this just I
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:45.960]   got a bad one. That's weird. Okay, no, nobody ever heard of that.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:54.120]   Chattram, anybody ever hear of that problem? I'm trying to get a little extra help here.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:58.680]   All right, moving. I think there's a movie where the person realized finally, the third act realizes,
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:01.880]   Oh my God, I must be dead. It's not it's not a broken watch. It's just that
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:08.600]   my skin no longer conducts. Oh, maybe that's it. Maybe I'm dead. I see dead people or look
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:12.920]   on the bright side. You could be one of the undead. I must be one of the undead.
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:19.160]   Thanks for the bright side. I'm very much a glass of blood half full.
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:31.240]   Anything else to say about the, you know, overall quarter was a good choice. Apple's
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:36.280]   going to do okay. Apple's going to survive. It's not over. Yeah, Apple's okay. They're going to be fine.
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:42.280]   Okay, okay. But for all of you who who lived through the 90s and thought every quarter,
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:47.960]   that might be the end. That's true. They got to within one quarter, I think of
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:54.680]   I will say that reading to me, the most interesting part is always the call where,
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:59.480]   as Jason indicated, that they have to answer questions. And if they don't answer truthfully,
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:04.520]   people go to jail. And I thought that reading through it a couple of times, it seemed like
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:11.400]   a very, very defensive, reserved. I'm not, I've got a script in front of me. No matter what
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:16.680]   question is asked of me, I'm going to respond to the script. I am not going to be broader. I'm
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:21.000]   going to be completely focused. Almost every question, there was an opportunity to mention a
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:26.440]   new product or a new update that they did a couple months ago. Whereas this is usual, not that,
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:31.880]   not that CEOs are going to be so undisciplined, they're going to start freestyle wrapping during
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:37.800]   a call with analysts, but they were absolutely tight-butted in a way that I've never seen them
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:43.720]   before. Even even when someone even when one analyst threw Tim a softball about augmented reality,
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:50.600]   expecting him to essentially be coy and hinting and excited, he said, well, we're very, very excited
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:56.280]   that we've got a live over 11,000 AR kit supporting apps in the app store that of course are running
[00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:01.640]   on the iPhone and iPad. Beyond this, we have no other comment. It's like, ooh, these, it's,
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:06.600]   it's almost as if they were like, we have a, we have a very specific goal here. We want to avoid
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:11.000]   disaster. This is a trend that's been going on for a while now. I didn't actually think this was
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.680]   different from the last three or four. They used to be way more freewheeling. And what has happened
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:19.320]   is first off, they've taken up, they now take up about half the time of this hour of this call,
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:23.640]   which again, like when do you get a Q&A with Apple executives ever, even though these aren't
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:28.200]   journalists, they're financial analysts, but still when? Well, they started filling up the first half
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:35.400]   hour of the hour with the CEO and CFO reading from prepared statements. You can literally hear
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:41.560]   the paper pages turning as they read them because I'm there transcribing it all. You can hear them.
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:45.080]   I've emailed them. I've said, can you just send me that? Someone don't have to transcribe it.
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:49.720]   And then, and then the Q&A, yeah, Andy is exactly right. That was, I try, I read a
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:54.360]   mackerel column about this every quarter. And one of the things I try to do is give like little,
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:58.360]   little head nods to the analysts who try things. So like the guy who tried to ask about
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:04.280]   abstracting transparency, like good job, completely ignored the question, very politician-like answer,
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:08.600]   where he named two other things that were sort of related, didn't connect them and then moved on.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:14.120]   And then yeah, absolutely, Ben Bolin, the analyst, asked about AR and VR, did it in a clever way where
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:20.440]   he said, just, you know, progress in your existing products, just like trying to trick them or something.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:24.520]   And Tim Cook's response was, yeah, he talked about ARKit. And then at the end, he did say,
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:29.800]   we're always exploring new and emerging technologies, but I wouldn't want to say anything about that,
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:35.320]   which I took to be like a wink. Like everybody knows, Tim, everybody knows, and Tim knows that
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:41.720]   everybody knows. But yeah, they're super disciplined. They've cut the Q&A time to half, and they never
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:47.720]   really, there are details in there that are interesting that you can glean, but it's a fraction of what
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:51.800]   was there even in like a year. I mean, that's good messaging management. I mean, that's what
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.720]   they're supposed to do. I mean, it's not fun for us, but it's what they're supposed to do.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:02.040]   It's not anything about the car project, tighten anything at all about the car? No, strangely no.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:08.200]   But let me tell you again about how much money we give to developers. So, yeah, it's a great,
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:13.560]   they do a lot. They're just very on message. Yeah. Yeah, that's what annoyed me. That's it.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:20.840]   Well, we noticed that we just got an hour before this call that three quarters of the campus is
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:25.880]   on fire and there are alien spaceships above that. Could you let us know if this is going to
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:31.000]   affect productivity for the next quarter? Like, well, we're really focused on the new spatial
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.800]   audio features of the new AirPods and how they're opening a brand new, like, yeah, okay.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:40.840]   We believe privacy is a human right and that does not apply to aliens. Speaking of spatial,
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:47.640]   I've been meaning to ask you this, Jason, you're using iOS 16. Have you tried the thing where you
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:56.520]   take a picture of your ear? Yeah, I tried it. Does it work? I mean, it said it did. I see.
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:02.120]   I hear some people say it makes a big difference. I have heard no difference. I haven't tested
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.480]   deeply, but I did have it take pictures of my ears the other day, which was weird.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:13.160]   It's using the spatial front camera, the depth sensor to do that. Yeah, it is. It's trying to map
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:16.920]   the inside of my ear, I guess, and do that. I haven't noticed any difference in how my AirPods
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:21.800]   sound. That's because your ear is more normal. I bet if somebody had a cavernous ear or a teeny
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:27.320]   ear, I make more. I think it's pretty small. Yeah. I know. I think it's brilliant because
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:31.640]   I'm only half joking here. Audio files. I mean, the audio files go for anything.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:38.440]   They are so easy to convince or to help them convince themselves that whatever stupid silly thing
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:43.720]   has made the audio better for them. I'll be fair and say, okay, maybe at this point,
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:49.640]   the quality of the audio hardware and software they're using is so high that any difference is
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:55.800]   going to be noticeable and appreciated. But I'm sorry, if you've got little cross bucks,
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:01.160]   keeping the interconnects from your speakers off the ground because all the impedance, the
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:07.560]   impedance, I feel as though it'll make them feel as a, wow, no, I'm taking a picture. This
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:12.440]   software is customized too much. It's kind of like having custom in-ear monitors only done
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:16.760]   computationally via software. That's going to at least make them feel better about the money they
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:20.920]   spent on these. I think that if you were the person that could hear the difference so that you took a
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:26.440]   CD and took a green Sharpie and went around the outside to keep it from, to keep light from escaping
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:34.760]   from the CD ROM, this, the scanning is for you. I have a histogram. Look, that proves that this
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:41.240]   sounds better. How hard was it to, so you got to get the true camera looking like a Proose
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:47.320]   Spatial? It's literally the face ID training. So it gives you a little circle. You're supposed
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:51.000]   to put your ear in it. You're supposed to move your head around. It beeps when you're ready
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.480]   to go to the other ear. It's basically ear ID.
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:59.080]   And it's the end. Actually, somebody back in Cupertino's turning on the camera every time you do that
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:04.520]   and just laughing at you. A little work. New person. At what, at what point has somebody,
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:10.040]   what conference room has someone said, what if we tell people that nasal cavities increase
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:15.720]   resonance and if they put these special nose plugs in, it will actually give you give them better
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:19.240]   presence, stage presence. You just like, I bet we can get them to do that. We have a big coffee.
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:24.680]   Just 800 dollars for these plugs. You just need, you just need someone on TikTok to show how it works.
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:31.400]   Again, I'm sure there are already. And now, and now here's the histogram that I made after putting
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:38.760]   these nose plugs in. And you can see by the histogram. Too bad there isn't a better search on TikTok
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:46.440]   because I'd like to search for things like that. That'd be handy. Apple did hire an executive from
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:54.040]   Lamborghini to work on its electric car. Apple's like the heck, the heck was $50,000 cars. Let's
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:06:00.600]   just make self driving happily not to our store. It doesn't have to be street legal, does it?
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:06.920]   Okay. All right. All right. Like everybody get your Lamborghini jokes out now because I think the
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:11.640]   most interesting thing is what part of what was he in charge of at Lamborghini? And the answer is
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:17.160]   the chassis including handling suspension steering brakes and rims. This is a nitty gritty car
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:22.200]   hardware guy. And if Apple hired him, like that doesn't strike me as a guy you hire if you're
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:27.560]   just working on some snow. That's a car guy. Yeah, this is the nuts and bolts. This is hardware.
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:32.840]   Luigi Taraborle. He's 20 year veteran of Lamborghini. He's got the name.
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:40.200]   Hey, Luigi. That name says to me that that electrical system will be total crap.
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:49.880]   He designed the Urus, the Huracan and the Avantador, Avantador. In addition to more limited models
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:58.360]   like the Huracan's Tarrato off road vehicle and the Asterion concept car. But you're right. He's a
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:02.440]   head of chassis and vehicle dynamics. That's exactly what you need if you're going to build a vehicle.
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:09.320]   Right. Yeah. But at this point, I've felt I've fielded so many stories from the outside, so many
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:17.320]   rumors from the inside that I'm not 100% convinced that Apple has any specific plan. And when I hear
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:23.400]   about a hire like this, that's absolutely correct. And it's important to know what this person
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:28.760]   did in this previous job and what they might bring to an Apple car project. But it might
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:32.840]   indicate that yes, they are definitely building a real car or it might indicate that again,
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:36.680]   they don't really know what they're doing. They want to get as much expertise as possible. And this
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:42.760]   is another person who got this is another person who will who got the really great slide deck who
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:48.840]   really who got the really great presentation and and two years is going to be leaving because
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:52.920]   whatever you can do that and get to do that. Not only are these people expensive, you have to
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:08:00.040]   lure them away from he's been there for 20 years. But also what kind of weird environment must it be
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:07.880]   to have all these really talented engineers coming to work if there's nothing to work on. I mean,
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:12.040]   it's got to be. I mean, when you're an R&D though, it's not that there's nothing to work on. It's
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:18.200]   sometimes way more fun, you know, for the for the because it's all blue sky. I remember talking
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:24.360]   to someone at at a talking to someone at Microsoft and they were in a team that wasn't releasing
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:29.240]   anything. They were just they were at Microsoft to test this. This is actually photosynt, right?
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:35.560]   And they had no interest in like the team had no interest in getting a released product because
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:39.080]   like then they'd have to support it, you know, like like, but they were having a fun time and
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:43.240]   they're doing great technology. They were doing all this personal person. I think a lot of people
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:49.320]   want to have a product come out. I remember working for Sif Davis for four years, so-called,
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:53.640]   you know, working on their television division and even being told we would go down to
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:59.080]   Gina Smith and I would go down to MGM and hang. We had offices at MGM Studios
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:03.240]   and being told by my boss, oh, yeah, we have no intent of doing anything or any business with
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:07.880]   them. But just we want you to go down there and do that. Yeah. It was to my
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:10.680]   life. I think it's different from a broadcast. I think it's different though from being a
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:17.000]   broadcaster waiting to broadcast as opposed to someone that's in doing R&D. There's
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.880]   kind of a fun academic thing that happens and it's dangerous because if you're not doing something
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:24.760]   but they've got cars out there. They're still doing something. Yeah, yeah, they're going.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:29.800]   I know I just I guess I would say I know I don't know anybody at Apple working on the car, but I know
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:34.440]   other people working on self-driving cars and I don't get any impression that any of those
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:38.360]   engineers are in any rush to release the car. They're just having a great time with a whole
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:42.440]   bunch of money. They got a whole bunch of sensors. They got a whole bunch of things going out there.
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:46.840]   They come back. They're passionate about what they do. They love doing it. I don't get that they're
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:53.080]   they were that they'd care. Like they're just like it's a really, really fun environment for
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:56.680]   them to be and they've got pool tables and you know, free lunch and you know, they're doing one
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:02.360]   of our chatters. I won't name names works for Nokia and he says, I abhor having to work on actual
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:08.360]   products. We have to interact with customers to fend ourselves when we miss deadlines.
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:16.600]   Pure R&D is lovely. Exactly. Okay, I guess we do it. We do know that there's a history at Apple
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.760]   of at for a time they have they're having problems attracting the right talent because
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:25.800]   the word result that if you if you're a researcher and you work for Apple, guess what? You are never
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:29.880]   going to be able to talk about any of the research you're doing. You're not going to be able to publish
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:33.640]   nearly the quantity of stuff that you were expecting to publish and part of it and they
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:38.760]   Apple decided to loosen the leash a little bit but it's still not the same as working for almost
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:44.120]   any other company where you get to you get to have you get to have you don't it's it's nice to have
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:48.840]   that block on your resume in which they okay so you were working at Apple for seven years. What
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:53.240]   did you do? It's nice to be able to say well I did this research this research. They hear the papers
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:58.360]   I published and here's the stuff as opposed to I'm not allowed to talk about anything I did at Apple.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:03.160]   I think I would get I think I have to tell it I think I can't tell you that I it didn't involve
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:08.440]   a mop come in a bucket come to think of it. What am I saying? Of course I know how I just like to
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:15.960]   work in a product that never I am a podcaster that's that's in the nature of the business Alex
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:20.680]   you were going to say something. There's a lot of there's a lot of weight all I can say is there's
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:24.680]   a lot of weight when you can just tell someone like I worked on this and they say what did you do?
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:29.320]   I can't tell you that from especially from Apple that's like that is if they knew that you worked
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:33.400]   in that field and they say I can't talk about that. I can't tell you about that. I'm you know under
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:38.440]   NDA I'm not at Apple you know like when you come and again the thing is if you're trying to get
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:44.600]   another job working in especially Apple but any of the thing you know it's not that hard.
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:49.880]   After you after you you know get get through two years three years it's not hard to get another
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:55.960]   job. It reminds me of the TV show Silicon Valley. Remember where they when they didn't have any
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:00.600]   use for me they they they just went up to the roof and they sat there and had lunch and they
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:07.320]   were still employed but they just had a perpetual perpetual lunch upstairs. Our show to retain a
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:13.560]   little break come back with more Alex Lindsey. Wonderful to have you from 090.media and the
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:21.240]   office hours.global from WGBH in Boston. Mr. Andy and I co-json Snell from six colors.com the master
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:27.800]   of the color graph. Our show today brought to you by Nomad and this is a good time to talk about
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:32.360]   Nomad. They've just introduced I think my favorite product. Lisa and I have two of these
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:37.240]   the base one. They've just introduced the gold version. Now I might have to get another one.
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:43.000]   Nomad does amazing stuff. You may be familiar with Nomad but they started
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:49.800]   some almost a decade ago. 20. Yeah it was 2012. As a Kickstarter project
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:56.360]   their goal then was to build the ultra rugged minimalist tools for the 21st century.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:00.760]   That would seamlessly integrate into your everyday carry in for the last nine years.
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:05.400]   They've expanded into a wide range of mobile accessories. iPhone cases with beautiful
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:11.480]   whore-ween leather. Apple watch straps. I love my Nomad watch straps. The leather in that is
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:18.520]   is not only beautiful but at ages so well. Wireless chargers like that incredible boy that
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:27.000]   this new charger is base one and gold. Gorgeous premium wallets passport holders with
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.160]   whore-ween leather. That's the tannery in Chicago that was founded more than 100 years ago
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:38.120]   that gives you this such beautiful leather smells beautiful. It feels the touch it feels beautiful
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:46.120]   but also it ages so beautifully. You get this rich patina that's unique to yours which is also
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:52.280]   great. Wireless charging take a look at the AC adapters using these new GAN adapters. They've
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:58.600]   got 30 watt and 65 watt GAN adapters that are tiny. I think this base station is incredible. Lisa likes
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:04.920]   the base one because she can charge her watch and her phone at the same time the mag safe adapter
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:10.280]   and the watch adapter. It's so pretty now this gold one. It's a limited edition though so I'm
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:16.120]   telling you about it now but don't waste time. They have gold limited edition. They have carbide
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:21.160]   which is when we have in silver. This is interesting because the gold is a little less expensive
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:28.200]   than the other ones. I guess it's a special deal that marked them down. So wow get on over there

[01:15:52.760 --> 01:16:00.360]   Washington Post interesting article. Jeffrey Fowler. Electronics are built with death dates.
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:04.760]   Let's not keep them a secret. This is this is in reference to that AirPods.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:10.200]   Thing I mentioned which is that you know the batteries glued in and after two years is gone.
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:18.120]   It's gone. So he has a gadget graveyard in which he talks about a variety of different gadgets
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:24.280]   and and whether you'll be able to upgrade them. For instance the Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet after
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:29.480]   an Amazon won't say how many recharges it can take but whenever it's done. Year two years three
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:35.800]   years. That's it. There's no battery replacement. It's going in the landfill. AirPods same thing.
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:40.680]   Does anybody are there any third parties that I think I've seen them that will unglue and replace
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:48.520]   Apple's battery service just sells you a new one. You just get a new year. You don't get a new battery.
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:54.440]   You just get a new one and the other. I presume the rest goes in the in the landfill. The iPhone.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:59.480]   Yes. You can you can replace it in Apple's services. I think fairly economical.
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:08.440]   MacBook Air same thing. Bose QC 35 headphones designed to die. Dyson cordless vacuum designed
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:12.680]   to be repaired fit bit charged. You could pretty much know which things are going to
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:19.720]   Yeah. To be decided. You have to you have to give a little. I am so on the side of right to repair
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:27.080]   especially when it's very very clear that so many companies could make things easier to fix
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:32.360]   easier to extend the life of they choose not to and they worse they will give BS reasons as to oh
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:36.360]   no that's that's technologically impossible. You're not you're too stupid to understand why you wouldn't
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:42.360]   want a laptop where you could where the changes could be replaced but nonetheless there are certain
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:49.080]   areas in which it's going to be it's got to be really hard to make in-ear earbuds easy to replace
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:54.040]   batteries or even easy to source batteries. I'll give so I'll give companies sort of a free
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:59.560]   pass on that on limited occasions but yeah when you when you find any any device that has a
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:05.560]   like any device that is a daily daily use computer or daily use entertainment product it should be
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:09.480]   able to live at least five years. I'm shocked when I I mean the Nintendo switch
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:15.880]   this is it's already you know my my switch is a couple years old it's already almost ready for
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:21.400]   the Logan's run carousel. Yeah exactly it's a little it's little jewels about to go off there isn't
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:26.600]   they don't offer replacement of battery on it. It's a fence it's offensive. Same thing with the
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:33.160]   meta-quest to VR headset that you could easily have a replaceable battery in that there's just no
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:39.880]   reason not to. Just or at the very least don't take the handcuffs off of people who enterprising
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:45.560]   workshops that know how that can figure out how to replace it themselves. I mean we the the the
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:52.600]   absolute hell like the the the the center of hell for for hardware designers is definitely the people
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:57.480]   who manufacture and design printers where it becomes we are going to make sure we're going to make
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:03.800]   sure that there is absolutely no way that you can avoid buying printer cartridges that you don't need
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:08.360]   and make sure you're buying them for the most expensive source possible. When you have printers
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:13.720]   that it doesn't matter that you're that you still got plenty of a vink in the cartridge that there
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:18.360]   is some sort of a counter that says oh well a certain time has expired we feel as though you must
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:22.600]   have run out of ink by now and we're going to basically force this machine not to do anything
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:28.440]   until you automatically order through it directly through our own personal website this hardware.
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:35.240]   That's the sort of stuff that makes consumers and industries hate a company and I think that a lot
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:42.440]   of these companies are on this same route where where when you say that hey there's a my my laptop
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:48.600]   is five years old a six years old it's no longer receiving OS updates oh and a lot of the most of
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:52.600]   the new software most of the updates to the software that I have won't run on it anymore
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:56.680]   can you at least unlock the bootloader for me so I can install something else on it. Nope
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:00.280]   nope it would compromise us the integrity of the computer it's much better it's much safer for
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:06.440]   you if you were to simply throw this away and buy a new one then to simply download a boot
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:11.560]   disc and simply make it make it into something that's still useful that's bad. Fowler does
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:15.880]   it quote "Kauweens if I fix it who is doing his best to make these things repairable in fact I
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:21.880]   fix it" the chairman tells me has a Nintendo switch battery replacement of moderate difficulty 21 steps
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:27.880]   it'll take as long as two hours so you better want to replace it but at least they sell the batteries
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:34.440]   for $39.99 and they and they sell the tools that you need or might need to to get it out it is glued in
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:43.720]   yeah and the screws Nintendo uses weird Y00 screws so you're going to need maybe a special tool to
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:50.280]   do that again they sell it. Speaking of things dying how old is apple arcade must be about three
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:58.280]   years old because according to mac rumors that's how long the deals with many apple arcade game
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:07.000]   designers lasted and now these contracts are starting to expire well and and apples letting
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:12.280]   some of them expire some of them apple's not care about apple is resigning yeah it's not that apples
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:17.640]   not like they're all expiring they're all leaving apple is not is choosing not to upgrade you know
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:22.200]   or not to upgrade continue the relationship. Well I bet there's some developers though who say well
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:28.040]   maybe this wasn't a great deal for us and so yeah so I'm looking at the 15 games from arcade
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:34.120]   that are going to leave this the service and none of them are you know anything we've ever heard
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:40.360]   of yeah not yes I mean that's that's the answer right as apple knows exactly how many minutes these
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:44.520]   are all being played and they made their bets and their conception of that service I think we
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:48.440]   talked about this when you were gone Leo but like their conception of that service has changed over
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:53.640]   the last few years it's not what they thought it was you know they've made those changes with like
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:57.640]   rebuilding classics and also bringing things from the app store and pulling them in and where they're
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:03.080]   basically all paid for and so and yeah I think some of these they're like oh nobody wanted to
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:09.560]   play this all right well goodbye right I do feel I feel for the fans of those games if there are
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:13.960]   you won't be able to play like they'll sit on there and you could still play them or they'll put
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:18.920]   them on the app store but then you're gonna have to buy it right uh amel says that if you downloaded
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:24.280]   the game before it was removed from the arcade you can continue to play it for at least two weeks oh
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:29.560]   if you thought you're gonna get the highest score you better start right you better you better get
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:33.640]   going take some time I got a lot of I got to take some personal time I got a lot of quests and I got
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:39.960]   complete I gotta I gotta find my bravery now yeah it does emphasize though that especially with a
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:45.240]   subscription thing like apple arcade you don't own those games those are only good until they're
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:50.280]   not just wouldn't mind everybody but that uh you know they're not canceling cricket through the
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:54.840]   ages have you maybe played that game is that your favorite so much it's the only game I play with
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:23:01.480]   my son if I'm through the age nothing's just the game of totally absurd no it's it's very absurd
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:07.800]   it's dark it's about a cricket no it's two people hitting a ball at each other but sometimes it's a
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:12.120]   ball and sometimes it's a club and sometimes it's knives and sometimes it's whips and sometimes
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:17.480]   it's a sometimes it's a dinosaur and sometimes it's like whoever thought of this game is wow I want
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:22.280]   to meet them anyway so so the um but but that is one of the advantages of arcade right is some of
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:26.360]   these odd indie games I would have never got a shot right I would have I would have seen this game
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.960]   and gone that's the dumbest thing ever but my son and I will spend hours sitting there playing
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:35.160]   against each other and it's just it's total because it it has its own physics um sim and so what
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:39.400]   happens is you can get into these weird things where it'll do something that you don't expect you
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:44.920]   know like it bounce it breaks the system and and so you get really unexpected uh unexpected things
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:51.160]   it just it's it's funny you know it's funny this is a category of gaming called wobbly gaming or
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:55.640]   something where there's another one where you're trying to walk but you can't really unless you
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:24:01.880]   I'm it just right this is like that yeah it's a little you're a little ungainly yeah it's exactly
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:06.200]   it's very it's very it's very frustrating in a lot of ways but but we have a little controller you
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:10.200]   know we have the little game controllers and we play it and and I think that's the only apple arcade
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:14.760]   game I've ever played for more than about 10 minutes so it's so you could play this got single player
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:17.320]   do you have a single player but really fun when you're playing each other john
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:22.680]   this guy's single player or it's got a lot of them my kids my kids my kids definitely sit down and
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:27.320]   they play a lot of different games on apple arcade yeah daddy long legs I remember you're
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:32.440]   right birc is saying daddy long legs we uh Megan and I were doing that on iOS today it was just the
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:38.040]   weirdest weirdest like flappy bird I mean like flappy bird is like the most frustrating game ever
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:41.880]   so is this this is gonna be pretty fun i'm gonna like get this is not no I shouldn't it shouldn't
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:48.360]   be frustrating okay it's but it's do you buy regular games still or do we just do apple arcade
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:52.040]   all the time it feels like apple arcade games are kind of different from the mainstream
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:58.680]   yeah I most of the games that I play on apple devices are apple arcade but that's only because
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:04.760]   of me I just I'm well it's cheap but it's because they because I've essentially already paid for
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:09.960]   them I'll give them a try and it's it's there's it's probably gonna be worth my time and because I
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:14.280]   know that it's not going to just be hey congratulations on the achievement that you that you did in the
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:18.200]   first eight seconds now here's what you can buy in order to get to the next achievement for the next
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:23.480]   20 seconds I'm more of a snacker when it comes to games than someone who gets really involved for
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:27.960]   the for weeks and weeks and weeks and so these little games like let me have fun for about 10
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:35.080]   minutes or an hour or two hours are are scratch my itch so what am I supposed to do Alex I'm so
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:40.040]   you gotta swing you gotta throw the ball you gotta throw the dinosaur keeps eating me I know you have
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:45.320]   to throw it like that there you go like that yeah but I see now you got a bone oh but no you do
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:49.880]   it much better than you are yeah who is this is the snake this is the this is the here here
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:53.560]   you're playing oh oh okay guys rather throw the bone throw throw the bone
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:26:01.000]   backwards okay you got through it at the time throw the snake throw the snake oh he hit me oh I
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.560]   got through it right when it's at the top yeah you got and you got to get used to like where you can
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:13.960]   throw it it's hard yeah yeah I hit myself I got a club now I got a club okay okay here we go oh
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.920]   she's trying to also run at him you can try to run at them and just run into them too and
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:27.800]   and maybe your strategy is if I don't know how to do it on the phone but there's a lot of controls
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:36.840]   on that okay okay this is a winner this this is why like apple arcade it's like this kind of like
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:41.480]   you would never if you were trying to make money in the app store you would never make this game
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:47.080]   but it's so much right the golf there was another golf game at launch that I liked a lot yeah oh yeah
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:53.480]   oh my golf oh my golf is the classic fantastic game but that's been since day one right yeah yeah
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:58.360]   okay good Sudoku is good on apple arcade oh good Sudoku I like Sudoku well they brought they brought
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:02.920]   and and flip-flop solitary they brought a bunch of those great zak gauge games that were in the
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:07.160]   app store commercially that they brought in and basically said you can get it completely unlocked
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:12.840]   for free although I still get games out of the app store two insect zak gauge has a new game called
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:18.360]   not words that's like a crossword word game kind of thing that that's and that's uh you know if you
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:21.960]   don't do apple arcade you can also do it on multiple platforms so that one's on google play
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:26.440]   and the app store on the outside with an in-app purchase and so you know I think everybody makes
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:31.480]   a little calibration if you're a game developer about do you want the whatever that guaranteed
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:35.960]   money is from apple arcade or do you want to take your chances in the wider world and it's a
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:39.880]   little bit of both and especially if you think of a crazy game you're like well let's see if we can
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:45.880]   sell apple on it I am sorry to say that well let me put it this way if you are using a dial-up
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:56.360]   modem do not upgrade to Mac OS Ventura now you tell me beta four came out uh Mac OS Ventura and look
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:07.720]   what's gone the ability to set up uh dial-up um I can't believe this was still in this was still
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:11.400]   in it oh carrier can you still fax can you fax
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:18.760]   fax me at least people still do you know I guess there are people who are on AOL and they dial in
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:24.760]   and and so forth oh I'm just I'm looking in Ventura now and under printers and scanners it if you
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:30.600]   search for fax it even says fax settings add a printer scanner or fax well that's a relief
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:34.680]   you actually there are there are weirdly enough there are still there are still
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:39.880]   a lot of us in Japan that like the big offices that have pretty much like locked down a lot of
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:47.080]   their technology uh for into into 2002 2003 2004 that it's it's one of the facts is one of those
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:53.720]   things where no one uses fax until you find the one damn office that absolutely uses fax a lot of
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:29:00.600]   real truth and uh you know I mean there are weird businesses where they still want faxes of stuff
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:07.960]   luff of AOL AOL subscribers guess how many how many 1.5 million yeah and they all call my radio show
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:13.800]   but also also a lot a lot of them don't realize they're still subscribing they thought that right
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:19.080]   they thought that they they they thought that the fact that you unsubscribed five times was enough
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:24.520]   but apparently the cutoff is 11 before me actually will stop they're still making 180
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:31.880]   million dollars a year on dial up but the question is who is they because who owns AOL now i think
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:38.440]   it's war is it what is it it was time well or what that means AT&T owns it yeah yeah oh that's bizarre
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:45.800]   all right i got a question for you Jason why do you have a keyboard glued underneath your desk
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:52.440]   well i know what this is about i have a uh i because i don't use apple's keyboard but i wanted touch
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:58.760]   id on my mac studio so i bought an apple touch id keyboard and velcroed into the bottom of my desk
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:03.000]   with the touch id button sticking all the way out at the edge of the desk so i could just reach
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:09.720]   underneath that is so hysterical and then i had to do what do you use i well right now i'm using a
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:14.520]   key chronite i'm a mechanical keyboard kind of guy i use clicky clacky keyboards but like then i had
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:20.280]   then i had to get software to lock out all the keys so i i ended up with carabiner elements
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:25.000]   which lets you map every key to like mouse button 32 or something like that so basically if i
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:31.240]   mash another key on the keyboard nothing happens uh just that one button that i use for touch id
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:37.160]   i hope one day that apple will sell either the magic trackpad with a touch id button in it or
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:45.160]   a stand-alone touch id dongle of some kind uh but until then it's the next best thing just
[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:49.240]   you're just at a keyboard doesn't your phone unlock your watch unlocks your mac
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:53.640]   you know it would be an awesome feature of continuity camera also did face id but it
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:58.600]   doesn't do that that's not how it works so i have and and actually i got i have an admission i haven't
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:03.720]   written about this yet but i did last week actually disassemble the keyboard reduce it just down to
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:08.840]   the motherboard and the touch id and now it's in a little 3d printed uh dingus here on my desk
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:15.080]   now this is the other strange thing this key cron you say mike hurley built it for you mike hurley
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:19.320]   did build it for me is that his thing that he builds key boards he does he does a twitch stream
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:23.480]   where he builds keyboards yeah that's what he does he's a he's like deep into mechanical keyboards
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:27.160]   and he wanted to make one for me that he thought i would like and i do like it it's really nice
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:32.200]   so he gets he gets the parts from the key cron company and then assembles key cron sells
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:36.600]   something that's kind of hobbyist uh it's not the high level like he's into the like you make a
[01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:40.680]   pre-order in a year later your keyboard parts come it is a that you can go deep down in the
[01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:44.680]   mechanical keyboard well i just like mechanical keyboards they're clicking in their fun too and
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:48.680]   he's like oh i'm gonna make one that's i'm gonna use this key cron i think you'd like it and i'm
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:53.320]   gonna buy some custom switches that are like special switches and i'm gonna lubricate them and i'm
[01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:57.640]   gonna do all this stuff i'm gonna send it to you how do you get custom keyboards by mike hurley i
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:02.920]   want that you just got to be friend might get mike on twit sometime i guess i will yeah so i'm
[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:06.360]   gonna do for those who are watching in video if we can if we can get a little shot of this i'm
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:12.840]   gonna take my webcam under the desk oh there's the key cron that's nice oh look it's not under
[01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:19.080]   the desk anymore it's just a little it's a little bit and it still works apple no no there's a and
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:24.360]   i linked to it in my story on six colors um there is you can disassemble it uh pop off all the stuff
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:29.560]   and then you're left with the circuit board and the the ribbon cable that goes to the touch ID sensor
[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:34.280]   and the ribbon cable that goes to the lightning port i some other people have done it where they've
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:38.360]   actually kept the bluetooth antenna as well but i didn't do that and so i've got a little stand
[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:42.120]   alone and then the guy who did it i linked to this all in my post but the guy who did it actually
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:48.920]   he 3d printed something you can download that 3d printed file and then at that point you can if
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:53.080]   you've got a 3d printer you can print it yourself i don't but then you can just use craft cloud which
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:57.960]   is if you don't know about it it's like a clearing house for 3d printers third party 3d printers you
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:02.360]   upload your file there and say here's the materials i want and you get a bunch of bids and you
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:07.320]   i for 20 bucks a guy in texas printed the little case and send it to me and you even do this
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:13.560]   pretty fun uh live on youtube part of mike did mike did this live on youtube and he was my
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:18.120]   inspiration and and the guy who did this on twitter who talked about it was in the chat at the time so
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:22.920]   uh we put it together so i don't know if i really advise anybody to do it you can do it i'm surprised
[01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:28.040]   it works i would have thought apple for security reasons would disable it because it's still the
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:31.800]   keyboard the keyboard is there right that that motherboard that's circle that's the whole keyboard
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:37.400]   uh the mac thinks it's got a keyboard what you do is you detach the ribbon cable that runs to the
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:43.480]   keys so there are no key presses detected yeah but the touch id sensor is still detected and it
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:48.440]   totally works but again this is ridiculous and i just want to say apple not all of us want to use
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:54.360]   your keyboard your keyboard's great it's great it's not it's not you it's me uh but it would be nice if
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:59.880]   you put touch id on something else that is uh stand alone either a little box with touch id sensor in
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:05.160]   it or might i suggest a brand new version of the magic trackpad because my hands my fingers are
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:11.400]   already on it that might be a good place to put it and thousands of people tune in to watch my
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:17.640]   god you can't get over it it's chill so i am i am an old and don't understand twitch but what
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:22.120]   mike tells me is the people who come to his twitch channel on friday is for keep friday keyboard club
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:26.440]   he plays kind of like chill music in the background and and everybody's like just kind of chill
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:32.840]   as he very slowly puts together a keyboard yeah that's you know again i just get the keyboard
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:37.880]   out of it so thanks to mike for that time for friday keyboard you got it you nailed it that's what it's
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:45.080]   like i love it super smooth quiet calm yep i love it don't you don't you don't you ask you
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:49.480]   you want to hit the the touch id but you accidentally hit the button that activates the trap door in
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:53.640]   front of your desk doesn't that happen sometimes yeah well you know that that actually is a problem
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:58.280]   but the good news about this procedure is that the key that's under the touch id button doesn't
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:03.480]   come with it's separate so this thing doesn't move it only reads my fingerprints so therefore the trap
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:09.400]   door remains uh uh solid and not with me in it yeah i have to use a different keyboard i use the
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:15.000]   stream deck to drop people through the trap door now that's my advanced system for that now you
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.080]   know i've been thinking about you i used to have an apple script but i really want to turn that
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:25.800]   into a workflow instead you know i i i i i i i think shortcuts are a better uh way to well actually
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:29.960]   home automations is your best way to do your evil way and you could say it you could say it out loud
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:34.360]   open the trap door please yeah or or every wednesday at three thirty open the trap
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:40.200]   oh if you're sure for cleaning and for cleaning feeding the alligators whoever's standing there
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:49.320]   it's their problem um here's a here's a cluji solution from the secret speaking of cluji solutions
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:55.640]   from well i'm i'm impressed by by you and mike and and your determination and i think that's
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:01.560]   actually a great idea so i'm not i'm not good but this this next one is a cluji solution the secret
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:09.880]   service is thinking about disabling apples messages because of the problem of them deleting messages
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:17.960]   in the january sixth run up yeah uh okay so they've decided i guess you know and maybe this
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:22.600]   explains what happened you may may remember you may know about this uh the january sixth
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:27.880]   committee looking for the text messages between secret service agents uh before during and after
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:34.680]   the january sixth insurrection uh we're told by the inspector general oh i should have told you this
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:41.800]   uh i've known about it for nine months they deleted them uh oh but it was just routine maintenance
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:47.560]   and had nothing to do with any complicit we were just changing phones yes yeah right uh but maybe
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:56.520]   that's true because now the secret service is saying um we want to disable apples messages because uh
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:04.200]   uh uh we couldn't so what the so and then actually this kind of makes sense so this the
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:08.920]   secret service has a system has to all government agencies for retaining those those are
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:14.920]   official records they are by law need to be retained by backing them up but apples messages
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:21.960]   are encrypted so it turns out they're backing up encrypted nonsense so their system for backing up
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:27.480]   apparently i mean i mean it may have been something that no one's ever asked for them before they
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:31.320]   didn't know they might have been just doing backups they're just doing backups going well it backs
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:34.280]   up everything and then we're going to get rid of it all and they didn't they didn't they may not
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:38.440]   have they really like sometimes people make this into something into a conspiracy when it really
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:42.920]   is like yeah it's asked before no one's asked for the messages the phone research occurred as the
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:49.400]   secret services implementing a new mdm mobile device management platform uh apples i messages
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:53.640]   cannot be backed up by the system because they're encrypted and stored on users devices unlike
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:38:00.120]   regular text messages so the secret service said we couldn't we couldn't back up uh the the
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:06.360]   messages uh so when individual agents failed to manually back up their data before their phones
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:11.640]   were erased and reconfigured for the new management system the only copies of those messages were
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:18.040]   were gone forever so now they're saying by the way i mean i guess it depends on your political
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:23.480]   event whether you believe this or not but now they're saying probably we should use some other
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:30.600]   messaging surface instead of apples messages because we can't back them up sure although i this
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:36.600]   goes against what i i thought that they were encrypted only in transit and that if you do an i cloud
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:42.200]   backup well but remember the secret yes that's true but the secret service does not want to back
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:47.560]   up the iCloud so that's i mean that's true but they're not going to back up their phones to iCloud
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:51.320]   but but the argument that they're encrypted on device i think is not true
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:56.920]   i think they're not encrypted on device they're only encrypted end to end and if that's the case
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:02.520]   that this is not actually accurate but i i don't maybe there is a quirk there it seems to me that
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:08.280]   this might actually be that the mdm system they're using doesn't do it properly in some way but i
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:13.640]   yeah maybe they maybe you don't use i message in that case maybe you don't it doesn't it does
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:19.720]   it does point out a problem that didn't exist really until like 2005 2006 that's right where you
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:25.240]   have i mean it's really really important that every record be retained not just for history but
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:29.720]   also because i don't know let's say that there is a massive insurrection and someone is violent
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:33.320]   it needs to be thrown into jail for the things that they did while they were in office you need to
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:38.200]   basically have you can't give them a safe sanctuary of we can have a communication that's only private
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:45.320]   to me and my supporters and not not to investigators or historians so i mean it's we also i mean we
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:49.400]   we all enjoyed talking about oh well geez you know obama has to give up his iphone and gosh
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:53.880]   you know how disappointing is to go to a secure blackberry but it's super super important and i
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:59.960]   think this is i i i acknowledge that this could this looks very this looks very very very suspicious
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:05.720]   we can't deny that i acknowledge that the possibility that maybe this was just a mistake or an oversight
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:10.840]   or something they didn't really foresee but it does mean that okay with now that we have now that
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:15.640]   this thing has actually happened we have to make sure this never happens again trust is so
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:19.640]   important even if the even if these are completely innocent messages about hey we want to get
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:24.600]   dunked on us after i don't know i'd rather get storybooks we need we can't have people not being
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:30.920]   able to trust the people who are the people at this level of government secrets by the way the
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:37.160]   political which has a story says they talk to a former c_c_ director chris craps who i uh i trust
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:43.080]   uh he says when it comes to handling i messages the secret service follows its parent department
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:48.760]   the dhs's protocols and according to craps the dhs has not dis-disabled messages
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:57.240]   craps doe did say the white house has so uh it may you know i don't it doesn't solve the uh
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:01.560]   conundrum but it may be that the white house has disabled apple messages because they can't
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:05.400]   pack them up i don't know that's a you know what jason uh that's an us i'm gonna put you on a
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:13.000]   assignment figure that out is this bs or is this uh is this real are those messages encrypted on
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.640]   device or not one of our one of our twit members said well you know everything's encrypted on device
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:23.800]   and it's true but it's true at a high level which is there's a key and so if you erase the key your
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:29.480]   devices erased but the problem is when the device is unlocked and and readable my understanding was
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:35.800]   that the messages were were not encrypted inside that package and therefore if you're using mdm and
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:39.560]   it's something that can just read the disc when it's unlocked it should be able to see them and i
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:43.720]   don't quite understand what's going on there there may be a very weird quirk here but it may be more
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:50.680]   of an mdm quirk that it is a an apple messages are encrypted on device quirk but i don't know and
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:54.860]   and we should also remember that the secret service or the government employees, then
[01:41:54.860 --> 01:41:57.120]   they're not political appointees.
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:58.680]   Well, but that's the question.
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:01.360]   So was, are they or aren't they or aren't they?
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:05.560]   Remember that one of the Secret Service agents in fact went to work for the White House and
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:09.080]   then went back to the Secret Service which is kind of weird.
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:11.520]   Well, but for the most part, they are the political...
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:17.340]   For the most part, they may be supposed to be a political, I understand.
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:21.840]   And I will say that I, from...
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:25.040]   I think that it's problematic.
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:28.840]   I mean, there's a lot of things bad about January 6th and I think everybody should get
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:32.920]   prosecuted that needs to get prosecuted like so I just want to say that out loud.
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:37.440]   For Secret Service, there's a problematic thing about asking for all the communications
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:39.480]   between Secret Service given what they're privy to.
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:40.980]   Well, they're required to though.
[01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:41.980]   That's not even a question.
[01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:42.980]   That's not even a question.
[01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:43.980]   It's a federal law.
[01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:44.980]   They have to...
[01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:45.980]   The records, federal record keeping action.
[01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:46.980]   Why are they do that?
[01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:47.980]   Yeah.
[01:42:47.980 --> 01:42:49.980]   If they want to do it personally, they should do it on their personal phone.
[01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:55.540]   I mean, that's the whole point of having a government phone is that those records will
[01:42:55.540 --> 01:42:56.540]   be kept.
[01:42:56.540 --> 01:42:57.540]   No, I understand.
[01:42:57.540 --> 01:43:04.420]   I just think it's that being like just subpoenaing it will degrade their ability to talk to
[01:43:04.420 --> 01:43:07.900]   each other, it'll push their communications out of the system or it'll reduce trust with
[01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:08.900]   the...
[01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:09.900]   Well, interestingly, it goes to protect it.
[01:43:09.900 --> 01:43:12.900]   That's exactly the point of this story is will Booboo better not use Apple messages.
[01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:15.100]   We bet you something we can control.
[01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:20.700]   Well, the interesting thing is that when we talk about secure platforms, the fact that
[01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:22.460]   Secret Service is using iMessage...
[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:23.460]   It's a little worrisome.
[01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:24.460]   Also, yes.
[01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:25.460]   No, no, no.
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:26.460]   That's good.
[01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:27.460]   It tells you something they know a lot.
[01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:29.260]   They know a lot about what's secure and what's not secure.
[01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:34.420]   And the fact that they're using iMessage just to talk to each other is an interesting detail.
[01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:38.220]   They don't know enough not to erase their messages when they back up there, when they
[01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:39.220]   get to read their phones.
[01:43:39.220 --> 01:43:40.220]   No, or they do.
[01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:41.220]   Or they know, or they do.
[01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:42.220]   Well, yeah.
[01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:43.220]   And that's the question.
[01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:47.420]   But we can only speculate about what's going on here.
[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:53.140]   But the thing is, whenever these kind of arguments come about, it might interfere with their
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:59.500]   mission or their job, I think that my immediate reaction is always, "Well, the thing is these
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:00.740]   people are supposed to be professionals."
[01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:01.740]   That is the mission.
[01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:02.740]   That's part of the mission.
[01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:04.140]   And basically, if you tell them that...
[01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:07.340]   And if you tell them, "By the way, here is your special phone that you are supposed to
[01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:08.660]   use anytime.
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:10.700]   It's a business-related or mission-related thing.
[01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:13.260]   You're supposed to use this phone and this phone only."
[01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:15.180]   And if you have a problem with that, here's the door.
[01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:19.260]   I expect that people at that level will be professional if you say, "Okay, I don't have
[01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:23.740]   to agree with this, but I'm going to do this because this part of my orders."
[01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:30.940]   And the second thing about it is simply that I would hope and expect that the people who
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:36.700]   make it into these high positions, as well as people who are just hired as cops, people
[01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:42.020]   who are in the military, in the National Guard, also have a certain level of sophistication
[01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:44.820]   or a certain level of trust in them.
[01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:48.820]   But nonetheless, we are finding out that if you start looking for white supremacists
[01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:50.500]   in the police force, you find them.
[01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:55.580]   If you start looking for white supremacists in pretty much any government body that's
[01:44:55.580 --> 01:45:02.180]   supposed to protect people from violent white supremacists, you will find white supremacists
[01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:03.420]   in that group.
[01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:10.500]   So we can't assume that anything that looks suspicious with this deletion of texts are
[01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:14.580]   because we can't assume that these secret servers are doing something suspicious.
[01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:18.380]   But nonetheless, we also can't assume that there weren't one or two people who are like,
[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:19.860]   "Hey, I'm on the side of the insurgents.
[01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:22.980]   Finally, we're going to do something about this and we're going to keep our guy in the
[01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:23.980]   White House."
[01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:24.980]   We can't assume that either.
[01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:25.980]   That's why we want to prepare.
[01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:26.980]   And I will say this.
[01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:32.060]   I know Alex, you have in your job worked with the Secret Service more than once in a
[01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:33.060]   lot.
[01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:37.100]   I think you have some direct experience that we lack.
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:46.460]   And I will say, some of the finest, most professional individuals I've ever worked with,
[01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:49.940]   even when I did made mistakes in the White House.
[01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:53.780]   So, Lizzy, you're not allowed to use that staircase.
[01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:54.780]   I think we told you that.
[01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:55.780]   It's more of a...
[01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:58.940]   If you have a laser measure in the East Room and you miss the door, the camera goes out
[01:45:58.940 --> 01:46:01.700]   across the White House, people get too excited.
[01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:04.620]   People get so super excited.
[01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:06.340]   I was just measuring because we had to do it again.
[01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:10.940]   I can say that my interactions with the Secret Service, the time that I set up my camera
[01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:15.260]   on a tripod to take pictures of cows in front of the White House at 7 a.m. one morning,
[01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:17.780]   they were so nice to me.
[01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:18.780]   They were so pretty.
[01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:20.580]   They had to go on that, too.
[01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:24.260]   What happens when that happens when that little laser goes out, someone comes running...
[01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:29.820]   You can tell that they ran and stopped and walked and they go, "Hey, how's it going?"
[01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:30.820]   Exactly.
[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:31.820]   Exactly.
[01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:34.460]   We saw a laser measure in the room.
[01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:37.780]   We have a thing and they go, "Yeah, let's not use that."
[01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:42.060]   Do not want to red dot anything.
[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:45.260]   You get the feeling that they are.
[01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:49.740]   They had a solution already to go and they're having the front conversation.
[01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:50.740]   No, no, no.
[01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:52.740]   When he ran in, his hand was my...
[01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:53.740]   Oh, geez.
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:54.740]   Oh, geez, Alex.
[01:46:54.740 --> 01:46:56.740]   I just under-under a jacket.
[01:46:56.740 --> 01:46:57.740]   It wasn't as bad as it was.
[01:46:57.740 --> 01:47:01.100]   It was definitely a lot of excitement.
[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:02.100]   It was like...
[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:03.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:04.100]   But the nice...
[01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:06.380]   Don't make mistakes twice with the Secret Service, I'm guessing.
[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:07.380]   I have.
[01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:08.380]   You learn.
[01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:10.380]   There's different mistakes.
[01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:12.340]   Not the same mistakes.
[01:47:12.340 --> 01:47:17.740]   I think we can be critical of the Secret Service and also respect them.
[01:47:17.740 --> 01:47:21.700]   My guess is a lot of those people that Alex respects at the Secret Service are probably
[01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:23.700]   face-palming about this entire issue.
[01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:25.700]   I think I'm going to prove that.
[01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:26.700]   Yeah.
[01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:30.820]   I would be concerned about Secret Service agent or police officer who was saying, "No, I
[01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:31.820]   refuse to be audited.
[01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:33.740]   I refuse to be observed.
[01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:38.060]   You should trust me implicitly and everything because the best people in those positions
[01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:42.660]   understand that they are the spear point of fascism should the country go that way and
[01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:44.780]   they do not want to be the spear point of fascism."
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:46.940]   That's exactly right.
[01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:48.740]   First look at Belkins.
[01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:50.700]   This is a big change of subject.
[01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:52.220]   First look at Belkins.
[01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:55.300]   iPhone continuity camera mount.
[01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:56.820]   Oh, geez.
[01:47:56.820 --> 01:47:57.820]   I have one of those somewhere.
[01:47:57.820 --> 01:47:58.820]   I wonder where it is.
[01:47:58.820 --> 01:47:59.820]   Do you have one?
[01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:00.820]   I do.
[01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:01.820]   I do.
[01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:02.820]   I don't know where.
[01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:04.820]   Oh, well, you could have been one of the stories in the show today.
[01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:06.940]   There was a lot going on that week, but yes.
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:10.300]   So they gave it to you and have you used it?
[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:11.940]   Brian Tong had a piece.
[01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:12.940]   That's all I was.
[01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:14.180]   Yeah, you stick it on.
[01:48:14.180 --> 01:48:16.020]   I mean, you stick it on the top of a laptop.
[01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:17.660]   It doesn't fit on a monitor really.
[01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:19.860]   It's for laptops, at least the one that I got.
[01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:20.860]   So it's kind of a very narrow thing.
[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:21.860]   Yeah, that's what this one looks like too.
[01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:22.860]   Yeah.
[01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:23.860]   And the big, you know, the big, that's it.
[01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:24.860]   I got that.
[01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:28.940]   The big challenge is the weight of the iPhone because honestly, the iPhone is heavy enough
[01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:34.620]   that if you get that MacBook screen a little far back, it will just keep opening up.
[01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:36.220]   So it's a delicate balance.
[01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:39.060]   And I kept thinking, what is the what is the metal thing for?
[01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:43.540]   And they say it's for like a tripod so that you can put it on a desk or something instead
[01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:47.100]   if you want to have it just sort of at the right angle on a desktop.
[01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:51.420]   But I started to think, I wonder if that metal thing is also a counterweight so that
[01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:56.780]   you can like bring it out and just get a little more weight forward on the thing so
[01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:59.260]   that it doesn't pull the whole display backward.
[01:48:59.260 --> 01:49:02.100]   Because that's I didn't understand when we were talking about continuity.
[01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:06.540]   The first off, what the challenge would be that these these laptop screens are so light
[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:12.060]   and then you put a big old iPhone Pro Max on the back and it pulls it really wants to
[01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:13.060]   pull that thing open.
[01:49:13.060 --> 01:49:17.340]   And in order to use the desk view continuity camera, you do have to have the phone particularly
[01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:18.700]   placed in such a way.
[01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:20.060]   I presume that's what this is for.
[01:49:20.060 --> 01:49:21.060]   Yeah.
[01:49:21.060 --> 01:49:25.180]   And in fact, the way the angle works on continuity camera, you actually do want the screen to
[01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:29.620]   be a little bit taller than you would if you were using it normally.
[01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:31.580]   So and that helps with the balance, right?
[01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:33.300]   It helps with the weight distribution.
[01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:36.940]   And then it gives it a little more field of view to see the desk view in front of you.
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:41.180]   Otherwise, even then that desk view is so you have to push the laptop so far back in
[01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:43.180]   order for the desk view to make any sense.
[01:49:43.180 --> 01:49:44.540]   And it's an unnatural position.
[01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:47.540]   So I'm going to stick with a camo and a tripod.
[01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:48.540]   How about that?
[01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:50.540]   That might be you can do that too.
[01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:56.780]   Actually, what I often end up doing if I'm in a hurry is I just prop my phone open in
[01:49:56.780 --> 01:50:00.540]   the case and I put it on top of a bunch of thick Python books and that works pretty well
[01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:01.540]   too.
[01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:02.540]   So yeah.
[01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:04.380]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:11.340]   And when we come back, it will be time for the picks of Zavik with our fabulous Mac break
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:12.900]   weekly team.
[01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:14.660]   Our show today brought to you by cash fly.
[01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:18.860]   And when I say brought to you by, I mean, literally, if you're downloading our podcasts,
[01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:21.180]   you're downloading them from cash fly.
[01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:22.540]   How do we know cash fly is amazing?
[01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:27.420]   We've been using them for 10 years more than they saved our bacon back when the Twitter
[01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:28.620]   first started.
[01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:33.100]   Matt Levine of cash like came to me and said, I can help you get these shows out to your
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:35.340]   audience without delay.
[01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:39.380]   And it really works with 50 plus locations around the globe when you're listening or
[01:50:39.380 --> 01:50:40.740]   watching a show.
[01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:46.420]   You're getting it from a server that's close to you, which means it can outperform any
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:47.420]   other system.
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:53.740]   I mean, certainly much better than the, you know, HTTP we were using 30% faster than other
[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:55.580]   major CDNs.
[01:50:55.580 --> 01:50:58.620]   And the other thing I love about cash fly because they have all these points of presence, they
[01:50:58.620 --> 01:51:04.460]   have very high availability effect over the last 12 months, 100% availability, because
[01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:06.140]   if one server goes down, no problem.
[01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:08.660]   There's another one and another one and another one.
[01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:12.660]   Now cash flies branching out into some very interesting new things like ultra low latency
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:13.660]   video streaming.
[01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:17.060]   This is so much better than that unreliable web RT solution.
[01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:19.900]   You might have been using WebSocket live video workflow.
[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:25.620]   It scales to millions of users with sub one second latency.
[01:51:25.620 --> 01:51:26.980]   Wow.
[01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:31.300]   You can also use and we've been using this kind of prerelease for a long time.
[01:51:31.300 --> 01:51:33.140]   Cash fly storage optimization system.
[01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:38.580]   You actually use their storage, which eliminates, you know, these, these cash misses.
[01:51:38.580 --> 01:51:41.700]   So you get a cash hit ratio of 100%.
[01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:45.980]   It also takes a load off your origin servers and reduces your S3 bills if you use S3 for
[01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:48.140]   that as we do.
[01:51:48.140 --> 01:51:51.980]   It really is a great way to make sure your content is always available.
[01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:57.820]   And with cash flies, elite managed packages, I can tell you personally, VIP treatment 24/7
[01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:00.820]   for support and response times in less than an hour.
[01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:04.420]   Most of the time they're already fixing it before you before you even call them.
[01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:06.460]   They go, we know, we know what's wrong.
[01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:12.140]   10 times faster than traditional methods, six continents, lightning fast gaming, it'll
[01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:17.180]   deliver your downloads faster with zero lag glitches or outages, mobile content optimization
[01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:19.740]   that offers automatic and simple image optimization.
[01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:24.740]   So your site loads faster on any device and of course, multi CDN for redundancy and fail
[01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:29.620]   over your traffic is intelligently balanced across multiple of riders, giving you the
[01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:32.820]   shortest routes mitigating as performance glitches.
[01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:38.180]   And that's why whenever you download one of our shows, audio or video, and you're getting
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:41.460]   it from cash fly, never a problem, never a hitch.
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:43.780]   It comes in fast and easy.
[01:52:43.780 --> 01:52:48.980]   And with cash flies 24/7, 365 priority support, they're always there for you when you need
[01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:49.980]   them.

[01:52:50.980 --> 01:52:52.300]   We're so grateful.

[01:52:55.140 --> 01:53:02.860]   If you're not using cash fly, you ought to be cash fly CAC H E F L Y dot com.
[01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:03.860]   Thank you.
[01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:07.060]   Cash fly for your support.
[01:53:07.060 --> 01:53:11.900]   Back of the week time, let's start with Jason Snow.
[01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:20.140]   In a last week, Alex had a great desktop picture app that he picked and it inspired me.
[01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:23.060]   So I want to promote downlink, which is free.
[01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:26.820]   Downlink uses NASA's Earth facing satellites.
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:31.220]   I want this to do and you can do custom views.
[01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:33.700]   Has great coverage in North America and the Pacific.
[01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:34.700]   Not as great in Europe.
[01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:35.700]   Sorry about that.
[01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:39.820]   It's not as advanced that's available to the public, but you can do a custom crop or you
[01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:42.420]   can choose one of the predefined crops.
[01:53:42.420 --> 01:53:48.660]   And it is using the these beautiful satellites that take pictures of the earth all the time.
[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:51.900]   And they update, I think it updates as the images update.
[01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:53.580]   So it's like every hour, maybe.
[01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:55.820]   He says as fast as every 20 minutes.
[01:53:55.820 --> 01:53:56.820]   Right.
[01:53:56.820 --> 01:53:57.820]   Depends on the crop and all that.
[01:53:57.820 --> 01:54:01.460]   You can go up to every 20 minutes and you can get a live look at the earth, perhaps over
[01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:05.180]   your location, perhaps somewhere else, if you really want to.
[01:54:05.180 --> 01:54:10.140]   It's a really good app by Anthony Calangelo and who does a space podcast as well called
[01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:11.980]   main engine cut off.
[01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:12.980]   And it's just beautiful.
[01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:16.620]   And that is what I use on my desktop is I have a picture of the Pacific and the California
[01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:18.580]   coast all the way out to Hawaii.
[01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:22.740]   And on a, you know, on a hot day, I can see that California has no clouds and they've
[01:54:22.740 --> 01:54:24.420]   all been pushed off shore.
[01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:27.820]   And on and right now I'm watching, there's a hurricane out in the Pacific and it's very
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:28.820]   visible.
[01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:29.820]   I'll get this immediately.
[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:30.820]   Downlink.
[01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:31.820]   Downlink.
[01:54:31.820 --> 01:54:36.860]   It's in your menu bar, launches its startup and you set the view and then it will auto
[01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:42.300]   update just, you know, basically hour by hour or a little bit less throughout your whole
[01:54:42.300 --> 01:54:47.860]   day so you can see the evening pass across the face of the earth and then you can turn
[01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:51.220]   off your computer because it's nighttime.
[01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:52.220]   Downlink app.com.
[01:54:52.220 --> 01:54:53.920]   It's free.
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:54.920]   It's free.
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:56.620]   Free lowest price possible.
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:57.620]   Nice.
[01:54:57.620 --> 01:55:00.460]   Alex Lindsey, pick of the week.
[01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:06.380]   So my pick is the new light and magic that just came out last week with on Disney Plus.
[01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:07.380]   Wow.
[01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:08.380]   So this is documentary.
[01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:09.380]   Yeah.
[01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:14.300]   It's documentary six, it's six episodes, six amazing episodes and hopefully the first
[01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:16.500]   six of like a hundred.
[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:19.980]   It is, it's not just that it's a great story.
[01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:24.740]   You can't believe the footage they had like these interviews with George and some of the
[01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:26.580]   behind the scenes of them shooting this stuff.
[01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:31.140]   I mean, fortunately they captured it, but this is really the inception of ILM, industrial
[01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:32.420]   light and magic.
[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:37.740]   And then as they built forward, you know, it shows you progressing all the way through,
[01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:42.420]   you know, episode one, I think is where, or episode two or three, where they talked about
[01:55:42.420 --> 01:55:43.620]   some of the digital cameras.
[01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:49.380]   And so it's, it's a, you know, they cross, you know, 30, 30 years or 35 years of, of,
[01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:54.620]   of ILM and really talk about the big things that changed and who was part of it.
[01:55:54.620 --> 01:55:58.260]   And what, it's just it's fast from, as a story, it's fascinating.
[01:55:58.260 --> 01:56:01.940]   You, you, you realize it was just a bunch of people that just were really into these
[01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:05.580]   visual effects thing that no one had really heard of and they were all hanging in, and
[01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:08.900]   George just happened to hire the right one, John Dykstra.
[01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:12.100]   And he just told all his friends, let's, like, let's go play.
[01:56:12.100 --> 01:56:13.860]   We got, let's, let's go do this.
[01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:14.940]   Collected all these people together.
[01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:18.620]   And they told some of their friends and before you know it, you have this crazy group
[01:56:18.620 --> 01:56:22.180]   of people that are putting this thing together and all the trouble that they had.
[01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:23.180]   They were six months out.
[01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:24.380]   They had two shots done.
[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:28.300]   You know, and, and, and they had 400 shots to go.
[01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:32.340]   And so after, you know, a long time of doing this, building their own cameras from scratch.
[01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:38.740]   And in addition to the fact that it's just an incredible story, it's incredibly well told.
[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:45.100]   This is a documentary production value as someone who does things like that.
[01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:47.820]   The documentary production value is astounding.
[01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:49.260]   This Lawrence casted it.
[01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:50.260]   Who did it.
[01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:51.260]   Yeah.
[01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:54.340]   So he wrote, he wrote Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi.
[01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:55.340]   Force Awakens solo.
[01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:57.540]   He's very much involved with this.
[01:56:57.540 --> 01:56:59.100]   So he's a really, so he's a documentary.
[01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:00.100]   Wow.
[01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:04.900]   And it's the, it is a masterclass in the, like the interviews that they do.
[01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:09.620]   If you look at the background, the lighting and everything else, if you look at the animations
[01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:11.580]   they do to explain how the camera works.
[01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:14.900]   At first it looks like a drawing, but then you see that the little cables are vibrating
[01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:15.900]   in 3D.
[01:57:15.900 --> 01:57:18.980]   You know, you're like, oh, they rendered that, you know, so, so there's so many things.
[01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:21.900]   And they do these, these, these things where they show you like how the matte paintings
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:27.940]   and they, and it's just, it takes visual, visual effects to an entirely different level
[01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:31.940]   as far as just really understanding how hard it is, understanding how hard what they did
[01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:35.300]   was, but also just really understanding how it works.
[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:37.300]   And in it, but, but it's not a geeky thing.
[01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:41.980]   It's really about the story about the people who put these together and, you know, and
[01:57:41.980 --> 01:57:43.980]   I got to see a lot of my friends.
[01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:44.980]   Yeah.
[01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:47.980]   And the camera and your camera that you bought, the model camera that you bought.
[01:57:47.980 --> 01:57:48.980]   Yeah.
[01:57:48.980 --> 01:57:52.860]   And the camera that I, that I own is, is, is on one of the shots.
[01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:54.900]   So, so the, yeah.
[01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:58.740]   I think it's worth saying too, what we're talking about ILM is just that, because I also know
[01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:00.180]   some people who work there.
[01:58:00.180 --> 01:58:05.580]   And I think that there's this trend especially in like modern film circles to talk about
[01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:09.500]   special effects people as if they're robots or their computer programs and they don't
[01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:10.500]   really love film.
[01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:14.820]   And I'll tell you, I have never met people who loved film and have loved, have loved classic
[01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:20.780]   movies and love the visual style of filmmaking and try to, you know, then the people at ILM,
[01:58:20.780 --> 01:58:25.140]   like the people who work in the FX industry in general, they love film and filmmaking.
[01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:27.020]   They are filmmakers.
[01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:31.220]   And if you ever see somebody say, oh, that's just the technicians at the special effects
[01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:33.380]   house, they don't understand.
[01:58:33.380 --> 01:58:34.380]   It's not true.
[01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:39.300]   Whatever that person is saying, they don't know because nobody loves movies and the, and
[01:58:39.300 --> 01:58:44.100]   the, the language of movies more than the people who are working in the visual effects
[01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:46.860]   houses, that is why they're in that business.
[01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:47.860]   That's awesome.
[01:58:47.860 --> 01:58:48.860]   Yeah.
[01:58:48.860 --> 01:58:50.900]   It's just, it's a must, it must watch it.
[01:58:50.900 --> 01:58:52.580]   If you, if you just, it's, it's fascinating.
[01:58:52.580 --> 01:58:55.380]   The first, the, the, it's just so good.
[01:58:55.380 --> 01:58:59.180]   The all the way, I haven't, I have to admit, I watched the first one and the second one
[01:58:59.180 --> 01:59:01.460]   and then immediately jumped to the last one's like, how far are they going to go?
[01:59:01.460 --> 01:59:02.460]   So then I watched that one.
[01:59:02.460 --> 01:59:04.220]   So now I got to go back and watch.
[01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:05.220]   You watched it.
[01:59:05.220 --> 01:59:07.220]   I want to see if I showed up.
[01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:10.620]   So anyway, so, so, to be totally clear, I'll be like, no, I didn't get me.
[01:59:10.620 --> 01:59:13.660]   Because, because, because, you know, the footage, there's so much footage from episode one,
[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:18.300]   because they shot, they, every time George was doing anything, someone was behind him
[01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:19.300]   shooting.
[01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:23.900]   So I was curious, like what they were going to grab from, from a lot of that, the, the,
[01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:26.220]   the, and, and so I was, you know, wanted to see what that looked like.
[01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:30.060]   Cause I've seen tens of hours of that footage and, you know, because I had to do research
[01:59:30.060 --> 01:59:31.820]   for something anyway.
[01:59:31.820 --> 01:59:37.140]   So the, the, but just so I'm hoping that they're going to do more of these.
[01:59:37.140 --> 01:59:41.660]   And so our job, everybody's job is to go watch lots of this show lots of minutes, you know,
[01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:46.060]   that, that we like this because, and now I, and I think that Disney, this is the best
[01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:48.060]   one so far, but they, you know, they have assembled.
[01:59:48.060 --> 01:59:51.900]   So Disney has assembled and they've been doing, you know, they did some Mandalorian ones
[01:59:51.900 --> 01:59:52.900]   and everything else.
[01:59:52.900 --> 01:59:56.340]   This is a great thing for the subscription because the, you know, basically it's not,
[01:59:56.340 --> 02:00:00.020]   it's not nearly as expensive as doing a $200 million gray man, right?
[02:00:00.020 --> 02:00:02.260]   But people who really like film, it's another thing.
[02:00:02.260 --> 02:00:04.340]   It's another piece of content that they can throw out.
[02:00:04.340 --> 02:00:08.940]   Now this one, I will say the Zilm one, they spent a lot of money on this one.
[02:00:08.940 --> 02:00:13.220]   This was definitely not like cut together by the intern, you know, so, so, but, but I
[02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:16.740]   think that they're starting to, I think Disney's starting to figure out that all that behind
[02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:21.740]   the scenes footage is valuable subscribers because if it just keeps on rolling out between your
[02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:25.580]   big, um, 10 polls, it's going to keep people on the hook.
[02:00:25.580 --> 02:00:29.700]   And so I think that I hope that every, all these services get deeper into it.
[02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:33.180]   I would love to see like Apple do tiny world, you know, like, how do they shoot all that
[02:00:33.180 --> 02:00:34.180]   stuff?
[02:00:34.180 --> 02:00:40.140]   Like, you know, like more and more of these, of these movies that to me, shoot less stuff.
[02:00:40.140 --> 02:00:43.580]   I mean, I know I'm a film geek, but shoot less stuff and just show us more behind the
[02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:44.580]   scenes.
[02:00:44.580 --> 02:00:45.580]   I'd be good.
[02:00:45.580 --> 02:00:49.060]   I'll stay special, especially behind the scenes stuff about visual effects on the modern Marvel
[02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:54.060]   movies where every single visual effects house is saying the worst news we get is that we're
[02:00:54.060 --> 02:00:57.660]   doing a Marvel movie because they are going to nickel and diamonds until the very end
[02:00:57.660 --> 02:00:59.940]   and keep making changes and they're horrible to work with.
[02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:02.780]   But I'm sure that documentary is coming out on Disney plus anytime.
[02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:05.420]   That's, that's, that's where I come from.
[02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:06.420]   We call that Tuesday.
[02:01:06.420 --> 02:01:07.420]   Yeah.
[02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:11.460]   I just want to throw in something for your basement, Alex.
[02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:17.100]   This is our staff pick of the week from Patrick Delahanty, our, our, our, our, our software
[02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:18.300]   engineer.
[02:01:18.300 --> 02:01:22.260]   The available, but you've got to run and get it right now.
[02:01:22.260 --> 02:01:24.980]   The ecto containment unit from Ghostbusters.
[02:01:24.980 --> 02:01:28.660]   This is a model built by, yeah, I thought you might want this.
[02:01:28.660 --> 02:01:36.620]   It's built out of a wood by a guy's company that makes this office, Cine makers.
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:42.180]   There's only one of them currently $2033.61 on Etsy.
[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:43.660]   But you better hurry.
[02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:47.540]   There's only one in there, nine people with it in their cards, according to Etsy.
[02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:50.660]   So everybody's going, can I, should I go?
[02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:57.260]   My, my wife's saying a lot of those people put them in the cards before the, the multi-state
[02:01:57.260 --> 02:01:58.420]   lottery last weekend.
[02:01:58.420 --> 02:01:59.420]   Yes, that's right.
[02:01:59.420 --> 02:02:01.260]   If I win, I would $1.3 billion.
[02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:02.260]   I make a million.
[02:02:02.260 --> 02:02:07.020]   I will be buying an ecto containment unit because everyone needs one of these in their
[02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:08.020]   basement.
[02:02:08.020 --> 02:02:10.180]   Andy and I go pick of the week.
[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:12.380]   A couple of quick, fun audio ones.
[02:02:12.380 --> 02:02:17.580]   This is a super scope C one, oh, six cassette recorder.
[02:02:17.580 --> 02:02:22.180]   And really designed for like heavy duty use for like journalists, like during interviews
[02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:25.780]   and live, live preffed conferences in the eighties.
[02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:28.140]   Kind of cool, not terribly interesting.
[02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:33.380]   However, it comes, you can get an accessory for it that is the reason why I wound up buying
[02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:34.380]   it.
[02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:40.100]   And it's very, very app or pog, given our conversations about the secret service, you could also get
[02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:41.620]   a pistol grip for it.
[02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:42.620]   Oh my God.
[02:02:42.620 --> 02:02:43.620]   Maybe not.
[02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:44.620]   Maybe not.
[02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:49.460]   Can you imagine like, I'm saying, Mr. President, Mr. President.
[02:02:49.460 --> 02:02:50.460]   Mr. President.
[02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:59.140]   Whoa, I kind of had a smart collection of you have a lot of these weird little, what do
[02:02:59.140 --> 02:03:01.140]   you buy them at the MIT flea market?
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:02.540]   MIT flea market.
[02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:08.420]   And also this, this was like everybody had their silly like COVID like delusion.
[02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:12.460]   And mine was like collecting like old cassette players because I kind of realized that they
[02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:18.860]   I kind of fell in love with how they they tell a really interesting design story of how
[02:03:18.860 --> 02:03:20.580]   some of these were very, very practical.
[02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:22.820]   Some of these are trying to design for a specific purpose.
[02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:27.620]   Like again, I'm a field reporter and I need to like, I need to basically get interviews
[02:03:27.620 --> 02:03:29.980]   and get the get the numbers for what I'm writing.
[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:34.500]   And people who are trying to enjoy music, and sometimes when the technology was not ready
[02:03:34.500 --> 02:03:36.660]   to be like a music enjoyment thing.
[02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:41.700]   And a lot of I just love the fact that so many of these were made in so many different
[02:03:41.700 --> 02:03:44.500]   shape size colors, configurations.
[02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:49.540]   And like I said, I think it tells an interesting design story of when cassettes before the
[02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:55.260]   walkman came out and they figured out that, okay, great, it's a stereo high fidelity mobile
[02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:56.260]   playback thing.
[02:03:56.260 --> 02:03:59.460]   No, okay, but maybe it's a conferencing thing.
[02:03:59.460 --> 02:04:03.620]   No, maybe it's a music thing for the beach and how do we tell it?
[02:04:03.620 --> 02:04:04.620]   Superscopes.
[02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:05.620]   Thanks to scooter X in our chat room.
[02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:07.260]   Superscopes still around.
[02:04:07.260 --> 02:04:13.660]   They are in this fabulously antiquated looking building.
[02:04:13.660 --> 02:04:18.220]   And they make digital solutions that are very much like what you just talked about, but
[02:04:18.220 --> 02:04:20.940]   obviously digital now instead of cassette.
[02:04:20.940 --> 02:04:26.980]   Handcrafted bespoke artisanal analog recording decks.
[02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:32.180]   But the other thing that I wanted to talk about is this, I had by this recently a spin
[02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:33.180]   fit.
[02:04:33.180 --> 02:04:39.420]   These are third party ear tips for pretty much any sort of in ear headphones that you have,
[02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:44.740]   whether you have air pods, whether you have Sony in earbuds, whether you have wired earbuds.
[02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:48.700]   Most of the time when you see people make complaints about these things, it's not about
[02:04:48.700 --> 02:04:49.700]   the audio quality.
[02:04:49.700 --> 02:04:50.700]   It's that gee, it's uncomfortable.
[02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:56.980]   I can't wear it or it keeps, I heard someone talk about, I wish I could wear air pods, but
[02:04:56.980 --> 02:04:58.260]   it just keeps falling out of my ear.
[02:04:58.260 --> 02:04:59.260]   It doesn't stay in.
[02:04:59.260 --> 02:05:02.860]   Well, the thing is like you can just pull off the little plastic or rubber tip that came
[02:05:02.860 --> 02:05:09.020]   with and replace it with something that either A, fits your ear better or B, maybe you need
[02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:13.700]   a larger one and one ear, a small one, the other ear, maybe you want a foam sort of
[02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:16.540]   earbud enclosure instead of a silicone one.
[02:05:16.540 --> 02:05:23.100]   Maybe you want the kind that is almost like an ear plug, like a noise that absolutely
[02:05:23.100 --> 02:05:26.940]   removes all the noise from the outside by making a seal against your ear.
[02:05:26.940 --> 02:05:31.300]   And with all with these like these third party ear tip replacements that cost anywhere from
[02:05:31.300 --> 02:05:37.540]   six bucks to 13 or $14, you can really turn your earbuds from something that you can barely
[02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:42.100]   tolerate for a half hour of a workout to something you can wear all day long.
[02:05:42.100 --> 02:05:47.580]   And so every every three or four or five months, one of my ear tips like winds up tearing so
[02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:48.940]   I have to buy another one of these.
[02:05:48.940 --> 02:05:50.980]   It's good to know you can get third party ones of these.
[02:05:50.980 --> 02:05:51.980]   Are they an Amazon?
[02:05:51.980 --> 02:05:55.220]   Yeah, these spin fit is just one maker, they're an Amazon.
[02:05:55.220 --> 02:05:57.140]   They're all kinds of makers about these.
[02:05:57.140 --> 02:06:00.900]   Some of them, some of them are really nice in that these are, these are specifically a
[02:06:00.900 --> 02:06:06.060]   size medium I take for these earbuds that they, they work really, really well for me,
[02:06:06.060 --> 02:06:10.180]   but some of them will sell you a kit that's like a little secret box that has like for
[02:06:10.180 --> 02:06:15.580]   $11, it will have all kinds of ranges so that you can really mix and match for one ear to
[02:06:15.580 --> 02:06:16.580]   another.
[02:06:16.580 --> 02:06:20.180]   So whichever ear is giving you the most trouble that ones that you give the most attention
[02:06:20.180 --> 02:06:21.180]   to.
[02:06:21.180 --> 02:06:25.540]   And like I said, it really not only just for comfort, but sometimes it's like, gee, I've
[02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:31.060]   really been looking forward to spending, to replacing my non non noise canceling earbuds
[02:06:31.060 --> 02:06:33.500]   with the new $100 more earbuds.
[02:06:33.500 --> 02:06:36.940]   But then you put in like some better like silicone ear tips and realize that wow, that really
[02:06:36.940 --> 02:06:42.420]   does seal my ear canal against outside noise enough that I kind of would rather spend the
[02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:45.260]   $12 for these than the $100 for a brand new pair.
[02:06:45.260 --> 02:06:51.100]   And they have them for the iPod Pro, AirPod Pro as well as many, many, many, many others.
[02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:52.100]   And they're size.
[02:06:52.100 --> 02:06:56.140]   So you want to order the size that fits your, your best.
[02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:57.140]   Right.
[02:06:57.140 --> 02:07:00.220]   And different, different colors too, so you can get the, a kicky yellow color.
[02:07:00.220 --> 02:07:01.220]   This is good to know.
[02:07:01.220 --> 02:07:03.860]   Sometimes I lose them and I think, oh, I, now what do I do?
[02:07:03.860 --> 02:07:06.420]   I'm out of luck, but no, you can get new ones.
[02:07:06.420 --> 02:07:07.420]   Yeah.
[02:07:07.420 --> 02:07:08.420]   Thank you.
[02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:13.060]   And also size for different size of, yeah, you get the one that's right for your don't
[02:07:13.060 --> 02:07:15.900]   they won't, they don't want them here, but coming off inside your ear.
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:17.780]   That's, that's a bummer.
[02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:20.820]   Well, that's a bummer because it's over.
[02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:23.260]   But thank you for being here for Mac break weekly.
[02:07:23.260 --> 02:07:28.620]   We do this show every Tuesday, 11 am Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern, 1800 UTC.
[02:07:28.620 --> 02:07:31.180]   You can watch us live at live.twit.tv or.
[02:07:31.180 --> 02:07:33.940]   Chat with us live at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:07:33.940 --> 02:07:39.300]   Of course, club twit members are always hanging out in the discord all around the clock because
[02:07:39.300 --> 02:07:43.500]   it's not just the shows, but we have great conversations going on there all the time.
[02:07:43.500 --> 02:07:47.900]   Club twit is, you know, something we started a few months ago, I think it's going really
[02:07:47.900 --> 02:07:48.900]   well.
[02:07:48.900 --> 02:07:53.260]   It really helps us kind of subsidizes new show development, gives you ad free versions
[02:07:53.260 --> 02:07:58.020]   of all of our shows, access to the discord and then the twit plus feed.
[02:07:58.020 --> 02:08:00.500]   It's not, you know, our goal is not to leave anybody out.
[02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:04.740]   We still offer free versions of everything, but for those of you who don't want to add,
[02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:10.620]   don't like ads or don't want to be tracked by ad tracking technologies and want to hang
[02:08:10.620 --> 02:08:14.420]   out with other, other friends in the discord.
[02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:15.620]   This is, I think, a pretty good deal.
[02:08:15.620 --> 02:08:17.380]   It's only seven bucks a month.
[02:08:17.380 --> 02:08:21.780]   We also offer four individual shows, a two ninety nine per month cost.
[02:08:21.780 --> 02:08:25.500]   So if you just want this show ad free, you can get it just by itself, but you don't get
[02:08:25.500 --> 02:08:26.500]   the discord.
[02:08:26.500 --> 02:08:27.500]   You don't get the twit plus feed.
[02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:29.700]   It's worth the seven bucks, but it's up to you.
[02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:35.500]   If you want to know more twit.tv/club twit twit.tv/club twit.
[02:08:35.500 --> 02:08:39.300]   Jason Snell does infinite podcasts.
[02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:45.220]   His website six colors.com has a list of them all at six colors.com/podcast.
[02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:48.220]   He also writes for Macworld and many other magazines.
[02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:53.340]   He's a very busy guy, but I'm glad you made time to be part of our Tuesdays.
[02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:57.340]   Coming from you, infinite podcasts is an honor.
[02:08:57.340 --> 02:08:58.780]   No, you do more than I do.
[02:08:58.780 --> 02:09:00.700]   That's, that's, you know, that's for sure.
[02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:01.700]   I don't know.
[02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:03.340]   On an hour per week basis.
[02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:04.340]   I don't know.
[02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:05.980]   Yeah, I've been cutting down in my old age.
[02:09:05.980 --> 02:09:07.940]   So I think you're catching up.
[02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:08.940]   Thank you, Jason.
[02:09:08.940 --> 02:09:09.940]   Really appreciate it.
[02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:10.940]   Thanks, Leo.
[02:09:10.940 --> 02:09:13.020]   Thanks to Andy and I co two WGBH in Boston.
[02:09:13.020 --> 02:09:15.060]   Where are you going to be on next?
[02:09:15.060 --> 02:09:18.620]   A day early this week, I'm on at one ten in the afternoon on Thursday.
[02:09:18.620 --> 02:09:25.820]   Go to WGBH news.org to stream it on audio live or later, or go to WGBH's YouTube channel
[02:09:25.820 --> 02:09:27.860]   to see the live video stream of it.
[02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:29.700]   We're not in the Boston Public Library this week.
[02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:33.260]   Oskis, on Thursdays, that's only on Fridays and Tuesdays, I think.
[02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:37.860]   But you'll still be able to steamy pretty much exactly like you're seeing right now.
[02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:40.700]   Only only I'll be using my NPR voice.
[02:09:40.700 --> 02:09:42.340]   Are your sideburns getting wider?
[02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:43.660]   They look like they're getting wider.
[02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:45.300]   No, no, they're still as fresh.
[02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:47.300]   I decided to go platinum with them.
[02:09:47.300 --> 02:09:52.180]   There's still a little patch of color there.
[02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:56.740]   It's weird when I look at like, you know, Google Photos can like has like 20 years of
[02:09:56.740 --> 02:09:57.740]   photos of me.
[02:09:57.740 --> 02:10:02.700]   It's almost like you can see like it's the progress bar of my old age downloading because
[02:10:02.700 --> 02:10:07.540]   you go from like deep, deep copper red to like a little bit of gray, a little bit more
[02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:08.540]   gray, a little bit more gray.
[02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:09.540]   I love it.
[02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:10.540]   I love it.
[02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:12.620]   We've been together a long time, Andy.
[02:10:12.620 --> 02:10:17.020]   We've both gone a little grayer in those days.
[02:10:17.020 --> 02:10:20.980]   So of course, Alex Lindsey, we're going to have an ask me anything with Alex rescheduled
[02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:24.100]   in our club August 18th at 9am.
[02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:27.540]   So please stop by if you're a club member for that or join the club for that because
[02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:30.020]   you will definitely want to ask him questions.
[02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:31.980]   Our book club, by the way, is August 25th.
[02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:32.980]   It's really a good book.
[02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:38.900]   Clara and the sun, Stacy Higginbotham, Anne Pruitt and I will all discuss as with as will
[02:10:38.900 --> 02:10:39.900]   you.
[02:10:39.900 --> 02:10:42.100]   I hope that's coming up.
[02:10:42.100 --> 02:10:49.020]   Alex is available for employee if any promises not to use his laser sights.
[02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:53.180]   If you don't want him to at 090.media.
[02:10:53.180 --> 02:10:55.140]   Laser measure measure.
[02:10:55.140 --> 02:10:56.980]   They're not sites.
[02:10:56.980 --> 02:10:58.300]   That's not the red dot.
[02:10:58.300 --> 02:10:59.460]   That's nothing.
[02:10:59.460 --> 02:11:05.460]   He's also, of course, the man in charge, the big guy at office hours.
[02:11:05.460 --> 02:11:06.460]   Just barely.
[02:11:06.460 --> 02:11:07.620]   Well, but it's a big group.
[02:11:07.620 --> 02:11:08.620]   They're taking over.
[02:11:08.620 --> 02:11:09.620]   Yeah, it's a big group.
[02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:10.620]   It's taken over.
[02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:11.620]   They're working on it.
[02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:12.620]   Office hours.global.
[02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:13.620]   Yeah, you can't.
[02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:16.300]   I guess you can't really say it's your thing anymore, right?
[02:11:16.300 --> 02:11:20.660]   861 shows today focus on surround sound basics.
[02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:22.300]   Sounds fantastic.
[02:11:22.300 --> 02:11:25.500]   And you got to listen to the first hour of that too because just there we had so many
[02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:27.500]   audio experts and people started asking audio questions.
[02:11:27.500 --> 02:11:28.500]   Oh, I do.
[02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:29.500]   It was going to be there.
[02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:32.060]   And so it was just really, really dense, dense information.
[02:11:32.060 --> 02:11:33.060]   And we're pretty excited.
[02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:38.660]   We're going to talk about my new favorite music video called I Won't by AJR.
[02:11:38.660 --> 02:11:39.660]   I don't know if you've seen it.
[02:11:39.660 --> 02:11:40.660]   I like AJR.
[02:11:40.660 --> 02:11:43.980]   It's so the music video is really well shot.
[02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:46.260]   We're going to kind of break it down and talk about how it got done because they do
[02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:47.260]   some amazing stuff.
[02:11:47.260 --> 02:11:48.260]   Yeah.
[02:11:48.260 --> 02:11:50.060]   And the words were pretty good.
[02:11:50.060 --> 02:11:51.060]   Yeah, I follow.
[02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:52.740]   I only know about them because of their ticktock.
[02:11:52.740 --> 02:11:57.380]   So I see all of their like special effects 30 seconds at a time, but I'm impressed.
[02:11:57.380 --> 02:11:58.380]   Good.
[02:11:58.380 --> 02:11:59.380]   All right.
[02:11:59.380 --> 02:12:03.540]   Office hours.global if you want to participate in that global phenomenon.
[02:12:03.540 --> 02:12:05.420]   And I see you've added a search which is great.
[02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:06.580]   You have so much content.
[02:12:06.580 --> 02:12:08.420]   You have to have a search box.
[02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:09.420]   Tech.
[02:12:09.420 --> 02:12:10.420]   High tech.
[02:12:10.420 --> 02:12:11.420]   That's awesome.
[02:12:11.420 --> 02:12:12.420]   Search the content.
[02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:13.420]   That's awesome.
[02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:14.900]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[02:12:14.900 --> 02:12:15.900]   I appreciate it.
[02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:16.900]   We'll be back next week.
[02:12:16.900 --> 02:12:18.340]   I hope you will too.
[02:12:18.340 --> 02:12:23.300]   Meanwhile, time to go back to work because break time is over.
[02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:24.300]   Bye bye.
[02:12:24.300 --> 02:12:26.260]   Hey, we should talk Linux.
[02:12:26.260 --> 02:12:30.220]   See operating system that runs the internet, but your game consoles, cell phones, and maybe
[02:12:30.220 --> 02:12:31.540]   even the machine on your desk.
[02:12:31.540 --> 02:12:33.420]   But you already knew all that.
[02:12:33.420 --> 02:12:37.420]   What you may not know is that Twit now has a show dedicated to it, the untitled Linux
[02:12:37.420 --> 02:12:38.420]   show.
[02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:42.220]   Whether you're a Linux pro, a burgeoning, cishet man, or just curious what the big deal
[02:12:42.220 --> 02:12:48.460]   is, you should join us on the Club Twit Discord every Saturday afternoon for news, analysis,
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:50.980]   and tips to sharpen your Linux skills.
[02:12:50.980 --> 02:12:55.940]   And then make sure you subscribe to the Club Twit exclusive untitled Linux show.
[02:12:55.940 --> 02:12:58.620]   Wait, you're not a Club Twit member yet?
[02:12:58.620 --> 02:13:01.980]   We'll go to twit.tv/clubtwit and sign up.
[02:13:01.980 --> 02:13:02.620]   Hope to see you there.
[02:13:02.620 --> 02:13:12.620]   [MUSIC]
[02:13:12.620 --> 02:13:18.740]   "The End"
