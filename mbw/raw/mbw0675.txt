[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.040]   Yeah, it's a friend of mine goes to Japan every year and he brought that back for me.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.600]   So it's my little special.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.040]   It matches Mac Break Weekly Purple.

[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.600]   Andy Anako is also here from the Boston Public Library.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.360]   No, I don't mean he works at the Boston Public Library.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.320]   He's literally coming from the Boston Public Library.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.960]   Actually, it's actually it's a local public library.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.600]   It's like a 50 minute walk from my house.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.600]   Nice.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.320]   Support your public library, kids.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.200]   I'll let you podcast from there.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.800]   And from Montreal, Canada, Mr. I'more.com/vector.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   Renee Richie.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800]   Hello, Renee.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.800]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   I wore this for you today.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.360]   I don't know if you can see it, but it's the original Apple logo with Sir Isaac Newton.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.040]   A mine wandering door so they haven't abandoned it completely yet.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.760]   I think that I that was the one that was designed by the third Apple founder.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.760]   Yes.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.240]   And the one ever saw him after interviewed him.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.120]   John Wayne, Jeff, something Wayne.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.280]   I can't remember his name, but one who wasn't Steve's the one who wasn't a Steve.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.720]   And he left because he was too nervous about, you know, the all the risks they were taking.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.800]   And he said, I can't handle this man to be fair.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.120]   To be fair, he'd already been burned really deeply once with like as one of these 1970s,
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.360]   like hippie startup that left him like really, really in debt and deep and problematic.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.560]   So we shouldn't we shouldn't judge.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.160]   He sold his 10% stake in Apple, which by the way, today would be worth what?
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.360]   Yeah, God only knows for 800 bucks.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.360]   Ron Wayne.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.360]   And I interviewed him.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.400]   I'm on triangulation some years ago, and he was completely cool about it.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.840]   He said, yeah, that's fine.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.840]   What are you going to do?
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.840]   Is he come easy?
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.840]   Go easy.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.840]   Come easy.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.840]   Go.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.840]   But he did do that.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.480]   Look, already make money then because if you're not making money anymore, I'm pretty
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.160]   sure it's a lot harder to deal with that.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.560]   I don't think he's wealthy.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.160]   No, I mean, 10% of apples.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.960]   What is Apple's net worth?
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.960]   A trillion right?
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.960]   So he'd be worse.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.280]   We've raised a hundred billion dollars.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.280]   That's real money.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.240]   Yeah, if it didn't get diluted.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.920]   So speaking of real money, everybody can get their Apple card today.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.920]   Yay.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.080]   I did it live.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.880]   Everybody except Canadians.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.000]   Do you want to see what the actual apple call it?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.320]   Yeah, because you got it while ago, right?
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.000]   I'm having trouble saying these words actual.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   I have.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.360]   Yeah, I've got the titanium.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.360]   You got the titanium.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.600]   Oh, you haven't opened it yet.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   Oh, it's so big.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   Oh, wait.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.400]   Oh, I just put it back in its little thing.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.400]   That's pretty.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.280]   I just applied because I couldn't get it until today, but now everybody can get it.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   Look at that.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.240]   And could you cut meat with that?
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.240]   Is it sharp?
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.240]   It's not.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.240]   No, I don't want to know.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.240]   Show your cards.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.240]   Carson, Carson, there you go.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.240]   Yeah, it's definitely not sharp.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.400]   But what's nice is you can hold it up and there is no identifying information on there,
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400]   except your name.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.520]   No, I can actually show you my card and I'm not worried about somebody trying to steal
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.520]   my information.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.520]   It's got a chip.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.520]   It also really whites.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.920]   I think your titanium would be metallic, but it looks really white.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.920]   It's white.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.520]   Is it painted scratch it?
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.520]   See if it's painted.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.520]   If you scratched it.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.920]   I'm scratching it.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.520]   The only thing that can scratch it is another apple card.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.160]   I think it's painted just because you can see it's metal.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.960]   It's on the side.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.200]   So I was wondering if it was somehow.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.880]   I was wondering if it was laminated because remember the titanium power books, they had
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.120]   a problem where eventually enough flex would get into it and you see the little cracks
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.520]   from the sides of the titanium.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.520]   Remember that?
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.520]   Well, they certainly know how to work with titanium.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.240]   So if you've wanted an apple card and have done as I did every day for the last three
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.360]   weeks, woke up in the morning, opened the wallet, pressed plus.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.680]   If you after you press plus and you say continue, if it shows you a camera view, so you can
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.640]   scan an existing card, I'm told force close the app and do it again.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.880]   But starting today, Apple put out a press release.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.760]   Everybody who's eligible, that means you have an iPhone 6, iOS 12.4, the latest version
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.600]   of iOS can apply and you're in the US.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.600]   You can apply.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.160]   Goldman Sachs determines whether you get it or not based on your credit.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.280]   I had to give it my last four digits of my social and take a picture of my driver's license.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.760]   Did you, Laurie?
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.760]   I didn't.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.560]   I had to give my Social Security, but not my ID.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.000]   So I don't know why, but for some reason it wanted a picture of the ID, but it was all
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   done in real time.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And just a few minutes, in fact, I did it on the air.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.680]   If you watch iOS today from this week, I actually did it in real time because I thought it'd
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.720]   be fun to walk through that.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.520]   I was very pleased.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.520]   They must like me.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.520]   $30,000 limit.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:12.280]   I think I can go buy a, I almost afford a Mac Pro.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.280]   So that's almost.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.760]   I think, I think they know your Apple store buying history.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.680]   I think that's exactly like they were looking at how much, how much is a new Mac Pro?
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.440]   That's the credit limit we'll get.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.440]   Nothing less than that.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.840]   I got 12.99%.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.520]   You could get as much as 23.99%, which is not a great interest rate.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.800]   In fact, they tell you what your interest rate and limit will be before you say, okay.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.960]   So you can go through that whole process, find out what they will give you and decide
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.520]   whether you want it, which I think is prudent.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.000]   Don't, don't, you know, be careful with your credit cards, kids.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.140]   You know that unless you plan to pay it off every month, I think it's nice to have this.
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.960]   If you have Apple Pay, what are you getting additionally to just regular Apple Pay?
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.000]   Well, you get the 2% cash back.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And you get credit.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.600]   3% at Uber as of today.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.800]   Yeah, that was interesting.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.400]   Uber and Uber eats.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.520]   So 3% cash back with Apple purchases and Uber purchases.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.640]   And you figure, I didn't think about that much, but you figured that's got to be continuing.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.120]   Like there's all Starbucks.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.880]   There's just so many potential partnerships that can play there.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.560]   You also get, of course, a wallet app that tells you how much you owe right now.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.560]   Nothing do.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.320]   I have nothing to pay.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.880]   So that means your Apple card is still white.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.080]   You haven't bought anything yet.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.160]   It changes colors.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.160]   You buy it?
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.160]   It does.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.680]   And it changes colors when you pay it off.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.000]   So if you pay off the entire balance and you have nothing again, it goes back to white.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Oh, really?
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   She could agree.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Goes to white.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Okay.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.720]   And somebody, I think Micah was saying it turned coffee color when Megan bought something
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.280]   in Starbucks.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.720]   Is the color tied to what you're buying?
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.720]   I don't think so.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.720]   That might have been a coincidence.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.160]   I think food and drink is orange.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.400]   Here's, yeah.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.400]   This is John's.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.000]   So you bought, what did you buy, John?
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Food?
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.840]   So yeah, that's, that's kind of interesting.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.840]   It looks like it's slightly stained when the food, the food you've been eating.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.840]   I can't think.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.840]   It was pure white and now you've tainted it with coffee.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.840]   You've tainted your card.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.280]   It looks a little burnt.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.280]   That's cool.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.280]   That's cool.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.280]   Mine, right now has a little bit of, uh, it's not, there we go.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.280]   Ooh.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.280]   You've got multiple colors.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.280]   A little bit of blueish colors.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.920]   Oh, that's total gamification.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.880]   Yeah, like I want to just go buy something.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.880]   Where's the green?
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.720]   How do I get on my, I want to find out where I can buy something.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.720]   Final records.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.720]   Final records.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.720]   You got to join.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.640]   Yeah, you got to join the Reddit subreddit, Apple Card subreddit.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.240]   I'm sure they'll have all the details just as we join the Pokemon go subreddit or the
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.160]   Harry Potter was a unite subreddit to get all the details on how to play the game.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.160]   Yep.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.160]   So if you've been waiting, wait no more.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:03.680]   You published a September 2019 event preview on imore.com Renee.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.200]   Is there much to preview yet?
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.920]   What are we previewing?
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:13.560]   I mean, so the September events are one of the most stable, I think in the tech community.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.800]   It's like Apple's almost certainly going to have a September event.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.240]   It's almost certainly going to be iPhones there.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.840]   We've had Apple watch for the last five years.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.360]   So that's probably going to continue.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.040]   And given that they said there was more to come with TV plus and with Apple Arcade, that's
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.720]   likely for that event.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.480]   Plus we always get a couple bonus features from iOS and Mac OS, depending on you hardware
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.440]   features that get introduced during the event.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:43.360]   So I feel like if you were going to predict an event, maybe WWDC is just as predictable.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.520]   The March ones and the October ones are always kind of wild, Carty a little bit, but I feel
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.880]   like the September one, we always have a sense of what's coming every year.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.080]   You even described the opening moments, music plays, the Apple logo dances something clever
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.280]   across the big screen.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.640]   Then the lights go down, Tim cooks, takes the stage.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.640]   Good morning.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.640]   Good morning.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.640]   And the September event is on.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.640]   Good morning.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.640]   Good morning.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.240]   We have some exciting things to show you today.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.240]   Three iPhones.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.760]   I mean, it sounds like we're going to get to me.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.400]   To me, it sounds like this is a repeat of the iPhone seven plus playbook where the physical
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.280]   design isn't going to change much from the redesign and the S year, but they're going
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.680]   to throw an extra camera on it, throw some extra finishes on the phone so it won't look
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.560]   entirely similar to the year before and then just focus no pun intended really heavily
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.120]   on that camera technology.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:41.560]   There is a rumor there will be, and I don't know what you think about this guys, an iPhone.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.320]   Should we call it 11?
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.320]   At least for.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.920]   So this is super interesting because right now people look at the iPhone and they think
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.920]   it's super expensive.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.680]   It's $1,000, but you can get this cheaper version called the iPhone 10R.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.240]   And what it sounds like they're doing is flipping the tables on that so that the R model becomes
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.240]   the iPhone.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.160]   So now the iPhone only costs $750 again.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.520]   But if you really want to, if you want fancier cameras or whatever other doodads they add
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:12.560]   to it, then you can go up to the iPhone pro and that has the three camera system, the bigger
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.240]   size, all of that stuff.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.480]   And then it's weird.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.240]   It's completely marketing.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.640]   But I think it's a kind of marketing that actually, like it doesn't resonate, but it
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.000]   sort of makes a difference in the way everybody talks about it.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.640]   I think it's just going to make a lot of people angry.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.400]   I'm concerned with this whole pro naming scheme.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.360]   I don't know if this is such a good idea.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.920]   We all know what happens when Apple puts out something and calls it a pro.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.960]   All the pros get really angry because it's not pro.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.680]   So I'm concerned.
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.760]   I don't know if it's such a good idea.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.400]   Well, if it had a type D.R.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.080]   That would be a pro feature, right?
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.840]   Well, Andy, is there a backlash with the P30 Pro?
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.120]   I've never heard anybody even blink at the name of the AP30 Pro.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.400]   And I have a one plus pro.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.720]   Which so pro can con con notes something.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.280]   It means more.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.760]   Well, it means, well, what constitutes a professional phone?
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:15.120]   I really think the only professional phone out there is the Samsung Galaxy Note because
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.840]   that's the one where it says doesn't matter how big it is, doesn't matter how much it
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.040]   costs, just give us everything that can be used to use this instead of a laptop.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:27.080]   Other than that, it really is all about like Facebook and cat videos really.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.080]   Are you going to get that?
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.080]   Are you going to say?
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.200]   And Harry Potter, Wizard's Unite.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.440]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.440]   I overlooked that.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.480]   So, but yeah, so you get persnickety about laptops and desktops.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.840]   But yeah, when phones it's like, okay, we're going to we're going to say the pro stands
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.840]   for PR only.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:47.280]   Well, but pro on an iPhone would would kind of make sense if it had a type C connector.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.720]   Apple could continue with the lightning connectors so that the people who bought a lot of lightning
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.400]   dongles, everybody wouldn't feel weird.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.960]   But those of us who, you know, that's what the iPad Pro partially connotes, right, is
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.680]   as a type C connector.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.960]   I think I would buy it just for the type C connector.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.080]   Until next year, sadly, you don't think so?
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.520]   No, no, not until next.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.640]   Isn't that the rumor though that the pro might be a type C or was that just a.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.040]   I think I think it's been squashed.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.280]   I'm pretty I've heard a lot of chatter about it for next.
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.280]   How about a pencil?
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.280]   None.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.640]   How about a pencil like the iPad Pro?
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.640]   I would love it.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.400]   Maybe I feel like the EPA.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.080]   I don't think I would love it.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.000]   I would be the first person I would be sitting there at every park bench doodling my fingers
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.320]   off if we got one.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.520]   I've been wanting it for years.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.240]   I just don't we there hasn't been any solid rumors about it.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.280]   There's like Barclays capital ventures, which I think is 37th in line of accurate
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.960]   amped Apple rivers.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.400]   Would you consider buying a Galaxy Note 10 just for the stylus Renee?
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.400]   I've thought about it.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   I've actually used them.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.400]   I really like it.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.680]   It's not my favorite pencil technology anymore.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.520]   Like I just think we've gone beyond digitizers and I used it.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.440]   I used Wacom for 10 years.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.800]   I used to take forever.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.800]   And once you get used to not having a reticule, not having an air gap, not having to deal
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.160]   with the digitizer, you don't want that back.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.120]   I think the notes always been my favorite Samsung device, but I just I really love the
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.560]   pencil technology and I want that on a phone.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.800]   Yeah, it's going to be something you you you want to think that Apple is going to want
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.480]   to say here is what you can do creatively and artistically.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:25.040]   We didn't just throw this in as a note taker that it will be please they'll be pleased
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.240]   if they do hand writing recognition and it's a regular input device.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:33.280]   But I think the demo video they really want to show is people actually creating art with
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:39.400]   it and people are using it as like a new accessory for the camera app to indicate that hey,
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.760]   I want to I want I like of these of this series of four photos of my kids.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.280]   I like the smile of my third kid here.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.200]   I like the smile of my second kid right here.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.840]   So make one that makes the best picture possible stuff like that.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.880]   So I could see Apple really getting wanting to hold off until they really have a great
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.120]   use case or a great video for it.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:06.240]   They would also not make it so that if you put the pencil back in wrong, you get stuck
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.720]   and you have to buy a new phone.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.040]   Yeah, that would be bad.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.080]   I did that before your time, Laurie, but I actually did that was on the show with us.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.880]   Yes, it was on that break weekly.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.880]   I'm an idiot.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.880]   Those are the moments.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.240]   So forgive me because I wasn't here last week and by the way, Andy, thank you for filling
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.240]   in for me.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.240]   Renee Renee Renee.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.240]   Well, Renee did the job.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.400]   Well, you were all here to protect the job.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.400]   Yes.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.040]   Thank you for doing that, Renee.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:34.060]   So you probably already talked all about this, so I hope if I'm not regenerating the same
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.000]   story over again.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.360]   But we are getting close to you.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.520]   Did you talk whether it would be September 10th?
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.520]   I don't know.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.800]   We talked about it, but it's probably would be.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.080]   I saw some are somebody published September 3rd.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.120]   No, there's no way September 3rd.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.120]   That's Labor Day.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.120]   No, we can.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.120]   Absolutely not.
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.400]   So September 10th is a Tuesday.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:01.840]   It's the first Tuesday of the month is the day after Labor Day and traditionally, because
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.480]   there's so much rehearsal involved for these events, they don't make their employees come
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.040]   in on a three-day weekend to prepare for it.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.720]   So traditionally, they wait a week.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.480]   It would be completely consonant with all of their events in the last few years to be
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.560]   the second Tuesday.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.240]   The only one they moved was on September 11th, right?
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.240]   So they made it a Thursday.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.240]   Yes.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.320]   They do a Wednesday or Thursday.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.480]   So I think September 10th, we know that.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:29.360]   And presumably that means for pre-order the Friday following and delivery, the Friday
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360]   following that.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.360]   Yes.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.960]   Although once in a while, the last two years, one of the units has been delayed, but it
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.440]   feels like they've gotten that production ramp up solid now.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.200]   So you won't have to see any October for the number of launches.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.440]   My wife, Lisa's iPhone XS Max brick, 12.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.680]   We were at the podcast movie.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.120]   Oh, no.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.320]   And I said, well, don't worry about it.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.320]   You take mine and you're going to get a new one in three weeks anyway.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.920]   She said, I can't wait.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.560]   She's going and she's going to take it to the Apple Store.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.480]   And actually I was able to do a DFU and get it back up and running, but still that's
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.680]   nerve, a little nervous man.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:07.920]   And she, the other thing that happened, she used my, so the good news was I had my tennis
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:13.240]   Max identical phone and I just took her sim, put it in mine, erased mine.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.680]   She was able to use it as her.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.480]   And she said, oh, so much faster than mine.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.880]   And I've been saying for a year, I think you got a dud because she's always losing
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.120]   connectivity and stuff.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.120]   Is that possible?
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.120]   Sure.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.360]   I mean, there's always a small percentage of them.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.360]   But how do you prove?
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.360]   It's technology sometimes.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.360]   Yeah, that happens to anything, right?
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.920]   But I'm going to, I'm not going to do any advice and just say you take it back as soon as you
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.600]   even have an inkling of it, you take it back as early as possible.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.320]   I mean, still in her warranty.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.040]   But again, she's going to get a new one in three weeks.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.960]   Especially in this is a good time for, and this is a good time to remind people that
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.400]   particularly when Apple has a brand new phone they've just released, they are even extra
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.360]   eager to collect science.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.720]   Anyone, anything that they've been water damaged, anything that's been dropped in the screen
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:03.560]   shavender, they really want to collect those back to engineering to see how it broke and
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.160]   why it broke.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.040]   And so it doesn't, it doesn't mean that if you dropped it accidentally and you violated
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.320]   your warranty, that they're definitely going to swap you for a new one.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.360]   But it's possible that the, the store that you're going, that you're at has received
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.640]   like sort of a hunting list saying that we want four cracks greens.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.800]   We want two water damage ones and they might be able to actually swap it out immediately.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.720]   So it's worth it as with anything with the Apple, with Apple Genius Bar, it's worth checking
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:33.080]   out because the latitude of the Apple Genius Bar to fix things and make you happy is pretty
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.080]   wide.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.480]   Interesting.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.960]   So now's the, this would be a good week.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.520]   Bad week to buy a new phone.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:45.680]   However, I kept telling you that don't, you know, okay, fine, but don't get a new
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.680]   one.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.680]   Whatever they, whatever they say.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.520]   Just sitting on the shelf just in case.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.520]   Yeah, I do.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.520]   I do.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.520]   I choose three weeks.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.200]   Although now that I have an Apple card, I'm not giving up my, now tell me, tell me a
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.320]   little more about this Apple card.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.800]   Can I, I can use my watch?
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:00.800]   Right.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.480]   It's any time I want to use Apple pay.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.800]   I don't need the card to do stuff.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.160]   I can use Apple pay.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.160]   Correct.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.160]   Okay.
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.480]   And yeah, you can buy anywhere Apple pay is accepted and anywhere on the internet where
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.000]   you're making online payments.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   I love that.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   I use Apple card.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.040]   I use Apple pay all the time online because it's just the, it's one click.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.440]   It's a very easy thing to do.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.440]   And secure.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.440]   So I don't really need this phone.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.040]   And when you, if I mean, if I gave up my phone, I could still do it.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.120]   You need the phone to sign up for it though.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.120]   And to pay it.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.120]   Oh, and to pay it.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.880]   And to manage it and to pay it.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.880]   You can use your iPad to pay it.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.880]   Okay.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.880]   I got an iPad.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.880]   Okay.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.880]   If you, if you lose your iPhone, but you definitely, it's, it's built around.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.160]   You need the iPhone in your life.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.840]   You don't have to carry it around with you every day, but you have to own it.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.800]   You have to have it on you somewhere in your house, even if you just shut it off.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.800]   Like an Apple watch the house.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.200]   I got the invite, I got the invite last week.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.760]   And then when finding out exactly, I thought that I could just like sort of trick the trick
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:04.440]   Apple and say, well, I'll put my SIM card in like one of my old Apple, my old iPhones.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.000]   Use that to sign up and then just test it out.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.400]   And then I was having my wallet for whatever after finding out exactly how difficult that
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.400]   would be.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.880]   It's like, okay, so I'm going to get another credit card just so I can test it out for
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.200]   maybe a week or two.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:21.320]   And then it will be so impractical for me to use that it's just there to cause problems
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.320]   for me.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.320]   I bet later on.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.320]   Yes.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.520]   But I will use an iPad though, Andy, don't you know, how can I use it with an iPad?
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.520]   There's no wallet on the iPad.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.760]   Uh, I'm trying to remember settings.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.320]   I think it's in settings.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.320]   It is.
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.560]   It's settings.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.320]   I think Apple pay while it in Apple pay.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.800]   Oh, so the wallet.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.800]   Yes, you're right.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.520]   The wall on the iPad is in settings.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.920]   So you can do that on your.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:52.720]   I don't yet see my, it hasn't updated to say you have an Apple card though.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.720]   Are you running the beta on your iPad?
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.920]   You have to have the latest beta.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.920]   It doesn't show up with beta.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:59.920]   There was another beta.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.920]   I got one the other day.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:01.920]   There's a does for iPhone.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.160]   Maybe not for iPad yet.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:07.000]   The latest beta puts it on the iPhone 13, but I don't know about the iPad.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.600]   Let me just see if there's a software.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.600]   The beta life is hard.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.280]   No, I'm up to 13.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.520]   Oh, I'm on the public beta.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.960]   I'm at 13.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.400]   Oh, so maybe just hasn't communicated yet because shouldn't it just at least show up as a payment
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.320]   card and my default card and all that stuff?
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.520]   Because I changed it to my default.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.200]   I've had beta because I did check and they said it was just as a note.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.840]   I just know it as of the most recent one.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.320]   So that's another thing we'll get.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.360]   Presumably when will we get that?
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.320]   Not September 10th, the week that week.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.480]   So it will get B iOS 13 and iPad OS, right?
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.000]   Yes, it's usually two days before launch.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.400]   So whatever the Wednesday, Tuesday or Wednesday is before the phones come out.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.560]   Oh, before they arrive.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.880]   So the following week, you can pre-order.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.360]   You would be able to pre-order on the 13th.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:57.000]   iPhone 3G showed them that it was really, really a bad idea to release new operating
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.640]   systems on the same day as new phones.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.640]   Yes.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.040]   Put it out a few days early.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.040]   Yes.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.040]   Okay.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.040]   And for those who use it.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.040]   Only one disaster at a time, please.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.720]   We're using the public beta.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:13.880]   Is there anything they need to do or will they now get the final 13 and then just not,
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.960]   they'll stop or do they need to stop getting the betas?
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.840]   Do they need to take that profile off?
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.320]   What do they have to do about that?
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:24.200]   If they don't want to stay on the beta program, they're going to want to remove that profile.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:29.760]   But when the update happens so far in the past, I can't guarantee it this time.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:35.920]   But so far, every time the public beta has been the same as the final, or I'm sorry,
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.480]   the public launch has been the same as the final GM of the public beta.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.920]   It's been the same number and everything.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.920]   Do we?
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.920]   But that's not necessarily for sure.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.480]   Once the day happens, we'll know for sure and we'll let everybody know either you don't
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.800]   have to do anything or if you want to get on the public beta, you have to remove the
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.000]   profile and go that way.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.720]   But it's pretty easy if it's not the same numbers.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.280]   Yeah.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.520]   Is the version we have now, the most recent public beta which just came out, is that you
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.000]   think the final?
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.920]   I'm going to say no.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.760]   I believe we're going to have two more betas before then.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.800]   Give me one day of the week round here.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.800]   Really?
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.800]   Wow.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   They really try to polish it up the final days.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.160]   Yeah, in the last week.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.040]   They usually release these betas every Monday or Tuesday.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.280]   I think Mondays are the public.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.160]   So, now you might have a better reminder of this, but I think it's every Monday are the
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.160]   public betas.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.160]   I think I have the developers.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.160]   I think I have the developers.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.160]   That sounds right.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.800]   I think I developed it up to yesterday.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.240]   Because I'm on the public beta, not the developer beta.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.680]   So, developers are usually the day before and then the public.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.680]   Yes.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.680]   But not always.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.680]   Not always.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.680]   And they're doing way more betas.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.680]   They used to do betas every couple of weeks and then they would stop before, like stop
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.680]   for a while before the public release, right?
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.400]   Sorry, before the general release and now they just every week, they're just pumping
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.400]   out betas.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.400]   Nice.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.400]   Well.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.400]   It's exciting times.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.400]   Exciting times.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.400]   Let's see.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:06.560]   Let's see in Renee Richie's prognostication post.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:11.080]   You know, he's playing the gypsy fortune teller.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:16.320]   He says probably maybe we'll see Deidre O'Brien on the new store.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.320]   Opening is right.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.320]   And the AR demo.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.320]   It depends.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.240]   So, there's two intros that Tim cooks, which is between.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.680]   One is I'm going to explain, I'm going to show you something really cool.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.080]   Well, the worst one is when he tells you a baseball story.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.080]   That's like DJ Koback.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:34.240]   But when he just goes to like, here's the new Apple store, as an Angela comes out, or
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.520]   here's the new environmental policy and Lisa Jackson comes out, or here's what we're doing
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.400]   in enterprise or education.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.000]   And Susan comes out, you know, all of those are good.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.440]   If the effect, if the event is jam packed, he's like, the business is fine and we're just
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.640]   going to go right into things.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.960]   And that's my favorite.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.960]   Nothing to say.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.960]   Nothing to see.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.680]   Move along.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:26:00.520]   And then in the past few years, Jeff Williams has come out to talk about watch.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.720]   Watch has always been first, at least since it started appearing in the September shows.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.800]   And so the current rumor on watch, which I thought was great, and this comes from the
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:14.720]   beta, some images in the beta is that there will once again be an addition and you'll
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.640]   have a choice of titanium or ceramic.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:23.560]   They skipped that addition this year, which was a relief to me.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.200]   Save me a few thousand dollars.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.880]   I think they wanted to let the gold steal like that, a new design and a new finish with
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.120]   gold steel and I didn't want to just blow all their finishes in one year because if they're
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.480]   going to do S years for the next while, like that design is going to be around for a few
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.080]   years, all they can really do to juice excitement is change the finish.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.240]   So if you do all finishes in the first year, you don't have any of those left.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:46.800]   I think it was in retrospect, it was smart to sort of let the gold steal shine, so to
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.600]   speak, and then reintroduce ceramic and do other stuff over the next couple of years.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.600]   So the guts will not be updated.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.600]   I have a heart.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.360]   So some people are saying that there's a theory, you know, in Zach Hall, 9 to 5, Matt did a
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:03.320]   great job writing this up that because the series four was such a big improvement that
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.880]   Apple may not release a new Apple watch this year, that they might just either price drop
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:10.960]   the series forward, just leave the series for folks on the software.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:15.520]   I just, I have a hard time believing that though, because Johnny Saruji's team, they
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.960]   are just so good at pushing systems and package forward.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.000]   And that's like the SOC for the watch, because it has even more components.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.400]   I'll shoved onto the same chipset.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:29.040]   You know, they had the S, the original S1 and the original Apple watch, then they had
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:33.040]   the S2 and S1P and the second one, we've had S3 and S4 now.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:36.320]   I have a hard time thinking they'll go a whole year without an S5.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.800]   Hmm.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:42.080]   But then maybe the idea is that, you know, it's sort of what you might call the incremental
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:46.200]   Apple watch upgrade, which is a new chip and maybe slightly longer battery life.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.920]   And that's the upgrade, which it's an upgrade that counts.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:55.360]   But to some people on the outside, that might not seem like that big of a deal and not really,
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.360]   you know, something to promote in such a big way.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.240]   And so maybe that's the idea behind that is hard to see.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.240]   Wow, it's just a little-
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:05.280]   They did LTE, like they had a whole year where it was all about a cellular and a whole
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.480]   year where it was like the new design and they did the waterproofing the year before
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.480]   that.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.480]   There's always like a big thing.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:14.000]   My big remaining feature is always on display or at least like one mode that gives me the
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.440]   time all the time because it's the only watch I have where I just can't always see the
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.440]   time.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.200]   And if they made a better chipset that's maybe seven nanometer, we're more power efficient,
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.960]   instead of spending that budget on something else, they could finally spend it on a persistent
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.360]   display and then I would be super, super happy.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:35.200]   Yeah, I think the next thing to look forward to is going to be micro LED and an upgrade
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.200]   to the heart sensor.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.560]   They haven't really changed that hardware since the launch.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:44.120]   And now there are a lot of incremental updates that allow heart rate sensing to be a lot
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.360]   more accurate and also to consume a lot less power.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:52.320]   So I think that we're going to see one sort of like under the hood sort of update with
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:57.920]   the health sensors, but then a big big, big, big change with the display.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:02.480]   Because once we upgrade to that kind of a display, it really opens up a lot of things.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:08.560]   Like we will have either enough drop in power load to either give us a much thinner watch,
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.960]   which not a whole lot of people are clamoring for, but it would be nice on the smaller version
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.640]   of it to make it even more subtle on the wrist.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:21.200]   And also it could deliver what Renee wants, which is let's have a monochrome sort of black
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.880]   and white display that will just be like an analog watch or analog time indicator, similar
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:31.120]   to one of the few really, really great features of WearOS of Android watches, which is let's
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.440]   have a low power mode that just tells the time doesn't really activate the CPU, but can
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.920]   actually give you the time as soon as you flip your wrist.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:39.920]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.760]   I'd love to have an all that.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.760]   It's next year.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.880]   I mean, a micro LED is supposed to be next year though.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:44.880]   So I'm okay.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.880]   Exactly.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.720]   But that's, I have to agree with Renee.
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.960]   That's one of the biggest things.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.480]   Like I was moderating panels at Boston Comic Con all weekend.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:00.160]   And every time I needed my timer for the day was always like this, like GPs, it's the
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.840]   Casio G shock watch, because if I have an Apple watch, I actually wear it pretty often.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:10.600]   It has much better displays and much better tools for timing things.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:15.800]   But if I want to be able to like turn my wrist and not only do I see how much time is left,
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.560]   but it is still a stopwatch and it's still a timer.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.560]   It didn't decide to be like a weather station while my while my hand was down.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.120]   This is the only solution you have.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.120]   So the ability to have a persistent display that is absolutely controllable.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:33.880]   That is that that's going to be a really, really big plus for the Apple watch for me.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.800]   All right.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:40.440]   I'm just trying to get an idea of how much I'm going to put on my Apple card.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.440]   This is my...
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.440]   All of it Leo.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.440]   All of it.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.440]   All of it.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.840]   So it was going to be the first person to try to turn their Apple card black.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:54.320]   If you buy everything Apple announces in September 10th, it'll go black.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.320]   That would be.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.800]   Maybe it becomes the eye of Sauron once you're like, look, you're not only are you at your
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.280]   limit, but we know you have no ability to pay this back in the next month.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.240]   The Apple is watching you.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.240]   Apple TV.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:11.360]   And I love this Renee's video of the Apple TV dongle.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.360]   I want one so badly.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.360]   This does not exist.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.360]   That would be cool if it did.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:21.560]   Actually, I have to say I have dongles for fire TV and for Roku.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.360]   And in both cases, they overheat.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.840]   And I think that makes them a little less reliable.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.920]   The Chromecast is pretty solid though.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.560]   But the Chromecast is not doing as much.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.440]   I think I feel like maybe it is.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.200]   Yeah, the Chromecast is fine.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:39.400]   Yeah, all the Chromecast does is stream from URL that's provided by a phone.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.400]   So it's not necessarily, it's not maintaining, it doesn't have to have the power to maintain
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.400]   a user interface.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.960]   It doesn't have to have apps on it.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:50.440]   Really, it's just an app on another device or on your browser sends it a URL to stream
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.960]   from and then it just simply streams from that URL.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.280]   I have been getting questions.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.920]   In fact, I got a question this weekend on the radio show, should I buy a new Apple TV
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:58.920]   now or wait?
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.920]   And of course, anytime Apple's got events coming up, you should wait.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.880]   But do you think there will be a new Apple TV?
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.320]   I have a actual box.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.440]   I have a hard time seeing it because what, like it's so overpowered.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.440]   Yeah, it's got an A10 accident already.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:18.520]   I have a feeling they're going to upgrade it this year, but it's going to be a minor upgrade.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.320]   I don't know exactly what that would be.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:28.360]   But because TV+ is coming, supposedly in November, I think they're going to try to reinvigorate
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:33.280]   an audience that maybe hasn't invested in Apple TV yet or maybe hasn't gotten, they
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.200]   haven't upgraded in a few years or something like that.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.400]   Now is the time.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.440]   I don't have Apple TV 4K.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.440]   I have.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:46.560]   It's even pre-Apple TV HD because it was the version before.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.600]   I think that was Apple TV 3 if I'm not mistaken.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.600]   But that's all you need on your zenas.
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.600]   Yes.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.600]   It's true.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:58.800]   It's fancy to reach to a guy in Emerson like me.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.800]   Sorry.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:04.240]   I've been holding off buying a new Apple TV specifically for that reason.
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.760]   I'm just kind of waiting.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.120]   I now have a 4K television set.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.120]   So yeah, I couldn't.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.120]   You do need it.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.640]   But I'm waiting a little bit longer because what if they're going to end us just one tiny
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.640]   new feature?
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:21.360]   And I think for anybody who's slightly interested in TV+ they either don't own Apple TV or
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.360]   haven't upgraded for a long time.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:28.520]   This is a great opportunity for Apple to just do something small that doesn't change
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:34.920]   too much, just add a little bit more to faster processor or some better connectivity or something
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:35.920]   like that.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.760]   And suddenly those of us who haven't bought one in a few years are ready to go or maybe
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.920]   those who are on the fence before finally say, "Okay, now I'm going to buy it because
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.920]   they put a new one out."
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:44.920]   I didn't.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:49.480]   I'm reading your article and I didn't realize the Apple TV came out in 2017, the 4K.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.160]   So it is two years old.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.160]   Yes.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.480]   Last year they just added, they enabled Atmos on the existing hardware.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.480]   Right.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.480]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:02.840]   No, I'm just saying that we still have the basic Apple TV box still costs like $150, doesn't
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.840]   it?
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:10.400]   Either way, I think that the thing that I could really see Apple doing is one way or another
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:15.680]   finding a way to sell an Apple TV box for 99 bucks or somehow break the $100 barrier
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:16.680]   with the competition.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:17.680]   That's the competition.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:18.680]   That's Roku.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:19.680]   That's Fire TV.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:26.560]   It seems like above $100 you really have to explain what extra stuff you're getting for
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.560]   all that extra money.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.840]   I don't think that Apple can really make that explanation right now.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:37.400]   Plus, if they can generate so much excitement over the new service, that's going to be a
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:41.040]   great opportunity for people to say, "Oh, well, gee, I don't even have an Apple TV box.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.240]   I think I'll buy one of those."
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:47.440]   And anything to remove a barrier or to remove, let's say, 10 seconds of extra thought from
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:52.200]   someone's head to actually click that button to make that purchase is going to be to Apple's
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.640]   benefit.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:58.680]   Apple does have some new products to talk about, and we will talk about those in just
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.840]   a minute, but let's take a little bit of a break.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:06.720]   Mac break weekly, Renee Ritchie, Andy Inako, Lori Gill, pleasure having you.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.160]   I missed you guys, honestly.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.160]   Although, I have to say--
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.160]   We missed you too.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:16.000]   Podcast-- so this is the remaining, the last man standing of the podcast expos in the
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   US.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.840]   There are many expos all over the world, and they're even the regional ones in the US,
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.600]   but this is the last national.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.160]   It's now called podcast movement.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.280]   And there were 6,000 podcasters there.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.320]   It's been going up 15% every year.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.520]   And it really felt this year like it was a different quality.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:40.080]   In the early days of podcast expo, and then it became the new media expo, it really felt
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:45.520]   homegrown and funky, which I liked.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.880]   Now all the big brands spotify their iHarts there.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.720]   I had a big party.
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.040]   It really feels like a big business all of a sudden.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.960]   It does attract, as it always has, a lot of people who are new to podcasting and want
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.320]   to get into podcasting and want to learn more about podcasting.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:06.760]   It's always fun to see these fresh young faces who have no idea what they're getting
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.720]   into.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:14.680]   And I had to-- I was wandering around thinking they have no idea.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.440]   But it was fun to go.
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:21.640]   And of course, you see a lot of faces from-- not as many from the old days as I'd like.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.240]   You don't see Adam Curry.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.560]   You don't see Don and Drew.
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.320]   You don't see Zae Frank.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:29.320]   There's a lot of people who will be fun to see.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:33.880]   But I saw a number of them, and that was really great.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:39.200]   And I'm pleased to be in an industry that is about to really break out, I think, as a
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.120]   new form.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:44.960]   Every big media company was there.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.200]   You could see the difference.
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.360]   It's changing a lot.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.880]   So thank you for filling in Renee and thank you all for doing the show without me.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.880]   Were they the ones in Suitsleil?
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.480]   Like, you could identify the links on their IBM ties?
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:59.800]   Actually, it was a much better dress crowd than it has been in the past.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:05.560]   Even though we are in Orlando, where it is 98 degrees and 100% humidity, it's so funny
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:09.440]   because you attempted to wear shorts because it's really hot out.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:14.280]   And then you get inside, and as everywhere in Florida, it's air conditioned to 65 degrees.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.240]   And you're freezing.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:23.360]   So the sensible people were wearing suits and overcoats and wool hats and mittens.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:27.240]   It was really chilly.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:32.760]   Our show today, one of the things that we saw absolutely was a lot of new advertisers.
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.520]   I think advertisers are really discovering it.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.640]   And it's really been fun for me to watch that evolve.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:42.960]   And I have to say, we were one of the pioneers in doing advertising and podcasts and doing
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.960]   it the way we do it.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.000]   I'm very proud of the way we do it.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.960]   We pick our advertisers carefully.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.440]   We try to establish long-term relationships.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:53.200]   And we only recommend products that we know and use and love.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:58.480]   And I'm really glad to see Rocket Mortgage is back again from Quicken Loans.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.480]   They've been with us three years now.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.880]   We really are there the best.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:08.000]   When it comes to getting a home loan, Rocket Mortgage by Quicken Loans is the place to
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   go.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.800]   Of course, it's hard to find a house, but you also have to find a mortgage for this, the
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.000]   biggest purchase you'll ever make.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.080]   And what I love about Rocket Mortgage, they're really doing a lot to help you understand the
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.480]   process.
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:20.480]   So it's transparent.
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.840]   It's clear what you're going through.

[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.920]   Let's face it, it's not just any mortgage.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:26.920]   It's your mortgage.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.880]   It's something you're going to be spending the next 30 years with in some cases.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:34.080]   They're team of mortgage experts at Rocket Mortgage are obsessed with finding a better
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:35.080]   way.

[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:48.480]   In fact, JD Power has ranked Quicken Loans highest in customer satisfaction for primary
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.680]   mortgage origination nine years running.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.080]   That's how I know that we've been with them for a long time because it was seven years
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.080]   running.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.080]   We first started doing the ads.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:00.800]   They're highest in mortgage servicing six years in a row.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:05.040]   For JD Power Award information, visit jdpower.com.

[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.080]   Thank you, Rocket Mortgage.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:59.520]   Oh, let's continue on with Renee's walkthrough of the event.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:00.520]   My divination.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:01.520]   His divination.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.520]   He's reading the tea leaves.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.120]   His eyes have been pretty good at it.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.120]   Yeah, no.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:10.960]   If you go to enough of these, there is a kind of a formula.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.080]   They break the mold sometimes, but there's a kind of a rhythm to it.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.800]   If they announce Apple TV or they talk about Apple TV, almost certainly the big topic will
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.720]   be Apple TV plus an Apple Arcade.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:27.520]   There is news in the Apple TV plus and Apple Arcade space.
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:33.200]   We're starting to see at least rumors of pricing and the financial times.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.200]   I don't know where they got this from.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.800]   Mark Herman says in Bloomberg, Apple TV plus will be $9.99.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:40.800]   That makes sense.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.600]   That's about where you put it, write 10 bucks a month.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.600]   Yeah, can I quibble with that?
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.080]   Mark says they're discussing a bunch of different pricing options.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:50.800]   I'm sure $9.99 is on there because that's what news plus costs and that's what Apple
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.800]   music costs.
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.480]   But the rumor is Arcade is going to cost $4.99.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:58.880]   It seems to me it feels to me like if you don't have catalog content, you can't charge
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.880]   10 bucks.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.520]   Just like that's just my reaction.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:05.480]   Didn't we always say where's the, I mean, we always thought there'd be a bundle with
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.840]   Apple music, Apple TV plus Apple Arcade.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.840]   Is there a bundle?
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.840]   Have they, I didn't see any.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:10.840]   I'm hoping that's the one more thing.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.400]   I'm hoping that's that'll be the, there's very type of, they don't have to discuss that,
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.640]   but I'm hoping that it's say one more thing.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.640]   Here's the Apple bundle.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:22.760]   And if they do, then whatever price standalone they announce is meaningless.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.080]   It's the, it's the table setter for wow.
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.960]   And I can get all of those for just $15.99.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:33.280]   And Jennifer, Aniston for $15.99.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:39.280]   They are putting the Apple, they are updating the Apple TV plus teasers and they're, for
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:43.720]   the first time, it seems to me, because I use Apple TV on the, on the Apple TV.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.440]   I use their app showing it.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:49.680]   It's a big bar of upcoming new shows in the new, and the new trailers, right?
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:54.040]   But it's a lot of pressure because they just announced that Disney plus is going to come
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:57.320]   to Canada and a few other markets in November day and date.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.960]   And they have really competitive pricing compared to Netflix.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:05.960]   They're not going to be on Amazon products, which is super interesting, at least at launch.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.160]   But they're going to be on all the Apple stuff, which means they're all the same eyeballs
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.280]   that the Apple at that TV plus will have.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:15.720]   And that's just, you know, they're friendly Disney to be sure.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:19.200]   And Disney plus is going to be in the TV app as part of channels, which is really awesome.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.240]   I didn't think they do that.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.200]   But it's, I think it still puts a lot of competitive pressure on TV plus.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:29.960]   I would play some of these trailers from the new Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carell, Morning
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.080]   Show, for instance.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.960]   But I don't want Apple's lawyers to take down our YouTube video.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:40.280]   And Apple's lawyers might just want to think about that because it is, in fact, me playing
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:43.160]   an ad for your content, but I can't.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.160]   I won't.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.160]   So there you go.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.840]   And all I get in my YouTube recommended is other people uploading trailers from every
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:48.840]   single studio.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:49.840]   I know.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.280]   I mean, that's part of YouTube recommended.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.760]   I feel like I'm being targeted or something.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.960]   Anyway, it's happened a number of times now.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:56.960]   We can reenact them.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:58.960]   You be Jennifer Aniston's.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.120]   And Lori can be Aniston and Carell.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.920]   I'll be re-splitter spoon.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.720]   And I'll just sit and watch.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.720]   You're the narrator.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:10.680]   I haven't seen the newest trailer yet.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:15.000]   The first trailer was completely uninspiring.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.760]   Are you excited about it now?
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.400]   New one has a very, very newsroom vibe.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:23.720]   Like you just have anything resembling Swarkins words, but just the vibe of Bob.
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:28.120]   Behind the scenes, important times, newsy things going on was very the newsroom.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.120]   And newsroom was a flop.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.120]   I loved it, but it was a flop.
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.120]   Yeah, it was a flop.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.800]   But there was some people who really loved it.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.880]   So yeah, as with everything Swarkins does, there are people who love it and then people
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.080]   go, it's all the same show.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.080]   Just some people like the sports night version and some people like the West Wing.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.080]   It's all the same way.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.240]   I'm re-watching the West Wing because that is the greatest show of all time.
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.040]   But half those jokes are from sports night and half.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.840]   I like studio 60.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:55.840]   I love studio 60.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.160]   I was the only one.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:00.160]   But that was also because I like behind the scenes TV stuff.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.160]   So I might enjoy this.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:05.280]   And the newsroom has the exact same pilot as studio 60, like exact same.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:09.240]   Oh my God.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:14.280]   So they'll also, according to the financial times, and no one knows where they're getting
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:19.520]   this number, Apple says they're going to spend, what was it, eight billion dollars?
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.120]   Six, I think.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.320]   Six billion dollars.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.320]   That's right.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.960]   Six billion dollars on new content.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.040]   That's a big number, much bigger than the billion they've spent so far.
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:33.880]   But dwarfed by what Financial Times says Netflix is going to spend, which is 14 billion
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:36.680]   dollars next year on new content.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.680]   14 billion.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:44.600]   You're starting to get close to the GNP of a major nation at this point.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:48.880]   The difference is that Netflix is not nearly as profitable as Apple.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.480]   You know that Apple is going to be able to keep making these purchases for years and
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.960]   years and years.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:57.920]   Netflix isn't in any trouble, I'm quick to say.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:03.920]   But when you talk about how Apple is launching something, you feel as though they have a better
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:11.040]   opportunity to invest big and not have to worry quite so much about the results immediately.
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:18.560]   Whereas Netflix is, they're often positioned as the biggest, the company in the most danger
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:24.720]   now that all these amazing, huge new streaming services are opening up in the next year.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.280]   Netflix became Netflix, A, because they were really, really good, but also because they
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.880]   were the first ones doing it.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:35.320]   They became the Velcro, they became the Band-Aid, they became the Google, the name for what
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.400]   you talk about all streaming.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:44.560]   And now, Apple is jumping in, buying, Disney now controlling Hulu, having control of all
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.720]   of that library and jumping in.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:50.080]   The EBS is now expanding what they're doing.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:55.080]   You're getting a cinematic series like Picard up to bat.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.920]   This is going to be a really challenging time to even be Netflix.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:06.120]   I think Apple is in a really, really great position because they, just like, this is
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.160]   not a dig against Laurie, absolutely not.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.800]   I want to preface that by saying it.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.800]   But it's like-
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.800]   >> Watch it.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:18.880]   >> When your, if you're a parent and your kid says that my passion is music, I'm going
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.760]   to be in a band, I'm going to be performing for the rest of my life.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:27.760]   You want to hear them say, but I also have $230 billion in cash so that I will still
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.800]   be able to pay the rent while I'm pursuing this dream.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:35.360]   Apple is in sort of this position where they can pursue this dream of creating wonderful
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:39.640]   content and building up a brand while knowing that they've got a couple of hundred billion
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:44.920]   dollars in which to sort of fortify their dreams before it becomes completely profitable.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:49.560]   >> So if the band breaks up and they have to go back to college, they're just like,
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:50.560]   "Oh, that's okay.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:51.720]   It was a good try."
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:56.200]   >> I have to think that, first of all, Netflix has to spend the money.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.200]   They don't have a choice.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:02.600]   The problems they're running as fast as they can and they're losing ground.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:07.480]   I have to think that this is the year where consumers say, "Another $9 subscription, I
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.480]   can't do it.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.480]   I don't, I won't do it."
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:15.600]   At some point, consumers are going to have to say, "I pick one or two or three," but
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.000]   when you have, what is it now, eight or nine?
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.800]   >> So my guess, and it's just smart because there was a rumor that what Apple is not going
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:25.000]   to do is just dump all the shows to binge watch.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.200]   They're going to dump like three episodes and then have them be regular so that people
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.440]   can't just use their free month.
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:33.800]   But what a lot of people I know are doing is that when Stranger Things comes out, they
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:37.600]   resubscribe to Netflix for a month, watch everything they can possibly watch and then
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:41.880]   cancel again and then go to Disney, then they're going to go to Disney Plus and watch the
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:45.400]   backlog of Marvel shows and Star Wars shows and then cancel that.
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:49.960]   It sounds like they want us to subscribe to all of these, but we are going to be extremely
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:54.560]   predatory in what and how long we watch all of them and stagger them so that we're only
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:57.200]   paying for one at a time, maybe two.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.960]   >> Or you'll be like me and I am probably like more people out there in this world where
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.680]   I think I'm going to do that.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:07.720]   So I subscribe to this stars or something like that and then suddenly I'm just paying for
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.960]   it every month and forget to cancel.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:10.960]   >> No.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:15.600]   >> I wonder how piracy is going to be affected by this because there are a lot of people
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:19.480]   who are good, decent, honest people generally.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:23.960]   But once you push them to a certain level of saying, well, now to watch the five shows
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.960]   that I like, I'm going to have to pay $60 a month.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:31.400]   And if you find yourself that there's a subreddit where if you just subscribe to the subreddit,
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:35.840]   they will show you where this episode has been uploaded on YouTube and watch it during
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:39.120]   the 36 hours before content match takes it down.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:47.760]   I really think this is going to spur a lot of people to see the benefits of living the
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.600]   pirate life.
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:52.480]   >> And so we're back to Tim.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.360]   We've talked about whatever it is.
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:49:00.200]   Oh, wait a minute, Apple Arcade, rumor $5, right?
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.760]   That's actually the right price.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:02.920]   I would pay $5.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.440]   That's one app, right?
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.320]   And you're going to get 10 games updated every month.
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.320]   It looks like fun.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.920]   I think that that's the right price.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:10.920]   >> Definitely.
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.240]   >> That's leaving some money on the table, probably.
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.480]   Do you think they make money at $5?
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.480]   >> I don't know.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.720]   I guess it depends on how many people will subscribe.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.720]   >> Oh, I guess you're right.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.840]   If 100 million people sign up, yes, they'll have enough money to pay all the developers
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:25.840]   plenty.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:26.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:27.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:31.280]   They're right, that's right, because they only pay for the game once.
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.280]   >> Right.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.720]   >> I think that's a good price.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:35.960]   >> It just looks like so much fun.
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:39.320]   Even if you're going for a road trip, you want to throw your kids in the back with an
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.560]   iPod touch or an iPad.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:45.320]   Not have to worry about any weird ads popping up or anything that's pretending to be a
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:48.400]   game but 30 seconds in is something really horrible.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:51.360]   And they can just sit there and stream and play those games and new stuff comes long
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:54.320]   often enough that on the ride home, they're fine too.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:58.360]   >> And Apple promises that none of the games have in app purchases, you don't have to worry
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.360]   about that, right?
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:01.520]   >> They're all in law.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.840]   >> They're all in the awfully unlocked.
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:06.880]   And are they, did they say anything about whether they're online or you could play them
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.880]   in airplane mode?
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:08.880]   >> You can download them all.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:09.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:10.880]   >> You can download all of them.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:14.120]   So all of them are airplane playable.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:15.840]   That's really big.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:20.320]   I think this, I'm much more interested in this than Apple TV Plus, frankly.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:23.480]   >> It's all fun and games with streaming services until like this weekend.
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:24.480]   Sorry.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.760]   >> Finish your thought, Renee, until this weekend.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.600]   >> Oh, it's because it's all fun and games till this weekend when like log in for Harry
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:34.440]   Potter and Pokemon Go and Ingress all go down for four hours.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:35.640]   >> Oh, was it that bad?
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:39.840]   >> Yeah, I think all of Google went down, but I only noticed the Pokemon stuff.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:42.880]   >> Laurie, what were you thinking Laurie?
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.840]   >> I was just going to agree with you, Leo.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.160]   I don't watch a lot of TV shows.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.360]   I like to just browse around and watch a bunch of movies.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:56.800]   So I'm really not that interested in TV Plus, but I'm very interested in especially for
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:57.800]   night.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.720]   I thought I assumed that just like all the other subscriptions, we were looking at something
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:04.080]   closer to 9.99 even though that I thought that was a lot.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:06.960]   I just kind of assumed it would kind of fit that packaging scheme.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.760]   >> There's going to be a bundle.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:11.120]   >> It's only five dollars.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:18.440]   >> What if you got arcade, TV and music, which would be nominally, if you got the family
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:23.320]   plan $30, what if you got that for 15 or you have to be a little more right because the
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:24.320]   family plans 15?
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:27.760]   >> I'm thinking that they're going to keep Apple music separate from that bundle.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:30.000]   I think Apple music is very lucrative.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.800]   >> I personally think that the better bundle that would make us decide to go all in would
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.080]   be the new services.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:45.400]   So news plus, TV Plus and Apple Arcade and bundle all of that into something around the $15
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:46.400]   range.
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.400]   >> That would make sense.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:51.480]   >> Really great idea to get you on board with three things that you might not individually
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:53.560]   buy into at all.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:57.280]   But as a package deal, you might think, well, that makes them only $5 each per month and
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.280]   that seems reasonable.
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:02.440]   >> That also makes your iPad like a great entertainment device.
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:08.280]   It's like the complete kit for your iPad except for music.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:12.160]   >> Music is a real revenue generator for them.
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:17.640]   I don't know if Apple thinks that they need to give anybody any deals on Apple music as
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:18.640]   yet.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:23.120]   I think that they would do that after about six months to a year if they find out that
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:27.880]   they need to goose Apple TV subscriptions, they need to goose arcade subscriptions.
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:30.680]   So let's get more people on board by offering them a package.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:35.080]   I really don't see them doing that until they feel as though they have to do it.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:39.440]   Well, this is so interesting to me.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.440]   Well, this is when we'll find out presumably.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:42.440]   >> That's so new.
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:45.360]   >> Unless it is possible.
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:49.360]   Since we're talking November timeframe for the launch of TV+, that's what the german
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:50.360]   says.
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:53.800]   Did anybody, any rumors say when arcade would come out?
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:54.800]   >> Same time.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:53:05.120]   >> I remember was it 9 to 5 Mac that has the video walk through of it on the, yeah.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:11.760]   So they reported that within the wording of the information in the trial period for employees
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:21.120]   only that the, I think the way they worded it was that the 49 cent subscription price
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:24.560]   ends when iOS 13 comes out.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:31.480]   So to me, that means when iOS 13 launches, not in November or later this fall, but actually
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:38.080]   when iOS 13 launches, potentially that's when we're going to see apple arcade come out.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:41.560]   >> Donuts.
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:46.200]   >> So it's possible that if they're going to do, as we think, they will, a Mac book and
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:51.440]   iPad release that maybe they'll have an October event and announce everything then.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:52.440]   No.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:53.960]   >> You do it during the iPhone.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:56.600]   >> I think we'll get the services in September, yeah.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:57.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:03.920]   >> I'm wondering how they're going to do Apple TV because the way to get every single news
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:08.240]   outlet big and small to cover this is to get Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell and all
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:10.960]   of their stars there at the event.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:15.720]   Just make it more like one of the up fronts where you don't just get here some clips that
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.720]   we put together.
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:21.760]   But here is Steve Carell improvising on how funny it is that he's working for Apple and
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.320]   it's all that sort of stuff.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:27.000]   So I'm wondering if they would even decide to let's just do a New York event which we
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:34.120]   launched this separately in which we don't want to distract from our iPhone announcement.
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.720]   We don't want to announce from other hardware announcements.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:40.320]   We just want to make sure that everybody is really, really excited about seeing this brand
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:46.960]   new show featuring stars that they love and that they can actually subscribe to and lift
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:48.240]   right now.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:51.720]   So I think that their audience for that event, for the Apple TV event is really going to be
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:55.320]   YouTube to make sure that there's going to be those clips that go everywhere.
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.320]   >> Interesting.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:59.960]   The March event kind of fell, I wonder if the March event fell so flat with having them
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:03.520]   all there that they'd be afraid to repeat it though.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:07.720]   >> Well, it was a weird decision because they weren't announcing when it was going to be
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:10.480]   available, they weren't announcing how much it was going to cost, they weren't announcing
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:14.120]   anything more than here are some celebrities and here's what we plan to do.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:17.120]   Please remember us in four to 11 months time.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:18.640]   >> Yeah, they're doing that event.
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.360]   >> It was kind of destined to fail.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:21.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:22.800]   So maybe they do a do over.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:24.400]   Maybe they get a do over.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.400]   Yes.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:28.760]   >> I'm sorry, I'm a little distracted, I'm just ordering lunch.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:32.400]   Just keep talking once you're saying, no, I'm sorry.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.080]   I got my door to ask you open.
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:35.080]   That's rude.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:40.080]   I was thinking maybe though, chicken tikka masala, I'm kind of in the mood.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.080]   What do you think from Everest?
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.080]   >> That sounds good.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.080]   >> Oh, doesn't that sound good?
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:44.080]   A little garlic naan?
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.080]   >> Get me one.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.080]   >> Get me one.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:49.200]   >> Well, yeah, I can't do the garlic naan because I'm keto, but the chicken tikka masala,
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:54.080]   I think I could do that or they have the tend to her chicken, which is definitely keto.
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.680]   I'll get a little, I'll get a little, I'll get, I'll just go, I know what I'll do.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:02.680]   I'll get the butter chicken and then I'll get it medium.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:03.680]   Add it to my order.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:04.680]   There you go.
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:05.680]   I love this.
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:06.680]   Door dash, baby.
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:10.480]   Why cook when you can get slices on your sofa?
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.280]   That's nice looking.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:18.200]   It seems messy, but it is the best way to eat the best food from all of your local restaurants.
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:22.280]   Not only the big chains and they do have all of those who got McDonald's here, we got
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:28.000]   Wendy's chipotle, Chick-fil-A, the cheese cake factory.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.440]   We've also got our local favorites like Lala's Creamy, the best homemade ice cream I've
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:33.440]   ever had.
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.360]   Our Indian restaurants are Italian.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:41.640]   What's nice about door dashes, they're connecting all the big names with your local names,
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:44.360]   over 340,000 local restaurants.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:51.680]   Two, door to door delivery in over 3,300 cities in all 50 states and yes, Renee Canada.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:52.680]   Two.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:53.960]   Don't worry about dinner.
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:55.680]   Let dinner come to you with DoorDash.
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:56.680]   Here's the deal.
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:00.880]   If you put the DoorDash app on your phone, it's already there, isn't it?
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:01.880]   If it's not, get it.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:04.200]   I don't know why you wouldn't have it on there.
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:09.480]   Then your first order, 15 or more dollars, you get $5 off when you use a promo code Mac
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:10.480]   Break.
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.440]   That's how good deal.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:18.440]   Five bucks off when you use a promo code Mac Break on your DoorDash app.
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:20.440]   I just love.
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:22.000]   I don't know.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   This is the only problem.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.840]   It's hard for me to choose, but I do like chicken tikka masa.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:27.400]   I'm going to add that to my order.
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.040]   You know, you can get orders from a bunch of different restaurants.
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:31.040]   Why choose?
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:34.920]   I'm delivered right now.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:37.360]   And yes, it uses Apple Pay.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:38.520]   Of course it does.
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:41.480]   DoorDash, put it on your iPhone.
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:45.000]   If you got some other phone, Andy, put it on your other phone.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.360]   But you got to have DoorDash.
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:48.040]   And don't forget the offer code.
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:52.320]   Five bucks off when you use a promo code Mac Break.
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:54.080]   Lunch is on its way.
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:56.360]   I'll share a little with you when I get it.
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:57.360]   Exciting.
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:59.840]   Moving on to the event.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:02.800]   Renee's Pureless Pregnostications.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:05.720]   We have now gotten to.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:11.960]   They didn't even they haven't mentioned the HomePod in a while or the the AirPods.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:15.640]   They mentioned it in passing at WWDC because you can hand off from your phone to your
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:16.640]   HomePod.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:18.640]   You can have multiple listeners.
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.840]   You're multiple AirPods listening to your phone.
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:22.560]   So they've kind of mentioned it peripherally.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:24.120]   But is there anything new?
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:27.960]   There's supposed to be a bunch of other stuff about the HomePod that they haven't announced
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:28.960]   yet.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:30.280]   So that to me would be interesting.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:32.280]   I don't think we'll see a home.
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:34.320]   Like I would love to see a home theater system.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:38.320]   I'd love to see a HomePod mini especially because I think that it could be really interesting
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:45.480]   if they do like Andy said for other products, but crack that $99 or $149 market with their
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:48.720]   assistant product or just their speaker actually because the assistant product is not going
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:49.720]   to crack it.
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:53.960]   But the speaker product, the AirPod 3 is super interesting because AirPods 2 got pushed back
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:58.440]   to the spring and now our AirPods 3 still on track for the fall or do they move those
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:58:59.640]   to the spring again?
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:01.840]   It's interesting time.
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:07.760]   And you mentioned although this seems hard to believe since Apple did announce it's new
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:10.280]   wireless charging AirPods this year.
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:15.400]   But what about a third generation says Renee Richie with noise cancellation and sweat resistance?
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:20.200]   How about over the ear versions?
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:24.920]   They did announce just the other day they asked colors for the power beats.
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:25.920]   Yep.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:27.640]   That's a lot of time for this too.
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:29.640]   Okay.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:30.640]   What about AirPods?
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:31.640]   It's starting to wonder about the ear cans.
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:33.680]   Now you're talking.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:38.000]   Actually you know Microsoft makes surface headphones that are over the ear headphones.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   They're actually decent headphones.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.320]   I think Gurman had the rumor Apple was working on them going back a year, a year and a half
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:43.320]   ago.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:44.320]   Right.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.560]   They released it in an Apple brand though instead of Beats.
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:48.200]   Isn't this all Beats really?
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.200]   The same as AirPods.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:51.000]   I mean I think Apple wants to differentiate.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.800]   They want to have the latest technology, the highest and most avant-garde products.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:59.400]   And then they use Beats to fill in the back catalog for variations around the ear and
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.240]   on the ear and colors.
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:05.680]   Like they'll never be an Apple AirCans in every color for every Olympic team.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:08.000]   But they sure will be a Beats version.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.280]   Will they mention the new Mac or the new Mac book or the iPads at this?
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:17.480]   This event or will they keep the slate clean?
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.240]   Some people said but it feels like that's always October to me.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:24.520]   I don't even think I'm going to predict not even an event in October.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:27.200]   Just you know a press release.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.200]   I think they'll do it.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.920]   So if they have the new iPads and they have like with the big cameras and they have the
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:35.080]   new 16 inch MacBook Pro, I think they'll do an event.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:39.760]   Because the last time they didn't do one was 2017 and that was just hellacious because
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.160]   it was one thing after another.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.760]   It was the new iPads Pro.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:44.920]   It was the new iPhone.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.880]   It was just one product.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.920]   And I think it was way too much for one event.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:53.240]   All right.
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.640]   Should we make a bet?
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:59.560]   I bet you want chicken tikka masala or how about a butter chicken?
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.560]   Dores it.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.400]   You dash mine.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:07.560]   And then Renee says as he said earlier that the one more thing maybe would be a bundle.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:10.160]   I like the name Apple Prime but there's no way.
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.120]   There's no way.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.120]   No.
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.120]   Yeah, they wouldn't do that.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.120]   Take that gift.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:17.600]   So stick that Apple Prime.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.520]   This just in the president is tweeting.
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.800]   Oh no.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.240]   You can stop right.
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:28.360]   I'm going to take a slogan Dr. Pepper.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:33.520]   So Tim Apple went to have lunch or dinner with the president and his bedminster golf course
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:36.840]   earlier a couple of days ago.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:44.240]   And to plead his case against Chinese tariffs, the tariffs for some devices like AirPods
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:48.800]   would kick in September 1 soon.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:56.480]   And there is a moratorium till December 15th for Max and iPads and iPhones.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:03.120]   But nevertheless, Mr. Cook made his case to the president saying Samsung's not going
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:09.560]   to be paying tariffs.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.400]   And the president said, well, you got a good point there.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.920]   I'll think about it.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:19.800]   Essentially, he said there might be a bailout for Apple if there's a hardship because of
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.960]   the trade war.
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.920]   But he said, and I'll quote him, this would be very short term.
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.400]   If I didn't help them, they would have a big problem.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.640]   The smart people say, thank you very much.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.240]   And the dumb people have no idea.
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.600]   I don't even know what he's saying here.
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:34.600]   Anyway, enough said.
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.480]   There you go.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.480]   Okay.
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.480]   But it is.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.440]   I mean, the reason I bring it up is this very much will affect Apple's business.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:46.400]   And I had a very good point when he said his favorite Samsung, doesn't it?
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.400]   Samsung won't be paying it.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.160]   I never thought I'd hear Apple and bailout in the same sentence.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:59.560]   Well, again, I don't want to start talking and I'd not be able to stop for 30 minutes.
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:00.560]   No, that's good.
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:01.560]   That's good.
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:02.560]   That's fine.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:09.800]   Um, during fireball, John Gruber taking a little, uh, taking his licks at Siri and the fact
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:14.960]   that people were human contractors were listening to Siri.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:19.000]   Uh, this now we knew this, but the Guardian kind of really got Apple's attention.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.880]   Apple issued statements saying we're going to suspend the program.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:30.040]   But, uh, Gruber said, apparently the billboards Apple put up at CES should have read what
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:33.880]   happens in your iPhone stays on your iPhone, except for some of your Siri recordings, which
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:35.840]   we listened to.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:36.840]   He was mad.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.840]   He's mad.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:40.840]   He said Apple has to keep to a higher standard.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:45.800]   If you're going to say privacy is your main goal, I don't have, I mean, every single one
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.960]   of these assistants has human grading.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.360]   That's how you get better.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.400]   I wasn't surprised to see it, uh, on Siri.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:55.160]   I knew Amazon and Google were doing it.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:01.880]   Maybe there's a little bit of a difference because, uh, there are settings on both the
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:05.840]   Echo app and with Google, you can listen to the recordings.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:10.320]   Uh, you can turn it off as well.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:14.320]   Apple doesn't really tell you which recordings have been saved for review.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.520]   And the real issue he has and I have and we all have is not what the ones where you say,
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:27.840]   Shlomo, but the ones where we have a cat named Samantha, we call her Sammy every time I
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:32.800]   say, Hey, Sammy, my home pod goes, well, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:36.920]   So so that's the thing is these so-called incidental recordings where you didn't say
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.120]   the trigger word.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:42.760]   You weren't thinking about some device recording it and you maybe we're talking about other
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:43.760]   things.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.960]   Uh, agree, disagree.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:50.160]   It seems like when John gets upset, that's there's a good reason to be upset.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.160]   Right.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.360]   So I think this is, this is an example.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:05:00.920]   We weren't bothered by or surprised by to hear Amazon or Google doing this and we were
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:03.720]   up in arms when we found out that Apple was doing it.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:08.080]   Even though if we think logically across the board, of course they're doing it.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.920]   That's what, you know, that's what they're all doing.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:14.920]   They have like people, you know, like, um, using research and development to make their
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:15.920]   voice better.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.880]   That's, that's kind of part of the process here.
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:23.760]   But Apple, just, just like what Grumman says is Apple stands on this platform of privacy
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.200]   and brags about how private they are.
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:31.400]   So they're going to be scrutinized much more of about this kind of thing.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:35.480]   So on one hand, we can all look at it and say it's not really that big of a deal.
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:40.480]   But if they're going around bragging about their privacy, but they're actually not really
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:44.960]   being that transparent with something like recording things that are happening in your
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:51.600]   house, that to me is an example of not, you're, you're not walking the talk.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:54.960]   You're, you're talking about how private you are, but you're actually not following through
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:06:00.560]   with that by being transparent about something as private as my phone in my bedroom every
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.200]   single night.
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:08.960]   My difficulty on an ongoing basis is Apple wanting to present themselves as, hey, we're
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:14.840]   just here to help humanity and we're all about design and beauty and the arts and creativity.
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.160]   And I don't think that that's a lie.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:21.360]   I think that's, that is how they aspirationally define themselves, but they are a multi, they
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:25.840]   are a huge trillion, at times a trillion dollar company and they will make the same decisions
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.160]   that a trillion dollar company makes.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:32.960]   And even leaving the trillion dollars out of it, they are still making technology in the
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:38.880]   real world, which means that if the, if people choose to believe that the reason why
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:44.720]   Google and Amazon were allowing people, human beings to listen to conversations is because,
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.720]   well, because these two companies, they're horrible.
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.720]   They don't care about privacy.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.440]   They don't care about propriety.
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:50.800]   Apple would never do that.
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:53.760]   You have to realize that no, they're doing it because that's the only way to make this
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.080]   magical technology that you love work.
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:59.880]   And if you think that Apple has somehow made some sort of a breakthrough that allows them
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:05.760]   to never have to do that at all, you need to learn about how this stuff really works.
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.920]   So it's, John is absolutely right.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:13.840]   It is, it's one thing when a company doesn't reveal something because they didn't feel
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:18.800]   it was necessarily germane, which I think is the actual reason.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:23.080]   It's another thing when you are making a PR statement, not even necessarily a moralistic
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:28.520]   statement, but a PR statement about here's why you should give us your money and not
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:33.440]   any competitors because we do think, we take care of that other companies do not.
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.840]   You really do feel as though you've been lied to and it hopefully makes you think twice
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:40.880]   about any other assumptions you've made about a certain company.
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:44.640]   Gruber, this is actually a good point he makes here.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:51.160]   Compare and contrast what's going on with Siri with iOS is transcript feature for voicemail.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:55.840]   At the bottom of every transcription, iOS asks whether the transcription was useful or
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:56.840]   not useful.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:00.240]   If you tap either one of those, you get a very explicit prompt.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.040]   Help improve transcriptions.
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:07.400]   Would you like to submit this voicemail to Apple to improve transcription accuracy?
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:11.360]   Recordings will only be used to improve the quality of speech recognition and Apple products.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:15.960]   Do not submit recordings if you believe the speaker would be uncomfortable with use submitting
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:18.200]   the content to Apple.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.480]   And then there's a cancel and submit button.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:25.120]   He says, you've got to address the same prompt every single time, every time.
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.960]   He said, that's how you do it.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.800]   In fact, that's exactly what Steve Jobs said in 2010 at the D8 conference.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:37.520]   He said, privacy means people know what they're signing up for in plain English and repeatedly,
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:41.240]   I believe people are smart and some people want to share more data than other people do,
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:42.480]   but ask them.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.880]   Ask them every time.
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:46.220]   Make them tell you to stop asking them.
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.820]   If they get tired of you asking them, let them know precisely what you're going to do
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:50.820]   with their data.
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:54.440]   I think that this is a mission statement for privacy.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:55.440]   It's a good difference.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:59.720]   The difference is with the voicemail, you're going there to look at your voicemail and
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:02.880]   then you're reading it and you see that prompt.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:06.960]   But with accidental, for example, the biggest problem here is with accidental triggers,
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:10.040]   you would pick up your phone and it would say an accidental trigger has happened.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.680]   Would you like to report this?
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.280]   And then it's interrupting you every time.
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:17.240]   And I think that's great UX, but you also have to have please don't bother me.
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:18.560]   Please never do this.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.280]   Please ask me every time.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:21.520]   Please always do this.
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:26.400]   Don't ask me anymore because we're seeing now is death by a thousand prompts.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:30.360]   There's so much prompt fatigue that I worry that people won't even look at this if it
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:31.840]   starts popping up every time.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:32.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.480]   But there's got to be somewhere in between the two, the for Syria.
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:37.480]   I mean, there has to be.
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:38.480]   So it has to be.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:47.640]   Amazon has the echoes smart assistant app and every query, even when it's external,
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.960]   it just shows up on a list.
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:53.040]   And I kind of like being able to look at that.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:58.600]   And even it could even be something that's like stored locally and you can choose, send
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.240]   this to Apple, send this to Apple.
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.960]   And then at the end of every day or just whenever you remember to pop in and look at
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:07.680]   it, or maybe you get a notification on your phone once a day, don't forget to check your
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:14.080]   Siri query and you can go in and you know, decide what you want to send to Apple for
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.320]   review or what you would rather keep private.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:21.320]   You know, if you wanted to help Apple do that sort of thing, I don't, I don't think there's
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:25.760]   anything wrong with sharing my accidental queries with, with Apple.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.520]   I just, I think that it's important that we know ahead of time that that's being done
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.280]   and, and to what level.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:36.480]   So I don't like the idea of having just like this Siri app and you open the app and all
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.960]   of your queries are just right there for you.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:44.040]   And all of the ways that Siri has tracked your information to develop, you know, the
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:49.480]   weather in where you're at or, you know, the listing of your upcoming events or something
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:54.560]   like that, the way the echo version of their, their digital assistant app works.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.360]   That would be so great.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:00.200]   Yes, you're like on a Mac, you can pin it, but you can't do anything like that on iOS.
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.200]   Yep.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.200]   Mm.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:05.080]   Yesterday was World Photography Day.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:10.120]   Tim Apple sharing some of his, I know I want to call him that from now on sharing some
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:15.400]   of his favorite shot on iPhone.
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:21.200]   Here is a, that's a, that's a beautiful picture, the iPhone caught the morning light beautifully
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.840]   on that one.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.360]   That's from Guess Eight.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.480]   Here is a picture of the Dolomites by Carolyn Steig.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:31.880]   Her Instagram is We Travel the World, which is a great travel blogger.
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:39.520]   And then in a moment on a Baku beach by Mikhail Zato-Levittroff, some beautiful images.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:41.760]   Wow, that looks like a painting.
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.400]   That's amazing.
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:51.400]   So if you, if you aren't already following Chairman Cook, Rainbow, as a double rainbow.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:52.400]   A double rainbow.
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.400]   A double rainbow.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:54.400]   Isn't he?
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.400]   Isn't I forget who's chairman, but it's not.
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:56.400]   Oh, he's not chairman.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.400]   Tim, he's president.
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:11:59.400]   CEO.
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:00.400]   El CEO.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:07.080]   El CEO, Tim Apple, two loops on a spring warning in the Netherlands.
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.920]   This is, this is Twitter con.
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.400]   This is the way Twitter should be.
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.400]   Oh, look at that.
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:12.400]   Wouldn't that be great?
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:14.160]   Oh, it read so hard to do in digital.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.880]   And that's just beautifully done.
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.160]   On a recent summer road trip with my family, we stopped to play on these hail bales.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.160]   Hey, bales.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:24.880]   I caught a photo of my daughter, Airborne, with her pigtails flying into the sky.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.360]   It's Todd Lawson.
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:27.360]   Wow.
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.960]   Shot an iPhone.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:29.960]   Wow.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.400]   That's a, these are, these are really stunning.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.400]   So they're not all our...
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.400]   You've got to be truscipping.
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:35.400]   I'd love to have those photos.
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:38.600]   Oh, and, and here's Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell.
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:39.600]   I can't play that.
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.400]   I don't want to, I don't want to get pulled down.
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.240]   Can't go.
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:53.320]   Also, this tweet, Apple is celebrating America's national parks this month with a special badge,
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:57.360]   a special badge for your, your Apple watch.
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:02.320]   If you walk three miles, August 17th through August 25th, in other words, right now Apple
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:07.360]   make a $10 donation to the National Park Foundation for every purchase made with Apple
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:14.200]   Pay at an Apple store, Apple.com, or the app store in the US.
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:21.960]   And you can also get your very special Apple watch badge that will view, do you have it
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:22.960]   yet Renee?
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:26.920]   All you have to do is complete a walk, run, hike or wheelchair workout of three miles
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:30.880]   to get this animated sticker for messages and activities.
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:31.880]   I don't have it.
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:32.880]   I think it's US only.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:33.880]   I have to do it.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:34.880]   Oh man.
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.360]   Yeah, I need the Canadian National Park.
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:40.080]   I don't move three miles at one time, anytime in my life.
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.920]   I'm going to do it tonight.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.440]   Just to get that.
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:45.440]   You start walking Leo.
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.440]   I'll start walking.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.680]   We'll meet somewhere in the Midwest.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:49.680]   Yeah, we'll meet in the middle.
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:55.560]   Just like Marina Brown, which is final breakup art piece with the rest of it.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.560]   Oh really?
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.120]   They walked in opposite directions?
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:03.920]   Yeah, it was when they decided to break up the she's they started at opposite ends of
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:04.920]   the Great Wall of China.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:05.920]   Wow.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.840]   That's a long walk.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:10.520]   Wherever they met up, that was going to be like the piece.
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.720]   That's when they came to each other.
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:14.360]   Oh, they battled.
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:20.440]   That's when they decided who got the Porsche, who got the comic book collection.
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:24.000]   Then they sat down on the Great Wall and they split up all their CDs.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.400]   Apple books will feature our national parks, a themed collection that will guide readers
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.680]   through notable national parks in the United States.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:32.680]   Good fruit.
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:33.680]   I really appreciate Apple doing this actually.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:36.280]   Our national parks really are a treasure.
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:43.600]   The app store will highlight essential apps to help you plan your next national park visit.
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.240]   So this is good.
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:51.800]   National parks are absolutely one of our most of many people come from all around the world
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.760]   to see those Apple parks.
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:54.760]   I mean, national parks.
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:55.760]   Apple Park too.
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.520]   Actually, they all come.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.400]   Let's see.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:04.800]   I'm not going to talk about jail breaks or developers accusing Apple of any competitive
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:09.280]   behavior.
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:12.800]   Apple does have suggestions if you were declined for an Apple card.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.840]   I should have probably led with this one.
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:15.840]   Yeah.
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:19.080]   Go suck it as one of them.
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.880]   No, I don't know.
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:24.120]   Do a better job next time.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.120]   Yeah.
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.680]   Apply different.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.680]   Apply different.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:28.680]   That's it.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:29.680]   I like that.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:30.680]   You're like that.
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:31.680]   I like that.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:32.680]   Complicating it wrong.
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:35.960]   Negative public records like bankruptcy or property, reposition, concolor and application,
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:39.360]   heavy debt, also seen as a negative.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:43.680]   You need disposable income after paying off obligations.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:47.520]   If you apply for credit cards or loans frequently or you have a low credit score, you may not
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:48.880]   be approved.
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:55.200]   If you were denied, Apple says, make sure everything you submitted was accurate.
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:59.000]   Add a clear picture of a state issued photo ID if one was requested.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.160]   Of course, the applicant's last name must match the one in the ID.
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:04.160]   Okay.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.460]   Seems simple.
[01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:10.800]   Make sure your credit report does not contain errors.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:14.400]   So basically, yeah, apply different.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.800]   That's exactly what you should be doing.
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.960]   Let's see.
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:21.960]   We did the three colors.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.920]   Oh, my next car.
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:31.080]   Which I'm going to purchase with my Apple, titanium Apple card, the Porsche Taycan, which
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:33.720]   is already, I think sold out for 2020.
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.000]   They're only making 30,000.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.240]   It's the first electric Porsche.
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:41.400]   Looks really sweet, but there's also no prices announced if you have to ask.
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:45.360]   You cannot afford it, but it will have an unusual feature.
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.560]   I don't think any other car is doing this.
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.600]   Apple music will be built into the car.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.000]   You don't even need a phone.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   What?
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   What?
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.320]   And you let this happen with Porsche instead of Ferrari.
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.320]   How does this happen?
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.320]   How does this happen?
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:01.160]   Porsche says it plans to offer three years of complimentary in-car data to customers,
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:06.400]   and you'll get six months of Apple music free to new and existing Porsche owners.
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:12.120]   So yes, it will have car play, but you don't have to have a phone or connect it up to get
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:18.440]   Apple music, which is, I think, a great way to do kind of a 21st century radio in your
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.440]   $130,000 car.
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:23.480]   And take this BMW, you tried this yearly.
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:27.960]   Yeah, BMW actually charges for access to car play.
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:28.960]   Yeah.
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:32.520]   So maybe this is a little shot at BMW.
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:38.120]   Porsche says you'll be able to control Apple music, but not with Siri 9, with your proprietary
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.960]   voice control system.
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:47.040]   And you can create a custom Apple music station for any zone you hear while listening to
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.960]   broadcast radio.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:50.720]   So that's kind of cool.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:51.960]   So you could say, I like this.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.560]   Give me some more of that.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:18:00.280]   Even if you're listening to broadcast radio and Porsche will have exclusive Porsche playlists.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.800]   Teslas have Tesla playlists listening.
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:03.800]   I won't lie.
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.080]   You'll be able to link your Ticon and Apple IDs room of the need to air, enter a password,
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:12.560]   or pair your phone.
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:15.120]   And that's cool.
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:19.600]   And clear whether Android Auto will be available, although it's crazy if you put a car play into
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:22.200]   a car not to have Android Auto.
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:24.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:30.800]   So Porsche Ticon will be coming out in September and already is sold out for 2020.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:33.600]   I actually, I actually, I would really like this car.
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:36.600]   It would be really fun.
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:55.840]   Uh, dud, dud, dud, dud, dud, dud.
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:03.800]   It's, yay, yay, our show today brought to you by W. W. T. Worldwide technology.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:04.800]   A great company.
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:10.440]   Anybody in enterprise will know if you, you know, it's hard when you're adding technology
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:13.040]   to your company and all companies are doing it more and more.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.200]   They're moving to the cloud.
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:20.080]   They've got to add security, uh, because of course you don't want to be bit by ransomware
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.080]   or bre-, or breaches.
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:23.360]   And that's a big issue these days.
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:27.520]   You're looking at new networking and Wi-Fi technologies.
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:32.920]   And so the best place to go, WWT, because they have built this amazing advanced technology
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:33.920]   center.
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:38.000]   They actually started this a decade ago and it's grown exponentially.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.520]   Their lab now contains more than half a billion dollars in equipment from hundreds of OEMs
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:50.280]   and key partners ranging from the big guys, the heavyweights like NetApp, Cisco, VMware,
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:54.960]   little guys emerging disruptors like Tanium and Equinix and Expanse.
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:59.520]   And the beauty of this, of course, WWT's engineers work in these labs every day.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:00.760]   They beta test new equipment.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.840]   They build reference architectures.
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:10.520]   They design custom integrations for their customers, but it's also a lab you can use.
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:12.240]   That's pretty amazing.
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:17.920]   The advanced technology center is an incubator for IT innovation and that lets you schedule
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:25.560]   on demand or schedule ahead labs like, for instance, NetApp's cloud volumes on tap,
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:30.360]   on tap on flash, NetApp disaster recovery as a service.
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:34.480]   So that's, if you're thinking about these products, to be able to try them and see how
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:39.320]   they integrate with your existing infrastructure is gold, solid gold.
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:43.760]   Hundreds of other labs too representing newest advances in things like flash storage, multi-cloud,
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:46.820]   hyper-converged infrastructure, cloud data management and more.
[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:49.680]   You can learn about products before you launch.
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:52.480]   You could spin up proof of concepts and pilots.
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:54.720]   And they call it lab as a service.
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:00.520]   It's literally a dedicated lab space within the ATC where you can perform your own programmatic
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:03.360]   testing using the vast technology ecosystem.
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:07.640]   WWT is already built, completely virtual too, so you don't have to come to St. Louis to
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:08.640]   do it.
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:12.400]   You can take advantage anywhere in the world 24/7.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.400]   They have launched it.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:17.820]   They would launch it round about this timeframe by the end of the summer.
[01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:18.820]   The time is finally here.
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:25.340]   They have launched their new digital platform, encompassing the entire ATC ecosystem.
[01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:29.420]   This creates a multiplier effect of knowledge, speed and agility anytime, anywhere around
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:33.420]   the world for all of WWT's customers.
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:36.420]   And it's not just the labs you can get access to articles, to case studies.
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:44.420]   You get hands-on tools that make a big difference in our increasingly technical world.
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:50.060]   So if your business uses technology, if you need technology, you need to know about worldwide
[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:52.340]   technology, WWT.
[01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:58.520]   To learn more about the WWT and the ATC and to get access to their new on-demand lab platform,
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:02.760]   you go to www.wt.com/twit.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:04.620]   There's the page.
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:06.900]   WWT simplifies the complex.
[01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:09.220]   www.wt.com/twit.
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:16.700]   WWT delivering business and technology outcomes around the world and right into your office
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:18.700]   today.
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:21.900]   Lab as a service.
[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:22.740]   Andy Ennaco.
[01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:25.780]   I like this pic.
[01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:28.980]   Yeah, this is actually a repeat of a pic I made a couple of months ago.
[01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:36.140]   I bought this really cool pocket-sized flash, camera flash a couple of months ago.
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:40.260]   What I liked about it then was that it was about the size of a packet cigarettes.
[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:43.220]   It was inexpensive, about 60 or 70 bucks.
[01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:48.780]   Rams on two AA batteries and every single detail of how it was designed was so perfectly
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:54.660]   designed to be a flash that you put into your bag, you put into your pocket and you
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:57.980]   just, it will be perfectly useful for everything you want to use it for.
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:02.540]   The key here is on camera flash, you know, Red Eye, it looks horrible, makes people look
[01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:04.860]   like they're in the witness protection program.
[01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:07.500]   This has a transmitter so you can move it off camera.
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:11.700]   Right, the bottom of it is a, it looks like a regular flash with a hot shoe but you push
[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:14.380]   a button and it's like a transformer.
[01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:19.940]   It leaves the connection to the little connection to the camera behind and becomes like a wireless
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:21.140]   off camera flash.
[01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:22.540]   So great.
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:23.540]   What a great show.
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:24.700]   So great.
[01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:30.180]   And just so last weekend, as I said was the Fan Expo Boston and I love shooting like people
[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:31.180]   in costume.
[01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:35.820]   So this was the first real live fire exercise of this as an off camera flash and I couldn't
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:37.980]   have been more happy with the results.
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:43.860]   It gave me exactly what I wanted, which is the ability to just pop some fill into into
[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:45.500]   people's shadows.
[01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:46.500]   Look at that.
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:47.900]   These really nice little effects.
[01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:50.980]   These aren't the effects that you get when you leave when you have a flash like that's
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:53.140]   directly on the camera.
[01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:58.700]   But on top of that, it didn't need the transmitter that stays on top of the camera.
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:02.660]   Didn't need to be recharged really at all weekend.
[01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:08.540]   The flash itself lasted at least all day onto double rechargeable batteries.
[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:15.140]   It was so easy to just take pictures and also make adjustments as I go with it.
[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:18.460]   And again, small compact work great.
[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:22.660]   And for 70 bucks, it really is one of the best things I've ever bought for my camera.
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:26.860]   It'll work with anything that you've got that has like a standard flash hot shoe.
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:29.540]   However, it also has like flash sync.
[01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:33.180]   So if you have a camera that has a built in flash, you can have it set, you can set it
[01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:37.460]   so that it will automatically trigger in your hand or on a pole or on a tripod as soon as
[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:39.780]   it senses the flash from your camera.
[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:42.220]   So you really need to have a hot shoe to make it work.
[01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:44.060]   I love that.
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:48.580]   And to make it even to even sweeten the deal, they put like a really super bright pair of
[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:50.420]   white LEDs on the front.
[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:55.020]   So you can even use it when you're taking pictures with your phone or taking video pictures.
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:58.460]   Oh, now if you're looking at it, see, this is what I'm talking about of how well thought
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:24:59.540]   out this was.
[01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:03.100]   It was like, well, a bounce, a lot of people like to bounce the flash off the ceiling.
[01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:07.540]   So what if we put like the flash like on a little like tilt her so that it's no bigger
[01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:10.060]   than a normal pocket flash, but you can bounce it.
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:15.860]   And how much would it cost for us to just put like a little slot behind the front, the
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:21.340]   front sheet for it so that you can put in like like gels and filters and stuff.
[01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:25.420]   So every picture I took last week and had a little like warming filter on top of it.
[01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:29.540]   Again, every single thing they could have could have done, including, well, I know it
[01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:32.780]   would be really, really sexy and cool if it were had rounded edges.
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:37.380]   But if we keep all the sides square, that means that someone could just put it on a shelf
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:39.100]   and it won't fall over.
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:42.820]   And gee, even if they want to put it on a tripod, why don't we put a tripod's mount like
[01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:46.940]   a tripod screw on the bottom of it so that if you do want to put it on a tripod, it'll
[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:48.460]   work that way too.
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:53.140]   Again, when I was when I was going through my photos last night, it really occurred to
[01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:57.380]   me that of all the technology stuff I've ever used, there are very few times where I've
[01:25:57.380 --> 01:26:02.220]   seen something that is absolutely perfect, where every problem that you might encounter
[01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:06.900]   using this sort of device, they anticipated it and they found every opportunity to make
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:08.260]   this product better.
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:13.180]   And this is a $70 flash by a company I've never heard of before.
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:17.780]   They make other like camera stuff, but they're not necessarily this boutique hassle, blad
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:20.580]   esque sort of company.
[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:22.140]   So I couldn't.
[01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:26.040]   So my next step is I'm definitely going to be ordering another one or two of these.
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:31.060]   You can have multiple flashes key off the exact same transmitter you have on the camera.
[01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:34.420]   So I think I'm definitely going to add another one or two of these to my back.
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:39.700]   >> This is just getting the flash and the receiver because you want to.
[01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:44.660]   >> When you buy the basic unit, the basic unit comes with a flash and the receiver that's
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:48.020]   sort of, again, it's built into the bottom of it.
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:50.420]   But when you press a button, the bottom of it pops off.
[01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:51.420]   >> So you have the transmitter.
[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:52.980]   >> And the bottom is actually the transmitter, right?
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:55.260]   But you can buy extra transmitters.
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:57.580]   You can buy extra flash units.
[01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:58.740]   You can buy extra receivers.
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:01.780]   Actually, you can buy receivers that will pop onto the bottom of pretty much any flash
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:02.780]   you've got.
[01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:05.820]   I like this one so much that I might just buy another kit.
[01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:06.820]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:07.820]   I'm going to buy one.
[01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:08.820]   >> I think this is great.
[01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:09.820]   >> It could be easier.
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:15.260]   >> And when you shot these great pictures, were you holding it with one hand and the camera
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:16.260]   with the other?
[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:17.260]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:20.140]   >> What I was doing, I'm sorry, I didn't have it within reach.
[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:27.700]   What I was doing was, I was holding the camera with one hand and holding the flash with the
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:30.460]   other on the second day, there we go.
[01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:32.460]   >> You like it so much?
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:34.060]   >> It carries it with them at all times, folks.
[01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:40.020]   >> No, no, no, unfortunately, I had to dump out my bag was set up for moderating panels
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:44.100]   and taking pictures was not set up for podcasting, so I had to dump everything out.
[01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:49.700]   So the first one, I was just holding it up, the camera like this and the flash like that.
[01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:53.060]   For the second one, I realized that maybe getting a little bit more height or a little
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:54.220]   bit more distance was good.
[01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:58.900]   So I just had one of these little, I might make this a pick of the weeks in some future
[01:27:58.900 --> 01:27:59.900]   thing.
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:05.380]   So things I had to discover, these are like lock lying sort of like extender connectors.
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:12.620]   But what it has, instead of being for liquid, it has a tripod screw on the bottom and the
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.460]   other version of that on the top.
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:20.220]   So I just screwed the flash on the top of that, sort of using it as a handheld flash
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:21.500]   on a stick.
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:26.100]   And so I was getting a little bit extra distance, a little bit extra maneuverability with it.
[01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:30.660]   And that really have on day two and day three, that was an extra super super bonus.
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:34.100]   But like I again, I said, I just love the design of this thing.
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:38.900]   How many times have you used a phone or you've used like a router or something or charger
[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:44.060]   was like, oh my God, if only they had decided to like give me like a little clip right here,
[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:46.620]   I would not ever have to lose the special connector.
[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:48.940]   I need for this, but no, I'm going to lose it.
[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:53.260]   And then you find out that you find something where every single thing we thought, damn,
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:56.060]   it was too bad that they didn't put a tripod, oh wait, they did put a tripod thing.
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:58.260]   Oh, it's too bad that I won't be able to use a filter.
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:28:59.580]   Oh, well, no, they did think of that.
[01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:01.540]   They did allow me to use a filter with it.
[01:29:01.540 --> 01:29:03.940]   It's actually comes with a gel pack, which is really nice.
[01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:04.940]   You get to write it.
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:07.660]   It comes with a gel pack, but it also, it also lets you find your own solutions.
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:10.940]   The only problem I found with it is that I was almost exclusively taking pictures of
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:18.420]   people inside a sort of dark conference hall, which meant that I really wanted, because
[01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:22.380]   I wanted my pictures to be, I wanted to see the background, but also I have flat illuminated
[01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:23.380]   on the foreground.
[01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:27.660]   To get the background, I used to, I would have to have like sort of a high ISO, but the problem
[01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:34.220]   is that a high ISO, even though you can adjust this all the way down to 164th flash power,
[01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:36.180]   in many cases, it was still way too hot.
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:41.180]   So all I did was I cut out a little piece of paper for my notebook and slid it behind
[01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:45.300]   like that filter and that little slot and that just cut it down again just enough so
[01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:48.460]   that I could get exactly the amount that I needed.
[01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:52.740]   And it was like, if this didn't have this little feature of this little slot, you can
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:55.940]   insert your own filters, I would have had a problem that would have been difficult to
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:58.900]   deal with, but it did have it so I could solve this problem myself.
[01:29:58.900 --> 01:29:59.900]   Nice.
[01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:00.900]   Very, very happy with it.
[01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:01.900]   I just bought it.
[01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:02.900]   Yeah.
[01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:05.740]   That sounds like a very useful thing to have in your kit, because I don't like on camera
[01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:09.940]   flash having it though is handy, especially with bounce, but then being able to pop it
[01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:12.620]   off and putting it out here and that's great.
[01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:13.620]   That's really great.
[01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:14.620]   Yeah.
[01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:19.700]   It's from Hong Kong, so it includes 30, you have to add 13 bucks for shipping from Hong
[01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:21.260]   Kong Post.
[01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:24.340]   I think you can actually, you can also buy, that was, that's the actual website.
[01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:25.740]   I went to their website.
[01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:26.740]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:30.780]   If you go, if you go to Amazon, you can actually get on Amazon Prime and just get it for 69
[01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:31.780]   bucks flat.
[01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:32.780]   Oh, well.
[01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:33.780]   Too late.
[01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:34.780]   I already bought it.
[01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:37.300]   Laurie Gale, your pick of the week.
[01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:40.540]   So this is just a little silly thing.
[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:48.900]   One of my coworkers posted a picture, I think it was floating around on social means.
[01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:51.980]   It's an AirPods case, but it looks like a Pokeball.
[01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:53.140]   It's just a simple one.
[01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:54.660]   What I want.
[01:30:54.660 --> 01:31:01.660]   So I'm thinking, you know, if you're Renee, if you're, if you scroll through these different
[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:06.260]   ones, there's actually a, there are a bunch of different Pokemon related ones.
[01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:08.580]   I thought the Pokeball was the cutest one, but.
[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:11.540]   Now they don't charge in the case.
[01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:12.540]   Do they?
[01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:16.060]   No, but they do have an opening at the bottom so that you can plug in your charger.
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:18.660]   So no, this, this would not, it's too thick.
[01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:22.740]   You, you, your actual AirPods case goes in it.
[01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:23.740]   Yeah.
[01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:24.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:25.740]   AirPods case sticks inside of it.
[01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:26.740]   Like a nest.
[01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:27.740]   Oh, I get it.
[01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:29.540]   So it's just like, it's a case for your case.
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:35.020]   Yeah, it's just a cute little, little fun thing for my only problem is I might mistake
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:38.540]   it for my actual Pokeball and then I'd be confused.
[01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:39.540]   And then try to play games.
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:41.140]   Try to play games with it.
[01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:42.140]   Yeah.
[01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:43.140]   Yeah.
[01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:45.340]   But you can really show off your Pokemon pride with this.
[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:46.340]   Nice.
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:47.340]   Oh, I'm mad.
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:48.340]   You're right, Andy.
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:50.340]   It is available free shipping, 69 bucks on Amazon.
[01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:51.340]   I'd get it tomorrow.
[01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:52.340]   Oh, well.
[01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:53.340]   Sorry about that.
[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:54.340]   Oh, well.
[01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:55.340]   Hong Kong post.
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:56.340]   Hong Kong post.
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:59.420]   I'm not going to be what?
[01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:01.380]   I'm.
[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:08.380]   So that's from, that's from Amazon AirPods silicone shockproof AirPods with Cara Beener
[01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:09.380]   case.
[01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:11.780]   They always have the longest names on Amazon.
[01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:12.780]   It's ridiculous.
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:13.780]   It's for us.
[01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:14.780]   You got to stop those keywords.
[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:15.780]   It's for SEO.
[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:16.780]   Yeah.
[01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:17.780]   Is that the girls teens AirPods?
[01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:20.180]   What boys teens AirPods can't have these?
[01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:22.380]   No, no, no boys allowed.
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:23.380]   Nope.
[01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:24.380]   No boys.
[01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:25.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:26.380]   There's two of these all over.
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:27.380]   There's Simba.
[01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:29.180]   If you're a Lion King, fine, you get Simba.
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:31.380]   I think a kid would love these.
[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:32.380]   Yeah.
[01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.140]   Really cute.
[01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:36.780]   Is that Squirtle?
[01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:37.780]   My God.
[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:38.780]   Squirtle.
[01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:39.780]   And the Gengar.
[01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:40.780]   Gengar and the.
[01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:46.180]   I would have Gengar because Gengar is great for gym defense.
[01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:47.180]   Yep.
[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:50.180]   Mr. Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:51.180]   Okay.
[01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:55.420]   So this is something I saw on Peter McKinnon's YouTube channel a little while ago and it's
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:33:00.700]   for a Canadian best spoke handcrafted leather goods maker.
[01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:05.420]   It's just a guy who sits there in his workshop every day and knocks out one piece at a time
[01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:06.620]   when the order comes in.
[01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:14.940]   He makes it and I immediately ordered this is the wallet clip that he has and he says
[01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:19.060]   there's a long lead time, although this came pretty quickly, but he also has YouTube videos
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:23.460]   up where he shows how he makes each and every one of these products.
[01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:25.980]   And there's in the latest ones, there's not even any audio.
[01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:27.180]   You just, we're not even talking.
[01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:29.380]   You just hear him making them.
[01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:30.580]   And I was in transit.
[01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:36.740]   I just watched video after video because it's such beautiful, beautiful craftsmanship.
[01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:42.140]   And I know that you can get titanium and all sorts of fancy wallets.
[01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:48.060]   And yeah, but this is just it's and again, it's it's one dude in Ontario knocking these
[01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:50.180]   things out one at a time.
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:54.500]   The way I imagine they've been made since the early days of Dungeons and Dragons.
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:57.420]   So I said, I said they had me immediately.
[01:33:57.420 --> 01:33:58.420]   I ordered them right away.
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:33:59.420]   I was happy.
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:04.180]   There's a wide they make iPod, I sorry, iPad covers as well.
[01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:06.300]   It's all just beautiful, beautiful stuff.
[01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:08.500]   Little king goods.
[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:09.500]   I see yours.
[01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:12.100]   Which ones did you get?
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:13.100]   I got this one.
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:14.580]   It has the wallet with a clip.
[01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:15.580]   Yeah.
[01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:16.580]   And again, it's got a clip on it.
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:17.580]   That's actually a good idea.
[01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:18.580]   I've been using it.
[01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:19.580]   Yeah.
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:22.580]   Something you can put your brand new apple card in.
[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:23.580]   Exactly.
[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:29.380]   But just one on all the different tools that they use and it's just so amazing.
[01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:30.380]   This is beautiful.
[01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:33.620]   I wonder if I can get this on Amazon.
[01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:34.620]   No.
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:35.620]   No, yeah.
[01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:40.340]   Can I suggest a little like just courtesy rule that anytime you're picking the week
[01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:43.980]   is going to be something that's individually handmade upon order, just give the rest of
[01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:46.260]   us a heads up before we live stream.
[01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:50.020]   It's going to be a long time.
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:52.740]   It's going to be a long, long time.
[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:57.460]   They do take Google pay and PayPal, but not the Apple pay.
[01:34:57.460 --> 01:34:58.460]   I'm sorry.
[01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:02.860]   But you're so this is this is exactly the sort of thing that I like spending extra money
[01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:06.940]   for because a wallet is just something that is every single morning.
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:10.700]   The first things I do is touch this thing and put it in the pocket, whatever pants I'm
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:11.700]   wearing.
[01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:16.740]   And so I like for that thing to be well made to show its age very, very well to be like
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:20.420]   one of those constant things that doesn't change each and every day.
[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:21.620]   I can sort of count on it.
[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:26.500]   And also knowing that it's is being handmade by someone who put a lot of thought into it,
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:28.700]   it just makes you feel pretty good, doesn't it?
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:31.020]   Yeah, it's mesmerizing watching him make this.
[01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:37.860]   So now it's going to be a race between this wallet and my Hong Kong posts flash.
[01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:41.300]   This is an expensive show for me.
[01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:44.700]   Little King Goods dot com.
[01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:45.700]   This really is sweet.
[01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:46.700]   That's really nice.
[01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:47.700]   Yeah.
[01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:48.700]   Oh, you can see I bought it.
[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:49.700]   Don't show that.
[01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:54.180]   I am such a sucker.
[01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:56.260]   You can see why I had to kill my Instagram account.
[01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:57.260]   I can't.
[01:35:57.260 --> 01:35:59.500]   I just like Mr. Impulse by your apple card.
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:04.900]   It's going to look so interesting to be all colors of the rainbow.
[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:07.140]   Ladies, gentlemen, you use Apple your apple card.
[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:08.140]   No, I couldn't.
[01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:09.820]   It wasn't neither one allowed me to use my apple card.
[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:15.060]   Sad to say I have still not used it.
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:17.260]   Huh?
[01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:20.420]   Buy it with my phone.
[01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:30.340]   It doesn't seem to work.
[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:31.340]   That concludes.
[01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:32.340]   Oh, I did.
[01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:35.180]   I should show this because this was a Renee recommendation that I bought a couple of
[01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:36.180]   weeks ago.
[01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:37.180]   This really is nice.
[01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:38.180]   All right.
[01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:41.980]   It's a two terabyte Samsung portable SSD Thunderbolt 3.
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:49.540]   Now it's pricey, but except when you think that this is a Thunderbolt 3 M dot 2 two terabyte
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:53.900]   drive for 800 bucks, that's a pretty good deal because usually Thunderbolt drives are
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:59.540]   very, very expensive comes with the Thunderbolt cable and I have to say, yes, it gets hot,
[01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:01.100]   but not I'm not unbearably.
[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:05.860]   It'd be a good pocket warmer after you go to a football game, make sure you copy a lot
[01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:10.180]   of data to it and then you have a nice pocket warmer.
[01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:11.860]   That's a good idea.
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:12.860]   Yeah, right.
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:14.260]   It's just the right size.
[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:16.300]   Anyway, thank you Renee for that one.
[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:19.940]   I'll show in about eight weeks with my wallet.
[01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:20.940]   Yes.
[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:23.580]   I will show you that.
[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:26.420]   Renee Ritchie, I'm one.com/vecta.
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:29.020]   He's going to run off, make a bunch of videos.
[01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:31.580]   Is there some great stuff I know.
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:32.580]   Always a pleasure Renee.
[01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:34.500]   Thank you for being here.
[01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:35.500]   Thank you so much.
[01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.020]   Anything else you wish to plug?
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:41.020]   No, I'm going to have the video version of that preview up tomorrow and then I'm doing
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:45.220]   a deeper dive into iOS 13 and all the new enterprise features because they have a whole
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:49.100]   new custom setup method for enterprise that I actually found interesting.
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:50.100]   All right.
[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:51.100]   Cool.
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:52.940]   Thank you Renee.
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:57.620]   Andy Inaco, he's at the public library.
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:38:00.420]   Every week with WBR, no.
[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:01.420]   You're with GBH.
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:02.420]   WBR.
[01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:05.940]   It's that other guy, Ben Brock Johnson, who's at WBR.
[01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:08.700]   WGBH in Boston at the Boston Public Library.
[01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:09.700]   What day this week?
[01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:12.060]   Looks like we're settling into regular Friday.
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:15.140]   It's Friday again this week at the Boston Public Library Studio.
[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:16.140]   So come in and watch.
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:18.860]   I think I'm going to be on at 11.30.
[01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:21.460]   Could be misremembering, but hey, it's a library.
[01:38:21.460 --> 01:38:22.460]   You'll find places to hang out.
[01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:23.460]   Get coffee, get a cookie.
[01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:25.420]   That sounds wonderful.
[01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:29.780]   Thank you Andrew and of course, the great Lori Gill, managing editor at Imore, Apple
[01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:32.020]   Holik on the Twitter.
[01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:37.460]   When are we going to see you performing with Sickburn?
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:40.140]   I think our next show is September 13th.
[01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:42.900]   So I have a couple of weeks off this time.
[01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:46.620]   We usually play more often, so it's kind of nice to have that break.
[01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:51.500]   We're recording though too, so even though I'm breaking from playing shows, I'm still
[01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:52.940]   always out there.
[01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:56.500]   She's in the studio all night long.
[01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:57.500]   Yeah.
[01:38:57.500 --> 01:38:58.820]   Thank you Lori.
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:00.580]   Thank you everyone for joining us.
[01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:03.340]   We do Mac Break Weekly on Tuesdays right after iOS today.
[01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:07.980]   Make it a Tuesday, Apple Day with this week in tech.

[01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:24.900]   That would be 2.100 UTC.
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:28.660]   Of course, I understand you've got a busy life, so why don't you get it on demand?
