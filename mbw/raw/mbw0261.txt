[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.360]   It's time for Macbreak Weekly, the show that covers
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.320]   Cupertino and that's all it's Byzantine operations.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.120]   Yes, it's we cover the Cupertino City Council.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.480]   We cover the Sheriff's race.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.000]   No, we don't.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   We cover Macintosh and ladies and gentlemen,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.960]   here he is, Mr. Macintosh all the way from his Macley
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.520]   lair in beautiful Massachusetts, Mr. Andy Inatko.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.600]   He's got meters, analog meters.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.080]   Exactly, because digital is evil.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.480]   Adventures nowhere in the Bible, anything digital.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.960]   However, analog tube amplifiers, as predicted in Leviticus,
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.440]   are the only true receivers.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.680]   God bless you, Andy Inatko.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.720]   You are so right.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.320]   Did you see, is this a coincidence or do you realize
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.320]   that we are now on tube amplification?
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.720]   I did not know that.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.600]   I have a 1961 AM Collins transmitter
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   in the back of the studio here.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.400]   I think I fired up.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.320]   How many months?
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.880]   I saw that.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.400]   Thank you.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.760]   Thank you for rescuing that cabinet from becoming,
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.120]   as it was destined to be, some sort of Halloween prop
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.400]   for some sort of, tell me your future.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.400]   You could.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.040]   You could, actually.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.040]   You could.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.560]   You could.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.360]   Zoltan could occupy that cabinet.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.200]   Actually, there's still plenty of room, even with the tubes,
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.240]   although Zoltan would have to be electroproof.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.240]   No, it actually is working, too, which is kind of cool,
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.320]   but it's on the AM bands.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.920]   It was a five kilowatt transmitter, never used for more than 500
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.360]   watts to answer your question.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.360]   By the way, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Lindsey,
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.880]   and asking the tough questions that Transmita is going
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.600]   to be part of our AM-HAM transmissions, not broadcast.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.280]   I've carried myself to get a license by the internet.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.000]   You got to.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.440]   You got to.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.480]   Because we're set up here.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.000]   Yes.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.960]   Although, I used to think HAMS are just a bunch of crotchety
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.880]   old farts complaining about broadband over power lines.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.880]   I thought that's a good idea.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.400]   We'll have broadband over power lines.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.180]   PG&E will be the internet service provider, our local or
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.880]   connet or wherever your local electric company is.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.720]   Now I'm joining them.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.200]   I'm one of them crotchety old HAMS.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.440]   I'm not crotchety old HAMS because there is so much noise
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.760]   on all of the high frequency bands in Petaluma.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.920]   And I'm thinking, we're starting to think that it's because
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.360]   they put those smart meters in here.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.720]   And the data from the smart meters
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.360]   gets where it goes down the power line.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.760]   It goes right into your hand.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.960]   And then right into my radio, absolutely.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.280]   Hey, but you didn't tune in for that.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.960]   You tuned in to find out what the heck is going on with Lion.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.120]   I was 10.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.040]   I-O-S.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.400]   All that stuff.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.480]   You know, actually a big story that didn't seem to perhaps
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.320]   tie into Apple in any way.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.160]   But the big story of the week, HP getting out of the PC
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.720]   business, perhaps, and in the process, killing WebOS.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.840]   Andy Enoco, you wrote an interesting article on this for
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.520]   the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.560]   You blame Apple.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.000]   Not so much blame them as credit them.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.880]   Because it would--
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.200]   And it's a fine difference, but I think you'll understand.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   Exactly.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.280]   If somebody's fighter jet gets to stamp an HP logo on the side
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.960]   of the cockpit window, it would be Apple's.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.280]   And not just because of, oh, well, the iPad, they couldn't
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.160]   compete with the iPad.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.880]   They tried to do it pad, but they couldn't do an iPad.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.680]   They called it pad.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.080]   But people saw it right through that little ruse.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.520]   But it was also the idea that HP has sort of realized that
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.040]   they can't make any money by trying to sell huge volumes of
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.680]   hardware at a very slim margin.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.320]   It's also an endorsement of Apple's basic idea, which is
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.080]   say we don't care that we only sell 8% of the PCs that are
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.840]   being shipped that are in the hands of people today.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.280]   What we care about is that we're going to make enough money
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.880]   on each one of them that we will have a big, big profit by
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.440]   the end of the year and that we can then go on and keep on
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.600]   doing cool things.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.600]   HP was, depending on which number you believe, the number
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.600]   one or the number two PC maker in the world, but they were
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.080]   making next to nothing on each one they sold.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.040]   And also they suffered because HP, which we used to be one of
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.360]   the gold standard manufacturers for desktops and notebooks,
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.760]   they just kept having to figure out, okay, how can we make
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.720]   the cases thinner?
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.040]   Can we make the keyboards a little cheaper?
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.800]   Do people really need a great display when a good display
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.600]   will do?
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.040]   And as a result, I'd get like an HP laptop in for evaluation.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.120]   And I think, okay, this is a very twisty bendy sort of thing
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.840]   for a notebook.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.240]   I don't know if that's what they were going for, but
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.680]   they're almost completely going out of the hardware business.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.360]   The new CEO is essentially a software services guy.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.880]   And all the biggest acquisitions they've been making the
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.400]   past two or three years outside of Palm have been companies
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.160]   that just sell services to digital data services to other
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.960]   companies.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.200]   So I think the sort of odd thing is that the first casualty
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.040]   of the post-PC revolution is that HP, the biggest acquisition
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.640]   maker is getting out of the PC business.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.200]   They're actually taking a step backwards to be sort of like
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.920]   what IBM was like before IBM started making PCs.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.600]   They don't care about consumer electronics anymore.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.640]   They want to be a big company that sells services to other
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.240]   big companies.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.320]   Interesting though, because when they started selling the
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.040]   touchpad for 100 bucks, they couldn't keep them in stock.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.480]   Someone on Twitter said, they have, they have, based on their
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.640]   success selling printers, their new idea is that sell the
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.080]   tablet for next to nothing and make all the money.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.080]   If we only needed ink to use the tablet would be set.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.080]   It really was a gold rush.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.400]   Basically all my Twitter traffic for two days was, okay,
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.080]   BestBuy.com has them and they're gone.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.080]   Okay, Staples has them and they're gone.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.680]   Okay, go to the local stores and they're gone.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.400]   HP was rumored to have made as many as one million of these
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.640]   and they say in fact that they will have more.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.080]   They're just, they're restocking them.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.840]   They're bringing them in from the warehouse.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.680]   So that's now to be a price point that actually works.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.680]   99 bucks works.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.080]   The price is $1 million.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.080]   It's a price point that actually works.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.080]   99 bucks works.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.080]   The problem is it costs $300 below cost is exactly what you
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.080]   want it to be.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.080]   It's estimated that the tear down cost of the touchpad is
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.080]   about 300 bucks.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.080]   So yeah, you're only losing 200 bucks each.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.080]   Well, I think that one of the, one of the things that happened
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.080]   to a lot of these manufacturers is that, you know, the, they
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.080]   have been selling these lower NPCs, the net books and so on
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.080]   and so forth, the people who are being cost conscious, but a lot
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.080]   of those people are not, are not doing things with them that
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.080]   they couldn't do with their iPad.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.080]   And so for that same price, that $500, $600, they're buying
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.080]   that instead and Apple's making its healthy margin.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.080]   And oh, by the way, if you, if you were the type of person that
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.080]   wants the nicer computer, Apple sells that too.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.080]   And I also saw a story that said HP had to sell seven computers
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.080]   for every one that Apple sold to make the same amount of money.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.080]   So they're margins, razor thin.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.080]   It's not a great business to be in, but you got to wonder if the
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.080]   number one manufacturer of PCs in the US can't make a business
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.080]   out of it.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.080]   I feel bad for Dell and Lenovo and all the other PC manufacturers.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.080]   It must be tough for them too.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.080]   Well, probably not so much.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.080]   It's not certainly a company like Lenovo, which are still
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.080]   pretty much known as if you want a really good notebook, one
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.080]   of the good PC.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.080]   So I bet they also pretty much stayed out of the basement
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.080]   level pricing place.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.080]   Really, because that is an excellent point because if you're
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.080]   spending $299, $399 on a PC and there are plenty of PCs like
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.080]   that, you're probably not the sort of heavy user who wants a big
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.080]   powerful processor.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.080]   You're not necessarily the person who spends eight, nine,
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.080]   ten hours a day on this machine.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.080]   You really are going to be using it for iPad like things.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.080]   And people are going into these big box stores now and seeing.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.080]   I can either have this, frankly, very flimsy, very cheap, hard
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.080]   to type on, hard to use, old looking PC, or I can have the
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.080]   hottest piece of personal electronics to hit the market in
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.080]   2009, 2010 and beyond.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.080]   It's the amazing Apple iPad, the magical device that solves all
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.080]   of your problems.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.080]   Okay.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.080]   Which one will you go for?
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.080]   Did you buy who buy?
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.080]   Anybody buy a touchpad?
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.080]   Anybody?
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.080]   When I saw them on Staples for $49, I almost bought two just to
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.080]   give them away as gifts.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.080]   It's tempting.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:18.080]   I still have, I still have, I was in the middle of writing about
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.080]   actually preparing to finish my review of the touchpad when the
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.080]   news hit.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.080]   So I still have one that I might decide to say, tell you what,
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.080]   I don't think you're going to want it back.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.080]   You're not going to want it back or they're going to say,
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.080]   I'm going to tell them, tell you what, you could either spend
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:36.080]   $23 or $25 to have FedEx ship this back to you, or I can just
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.080]   give you 99 bucks and keep it.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.080]   It costs them more to sell it.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.080]   I mean, they'd be exactly, they'd be happy.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.080]   You're not even going to keep the money that's going to cost them
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.080]   more just to take it back, refurbish it, put it back in the
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.080]   store for $100 now.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.080]   No.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.080]   It is.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.080]   100 bucks is a hell of a nice little thing.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.080]   Do you think so?
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.080]   Is it?
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.080]   I really think so.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.080]   Your review and Heather said it's too slow for the hardware is too
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.080]   slow for the operating system.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.080]   It's not exactly slim.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.080]   Well, okay, there are a couple factors there.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.080]   For one, HP made a lot of mistakes when they designed the OS
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.080]   for this.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.080]   It's hardwired to do a lot of data logging in case of crash
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.080]   recovery.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.080]   And so there are a couple tricks you can turn all that off and
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.080]   it's peps up a measurable.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.080]   Oh, that's good.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.080]   But also when you talk about for 99 bucks, forget about the idea
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.080]   that there's any, you're ever going to get any apps for this
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.080]   whatsoever.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.080]   So if you have a good, good male client, you have an excellent
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.080]   web browser that works with Hulu.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.080]   It works with all the streaming video sites and display any
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.080]   site you want.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.080]   You also have the Kindle app, which is in beta, but works
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.080]   perfectly fine.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.080]   So if you just simply said 99 bucks for a mobile web browser
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.080]   and media, video, photo, music player that'll last for 10 hours
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.080]   on battery, plus it's a color Kindle with a 10 inch screen.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.080]   Boy, you'd buy two at that price.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.080]   I just bought a Sony dash.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.080]   Sony makes something called a dash.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.080]   I don't know if that was on Woot.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.080]   That's their, that's their, um, who's a total failure?
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.080]   No, I remember the dash.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.080]   Actually, I would like to have a dash.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.080]   How much was that on Woot?
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.080]   69 dollars.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.080]   Yes, see, that's a good deal.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.080]   So it's a chubby.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:09.080]   It's a big chubby and, and I got it literally because it's got
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.080]   Netflix.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.080]   I'm going to attach it.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.080]   I'm literally going to permanently attach it to my exercise
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.080]   bike.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.080]   You know, just kind of like that's all I know.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.080]   I don't need it to do anything else.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.080]   And I was like, I don't want to put my iPad there.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.080]   You know, I don't want to have, you know, I want to, you know,
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.080]   it's too expensive.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.080]   But there is a price point that I think that even people who
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.080]   already have iPads like me, um, uh, you know, you'll buy something
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.080]   cheaper just because you want to permanently install a screen.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.080]   I think that's the one thing about tablets is you get, oh, it's
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.080]   really nice to just have a touch screen that I can, you know,
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.080]   grab some information.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.080]   The chubby was totally worthless.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.080]   That little round thing.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.080]   They did improve the screen later, but you're right.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.080]   I bought a chubby and were deeply regretted.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.080]   And this is, this was 69 dollars.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.080]   You got a bigger screen.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.080]   Netflix.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.080]   You have a lot of little fun little things.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.080]   It was interesting.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.080]   I think it was a, you know, fancy desk clock or alarm clock.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.080]   It makes a lot of sense.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.080]   And, and, and if the iPad had not come out, I would have, uh, it's
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.080]   a little, it's a wedge shape as you, as you just saw if you're
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.080]   watching the video, which means it's not exactly.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.080]   Sin.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.080]   I'm not going to put, I'm not going to carry it around.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.080]   Sin and light.
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.080]   When I bought it, I didn't expect it to be quite so wide.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.080]   I, I looked at it.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.080]   I only saw the front and I was like, oh, it's just like an iPad,
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.080]   but smaller and cheaper.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.080]   And then I got it and I was like, wow, this is a lot bigger and
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.080]   heavier than I expected.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.080]   And I opened the box and I was like, oh, wow.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.080]   Okay.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.080]   But it works.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.080]   That's why it's so good for your application.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.080]   So that price you can buy to one to actually watch Netflix
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.080]   in the front of the bike.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.080]   You can use the other one to chuck the wheels when in case it slips
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.080]   off the frame.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.080]   It's actually perfect for that.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:32.080]   Actually, that does segue into the rumors now on iOS.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.080]   We are hearing a number of rumors about an iPhone.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:40.080]   Uh, and the latest anti rumor rumor was the, oh yeah, that rumor
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.080]   about a new iPad coming out this year.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.080]   No, no, it's not going to, I guess it wasn't.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.080]   That's not a, that, oh, but it turns out it will come out next
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.080]   year.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.080]   Well, there's an, and, and this rumor I like and I think even has
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.080]   some credibility that it will have a, a retina display.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.080]   Uh, I was sure like a, with what was it, a 20, a 2400 by 1500
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.080]   something like that display.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.080]   I could certainly see that happening.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.080]   My, my, it makes sense.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.080]   It makes absolute sense.
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.080]   Also, they have all that HD content with the iTunes store.
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.080]   So they're probably want to start selling devices that can,
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.080]   the mobile devices, they'll show stuff in HD.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.080]   My only problem with all these rumors earlier were the idea that
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:19.080]   they would just drop it on the market the same year as the iPad
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.080]   to without giving developers any advance notice that a device,
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.080]   the retina display is coming.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.080]   Yeah, you were right.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.080]   I can certainly believe this stuff.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.080]   This makes a lot more sense.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.080]   The challenge I think for developers is dealing with, I mean,
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.080]   that's a lot of real estate, you know, to, and when you look at
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.080]   the actual pixel, I mean, if it's just doubling and it's one thing,
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.080]   but also fragments now, even further.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.080]   Right.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.080]   The, uh, what do you develop the iOS space?
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.080]   You're developing for a retina display, developing it for old iPad
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.080]   and you're going for an iPhone, you're going to be like,
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.080]   "I'm going to be like a iPhone without a retina."
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.080]   You got, you know, four big screen resolutions.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.080]   It's starting to look a little like Android, actually.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.080]   All right.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.080]   Exactly.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.080]   Exactly right.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.080]   The fear would be that it would be like Android where developers
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.080]   would certainly start saying, "Well, we just put more crap on the screen
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.080]   instead of streamlining the interface."
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.080]   Right.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.080]   So it really depends on what sort of message that Apple sends to developers.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.080]   It's possible that they're just going to simply say,
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.080]   "We don't really want you to start using tool palettes.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.080]   We don't want you to put 30 buttons on every screen.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.080]   What we want is every single time you put a button on there,
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.080]   it looks gorgeous."
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.080]   And every piece of text is going to look magazine quality.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.080]   And if people thought that was a really cool thing on the time of the
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.080]   little iPhone display, imagine how cool that's going to be
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.080]   when they have something almost the size of a sheet of paper
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.080]   that can be a real magazine display.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.080]   I mean, I think that at that resolution on an iPad,
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.080]   it's going to be very hard.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.080]   The one, the last set of books that I still buy are picture-vianos.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.080]   Oh, yeah, no kidding.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.080]   But that kind of resolution on an iPad and that's...
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.080]   Oh, gorgeous.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.080]   If I could carry around all those books, I don't think I'd be really
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.080]   buying anymore.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.080]   A number of journalists, tech journalists got briefings from Facebook
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.080]   last week about big changes in privacy.
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.080]   The embargo was lifted about 28 minutes ago.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.080]   We'll talk about that.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.080]   In fact, Tom, if you want to cover it from the newsroom,
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.080]   I don't know if you're working on it now or not.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.080]   We can go to you.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.080]   We're going to take a break right now.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.080]   We'll also come back.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.080]   I do want to continue with those rumors on the iPhone.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.080]   Some conflicting rumors there about LTE and more.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.080]   And some very good news.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.080]   But both good and bad news for Michael Roberts,
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.080]   who's one of our guests on the triangulation a little while ago.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:21.080]   Michael Roberts created a little MP3 upload site that he's in
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.080]   and personal trouble for, but the good news for him and for
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.080]   Apple, Amazon and others from the judge.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.080]   We'll talk about that.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.080]   But first, I want to talk a little bit about our friends at SmileSoft.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.080]   They do such great stuff.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.080]   We've talked about Text Expander, which is my absolute favorite.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.080]   A must have on every Macintosh.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.080]   And smile software.com/macbreak.
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:47.080]   If you go there right now, you're going to see PDF Pen and PDF Pro.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.080]   This is a time of year where I'm filling out a lot of forms for my son,
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.080]   for school, for sports, for all that stuff.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.080]   And of course, nowadays I'm happy.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.080]   They don't no longer come in Word documents.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.080]   They come as PDFs.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.080]   But PDFs a little bit harder to edit.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   And that's where PDF Pen and PDF Pro are just fantastic.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.080]   You open your PDFs, by the way, you can try it free for 30 days at
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.080]   smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:17.080]   You open the PDF with it and you can add text, images.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.080]   You can paste in signatures.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.080]   You can make corrections.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.080]   You can fill out PDF forms.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.080]   You can merge, delete, reorder pages.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.080]   You can even redact information.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.080]   So if there's something in there in that PDF you don't want to share,
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.080]   this is such a great program.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:37.080]   I keep my signatures and my initials and my PDF Pen software.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:42.080]   And that way I can always pay my signatures a little better than John Smith there.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.080]   I really, I really, really like this.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.080]   You know, I actually have Acrobat, but I still would prefer so much better.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.080]   It's just so much cleaner, so much faster.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.080]   I just love it.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.080]   Oh, I got a lot of update.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, I always like when there's an update.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.080]   5.4.1, big update there.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.080]   That's probably the line update.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.080]   And this is all in the App Store too.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.080]   It is.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.080]   And I'll tell you what, Smile loves it if you buy it in the App Store,
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.080]   but if you want the 30-day trial, Apple does not allow that.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:10.080]   So you have to go to smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.080]   And as always, I love our advertisers to give you free trials,
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.080]   because what better way to get an idea of what software will do for you
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.080]   than try it for yourself?
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.080]   I got to warn you, you're going to be hooked.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:27.080]   One of the things PDF Pen Pro does is you convert websites into multi-page PDFs.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:30.080]   You can create PDF forms that are cross-platform.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.080]   Windows and Mac.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:36.080]   You could do all sorts of cool stuff with PDF Pen and PDF Pen Pro.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:41.080]   60 bucks for the PDF Pen 99.95 for PDF Pen Pro.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:45.080]   You decide which one is right for you, but you could try them both free right now.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.080]   smilesoftware.com/macbreak
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.080]   and a hearty hello and a smile for Gene and everybody at Smile Software.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.080]   We love them and we're so glad that you support the Macbreak show.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.080]   They're nice people.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.080]   It's one of the things I like about Mac developers.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.080]   They tend to be nicer.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.080]   Maybe they're not so angry.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.080]   I think that if you survive in the Mac platform, maybe that's it.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.080]   Maybe you tend to be particular.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.080]   It's more of a high touch industry too.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.080]   You kind of know your customers better.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.080]   You're involved with them and everything.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.080]   So let's talk about the iOS 5 rumors.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.080]   Now the latest, and Andy, I bet you have some input on this.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.080]   Alex, I don't know if you've got your ear to the ground too,
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:28.080]   but the latest is there will be a cheap, relatively cheap, maybe 99 buck,
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:33.080]   maybe 50 buck iPhone 4S that'll have 8 gigs of RAM.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.080]   It sounds like in plastic pieces.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.080]   And cheaper.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:45.080]   And then a fancier one, the iPhone 5, which will be a true world phone because it will have both CDMA and GSM chipsets.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.080]   It'll have all the frequencies.
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.080]   It'll be the phone you'll want if you're a traveler because you can go anywhere.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.080]   Right.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.080]   And it'll be sold at both of Verizon and AT&T.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.080]   Does that anybody, any thoughts about that?
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.080]   Andy, is that kind of jibe with what you're hearing?
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.080]   I definitely believe that this is going to be a refresh to the iPhone 4.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.080]   I keep going back and forth on whether or not I believe there's going to be an iPhone 5 this year.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:11.080]   Because they could save it for June and then be back on track.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:20.080]   And I'll see a lot of what I'm hearing about the idea of an iPhone 5 is simply the concept that as silly as the sounds they know.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:28.080]   That it's a very, very big deal to say iPhone 5 as opposed to let's put another letter after iPhone 4.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:37.080]   And that they would almost want to make sure they have a new case design and make sure that this iPhone 5 does something the iPhone 4 does not do.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.080]   And we're not talking about oh, it's a faster processor.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.080]   Oh, it's an 8 gigabyte camera.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.080]   Oh, it's a dual band with international.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:50.080]   We're talking about some new feature that makes it even better at what brings brain new things to the table.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.080]   The iPhone 4 doesn't do so.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.080]   But unfortunately, we get back to the idea that I just don't know about the iPhone 5.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:03.080]   I would be shocked if we didn't see an iPhone 4 that would be unprecedented and also maybe even a seriously bad move for Apple.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:13.080]   The fact that they didn't release anything in June implies that whatever they're going to be telling us about the refreshed iPhone that's coming out in September and October.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:22.080]   It's something that people can only really appreciate once iCloud is not only been announced but also was up and running.
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.080]   Right.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.080]   Andy's cutting in a little bit on his Skype.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.080]   Oh, there it goes.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.080]   Looks like we lost him.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.080]   So we'll call him Andy right back.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:36.080]   I actually think that the plastic one said plastic components, a plastic back possibly plastic front face.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.080]   I was like, I kind of want to make a phone at a glass.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.080]   My son has gone through four or five of them.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.080]   I was like, I don't know. That's not making cheaper. I would really prefer the back to be plastic.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.080]   Most phones are either metal or plastic.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.080]   I don't know.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   Apple is the only phone that I know that has not only a glass front.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.080]   You have to do that for the touch screen.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.080]   But a glass back.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.080]   I mean, what is that?
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.080]   I mean, probably 10 or 15% of the people that I know that have them smashed.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.080]   The back has been smashed.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.080]   And so I would love to have a plastic back.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.080]   It could look the same now.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.080]   Here's, okay.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.080]   So the speculation is that a iPhone, first of all, by the way,
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:13.080]   and I should mention this, that Cara Swisher was adamant last week on Twit.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.080]   She's with all things D.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.080]   Her sources are the right sources.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.080]   It's October. It's October. It's October, she said.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.080]   Of course, we've seen rumors that it could be as early as September 7th.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.080]   Apple's going to have an event September 7th.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:27.080]   And now people like Peter Rojas was on Twit this past week, the gadget guy.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:31.080]   He said, late September early October.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.080]   He said it's bad.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.080]   It'll be either September or October, but late September early October.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.080]   So we may not find out.
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:42.080]   I think an iPhone 4S, if they do this incremental update, at least do this,
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.080]   will have no more than perhaps an A5 processor.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.080]   That's the processor that's in the iPad 2, the dual-core processor.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.080]   We do think, we do hear all those rumors that it's an 8 megapixel camera.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.080]   I believe that.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.080]   I don't think there's urgency to go to 8 megapixels.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:59.080]   I mean, the rumors are though, they're looking at making something like 50 million.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.080]   I mean, like, just incredible.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.080]   Of the next one.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.080]   Now, let's see, that's what they're saying.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.080]   It's 25 million of the, again, I guess it's who you listen to.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.080]   This is all BS, right?
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.080]   It's all made up.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.080]   It's all made up.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:13.080]   But the rumors are that they're going to have 25 million iPhone 5s.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:20.080]   The big question I think you want to ask over and over again is, will we have 4G in any of these iPhones?
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:28.080]   Now, the Boy Genius report last week claimed that Apple had been testing a 4G LTE-enabled iPhone.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.080]   And they pointed to an internal iOS test build at one of Apple's mobile partners that had a P-list file in it for L.T.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.080]   E.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:48.080]   And now, Arthur Kim at MacRumors is saying we've since discovered the same LTE-P list in at least the last couple of developer builds of iOS 5.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.080]   So, it says LTE.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:55.080]   You could see connected mode LTE, intra-frequency measurement.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.080]   But that doesn't necessarily mean the hardware will support it.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.080]   It would only be prudent to put this into iOS at some point.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.080]   I think it does.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.080]   I think Apple tends to be behind on these things.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.080]   They tend to let the market mature.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.080]   Remember the iPhone had three iteration.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.080]   I mean, the first iteration wasn't even 3G.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.080]   It was 2G.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.080]   And it was out there.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:15.080]   So, I think that Apple's track record is that they're going to wait for it to be much more.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.080]   Although Verizon's beating the drum, they said we're in 15 more markets.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.080]   I know, I mean, I just upgraded my mind-fying.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.080]   Makes a difference.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.080]   Do we have 4G here? No, San Francisco does that.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.080]   Yesterday, I went and picked it up and I was like, "Okay, speed test."
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.080]   It's a big...
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.080]   17 down 12 up.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.080]   I was like, "Okay, some of that's because nobody else has it."
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.080]   I like that.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.080]   I think that 4G is a really bad idea.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.080]   I don't think anyone should actually go out and use it.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.080]   I think you really want to.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.080]   Yeah, don't do...
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.080]   Yo, terrible.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.080]   Don't buy it.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.080]   What do you think, Eddie?
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.080]   4G?
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.080]   I really don't know.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.080]   Well, the problem is this...
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.080]   Well, I know you don't know.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.080]   Nobody knows.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.080]   I'm just turning off acknowledging my ignorance.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.080]   We are all ignorant.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.080]   I'll...
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.080]   I'll...
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.080]   I'll...
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.080]   I'll...
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.080]   I'll...
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.080]   Put on like this.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.080]   His ignorance ever stopped a pundit.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.080]   Exactly.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.080]   I'm a different kind of pundit.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.080]   I am the hum...
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.080]   Shame on you.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.080]   Shame.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.080]   I'll...
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.080]   I'm saying that there are two or three variables with 4G.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:12.080]   Apple's track record has always been that they're not afraid to be the last to market with a certain feature.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.080]   If it means that they're not happy with how that...
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.080]   they'd be able to implement that feature on this day.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.080]   And right now 4G is a...
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.080]   There's a...
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:26.080]   There's a three syllable word starting with the word cluster that I like to do as a spoonerism,
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.080]   but I would probably screw it up and then we get the explicit tag.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.080]   But that is exactly the same way...
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:37.760]   A fluster luck a cluster luck. A fluster luck again. See you got a cluster clock a colla a faster clock
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:43.240]   It is a complete fuster clock well, it's not only that it's a battery hog or a hattery bog
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:49.700]   Exactly, yes, it's I traveled when I when I had like my big international goodwill tour earlier this year
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:56.720]   I had three different forg phones from but I think three different carriers and which one actually would produce a
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.640]   4g signal was kind of a crapshoot Verizon was the best of the three
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.560]   But you can never count on getting 4g even in major major cities and the second thing is that you do have to spend three or four days
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:13.920]   Learning how to manage the 4g radio if you want to be able to actually have a living thing pulled out of your pocket as opposed to just a pretty
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.860]   Honko
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:21.120]   Plasking class is rumored to be hiring more LTE engineers though. They're putting it into that's not a rumor. That's a that's job posting
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:26.640]   And that's that's true too. But also points to the fact that apples in an unusual position
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:32.400]   Where samsung and htc and these other manufacturers they can produce
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.240]   Essentially two different versions of the exact same phone
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:44.240]   Label differently in with minute changes so that atnt and verizon for instance have different versions and different names of the same phone
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:51.120]   Whereas apple will only have the iPhone and so if they decide to make a 4g enabled version of the iPhone and
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.160]   atnt and verizon both get at the same time
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.800]   Suddenly we have one phone that's kind of the crappy version of the iPhone and one iPhone
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:04.240]   That's actually the really good iPhone and it's all going to be based on which of these networks can actually deliver 4g coverage
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:11.840]   So it's possible that they're going to wait until there's a more consistency between their two major carriers before they're going to roll out 4g
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.920]   And really commit their brand to 4g or lt 4g LTE
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.880]   I'd like to see this feature. This is an iOS 5
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:26.560]   I think this is really cool in japan iOS 5 turns japanese phones into earthquake alarms a story from engagit mobile
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:32.240]   apple has put this into there have been apps to do this, but this is in iOS 5
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.280]   And they have an alarm system
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.200]   National alarm system for tsunamis earthquakes and so forth
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.080]   And iOS 5 is going to have this built into the notification center settings pane
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.760]   you could turn it off with that little button there and
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.920]   What will happen is your phone will not give you a tsunami alert
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:58.080]   The tsunami alert makes sense the earthquake player we know i'm kind of like well you already know it's mostly tsunami
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.880]   I find that
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:06.080]   In in california my mirror is a pretty good earth cooler. Yeah, the cup of coffee. Yeah. Yeah exactly exactly
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:09.520]   I don't think I need my iPhone. I don't need electronics for that. I analog component
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.720]   I think that's so cool though. It is it's an and it's I think it's tsunami
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.880]   Well, I was driving there was an amber alert
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.040]   Right they put that up on this on the highways
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.680]   I was like, you know, they should they should just install an amber alert, you know onto I mean there's a lot of people doing it
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.640]   But that's it. That's the kind of thing you want. How much extra would you pay
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.760]   For an amber alert. Yeah, I mean don't somebody's guess absorb the cost of that
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:34.960]   I don't actually want for the app. I don't want my app. Oh, it's an app you make it an app
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.720]   It's running in the background that pops up. Yeah, you're a pair of small children. I don't want to know
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.840]   That's what the police are for. I want to know
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:49.200]   Yeah, what are you gonna run out and look for that white? Hey, I'm from tan chevy. I know you
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.920]   I'm a country. I'm a country. I'm not for that guy
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.720]   Why is all someone on amber alert? I wouldn't call the police
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:01.040]   Drive over and say hello boy. I wouldn't say hello. We're gonna come uh and just to back we're taking a break come back
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:05.680]   Just a bit. We're gonna go to tom marrot in the newsroom and get the latest there is a big privacy announcement from facebook
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.320]   I think a very interesting privacy announcement from facebook
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:12.880]   Uh in fact the most sweeping privacy announcement they've ever made before we do that though
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.880]   Let's talk a little bit about hover
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.280]   Dot com if you are looking for somewhere to register to domain in the main name
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.280]   You know square spaces as sponsor
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:27.040]   We tell we tell people that you know if you're gonna go square space you want to get that domain name that custom domain name
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:32.080]   You start with it hover. I'm done. That's I have I am sold done over
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:36.640]   I I got to the end of buying my first one a couple months ago and I was like, am I done?
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:41.520]   Yeah, is that it? I came to the right clicks. Yeah, you get that other site you 50 clicks
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.880]   And you still you know, they're still trying to sell you something one of the things I like now
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.000]   Is that they build they know that you're gonna want
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.840]   Um
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.920]   Domain privacy right in the who is database. You don't want your home address and phone number in there
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:29:00.240]   So that's built in that you don't even pay extra for that. So that's one less click. Oops. I mean I I take the wrong address here
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:05.920]   Let me go in there macbreak dot hover dot com here it is. So here's what you do you go to hover dot com
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.880]   This is the the domain register we use and recommend
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.680]   Mac break dot hover dot com
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:12.960]   Uh
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.280]   You can get a new domain name
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.320]   Let's see what would be a good domain name name
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.520]   frosty
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.360]   luster
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.160]   Clucks dot com. I bet you nobody has that
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.400]   What do you bet?
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.200]   Let's just search for there and you so if

[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:41.440]   The other thing I like about hover is if you've got an existing domain and you may want to transfer this over
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:45.920]   In fact, I transferred all my domains over I wish I had used their domain transfer concierge
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.880]   service
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:51.440]   I was being cheapest 25 bucks for all your sites and they do all the transfers
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:56.240]   I wish frankly I had done this now for listeners to our show our viewers of our show
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:02.480]   It's absolutely free just mention call the phone number 86731 656.56. It's on the website just mention
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:09.120]   That you want to take advantage of this and they'll do it for you for free the transfer costs $10 per domain
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:15.120]   For everything but dot co $10 per domain and you get another year so you're getting like this great bargain
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.640]   That's great
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:21.920]   They they they watch is a customer. I want you to try it. I think you'll be glad it is really fantastic
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:27.840]   And if you need a new dot com domain you can get it from hover dot com for only 15 bucks
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:34.720]   Including domain privacy by going to macbreak dot hover dot com. Yeah, it looks more expensive when you start
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.800]   But then after you realize you're getting the domain. Yeah, I mean there you're not those not all these add-ons
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.960]   It's great for email if you if you want to an email address that never changes
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:48.240]   That's what I recommend you could point that email to gmail or hotmail or whatever you want to use
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.400]   But you have a custom domain with your name frosty luster clock in it
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.960]   and
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.720]   I wish that were my name. Hi Leo frosty luster clock. Good to meet you
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.440]   uh
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.800]   Macbreak dot hover dot com use the hover
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.080]   Uh the offer code macbreak at the end when you check out
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:12.800]   I think we've got the the wrong lower third on there for the for the offer because it is now that
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.360]   $15 dot com
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.520]   with uh
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:22.960]   With the show code macbreak give it a try and the free concierge service too, which is really nice
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:28.400]   All right, let's head over to tom marad. He is in the uh tnt newsroom. You know we have a daily news show every uh
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:34.880]   Every weekday monday through friday, uh 230 pm pacific 530 eastern tom marad i has act our sarah lane covering the tech news
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:40.160]   And the big story that they're covering just broke at uh when we went on the air and i'm actually very curious
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.400]   Facebook has changed its privacy policies dramatically tom
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:50.080]   What's the story? We don't know if there's a link between the change in the privacy policy and the 5.9 earthquake
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:56.640]   Cover either or both. We do know we do know what facebook's doing uh to change
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.080]   Not their privacy policy, but the way that you control stuff
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.920]   So one of the big things that's getting attention is
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:08.960]   Inline profile controls when you start to share something on facebook you'll get a dropdown menu that says i want to make this public
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.880]   They're actually changing the name everyone to public or friends of friends or friends
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.760]   You'll also be able to add in your own customized groups in there
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:22.000]   Photo tag review so if someone tags you in a photo you get to approve that tag before it gets added
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.920]   That's huge because before it gets put up on the internet for everyone else to see
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.480]   That's a big deal because people were just tagging you
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:33.920]   You know my bathing suit pictures were showing up and i don't have any control over and i apologize for that
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.360]   Yeah
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.360]   Screw you marad
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:44.320]   Uh content tag review you have the option to review and approve or reject any tag someone tries to add to your photos and posts
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:49.040]   So it's kind of the same thing as the profile thing in reverse. Somebody says hey, that's darth vader
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.040]   You know that's not darth vader
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:55.520]   You can view your profile the way others see it there's going to be a little dropdown menu that says
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.560]   Uh, let me see it the way everyone sees it. Let me or public
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:03.680]   That great the way, you know so that i can see what's actually being shared very easily
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.440]   Uh, this rolls out to a 1 percent of users starting thursday
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.960]   Uh, and then it'll keep rolling out from then on so if you don't see it right away
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:18.720]   That's why this seems like a response to google plus because it's almost exactly the kind of granularity you have every time you share with google plus
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:22.640]   Yeah, they say they they have dressed that head on they're like we've been working on this for six months
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:27.520]   We wish we could throw stuff together fast enough that this would be a response to google plus things
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:34.000]   Just don't move that fast right the same token the way they're presenting it very much is aimed at saying hey
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.560]   You know that thing the other people do we do that now too right
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:42.240]   Thank you, tom marrot tnt coming up to 30 this afternoon and i'm sure they'll be covering that in all the tech news
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:45.760]   Uh here at live dot twit dot tv
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.560]   big court decision
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.720]   Michael roberts
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:55.440]   You remember michael roberts he was the guy who did mp3.com and that was a site
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:58.480]   That screwed us all
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:03.200]   It's his all fine until then it was all fine until then mp3.com
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.000]   The idea was you upload you all your music
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.360]   Um and it would keep one copy
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:15.840]   For and so all you had to do is show you own this song you wouldn't have to upload it even
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:19.040]   I said I use the wrong word you put your cd and it would look at the cd said yeah
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.120]   I got that it's in your library now
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:25.040]   So it was a cloud music service much like amazon's much like icloud hopes to be
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.560]   Uh much like um google's music hopes to be
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.600]   But you didn't have to upload anything you just would put your cd's in it would very quickly say yeah
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.600]   We got that we got that we got that and now you've got it
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:39.360]   Uh they got sued out of business. This was some years ago
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.120]   Setting precedent setting a huge precedent nobody could do this
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.480]   Well, he created a new michael just doesn't take no for an answer
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:51.280]   Last year he created a new service called mp3 tunes same idea
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:55.040]   And a judge has ruled just ruled this week
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:02.800]   That uh, it does not violate copyright laws to keep a single copy of an mp3 on servers
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:08.320]   It is within the the realm of the digital millennium copyright act. It's okay
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.920]   When it's very restrictive though. I mean it's it is a bit-for-bit
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:17.760]   Uh has to be exact exact. I mean it cannot be I have uh stairway to heaven on on uh
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.080]   I have the live version and you have the the no
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.040]   Or you you bought the one on amazon and I bought and I and I ripped mine
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.360]   I if I ripped mine and there's and it
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.480]   Doesn't much
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.440]   In fact ripping is going to be an issue because when you rip it is always a little bit different
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.120]   You know depending on the encoder and stuff
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:35.280]   It will really be most valuable for for digital copies that you purchase on amazon
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.840]   iTunes the the big services or digital copies of people have downloaded that are popular
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.680]   Bit torrent if everybody has that bit torrent version the most popular now
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:47.920]   I didn't help poor michael is it still on the hook for stuff he personally uploaded
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.560]   Of all things
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.560]   Um, but this is this is very big
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.480]   The ruling makes it clear if mp3 tunes scanned a customer's music collection and found stairway to heaven
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.560]   Ripped from a cd with a slightly different file size that isn't the same
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.000]   That's not the master copy
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.760]   But I don't know if you remember when google announced its google music at google.io this year
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:10.080]   They showed a little box that you would wave with near field communications
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.960]   I guess or something that you would wave a cd at and would say I got that
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.280]   And then it would be in your cloud
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.920]   That's the kind of service that they could conceivably implement
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:23.680]   Now that that was a magic show sort of it was wasn't it where it basically if you have a there
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:32.320]   This this feature relies on google convincing the entire recording industry to make sure that every single commercial cd is chipped
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:39.200]   Uh, so that you and that every single computer that wants to use this feature has an rfid near field communications
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.440]   Receiver and can make that work
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:45.840]   So that's not that they're they're features that in these keynotes there are features that are they're actually shipping
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:49.520]   Then there's features that oh wouldn't it be can you imagine the year 2000?
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:54.720]   Will be able to access this way, but that's not the way it worked, but it's interesting to use for apple though
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.920]   Isn't it well kind well not really because apple was on a different playing field
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:05.280]   This is huge for amazon. It's huge huge for google because uh, there are two different things that this ruling emphatically upheld
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:08.080]   Which is that if you have a cloud service
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:11.040]   That if you have a cloud service
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:19.440]   It's perfectly okay for you to have software inside that cloud service that allows people to play back and stream music that they themselves have uploaded
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:27.360]   Uh, that does not so that's exactly what uh, uh, google music does. That's exactly so scroof shark is a big winner here and uh, uh,
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.920]   uh, turntable.fm
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.200]   Uh, amazon is drop box all these services that allow you to stream box
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:38.720]   The other thing that they that it demonstrated is that they that these services also fall under the same
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:45.280]   In-perpeture as uh as google does with youtube where you cannot uh, the recording industry cannot go after
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:51.120]   Amazon because if if someone uploads illegal content to amazon and streams it through that server
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:55.920]   They're not responsible for police and the content that other people that excuse me that their users post
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:01.680]   Their only limit their only obligation is that if the ria says that gern blanston has the white album
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:08.080]   He didn't pay for it. It's amazon's responsibility to take down that copy of the white album that that gern blanston uploaded
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.200]   Thank god
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:15.520]   But apple but the the thing that's being misconstrued a little bit in some of the commentary i've been reading is that it does not say that
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.240]   Amazon for instance does not need to excuse me that uh, that
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:24.000]   Just because somebody says they have tells the service
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.080]   Hey have a copy of the white album that does not mean that the service now has the ability to
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.920]   Essentially say no need upload it will give you a copy of the white album available for streaming
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:39.360]   Uh, but the services like amazon that component where you can I can simply upload my own music into the cloud player and stream it perfectly good
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:43.920]   Apple's not affected because remember that they're the company that decided to say you know what we're not even gonna
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:47.840]   We're not gonna experiment with this we're gonna cut deals with all these broadcasts
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.240]   Right they have a license to make sure that we have licenses for it
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.320]   So so in a way actually apple
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.720]   Prematurely paid for this
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:40:00.720]   Well, not necessarily they they know they've got this feature locked up right uh amazon has this feature because they're amazon
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:04.800]   They have billions of dollars. They feel as though not not only did they run it past their own lawyers
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.200]   But they basically feel as though if it came to a lawsuit
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:13.360]   They wouldn't they would have no problems in the and keeping this going and remember that they're their their music locker feature
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:18.000]   Only applies to music that people have purchased from amazon mp3
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.040]   They're just saving the use of the trouble of downloading an mp3
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.280]   And then re-uploading it back to the server. We should point out that michael robertson
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:30.480]   mp3 tunes was his thing, but he does currently work for google because google bought one of his other companies
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:35.840]   So in a way google's the one that uh could very well have have funded this fight
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.880]   Uh, it also says according to wired
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:46.320]   side loading is legal so if you go to a music blog or you find a song
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.440]   On another site that you don't have on your hard drive
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:54.320]   You still can say I want this in my cloud locker. I'm not sure how that would
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:41:01.280]   Work, but they said it's legal as long as the company removes the links and all songs added to lockers via that link when a copyright
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.040]   Holder tells the site the link is infringing
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:08.000]   So and it really the burden is on the copyright holder to say oh no no no that side loader
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:12.800]   Wasn't a legitimate side loader, but this one maybe is that that's that's classic dc ma
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.400]   Yeah, uh, essentially I was I had to reread that section too
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.800]   I think it seems to apply to if you have a feature that says
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:23.200]   On your on your cloud service that says instead of having to actually upload it
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:29.680]   Give me the url of the file that you want moved into and it will actually copy that file from the source to the destination
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:37.600]   They seem to be saying that this is no different than the user uploading the file directly from their local storage into the cloud
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:42.800]   They still have the same obligations where if someone's if if someone is taking taking
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:49.920]   A software from a from a torrent site. You can't add a feature to amazon cloud player that's a built-in bit torrent client
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.400]   Uh because that's kind of not going to fly
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:57.120]   So does it mean that you have to upload the song still or no?
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:03.760]   I I took I maybe I misread this I took it to mean you could merely verify that you owned it and it would be sufficient
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.600]   That's not the case
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.360]   Um, I don't think that is that you is that the company once you upload it
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:13.280]   Doesn't have to keep multiple copies if they can show that say that these are bit identical
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.720]   They only have to keep one. This was the problem with dropbox dropbox had
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.720]   Been doing this
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:23.120]   They've been saying oh yeah, it's the same song as this so we're only gonna store one copy so we don't overload our servers
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:26.320]   And that's that's that was that was specifically ruled against
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:30.960]   Uh for the reasons that you mentioned earlier where I can't simply say hey, I've got this 56k
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:36.560]   Uh from from from 1997 you can't replace it with a 256 k ac
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:43.680]   For streaming purposes you have to it's it's the basic principle is that if I the user take a file that I own
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:48.960]   Or that I own or have or have control of and upload it into a into a company's cloud service
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:53.840]   That company is not responsible for making sure that that's not an upper violation
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:58.720]   And so long as they respond to a takedown notice they're perfectly pure as the clean snow
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.320]   And this is good for apple because apple does have that feature
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.840]   Uh where you pay what was it 30 bucks a year
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:10.160]   I had this music and they will and they will replace your 56k copy with a good copy
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:15.520]   And apple's version is much different than this because what you're really it doesn't need to find one that's identical
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.040]   It doesn't need to you don't need to just know it's just a name and artist and boom
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.400]   That's it exactly and so apple still is getting their money's worth
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.680]   Out of their out of their little purchase because um this
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:29.680]   Is not going to necessarily lead to any new features by amazon or google because
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.400]   The the issue is is that the user is
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:37.760]   You know if they rip their own cd's this isn't going to really work because all of those files are going to be slightly original
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:43.200]   You know most likely and so that you know that you're still going to have to upload those because they're not allowed to store them unless they're identical
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:47.840]   So there's a lot of issues there where it doesn't really help as much as it may seem on the surface
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.000]   And remember that itunes music match is a form of amnesty where if you did
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:58.240]   Download like a hundred hundred megabytes hundred gigabytes of stuff off a bit torn or if you just ripped your entire
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:03.200]   All your roommates cd collections illegally doesn't matter if you pay the 25 bucks a year
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:07.520]   You have the legal you have a license to have access to all those copies of the songs
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:12.240]   I guess we'll all be paying that 25 bucks. It's a pretty I think a lot of I think a lot
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:16.480]   It's from monopolies might get out of jail a free card. No, no, no, you see I paid the 25
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:21.680]   I think it more as I think it more as being washed clean of my sins
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.760]   Well, I don't think that there's a
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:29.120]   Yeah, it's like buying an indulgence like in the 14th century, right? You say it's monopoly. I say I've been baptized
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:33.200]   Yeah, you know what? Yeah, I killed my servant, but you know what?
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.240]   That's a really bad looking leak in your tree in your church's roof
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.520]   How what what do we do if we what can we do to solve each other's problems here?
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:43.360]   I'm gonna keep on counting out the money. You tell me when to stop. Okay, five
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:47.520]   I have st. Iggy's pinky in this box and that's gonna keep me from going a heck
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.000]   All right, let's uh, I'm really treading a fine line
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.240]   Let's take a break. We're gonna come back there is one apple product
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:02.000]   They just cannot keep in stock. The demand is so great for can take a guess what it would be
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.920]   The demand is so great for apple cannot keep it in stock
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:12.240]   We'll talk about that in just a moment first. I want to talk a little bit about our good friends at citrix who have done such a great great
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.160]   Thing
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:18.560]   We talk about go to meeting all the time is the best way to meet online and you know how how how I use it
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.560]   We use it all the time. It's just fantastic
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:24.800]   Uh better than an in-person meeting because you stay where you are
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:29.040]   They stay where they are but you can see what's on your screen and if you're doing a sales presentation
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:35.760]   You can show them the keynote or the powerpoint, you know different strokes and and they see it and it's just like they're there
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:42.240]   Three times a day right now for me. Is that how often we have a big event next week and I'm on three go to meetings

[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:27.440]   Uh, they showed it to us like I was very frustrated because I said I don't normally do ndas or

[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:40.080]   It's like he's i like it that you wore purple you know we've got now the purple lights
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.720]   Because that's the mac break weekly color
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:47.520]   I try to coordinate just like the hulks pants. That's what you think of when you think of mac break weekly
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:51.600]   Is are the hulks pants coordinated? They're purple. Oh
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.320]   But isn't it isn't he green? I don't know if that was
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:57.040]   Hmm he's green though, right?
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.440]   Yes, and that's actually
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:04.800]   I'm sorry that that was that was at least a 15 minute rat hole about interesting things I learned about how
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.400]   colorists in the 1960s regarded color
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:12.160]   That there's that every time you notice that like all of
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.800]   Spider spider man dresses in red and blue
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:21.440]   And so all of their and so his his the green goblin dresses and green and purple the fantastic four where blue
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:27.200]   Blue costumes and so doctor june whereas like a green tunic and every time there's like green characters
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.200]   They fight blue characters and vice versa
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:35.360]   It turns the idea the idea the theory behind that is that colorists always think in terms of thought in terms of the basic color
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:39.920]   Wheel in the 60s and it was always up on the opposite side of the color wheel that would be the bad guy
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:45.440]   Not only that because if they if they would think about what colors the hero should be and then they want the
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:50.080]   The villain to be at least distinctive so they were always colored the villain at the opposite end
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.120]   So that'd be easier to make out or because subconsciously they figure well
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:59.920]   He's the bad guys who must be the opposite. Wow. I thought it was cool when I first heard about that. I think that's very cool. I didn't know that
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.680]   I had no idea. Well, I've just crashed google chrome
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:08.480]   You know lately I don't know is it have you if you notice this for some reason on the mac that I don't know if it's on the windows
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:13.120]   Side as well, but on the mac google chrome the newest version which I think is 13 13.0
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:18.080]   Crashes a lot more than safari does I might have to go back to safari if you guys noticed that i was maybe just me
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:21.920]   Nope, I have to have you a lot. I lean snow is that yeah, I haven't noticed it at all
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:27.200]   I get that aw snap thing they have a blue screen of death in chrome you haven't because you use safari
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.040]   Do you use safari to Andy? I use safari
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:37.680]   But i'm disappointed by the fact that I always have to have safari and chrome running at the same time so that when one locks up
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:43.760]   Temporarily I can just tap into the other and get that information that I needed at least you got the choice right browser. Thank you
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:49.680]   Yeah, maybe that's it. Maybe it's just the web is that's the even if that's the only reason why you bought an hp touchpad
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:56.400]   Just so you could have one machine that's just a browser that could always be always you can always keep it next to your desktop or next to your
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:02.320]   MacBook so that you can always have a functional browser when when something on your cpu on your main machine is bork
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.360]   That's worth nine and nine bucks to me. I think it's a lion thing
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.160]   Where's it's interesting?
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:11.360]   We're starting to see more and more lion updates of software dropbox shipped you actually you may not have it yet
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:14.240]   You actually dropbox isn't pushing it out right away
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:20.080]   So if you haven't if you've had problems with dropbox online, uh, there's a new version go get that
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:25.760]   Um carbonite one of our sponsors is updated for lion lion drivers are starting to come out now more and more
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:29.280]   And I think it's file system stuff low-level stuff that really has a seems to have a problem
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:32.800]   I uh, I'm not sure if there's let me check
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:38.080]   Excuse me if there's a url for a dropbox or can you just have you tried this?
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:40.560]   Can you just say dropbox and uh update me?
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:43.120]   Came out on thursday
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:47.760]   Yeah, I think if you think if you go directly to uh dropbox.com you can download and start it
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.720]   manual install dropbox.com/install
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:57.600]   And you'll get 1.1.40 and that's the one you want 1.1.40. So I'm gonna do that right now
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:02.560]   There also you that you never use dropbox.com because it's so well integrated into the os
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:07.600]   But if you go to the side itself, you'll you can access forums or we can get beta software and get advanced
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:13.520]   Uh, copies of stuff. So that that's been floating around for like a week or two. Yeah, okay came out officially thursday
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:18.960]   Don't try. Yeah, you wouldn't trust anything like that until it's actually no i'm still i wouldn't you know
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:26.320]   I've been using something called spider oak lately. Have you ever seen that spider spider oak, you know, um, it's uh
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:32.560]   It's kind of like dropbox. It's like kind of dropbox on steroids. So you have backup you have sync
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.480]   Um
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:39.680]   You can you can buy space. I bought I ended up buying a hundred megabytes because you know the two megabytes free
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:43.920]   It's just never enough. It's cheaper than it's a little cheaper than dropbox to buy more space
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.760]   um, and it uh it seems to have versions for every uh
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:54.720]   Every uh operating system. I don't know it looks it's a little more geeky. Yeah looks. Yeah. Yeah
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:52:01.680]   The reason I got it is unlike dropbox. It has what steve gibson calls pre
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:05.440]   egress encryption or p
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:09.680]   Actually, we've now called it pi because p is not so nice as pie
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:12.080]   It's the p it peas up to the web. Yeah
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:16.400]   So what you because dropbox you remember that there was this kind of issue where they can see your stuff
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:19.280]   Right, even though they had quote encryption. They had the keys as well
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:24.480]   Spider oak you generate the key and grips before it uploads so they can't see your stuff
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:27.920]   You only you have the key. So that's the main reason I said I switched over i'm just playing with it
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:32.480]   I'll let you know I did I used wall off for a while. I didn't like that because it wasn't native. It was a java
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:35.280]   So but i'm kind of like in spider oak
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:39.440]   Just a thought i'll just mention that throw that in a freebie
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:43.120]   Let me go back to our rundown
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.120]   apple looking
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:49.920]   To knock out new york city knockoffs, you know apple closed those stores in china
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:55.520]   Right or at least tried to and the chinese government said yeah that we're gonna close them not because they're not because they're counterfeit
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:58.560]   Because they don't have proper licenses
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:01.200]   And fill out the proper they didn't fill out the forms
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.240]   Not because they're not because they're illegal
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:08.560]   Uh, apparently new york city has a similar problem. I didn't know this
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.320]   um
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.800]   These aren't knockoff apple stores. These are
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.520]   knockoff apple products
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:19.360]   And apple is a little unhappy now i've always been able to go down
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:22.160]   uh to uh
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.440]   Chelsea
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.160]   The chelsey market down there and buy you know
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:30.640]   Rolexes i'm gonna say what is new york without knockoffs? We gotta have knockoffs
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:37.040]   The apple is filed a pair of trademark and fringent lawsuits against two stores and queens. Oh, that's not that doesn't count
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.080]   Queens is
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:45.040]   There's a lot of angry New York for right now. This is not the apple store. This is the apple storey
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:48.800]   And that's that wouldn't confuse you would it
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:51.920]   The apple storey you'd know the difference
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:56.720]   And the fun zone they've been selling not real ipods iPhones and ipads
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.480]   but
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:05.120]   Fake ones even though they say on them designed by apple in california assembled in china. I guess that's strictly true still though, right?
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.360]   Exactly just still
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:09.440]   Strictly speaking that's not a lie
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.880]   That's
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:18.560]   Defendants are trading on and receiving the benefit of the good wheel apple is established in the apple trademarks are considerable labor and expensive or mentally
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:22.320]   Many years apple sentence complaint. It also wants a list of suppliers
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:25.760]   So if you're in queens you might want to run over to the apple storey
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:32.480]   And get your knockoff. I i'm not tempted once that's that's they're all over the place with my uh, are they whenever i'm in?
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:37.360]   Well, whenever i'm in new york, uh, i always get my comics at midtown comics on 40th street
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:44.640]   As I'm on the corner of 40th 40th and 7th avenue for all your midtown comics needs from the new to the old anime
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:52.640]   I started auditioning for be the official pitchman from midtown comics, but there is but there's actually you could do movie film movie fun
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:59.680]   We were doing that on sunday i think i think every time i could just pump up two p.m. Press one for the next movie
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.720]   Well, you really want to see the smurfs movie
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:05.440]   Okay, uh two tent really
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:08.080]   Sounds like this sounds like kurmit
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:10.640]   all right, uh
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:14.960]   There's a there's a one of them like million those millions of little electronic stores in the town that hat
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:18.000]   There's run this always that's net right neck right next to the staircase
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:25.280]   You go up to go midtown comics and the window is always full of just absolutely display perfect versions of the ipod
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:31.120]   Wow, and every so every time i get every time i get my comics which is like maybe just four five times a year that plays
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:35.600]   I always stop look at the window saying yep, they got the new one. Oh good. They got the new nano. Oh interesting
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:39.280]   As lg in our chatroom says it's an original fake apple product
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:48.480]   We've started to do something we started it a couple of weeks ago and i think it's going very well our tips of the week before we get to our
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:55.840]   Uh apps of the week. Let's start with our ios tip of the week and i can't remember i think you're the ios guy right? Alex lindsey
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.720]   whoa
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:02.960]   Ocular what was it? What do you call those specular specular highlights?
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:10.640]   Flares lens flare sunburst that's not a specular highlight. No, that's a lens flare lens flare
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:14.720]   Now a specular highlight if it's bright enough can become a lens. Sorry i brought this
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:21.280]   All right, so ios tip, you know, uh, i have a camera over my shoulder
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:26.560]   Should i follow along as you tell me what to do? Uh, not on this one. Okay, because i'm talking about mail. Okay
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:31.840]   I don't know. We don't want to show your mail. Okay, so oh it might make sense actually, but i just don't know what meals in there
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:35.360]   So here's here's there actually you can do it because it's um
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:42.080]   It's in the actual setup. So there's a couple of things that i like to adjust on my mail. Um and that is uh first of all
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:44.720]   uh a lot of people um
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:49.920]   You know you get that first two lines you can't figure out what to do with right, you know and and i like to scan
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:52.400]   So if you go go over here, there we go
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:58.240]   Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, this one up here that one there
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:02.160]   There you go. So, look at that. That's beautiful. Um, we never had that before
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:06.960]   So we have to thank eileen and jason for all about andra, we for this over the shoulder shot
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.560]   Yes, it looks good. It's that's pretty
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:11.120]   So one thing to remember is is you're going through a lot of this stuff
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:15.200]   And you there's a couple of things that you a lot of people often forget about is you can change the number of lines
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:18.880]   You can preview and so you go to uh five lines and now
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:22.560]   Yeah, like that you're gonna see instead of two you're gonna see five lines in your mail
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:26.400]   Right, and and the thing is and i often tell people if you're wondering if you ever meet me
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.960]   I say don't write more than five lines. Um, that's why
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:33.440]   You have something on here that's kind of risky you allow it to load remote images
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:37.600]   I usually turn that off. I know it's annoying when you get html mail and you can't see the picture
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:42.000]   But it's also the way that spammers and others can kind of uh that they can track them. We'll turn it off
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.560]   That there's a trick so it's so turn that off. So leo has added one
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.680]   Um, I don't turn that sucker off and let you know unless you uh
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:52.320]   You know, it's not like you're gonna get a security issue. Yes, although it could be in theory
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:55.920]   Mostly it's just that you don't want to let them know you read that mail usually with gmail
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:58.000]   I have to admit which is where most my mail goes through
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:04.080]   Uh, you know most of us gone. Yeah, um, so then the other thing that a lot of people forget is that I was just talking
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:09.200]   Someone was complaining about I always have to delete the sent by sent by sent by well you can change that if you go down to signature
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:13.520]   Uh right there this one. Yeah, I hate it when it says sent for my eye
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.760]   So you just you can make that anything you want. Yeah, you know
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:20.320]   So that's the thing to remember is is that when you're sending stuff you can turn you can just delete it or you can send it from my
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:25.200]   You can say you know what I actually always do on mine. I put in a blank line. I type my name
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:31.040]   So that way I don't have to sign these emails. I put another blank line. This is the canonical
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.880]   I nobody knows this anymore
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:39.520]   But in the old days of email back when email really was email if you put two dashes followed by a space in a new line
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:44.160]   That was the sing the this signal that and the next thing is that your signature
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:48.960]   I don't I don't know of any software that ever paid any attention to that, but that's that's it
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:55.680]   And you know you could put anything here you want right so that's so that so um that's a combined tip from from leo and myself
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:59:00.560]   On how to how to work on some of your mail. I just know a lot of it will just use it straight up the way the way it comes in
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:06.960]   There's a lot of fun things you can do to adjust this so that's my that's my i'm gonna make his medium font size really big
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:10.800]   That's my tip for messing with I don't really think that that's appropriate
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:14.800]   I like it though. I do like it though that what the top font size is giant
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:20.160]   I I was that's something I'd actually like to judge because I'd like mine to say we not so we and frickin you
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:25.440]   Gigantic enormous huge. That's our IOS tip of the week and now
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:28.800]   Sounds like a hairball when I do that
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:32.320]   Our lion tip of the week from Andy and not cool
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:43.120]   In the village the quiet village the lion sleeps
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:45.920]   Just give me a weem away
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:53.680]   No, I thought you
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.680]   You're in the middle of a really good bit
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:59.440]   No, that's it. It's downhill from here. Go ahead
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:04.800]   Yeah, we think that in a mall they should just release lions so that if you're gonna be wasting time there anyway
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:09.120]   You should have to risk your life. Yeah, make it more exciting. Louis C. K. Listen run. Louis C K
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:11.120]   I do think lions like to hunt gazelles
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.080]   That
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.080]   Was a joke. That was a joke
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:19.680]   I wasn't afraid I was up very early this morning. Did you write this in I put my stuff?
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:24.720]   Well, I was if you want to get a gazelle. It's key to think ahead of the gazelle. Where will it go?
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:27.280]   Did you write this
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:32.480]   What were you on? How can you let it thinks it's getting away while it's working towards one of your compatriots?
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:36.960]   Watch the gazelle for a few days. You'll see the cynical nature of its roaming
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:44.320]   It's not random scare it and it will run that circle quickly have a partner waiting on that circle and
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.120]   No, no, no lion is happy
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:50.000]   What the hell were you smoking?
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.760]   It was like it was like five o'clock in the morning
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:55.760]   I was working on the notes and I noticed that Andy was there and I was hoping he was gonna react and so
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.600]   Gave us instructions for hunting gazelles
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:07.120]   Exactly. That's there. They are now watch that gazelle will go exactly the same way each time
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:12.480]   So make sure you've stationed another lion right where he's headed. See there they go. Go gazelles go
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:16.960]   No, no, no, there comes there's another lion waiting on the other side
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:22.560]   Sorry gazelles not this time. I was just I was just hoping to marry us
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:28.320]   Everybody that you stole that tip from Wayne Gretzky. Okay, that's right. Go where the fuck is headed
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:34.000]   Is go where the gazelle is going to be don't go with the go gazelle is that's right? That's the Wayne Gretz
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:39.040]   And there they are happy lions. I'm showing gazelle sandwiches for dinner
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.640]   Thank goodness. They hit the gazelle in the bush
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:46.880]   Is that a dog in there? What is that really?
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:52.960]   Looks like there's a German shepherd in with the lions get out of there. There's other legs sticking out of there
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:58.960]   And now we return from Olde Weigorg for a tip from Andy Inaco
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.880]   Well, there is a certain amount of continuity from one kind of killing to another
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:08.960]   They're both senseless, but one is a little bit easier to get out of your carpets if you know what I mean
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.840]   There this isn't necessarily specifically a lion tip
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:15.840]   But one of the really cool tip one of the cool features of Mac OS that people don't use quite enough
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:22.240]   If you are ever using a machine and sort of a public or public ish environment either in office where there are a lot of looky
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.240]   Losing around or you're at
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:30.160]   The bakery cafe where there's it's your feel safe enough that you're willing to walk five steps away to get a refill
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:35.040]   On your 32 on soda, but not so secure that you don't want people to you
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.160]   You don't want to risk people looking at your screen and maybe seeing the email you were composing
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.880]   There is a hot key that will instantly kill the screen
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:47.840]   And if anytime any point anywhere you just hit control shift eject that immediately blacks the screen doesn't put into screens ever
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:53.520]   It turns off the screen. So it's good for instant privacy. It's an immediate instant privacy
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.920]   It's not oh wait. Let me let me show you a spinning beach ball
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:00.320]   I decided how I'm going to turn that off it get kills the boss key
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.680]   Exactly
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:04.480]   And so it's also it's also cool if you you're on your last
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:10.720]   Drags of battery and you're really trying to stretch it out that will and if you're you know that you're going to be distracted for about three minutes
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.720]   Kill the screen. They'll kill the that'll save you a bunch of battery life
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:21.040]   And it's also really cool when you tag team it with another feature if you go into the security panel of system preferences
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:26.240]   You can click the checkbox. It says it always require that you type in a password to wake this thing from sleep
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:29.520]   So again, you you got these wise and high mrs
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:35.120]   In your office who think it's really really funny when you go down to the break room to get yourself some more coffee to say g
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:38.160]   I'm going to jiggle this person's mouse on the on the computer
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.200]   And i'm going to change this desktop to something porni graphic
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:45.920]   Well, if you make sure that you you can hit hit that hot key combination
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:51.520]   Not only turn off the screen, but the that machine will not be able to be used until you type in your password again
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:58.560]   So there's a least a least a 75 chance that you will not be seeing new pictures of stockard chanting or something
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.000]   Oh my god
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   breakfast, baby or time daily
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:09.360]   Control i think i think eject control shift reject i would take i would take stockard chanting photos over time daily photos
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:12.320]   They're both they're both very talented time daily wonderful singer
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.760]   Uh, the only person who i think who can really suit the role of mama rose
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:20.160]   Uh, the way that apple merman did but nude modeling probably not her
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:26.400]   She's no Helen mering this what i'm saying that's all i'm saying and somebody in the chat room said
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.200]   Don't just sell it
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.200]   because zealot
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:36.160]   Uh, this breaking story just came in also from the chat room. This is from tech vibes vancouver
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:44.320]   company zite apparently being acquired by cnn for 20 to 25 million dollars zite is a flip board alike
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:49.120]   that has been getting into trouble lately being sued receiving cease and desist letters from
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:56.240]   media companies saying you're misappropriating our websites including the washington post time Warner which owns cnn
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:00.640]   Ap and giddy images. Maybe instead of suing time Warner is just going to buy the sucker
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:07.440]   Um interesting story we call the carrot and stick approach. Yeah, we'll sue you or 20 to 25 million dollars later
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.000]   You can go to the beach
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.160]   Pray, do you want pray i do not change the deal further?
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:20.320]   Maybe that's exactly where this patent stuff has is headed where it's kind of a sign of prestige that your company is so advanced that you're being sued for
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:25.600]   infringement of some kind right so if you can't do anything that's so advanced that people can sue you over you can
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:29.360]   At least buy a company and be sued by proxy isn't that nice
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:35.840]   Let us uh now do our uh tips picks. What do we call them picks of the way we just did tips picks
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:42.320]   Whoa picks of the week ladies and gem. I'm replacing my dropbox. That was kind of a tip of the week
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.120]   Uh, andy and aqua your
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.200]   software or hardware
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:52.320]   Adware it's high both you guys are hardware today. Yes. Well, that's all right. I'll do some software in that case
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:56.640]   Well, at least it's inexpensive hardware. This is the connects air blue
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:05.440]   Which is a really simple little uh bluetooth stereo adapter and you can see it's about the size of a hostess
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.440]   Or missing oh, that's a good idea. That's a really good idea
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:13.600]   Why is the video frozen? Well, because you're doing you're doing too much with it
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:18.400]   You know it skype doesn't like to be manipulated. Oh, well there. Well, 49 bucks
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:25.840]   49 bucks. It's teeny tiny it weighs next to nothing so little that I thought that gee wasn't this supposed to be battery
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:31.280]   rechargeable uh but it turns but you know bluetooth takes up less than less than any uh
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.920]   Power and whatsoever. So this will this will run about
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:37.440]   20 hours or at least two or three days in my car
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:41.360]   uh based on just with one charge off of usb
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:46.160]   Uh, and it really is just as simple as you take any device that has a headphone jack
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:51.920]   And you plug in that plug this thing into it and presto voila you have it's bluetooth enabled
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:59.440]   So if you have like a really old car like mine that doesn't that can't take a new mad and uh mad and sort of a uh dashboard
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:03.840]   Uh stereo. That's one solution. Also. I mean, there's so many real
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.840]   I really like the really cool like
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:09.360]   150 $200 $300 you know
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:14.960]   Send your send send airplay to any any set of speakers inside the house
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:20.160]   Fact matter is it like you probably already have a really cool pair of 50 sub set amplified speakers
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:24.160]   You just take this thing for uh you can buy it for about it's retail is 49
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.840]   You can get on amazon for 40
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:29.040]   Uh and you simply plug this into anything and now you have bluetooth
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:35.200]   It turns that into bluetooth speakers and you can always you can just repurpose it for basically any purpose that you ever want
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.360]   Uh if you take it on vacation when I when I I just got this couple weeks ago
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:46.240]   But I can already see that uh when I travel that means that instead of having to I want to use the uh like the in room alarm
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.760]   Clark or whatever or or
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:51.440]   I phone doc will not work with my iphone 4 and or my ipad
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.440]   I don't really want to bother talking it that way
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.600]   But I can at least just simply plug this into that thing via the headphone jack and now that
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:02.560]   Uh that's that uh console stereo that's on the nightstand will work perfectly fine with my
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.400]   I can you can turn your hi-fi
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.320]   Which I still have we were just using it this morning
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:10.400]   Um, I might into a into a you know the big white box that apple
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.280]   I wouldn't
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:14.080]   Uh oh the hi-fi i remember that
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.080]   We were there we were there we crashed
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:20.480]   Steve's Steve job said he was going to throw out his uh high-end stereo equipment. Yeah
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:25.840]   So that's that's very cool. I think in that replaces the cassette adapter for a lot of older cars
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:31.760]   The canx air blue portable bluetooth music receiver $49 k-a-n-e-x
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:35.760]   And now Alex Lindsay has another hardware. He's got it with him
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:40.080]   Another hardware. Okay. Now you gotta give it to me because I'm the one with the handy cam
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:44.320]   So, uh, that is a handicam. This replaces the owlie the booboo
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:48.960]   So, well, I like I still like the owlie because you get a wide angle and I and I think that the um
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:53.600]   That the wide angle lens and the way you grip it is a little bit better, but this is um
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.160]   This is fostex and this has little ears. This has got a lot to it. I'm gonna have those
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:03.440]   Those are stereo headphones. Yeah. Yeah, so and you have a little input control here and so you can put it here now
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:09.200]   So these are directional so you want to interview someone you can turn it so that you're talking and they're talking
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:13.200]   And it comes in as stereo. So right and left so you have both those are separate later
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:17.040]   You know when you're recording it so you'll have that uh, I haven't tested it for bleed over yet
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:23.920]   But so now so you have that you can of course put your little uh a little light here or you can or there is another check this out
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.720]   You can hold it
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:30.960]   No, but you covered up the part that I was trying to show I should hold it from here here we go
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:35.280]   So the um so you have uh phones input of course you have your charge
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:40.880]   Charging with just a usb no special connector. They really thought this out another input down there
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.920]   So now you can only have two two inputs at a time, but you can decide hey
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:45.920]   I really rather have my input at the bottom
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:51.360]   You've got um attachments for this or for a tripod. This is just uh, you know, this is be hold onto that real tight rule
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:52.880]   Yeah, it's good
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.440]   You can um, so you can have this down here, but it's also on the on the end as well
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:01.760]   So there's a there's another one there. I really feel like they thought this out really well now
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:04.000]   What's important here is and this is one of the things?
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.600]   It's different from the alley which I which I'd love to see in the alley is that the audio coming into this is being managed by
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:12.880]   You know internally it's not going through the headphone jack
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:17.280]   So this is going through the 30 pin cable and so what you're getting is a much cleaner sound
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:19.600]   Is it digital or is it still it's still analog probably?
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.880]   Um, it is well
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:24.000]   It's analog here, but it's digital when it comes into the it's digital
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.240]   Yeah, it's coming in digitally. So so what I found in my early test was that it was a much much cleaner audio
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:34.080]   Then what we're what we've been getting by just putting my headphone to this. It's about 150 bucks
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:39.680]   And um and I have to admit I saw it. I don't even know what I was searching for and I saw it and within
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:44.320]   15 seconds. I it was on its way. I was oh my gosh. I have to have that
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:49.920]   So cool. Is that hot? Is that hot shoe just amount or is it an actual hot shoe for something?
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.560]   No, it's not it has no electrical connections. No, no, it's just that's a cold mount
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.640]   So you could put your you know, we have those light panel micros would go right in there very nice
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:04.640]   And again, what I'm gonna be doing with it is I'm actually to do my little things at like nab or mac world or whatever
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.080]   This is the perfect little thing and I can use my wireless my sennheiser
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.320]   With a white wireless
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:14.720]   Uh and plug that little wireless receiver. It'll slide right into that cold shoe mount at the top
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:18.720]   So you could have a wireless lab for instance that you could plug into this input
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:23.040]   That would then get to you know where you're going. That is pretty sweet. I thought that was pretty nifty
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.040]   Yeah, I really like that now
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:31.440]   The way they've slid it in it looks like it'd be easy to modify for other phones because you know, we've got new iPhones coming out
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:34.960]   You probably if you were gonna buy a new iPhone in october
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.600]   Yes, you might be prudent to wait
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:42.000]   You might want to think about it. Yeah, I would just probably turn this phone into the camera phone. Yeah, right
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.800]   Yeah, so um it does it looks like it'd be fairly easy for them to adjust this to fit other
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:50.560]   But I'd love to see other people like play around with this. I'd love to see this with the alie
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:55.440]   The boo-boo. I mean alleys got to as unnoticed you got to stand up and be kind of alley
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:00.800]   But I think it's great for if you want to do um on the road uh interviews being able to turn the mic one mic one way and one
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.480]   Mic the other. Uh, first I thought that was kind of goofy or you look like a one mic down below
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:10.960]   Exactly. Yeah, so if you want to better suit if you perhaps were not getting this or you could give them a lab or a headset or whatever
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:14.320]   And have it wired into there and um and have the other one pointed at you
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:19.440]   You know, those are there's a lot of different uh a lot of different options. You should you know with your mouth down
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:21.280]   It could
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:25.280]   I wouldn't suggest that you wouldn't recommend that. No, all right. Just you know, just wait
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:31.040]   I'd really like to hear your your opinion on this every time every time I see like an owl or something like this
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:36.880]   I always think that I bet that that's something that only one half of one percent of anybody would ever be interested in
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.400]   But for though that half of a percent is the absolute perfect thing. That's the thing
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:43.280]   What describes the absolute perfect thing that's for
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:47.600]   That's that as opposed to just saying why don't I just get like a regular camcorder?
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:50.400]   Dump the footage and then do a quick edit night movie on a desktop
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:54.320]   Well, I think that there well number one is you have a lot of interface options for the iPhone
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:58.960]   This is where cameras are going in my opinion, which is that you know, we're gonna stop trying to build an interface
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:00.320]   We're gonna stop trying to build the brains
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.400]   We're just gonna build something that will go around your iPhone
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.960]   The next step for this is to actually just create the sensor and slide this into it
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:10.960]   You know have a nice um, you know, aps sensor digital sensor
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:16.320]   I mean, this is the future of cameras not building more cameras with interfaces because camera manufacturers are horrible at that
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.480]   And so what they really should be doing is just a lot
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:22.480]   This is what i'm excited about is this is the slide and now what this provides is
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:29.520]   I have lots and lots of mic options that are actually better than mic options on this are actually better than my 5d mark 2
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:34.240]   Which the audio is completely worthless. So so the being able to have this input
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:36.720]   And being able to have that control
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:39.120]   You know, this means i'm throwing something in it's not as expensive
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:42.160]   And i'm able to kind of put that stuff together. So anyway, that's fine
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:46.160]   We're gonna wrap this up because somebody's making bacon in the other room and I just can't take it anymore
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:49.360]   Well, you know, we can bring it out because you know, maybe they say they say everything is better with bacon
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:52.320]   So maybe we could eat some on the show could be fresh gazelle
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:57.760]   All right. Well now that i've given some instructions on how to get your put a gazelle on the bobby
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:03.120]   My pick is free. It's you know onyx and everybody knows onyx. That's a great tool for
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:06.080]   System stuff
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:11.920]   On os 10, but if you've gone to lion you want to take a look at something called deeper also from the not them
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:18.480]   Not them them from titanium software. They give this away. Absolutely free. Although your donations are welcome
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:23.520]   And uh, and what deeper does is allows you to go a little bit deeper. I love this
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:26.240]   For the lion to install deeper
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:29.200]   It allows you to go a little bit deeper into
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:36.000]   The functionality of os 10 lion. Oh, I got to give it it each time you have to give it a minister
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:41.840]   It's a password of course because you're going to change system settings gives you a nice little interface
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:45.680]   And you can change things in the finder the doc quick time safari
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:49.920]   Mail does a nice help is there a button in quick time to make it useful
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:53.440]   You know i'm curious. Let's see because this is that new quick time right?
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:15:00.320]   It says useful always hide playback controls never display the title bar auto play movies corners of windows rounded keep in full screen mode
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:03.360]   Actually, you know, I I like it full screen mode. I would keep it full screen mode
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:08.960]   That's the button I was looking for is not there. It's not there make it be quick time seven. Yeah, yeah
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:12.720]   Disabled safari cache enable single window mode
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:18.240]   Confirm when closing multiple pages for mail you can display text mails instead of html when available
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:22.080]   I like that up. It's going to force quick mail. So we're not going to do that right now
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:25.600]   Uh, so a lot of the little features that you might have to
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:32.960]   Modify a p-list or use a right command from the terminal to do are available here great
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:37.840]   And free and very easy, you know, it's in fact one of the things I like about programs like this
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.520]   Yeah, you don't need this program to do any of these changes, but it exposes them
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:47.840]   So you know they're there they're possible for instance. I can have the doc be 3d with mirror effect or 2d with transparency effect
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:53.440]   Um, you know all of those things are somewhere. It's just having them all in one spot that makes it quite easy
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:58.960]   Change your login have your different background image on your login and show a message in the login
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:01.520]   Window. I think I'd like to do this
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:07.040]   Um, this is Leo's, you know, macbook air and so forth. All right. You're good
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:11.120]   Speaking of macbook airs go ahead and finish because you were going to talk about this
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:16.240]   Well, I was going to ask you actually I wasn't going to talk about that. I was going to talk about what what is the little clock thing they're using down at the bottom
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:19.520]   Oh, I like iclock. Haven't I ever picked iclock for you?
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.320]   Not that I know
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:26.320]   This is a fantastic program called iclock. It's a clock replacement. I make this iclock pro. I'll make this be my
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:33.040]   second choice and among other things it has settings for floating clocks
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:37.920]   And you can have all different floating clocks. That's the school clock. You can have techno silver
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:40.080]   You can have a map
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:46.480]   Clock and then you can change what time zones are showing both in their menu because it has a very really nice
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:51.120]   Let's see if I click it where is there it is really nice menu of
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.440]   Times around the world that you can customize your big traveler. You might prefer to have that
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.600]   But you can also put those clocks on the desktop
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:04.720]   And you can say which clocks are there because we often operate in different time zones including zulu time
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:10.560]   I like to have these clocks here on my desktop. You can also change that's great how the clocks are on the desktop
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:14.240]   You know if they're locked in or or so forth you can have them be digital or analog
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:19.360]   Yeah, I really I think this is nice. This is called iclock pro. It's not free from plum amazing
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.000]   So there's a couple of
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.680]   tips for as you
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:28.800]   Couple of tricks now I did earlier in the show promise you that I would tell you
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:31.520]   which apple product
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:34.160]   Is in short supply guesses
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:37.840]   Which apple product?
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:42.800]   Could you not could you not be able to get it's not the iphone? It's not the ipad
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:48.400]   It's not the 11 inch macbook air which I would have thought it was
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:54.240]   It's listen see I was gonna say I was thinking it was the 11 inch macbook girl 13 inch macbook air
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:18:00.240]   Wow now I wonder if that has to do with the fact that they didn't make as many perhaps because I wouldn't I prefer the 11 inch
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.800]   Supposedly apple have more
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:07.920]   I've read from other sources that apple had more faith and I thought the 11 inch was going to be the bigger seller
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.080]   So she didn't make as many
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:13.360]   Well, I'm not I'm not really sure it could be that there's a temporary blip
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.520]   If you go to the apple store right now
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:21.760]   I did check about an hour before the show and they are still saying on the on the basic 13 inch air
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:28.720]   Ships in 24 hours on amazon. However, where there's a whole bunch of different retailers contributing to any one different product
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.920]   You can see a couple of different retailers that are saying yes
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:36.720]   We have the $1499 macbook air 13 inch for only $19
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:40.480]   We would take cash check for you
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:45.680]   But you're going to pay I think so I think that there's a little bit of fluctuation in in the supply
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:51.840]   But as far as I know just about an hour a couple hours ago apple had plenty on stock well you and I both have 11 inches
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:54.800]   Andy do you have a preference for 11 or 13?
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:19:00.000]   I have a preference for 11. I think that I think that if you don't already have a decent
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:07.520]   Macbook that's a really tough decision between the third using the 13 inch as your primary mac or at least your primary mobile mac
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:11.760]   If you already have a macbook and I have the 15 inch which is my daily driver
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:15.600]   Whether I'm in the office or have big projects and you do on the road
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:21.200]   But if you already have that why the whole the whole point is to get something that's less expensive and smaller
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:24.240]   And lighter and I'm willing to trade two or three hours for the battery life forward
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.160]   So I think the I am very 10 much
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:28.880]   I'm still very much tempted by the love and share I haven't made a decision yet
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:32.720]   But I wouldn't be shocked if I wound up with one in the next 30 days
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:37.040]   I'm madly in love with my 11 inches. I really yeah
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:39.600]   Yeah
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.600]   And we have a show title
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.840]   What
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:50.400]   Annie and I go rights for the Chicago Sun times and uh that gives them certain privileges such as sneak peeks at roger's eberts new book
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.240]   I'm so jelly
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.960]   Perhaps someday soon we can have mr. ebert on the show
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:59.120]   I will pass that along but goodness gracious
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:05.840]   If you go to rogerebert.com you can find like the first chapter of this online already doesn't ship for another few weeks
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:08.240]   but I
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:13.840]   Roger's a friend of mine. I knew that there was a better than likely chance that he would be sending me a copy
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:18.800]   But even so as soon as I read that saying where's the button to push so I could buy this on the kiddell?
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.800]   Where can I buy? I want to buy this book. What about it?
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:24.880]   So I bought the good I pre-ordered the Kindle edition just based on that first chapter
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.720]   But I just like the first sentence
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:29.760]   Let me let me tell you something. What's the first sense?
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.640]   There's going to be a
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:35.680]   The audiobook is going to be shipping the same day. You will
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:38.240]   Freak when you hear who's reading it
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:41.040]   Wow, I'm not sure if I'm if I'm
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:44.400]   Don't say to say yeah, don't say but it will it will be the
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:49.040]   Holy mother of god because this is this is the name that you
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:54.560]   If you're in the office and you're and they're telling about who they're thinking about they're trying to get for your audiobook
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.800]   That's the name that says oh well obviously that'd be awesome
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:01.200]   But there's no way we're gonna get fill in the blank and they got fill in the blouse
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:07.760]   Well, it's Roger Ebert the first sentence. I was born inside the movie of my life

[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:02.160]   Training in the media. I don't think it's quite as organized as big nerd
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:06.560]   But but it's definitely but we're definitely having a lot of fun with it and we're having fun with the green screen
