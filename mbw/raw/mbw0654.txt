[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.960]   we cover the latest news from Apple. And there is news from Apple. Renee Richie is still
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.480]   in Cupertino where he's desperately trying to meet Oprah. But in his place, Lori Gill,
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.160]   we love having Laurie on managing it or I more. Now you were at the event, right?
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.960]   Yes, last time we spoke I had not been invited yet. And I think the very next day I got my
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.480]   official invite. So yeah, that was my first invite to an app.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.440]   Oh, fancy. We fancy. I get to have an app with all the celebrities.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.560]   Also at the event, I think Mr. Jim Dower and pull up the loop loop in site.com. Hi, Jim,
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.880]   Jim, meet Jennifer Garner. I did not. I didn't even know she was there. But she didn't text
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:38.920]   me. I'll be honest. She had the chance, but she didn't. So, but I did get to get to
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.000]   hang out with Laurie. That's pretty good. Frankly, give me the choice. I'm hanging out with
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.560]   Gill. Much better than Garner. That was my choice too.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.920]   I think you made the right choice, Jim. Also with his Andy Inaco, who was busy back in
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.360]   Boston. He's with, of course, the Boston Public Radio, the BGBH in Boston. Hello.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.880]   Thank you very much. Yes. I was I was holding the fort here on the East Coast. I felt this
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:16.880]   was so we I needed to represent East Coast snobbery in shunning this Hollywood, California lifestyle
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.680]   sort of event. Somebody had to stay home. Yeah. And of course, we were here busy getting
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.240]   apples, takedown notices and and doing our usual commentary on it, Megan Maroney and
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:38.680]   I. I don't want to color your perception of the event. So I won't say anything. But let's
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:47.360]   go one by one through the announcements, shall we? At the very beginning, the very first thing
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.040]   Apple announced was actually the only thing you can get right now, which is Apple's new
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.520]   news news plus. In order to get it, by the way, you have to update iOS or Mac OS to the
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.080]   latest version. They pushed out updates. I I kept trying to download an app or update
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.640]   the app and no, you got to update the whole operating system. Why is that, by the way,
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:16.360]   does anybody know? There were a lot of a lot of things tied to Apple news and the way it
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.960]   works. Or there were other updates that Apple wanted to get out and yeah, I'm they're always
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:27.280]   testing and they're always releasing updates. So seems like a good opportunity for them
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.880]   to just put that out there. Really the big the big change to Apple news was the addition
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.640]   of texture, which was the magazine subscription app Apple bought last year. They were a sponsor.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.200]   Texture will be shutting down. They haven't shut down yet, but they will be shutting. I
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.320]   don't think you can pay the money now if you wanted to. Apple will charge $10 for almost
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.600]   identical service. Apple claimed 300 magazines. Textures said 200, but I looked at the list
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.280]   of magazines and stuff at the top of my head. Couldn't see any differences. And it is very
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.200]   similar to the way texture worked. In fact, people like Stephen Troughton Smith, who've
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.200]   looked under the hood, say it's almost identical. For instance, the way texture worked was each
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:15.960]   magazine was a PDF of the entire magazine. And at first, I thought, especially because
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.000]   Apple showed off things like moving covers, video covers, and a new table of contents
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.480]   interface. I thought, oh, maybe Apple, wouldn't this be great if Apple said, look, we can
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.000]   do a better job of magazine layout for you. Why don't you use our templates and our software
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.840]   and add it to your workflow? I thought, Oh, I had this whole fantasy. And it turned out
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:44.160]   not success. Exactly the same. Now I like texture. I paid for it. And texture had a kind
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.160]   of unwritten additional feature, which was one subscription, multiple devices. So everybody
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.320]   in my family had texture on their iPad or iPhone. Apple's going to make that explicit
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.920]   and say this is a family shareable app, which is great to pay $110 subscription and my wife
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.520]   can use it. So forth, everybody in my fan.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:09.200]   Yeah. There's also someone on Twitter, Steve Trotton Smith, pointed out that I'm reading
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.000]   for the Twitter. I'm sorry, I didn't give you the link. Apple news plus magazines doesn't
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.320]   seem to use fair play their DRM and preloads the first few pages of PDF based issues regardless
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.360]   of whether you have a subscription. Thus, you can just rip them out of the cache on Mac OS
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.520]   and reconstitute the original PDF. And he then goes to show that yes, he managed to
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.560]   without a subscription, just simply create an entire PDF of the latest national geographic.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.320]   You get the whole thing, not just the first few pages, you get the whole thing. Yeah,
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:44.440]   it's it's not doing it the honest way. But yeah, it's not uncommon. I think magazine
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.120]   companies have had a hard time figuring out how to keep people from hacking and getting
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.800]   their PDFs because they've that's very it's very common that somebody can kind of just
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.600]   steal the PDF version of it basically and upload it for everybody to use. And that's kind of
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.440]   this backdoor way of getting access to it.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.000]   Yeah, and there's there's also a problem this morning. I don't know if they've solved
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.600]   it yet, where a lot of people are getting the news app news app crashing because of the
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:18.520]   server was sending the sending bad data causing like causing like actual like really, really
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.880]   bad huge crashes. I think they might have fixed it by now, but as of as of like nine
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:30.560]   or 10 a.m., I was getting nothing but screenshots of of essentially crash reports of people.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.600]   Do you anybody know what this means?
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.400]   So just so people understand because Apple didn't make this completely clear. Yes, you
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:44.080]   have to get an iOS update to 12.2 to get it. And then when I'm looking at news and saying,
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.760]   well, I see stuff I this looks exactly like my old Apple news. There is one more edition
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:53.960]   here news plus and that's the actual magazine newsstand. So you have to go to news plus and
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.240]   then you'll see the magazines. It didn't seem to pick up any of my texture stuff. You
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.920]   start from scratch. There are some new digital only things like the cut a tech crunch subscription
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.440]   version. But essentially, it's very much, you know, when you look at a magazine, very much
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:15.360]   the same. I like this, you know, kind of curation. And of course, one of the reasons magazines
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.580]   will like this is getting featured in this curated area is going to clearly help Wall
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:26.120]   Street Journal is a part of it, but not the full Wall Street Journal, apparently. I subscribe
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:31.880]   so I can't tell I get, but it's $149 a year. I get a digital Wall Street Journal. If you
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.880]   use the $10 a month subscription or a week, no, a month subscription from Apple, you'll
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:42.400]   only get a select portion of the content and no New York Times, no Washington Post, but
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.440]   there is the LA Times. And I think an interesting play from a newspaper that's been trying to
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.600]   fight its local image and become a national newspaper. Well, that's one way to do it.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.480]   If you're competing against the New York Times and the Washington Post, that's a chance
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:01.440]   to get, you know, it's weird. There was a there was a memo that the thing, the CEO of
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:07.440]   the Wall Street Journal circulated to employees to the company over the weekend, basically
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.960]   outlining that clarifying that node, not for we're not giving away the entire Wall Street
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:17.080]   Journal for 10 bucks a month is going to be a selection of stuff. But also kind of explaining
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.440]   why they decided to cut this deal where the New York Times and other publications didn't
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.840]   is basically saying that not basically not the he doesn't they don't feel as a company
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.040]   as though this is a product that is going to go to people who are likely to want to
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.840]   pay for the Wall Street Journal. Anyway, this is exactly what most of these are people
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.880]   that to get fresh eyes on the Wall Street Journal. And so that maybe and these are people
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.280]   that are contributing that are aren't making any money off of anyway. And maybe this way
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:51.360]   they can convert these people into paying Wall Street Journal users, particularly when,
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.960]   for instance, they there's something they want to see in the Wall Street Journal archives,
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.400]   or they want to see business analysis that they seem to be holding back as part of the
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:06.640]   paid package. So we're seeing a we're seeing a lot of plans to try to introduce a publication
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:12.080]   to people who aren't going to see it otherwise, and maybe pull them into the website where
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.240]   they can then go and become like a full bore subscriber.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:23.000]   So I I subscribe to the New Yorker app. The experience in the New Yorker app is is very
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:33.160]   different if you compare that to this experience of the New Yorker on on Apple's news plus.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.560]   You'll get the same New Yorker typeface, which is nice. If you open the magazine, you get
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.320]   a cover. This is that new Apple interface where you kind of get a table of contents.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:48.200]   But when you want to read it, you if you maybe don't swipe, you have to tap on. Okay, so
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.000]   it is actually New Yorker has done something different than other magazines. They actually
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.880]   look like they've done something a little fancier. Most other magazines was very much like texture
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:04.320]   where you would swipe over and then you get basically a PDF scan of the magazine, including
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.480]   ads. So other magazines. Yeah, each of them each one is different or some of them are
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.160]   different. That's how it was on texture. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm glad to see the New Yorkers
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:18.920]   put a little more energy into the digital version on here. Didn't didn't they mention
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:26.240]   either yesterday or sometime that for certain for certain screen combinations like the iPhone,
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.240]   they will actually break if they have access to the actual text of the PDF, they will break
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:36.920]   up the PDF and make it more readable for phones. You don't have to pinch and zoom on this tiny
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.960]   little iPhone SE screen. Good. I hope they do because that that is a big issue, of course.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:47.520]   Well, let me just show you wrote. I don't know if this is going to look bad on my screen.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:55.440]   This on my iPhone is retro gamer. Yeah. So it's it's the tiny little page by page and
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.200]   it would tap a page and open it up. Let's see. Do you do you have to kind of move around
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:08.000]   within it to read it? It's a little great. Yeah. So yeah, that's not. Yeah. So you have
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   to pinch it. Yeah. Yeah. So some of them are still like that. The Apple when they demonstrated
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.560]   it, they demonstrated on an iPhone and iPad. But I was surprised when they demonstrated
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:22.040]   on the iPad, they did it in portrait mode. But I guess that actually now that I've used
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:28.000]   it for a while makes more sense because if you're doing it in landscape mode, you get
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.640]   this permanent, well, not permanent, but you get a gutter on here. Whereas if you do it
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.520]   in portrait mode, it just kind of you seem is a more natural experience. And the gutter
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:43.240]   is a floating floating gutter that goes away when you're reading. And again, it depends
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.400]   on the production of the magazine because some magazines, you can tap the image and
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.640]   zoom and some magazines, there's no zooming at all. So obviously it's still up to the
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:57.440]   publisher to decide how they want to you can't zoom the text here on this New Yorker.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:04.840]   You know, when I when I thought about Apple news plus yesterday and the magazines, one
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:10.440]   of the the first things that I thought of was I actually stopped reading magazines years
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:22.800]   ago and get more detailed news through RSS feeds. And I like what Apple news does. You
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.240]   know, you have different sections and there's content from a lot of different publishers.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:33.880]   But actually, and I wrote that yesterday and I get I get a lot of news and you know, tidbits
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:41.240]   and things like that from podcasts that I like to listen to. But when I subscribe to
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:49.920]   Apple news plus and you go through that front page, it's it's actually quite nice because
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:57.520]   you do get stories from a lot of different publications. Yes. So you can read, you know,
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:08.160]   more in depth magazine stories from these publications based on a topic, you know, whatever they
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:13.680]   put in there for you, whether it's sports or cars or be careful though, because for instance,
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.800]   I don't read people magazine never would have no interest in the content. But because in
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:24.640]   demoing this yesterday, I opened an article on people magazine. It is now in my for you
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:29.480]   section Elizabeth Hasselbeck takes all tells all about her time on the view. I never watched
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.880]   the view. I don't even know who Elizabeth Hasselbeck is. And I certainly don't want
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:38.520]   to read that article, but it is front and center. It's like the top article and for you. And
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.960]   I only open people once. So there's a way to go. Well, I think once you open it, you
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:51.040]   can unheart it. I don't know. I think actually, I think it's just because you are subscribed
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.680]   to news plus right now, because I literally didn't open a people magazine. You're getting
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:01.880]   it too. And I have people from center and I have variety. I don't want variety, but
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.720]   populated heavily in there too. And these are both magazines that so far I haven't opened
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:14.600]   yet. So I think they're just just lighting information. So this isn't for you. For everybody.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.440]   Okay. Because it knows I subscribe to the Wall Street Journal, though, it's giving me
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:23.320]   a good selection of Wall Street Journal stuff. NFL football, it must, you know, I've selected
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:29.120]   these because of years of use of Apple news. So a lot of this comes from my previous use
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:36.920]   of Apple news. It would be very interesting. I subscribe to Apple news this morning. And
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:43.080]   I just got an alert that your Apple news subscription has expired. Okay, there's some
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:49.320]   growing pains. In fact, there's some people who in addition to the crash, which as far
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.560]   as I know has fixed, it was like a server update that they did. They didn't have to
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:59.760]   push out an operating system update. But some people have been complaining or commenting
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:04.720]   on the fact that they haven't been able to get family sharing to update. And I think
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:10.320]   it's just a matter of just wait. A couple of people that downloaded it yesterday at
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.800]   Imore had the same situation where their family sharing devices weren't, it just wasn't showing
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.240]   it. And it's supposed to just happen automatically. You literally open your news app, whether you
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:26.280]   had anything to do with the lead family members subscribing or not, you just open it up and
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:31.640]   there you have it. And some of some people, it just wasn't showing up at all. And they
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:37.240]   would delete the app and reinstall it, restart their devices, do all the normal things that
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.440]   you would do, make sure that they were signed in with the right Apple ID, all that kind
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:46.120]   of stuff. And it just never worked. And then just suddenly it worked. So I think in some
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.000]   circumstances is just wait. It'll update hopefully.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.400]   I mean, now we're nitpicking, but the sharing feature leaves a little bit to be desired.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:02.000]   And I wasn't sure what would happen. But if I share a story from Apple News, if somebody
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.120]   has Apple News, they'll get that story. But if they don't, they'll get a link that promotes
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.600]   Apple News. That's kind of that's kind of an issue for me. Because honestly, mostly
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:17.760]   what I want to do when I'm perusing news is bookmark it for use on our shows. So I
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.440]   can't really use this for that.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:26.400]   That's that's my problem too. I really, I hope that particularly when you go from a
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.880]   web article or something that's available, let's say on the LA Times, but also on the
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:34.400]   website, if you want to share it with somebody who is not on Apple News, I hope that they
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:40.680]   allow you to give you give them a link that takes them to the web version of that. It's
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:45.560]   it's a company. It's it's better than I thought it would be. I think they presented it exactly
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:50.280]   the way that they should have presented it, which is not as we are creating a revolution
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:55.200]   in news and distribution. We've got we've created a five minute video explaining our
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.600]   vision, but more like, yes, we bought this app and we've rebranded it and now we've enhanced
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.040]   it because we have the ability to make deals with larger publications. We're bringing in
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:08.080]   these these other great publications you're going to want to be a part of. It still remains
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.080]   to be seen whether this is a really great platform for people for publications that
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:19.560]   are trying to have one foot and print publishing, one foot in the web or publications that
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:25.760]   are doing in saturation local coverage, but they want to have they want to be able to
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.920]   project their content into the screens of their local readers, but also to make it available
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.000]   to people who are looking for news about the region. If they don't live in that certain
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.840]   region, it's a it's a sticking point. We're going to find out how much data Apple is willing
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:47.560]   to share with these publications because it's it is a privacy issue. Then it is a feature
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:52.040]   of the system that Apple is not going Apple is unlike the unlike a website. It's not going
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.280]   to be collecting data. It's not going to be loading up the cookies. It's not going to
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.040]   be tracking you from place to place to place. On the other hand, particularly when you have
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:04.320]   a local publication, a local news publication, they need to have that relationship that's
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.920]   more direct and more kind of intimate with their readers so that they know who are they're
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:13.600]   reaching? What areas of the region are they reaching? What topics are getting the are
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:18.040]   getting the most views? Which do they need to hire more local political reporters? Do
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:22.000]   they need to hire more local sports reporters? That sort of thing. And once you basically
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.360]   if you if Apple decides to drop that iron curtain so that they'll get some kind of
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.280]   money for some kind of views, but they will never know who's reading the stuff, what's
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.760]   popular and what they need to keep focusing on. That's not a great deal for a local news
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:41.160]   news site. And notice there are no, aside from the LA Times, there are no local. There's
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.120]   no newspapers on here at all. By the way, I found now it took me a little fiddling around.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:52.680]   If I don't want people magazine, whatever I go, I go to the share sheet. And then they've
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:59.960]   added some items to share love story, dislike story, block channel. So that's actually now
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:06.240]   used to be a control on the page. But now it's actually in the share sheet. So just in case
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:12.800]   case you want to block people, I am now blocking people. No, you can also add content from that
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:22.000]   share sheet and a bookmark to Safari. Nice. So that's the thing that kind of bugs me about
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.560]   this. And by the way, I will subscribe. I subscribe to texture. I really like having it.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.440]   I mean, it's perfect for an iPad. It's all that content on iPad. Great for travel. You
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:34.680]   know, you does have offline uses. They pointed out, well, automatically download magazines
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:40.680]   that you're interested in. But it also, and I worry when I see tech crunch in the cut
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:49.920]   and skim on there, it is Apple's walled garden alternative to an open web. And and honestly,
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:55.480]   that scares me a little bit. I hate what way it scares you because you want to be able
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.000]   to read all those horrible things on the internet. I think the internet, the opening
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.200]   is one of the best things mankind has ever done in a closed wall garden brought to you
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:09.280]   by a single company that charges you for that content is not a desirable alternative.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:16.920]   But you don't you don't need to subscribe to it. This is for people who know, but at
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:21.080]   in time, this might replace it. That's my fear. Just this Facebook is starting to replace
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:26.600]   the internet for a lot of people. Andy, this is the trend. This is what's happening. Not
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:33.560]   apps as like this, not as content aggregation in a walled garden and things like Facebook
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.880]   are totally replacing the open internet.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:41.680]   I agree that that's the way that's working. But so is literally using the internet. If
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.760]   you're just doing a general Google search, it's it's aggregating information based on
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:51.640]   your personal taste. Then you go to a web page, then you're going to somebody's blog.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:56.840]   Well, you can do it is because it hasn't gone away entirely yet, but it's slowly being
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.560]   replaced. And there are a lot of people who don't leave Facebook. It's like a well.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:07.400]   I think that the people that don't leave Facebook and the people that Apple is trying to get
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:14.280]   for these magazine subscriptions, maybe a bit different. And there's no reason that
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:19.360]   you can't go out and purchase subscriptions to these magazines and go to their website
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:24.280]   individually if you want. It'll cost you a lot more than $10 a month. But you can do
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:31.520]   that. Apple is putting together a package here where people that want these types of
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:36.880]   subscriptions to be able to get them easily in all in one place. And like I said earlier
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:45.160]   about the Apple News Plus homepage, that to me is the most compelling part of the whole
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:51.360]   subscription, which I didn't really notice yesterday. But after I subscribed and I saw
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:58.240]   that homepage, I was impressed with that because it didn't tie me into, okay, here are 300
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:05.640]   magazines. What is it that I want to read today? It was more of here are some interesting
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:11.760]   stories from the 300 magazines that we have. I love that approach. That's what I really
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:12.760]   think is so.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:17.480]   I don't deny it superior to an individual app for each magazine, which is also contrary
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:21.280]   to an open web where you can use a browser and surf around and you can use it in a variety
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:26.320]   of devices. And honestly, I think this undermines that completely. And how many times you go
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:30.560]   to a website now on a mobile device that says, you know, the experience would be much better
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:39.920]   on our app, including Reddit. I think that that is a very malign in tendency.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:45.840]   It really depends on your point of view. And it really depends, as Jim was saying, on what
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.560]   kind of user is using this sort of thing and how they intend to use it. Reddit, even on
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:56.080]   the web, is kind of one of those aggregators that you talk about. When I, part of my morning
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:02.080]   hunt is, as when I open up my laptop and see what fresh hell awaits me after eight hours
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:08.480]   of sleep, one of the places I go is I go to Twitter, I go to Reddit, I go to a couple
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:12.240]   of other, a couple of message boards. And usually there's a list of links that people
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:17.720]   have set up just to create a comment on. And that's where I find out about, oh, well, here's
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:22.560]   a, here's a, here's a bug in Apple news that I had not encountered myself this morning
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:28.800]   or hadn't had someone scream at me about half hour after waking up. So there, every piece of news
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:34.400]   is probably going to come in some sort of a box aggregated with other content. The question is,
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:39.760]   is this Apple news app doing a good enough job of human creation? And that's one of the great
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:44.400]   advantages of Apple news versus the algorithmic approach of Google news is that there are human
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:50.480]   beings are actual there. We have, we have lots and lots of friends who are no longer in journalism
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:55.120]   because they're working inside Apple now doing essentially their old jobs, but with much, much
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:59.680]   better healthcare plans. And they're, they're selecting, they're selecting and promoting and
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:04.320]   curating content that will be front and center for all of these people. Now,
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:09.040]   you're, I don't think that's a good thing either. We don't want Apple to choose. Well, I mean,
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.520]   if Jim's content to have Apple choose all the stories he sees, that's fine. But that's not,
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.680]   I don't think that's a good way to think about what's going on in the world. Some people do.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:22.000]   I don't think that's a good idea. That's not the way that I want to get my news.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.600]   But however, for some people, that's the best user interface there is. The hope is that not
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:32.880]   only will this surface really, really obscure magazines that really don't have the resources
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:40.240]   to create a compelling web, web presentation that will work on mobile devices as well as on desk
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:46.080]   tops and well as on tablets, but also it will surface individual pieces from other publications
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.160]   they've never heard about. And maybe they will want to, as long as Apple doesn't really
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:56.640]   put any roadblocks towards someone leaving the Apple news, walled garden and going straight to
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:01.760]   the Wall Street Journal or going straight to the LA Times or going straight to BMX, Biker,
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:07.440]   magazines, website, that's okay. It's a, it's a matter of choice. But I agree with you that there
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:13.680]   is a danger if enough people fall for the snake oil that no, no, no, believe me, where we've got
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.760]   your interests at heart writers and creators and publishers. We're creating the best environment
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.560]   to present your content. Well, no, you're providing another avenue for their content.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.800]   And so long as you don't accept a really bad deal from Apple, which is probably what they're
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.560]   likely to offer you, you'll be okay. So long as you don't put all your rigs in this one.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:37.600]   If I'm reading a Wired article on Apple's news, plus can I then go to, is there any way to use
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.720]   Apple news plus to open that article in Safari?
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.120]   Oh, you know, that was one thing that we were asking about and I hadn't even tried that yet.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.280]   Let's find out. I could tell you the only way to do it is to, you can add it to the Safari
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.200]   reading list, but I don't know if that just. And then it goes back to Apple news plus.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.480]   Yeah. So, so it is, so I'm just saying the arguments you guys give are the same arguments
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:03.120]   people give. I love living in a gated community. It's safe. It's fine. And there are a lot of
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:09.600]   positive arguments for that. But ultimately it's, it's deleterious to the ecosystem, in my opinion.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:18.240]   Okay. Leo, I have to back you up here for just a sec. You said that I am content to allow Apple
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:25.280]   editors to pick out articles for me. That's not necessarily true. What I'm saying is that
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:35.200]   with a catalog of 300 magazines, the fact that Apple would pick out articles that may be a starting
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:42.800]   point for me is good. Now, this morning I did go into National Geographic magazine and took a look
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:49.760]   through there as I was scanning through some. There are a lot of stories, a lot of great journalism
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:57.920]   in magazines that I would never see if Apple didn't do that page. So I'm, I am happy that Apple
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:03.120]   is pulling out some of this content and saying, Hey, here's something you might be interested in.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:11.840]   This is a story about Eric Clapton, but it's in this magazine that you may not read. So if I go
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:16.400]   in there and then I go down a rabbit hole of reading different articles from this magazine,
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:22.160]   that's good for me as a reader. It's good for the magazine because it's giving them some exposure.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:31.280]   I may highlight that article on Twitter or on the website. It's a starting point for people. And I
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:38.080]   think that even for me with the amount of time I have in a day, which oftentimes isn't much,
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:45.840]   here's 300 magazines go through them. I just, I don't have time for that. Here are some stories
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:51.120]   from 300 magazines that we think you'll find interesting. Great. There's a good starting point
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:56.800]   for me and off I go. So I think that they're presenting it in a way that is going to give people
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:03.520]   a place to start. And there's no reason that you can't deep dive from there.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:12.560]   I mean, I have RSS feeds for news sites and for sites that I really like to read and authors
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:20.080]   that I really like to read. Apple News, the regular free Apple News, is still a place I go
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:26.000]   every day multiple times a day and look at what's new in there. And now Apple News Plus,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.840]   I mean, it's more in-depth journalism that I really like that. And if they can pull out some
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.960]   articles for me, then I'm okay with that. But I'm not going to rely on that.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:42.640]   It's also something to consider when you think about the financial situation that some people
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:47.840]   learn that they can't afford all of these subscriptions, or maybe even one or two of these subscriptions.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:53.840]   And for the $10 a month price, you and your family can read national geographics, but can also read
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:58.480]   the national review and the New Yorker. And so for people whose finances aren't really
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:06.880]   as high as they want it to be, their family gets access to a lot of sort of high concept and
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:11.920]   really educational articles that they maybe couldn't have afforded before. And I think that's a
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:18.640]   leveling of the playing field for a lot of people who might have wanted to be able to read the New
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:24.160]   Yorker, but literally couldn't afford to. Because that's a weekly. So that one's, I can't remember,
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.320]   but it's pretty pricey per month. I used to have a subscription too. And it was a little bit too
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:32.480]   pricey for me at the time. And now for $10 a month, I can read the New Yorker and I can read all these
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:37.200]   other magazines. So yeah, and I don't deny that. In fact, as I said, I subscribed to Texture for
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:42.480]   years and I will subscribe to this. I do like it. I value it. I just worry about the walled garden
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.480]   aspect of it. We're going to take a break and come back. There's lots more to talk about. I mean,
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.680]   that's news plus. That's the only thing Apple announced yesterday that you can get
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:57.360]   today. But there is a lot more in the announcement, including Jennifer Garner. So we're going to get
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:02.560]   how is it that she was there? There were a lot of people like Chris Evans were there.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:10.080]   At least we saw him on the Apple feed. But look at all the people who were there who didn't show
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:15.760]   where were they backstage for at a party? She was probably looking for me. Oh, that's it. Of course.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:21.120]   You know, she was saying I heard Del Rimples here. Where is he? I need a new battery by Mike Pack.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:26.960]   Where's the sound guy? Oh, that must be him. But then she saw that he was sitting next to me and
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:32.000]   was like, Oh, she's too cool. I guess I'm just. I can't compete with that. Kill. Oh, man. Damn it.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.560]   Once again, first she, first she steals what's his name and now this. It's terrible.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:44.800]   Who's the good looking guy? I can't remember. That would be me. Oh, yeah. That's it. Our show
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:50.960]   today brought to you by my dinner. I love Hello Fresh. We've been cooking Hello Fresh
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:58.560]   for a while now. Melty Monterey Jack burgers with red onion, jam garlic mayo and crispy breaded zucchini,
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:05.360]   Tuscan sausage and pepper spaghetti, creamy dill chicken with roast potatoes and asparagus.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:09.680]   You know, the thing about Hello Fresh is you're going to get you don't have to do the meal planning.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:16.080]   You don't have to you don't have to buy the ingredients. They do the meal planning,
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:21.040]   the shopping. They even do the prepping. It's like a sous chef that arrives at your door and then
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:28.480]   you've got this amazing meal ready for you to whip up in 30 minutes or less and it is delicious.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:33.840]   I appreciate it too because as some of you know, I'm on a keto diet. So I can take those Hello Fresh
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:40.080]   meals and modify them so that Michael and Lisa who aren't can have a luscious meal and I can
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:47.520]   modify the sauces or the or some of the things so I can have my keto meal. It's really fantastic.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:53.680]   All meals come together in 30 minutes max and use less than two pots and pans and I appreciate
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:33:00.160]   Hello Fresh's attention to that because I'm the pot scrubber too and cleanup is minimal.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:05.600]   You'll make family dinners fuss free with Hello Fresh's picky eater kid tested and approved
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:11.040]   family plans. They have a number of different plans as a veggie plan, a classic plan and a
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:16.880]   family plan. I like the family plan because Michael is very picky but he always loves those
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:22.000]   Hello Fresh meals, especially the melty Monterey Jack burgers. Oh, I just leave the garlic mayo
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   off for him and put it on for me. Mm. That's more for me. It might fun features too. There's a
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.200]   dinner to lunch. Did you see that one where there's enough for your dinner and your lunch. I love
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:39.040]   that 20 minute meals if you're in a hurry. Gourmet meals if you're a gourmet and of course
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:47.040]   one pot wonders which I think you know a lot of these I'm going to cook again and again and again.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:53.200]   That's the other thing with Hello Fresh you're learning new meals new ideas. You're really expanding
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:34:00.720]   what your repertoire includes and I love the way the Hello Fresh meals and recipe information get
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:05.520]   packaged clear nutritional information. They come in brown paper bags so everything you need is in
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:11.680]   that one bag which is really nice and by the way those meal kits fit perfectly in the fridge so I
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:16.160]   don't have to go looking for ingredients. I just pop them in the fridge. It's also fun for us because
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:21.840]   we get the Hello Fresh box and some weeks we distribute just as a benefit to our staff. We distribute
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.920]   them and they just pull out the bag. They've got exactly what they want. I have to say though
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:33.840]   these guys you guys you guys are repacious. The staff jumps on this Hello Fresh box. Our
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:41.520]   box came yesterday. Lisa had already gone home so she called in to say hey bring that box to home to
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:50.080]   us. It was already gone. I hope you enjoy that box. John I'm looking at you. Hello Fresh.

[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:52.960]   All right. By the way I loved this picture that they showed the vanity fair style picture of all the
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:36:00.800]   Apple TV plus creators with Oprah front and center. And there's Jennifer Garner by the way.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:09.200]   He's seen right there. Let's talk about after they announced news plus they moved on to the
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:15.280]   credit card right. Is that the next thing I think it was. And we're starting to learn a little bit
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:21.680]   more about the Apple card. It makes a lot of sense. It's something we knew that Apple or thought
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:27.520]   Apple was going to do. They had we had heard partnered with Goldman Sachs to make this card.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:33.440]   For a long time Alex Lindsey on the show has been saying Apple should get into financial services
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:42.720]   banking even. The Apple card is a good first step. It isn't well it is a card but really that's not
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:49.440]   the chief way you'll use it. You'll use it with your Apple watch or your iPhone. The card interest
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:53.520]   rate now that we're seeing the fine print they said it's going to be low but they didn't say what
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:58.320]   it was. They also said it won't be available till later this summer. We now know that the interest
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:05.200]   rate varies somewhere between 13 and 24 percent depending on your credit. Not that low. Not that
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:12.080]   low. And there's no late fees but they will they will start increasing the the the the the
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:16.240]   interest rate. Yeah. How is that different from late fee? You don't pay. We're going to increase
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:21.360]   your rate. Exactly. We're not a late fee. Yeah. It's the gift that keeps on giving. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:28.480]   It's it's really weird. I mean I don't I it's it's an easy money maker for Apple. I absolutely see
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:35.840]   the business sense of this but that's a very very slippery piece of pond that they've stepped on.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:44.240]   The idea of making it so easy to tap a button on your phone and five seconds later they're saying
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:50.480]   get approval if you're if you qualify to get this card. So as soon as your impulse hits you that hey
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:55.920]   I want this credit card that I didn't want five minutes ago you've got this card and it's just not
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:04.640]   a good look for Apple to have people who are making to be making a lot of money off of interest fees
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:10.960]   on a card that people maybe didn't want to begin with but you get you get into credit card debt and
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:18.320]   they're now in the in the business of our customers are now paying us 12% 15% 17% 22% 24%
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:26.960]   which is which is a look that we've come to appreciate from Chase and from Wells Fargo and
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.840]   from all these other banks. It's not the sort of thing that we've come to appreciate as something
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:39.040]   that Apple would do. So I just think this is a a logical move a profitable move but I don't know
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:43.360]   why they feel as though they have to do this. I don't know I don't feel as though they're they're
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:49.040]   making things any better. I think of credit card. I think of credit card companies as a bit
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:56.320]   of a drugs of society kind of kind of thing and to have Apple. Wait a minute. You think credit
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:05.360]   cards are the drugs of society? They prey on people and they're necessary for us to be able to
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:10.880]   exist in society but if it weren't for credit card companies we wouldn't have had to use credit
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:17.840]   card companies to exist in society. So yeah the whole point is for them to make money off of you
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:22.000]   because you don't have enough money and for Apple to be a part of this kind of
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.160]   making money off of your lack of money just seems really I don't know just a little
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:35.760]   dirty I think. A bad look a bad look. So I mean using using those arguments we're saying that
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:40.800]   anybody with money doesn't have a credit card. I have plenty of credit cards dressed. No but
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:47.280]   that's because that's because of the way I get what you're saying but I think for a lot of people
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:53.680]   that was one of the announcements yesterday that really impressed me the most because Apple is
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:40:01.440]   making this so easy for people not to get tied into something but to actually apply and to use
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:08.160]   and to see immediately where they're spending and what their payment can be and how much interest
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:14.720]   you're going to pay. I mean those other drugs of society don't do that they don't want you to pay
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:20.960]   off your card. They try and hide as much from you I think as they possibly can
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:29.600]   where Apple is trying to be upfront and saying here it is. And it makes sense only in the fact that
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:39.200]   it's for your phone. It's for Apple Pay. That's the main. I think Laurie those point and I think
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:46.960]   it's well taken is if you can apply for credit card that easily that's sucking you into a trap
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:51.280]   and by the way yeah you're going to get it but you'll there'll be limits depending on your credit
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:59.040]   and notice that interest rate goes from 13.24% up to 24% that's got to be tied to your credit
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:06.400]   right? Your credit score. 24% interest is you serious and I think that's your point Laurie is
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:12.480]   that this can get people into a lot of trouble. And I think it's great just like Jim is saying
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:19.040]   that that Apple is providing a very easy way for you to see how much you're spending and how much
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:25.280]   you're spending on interest and all that kind of stuff. But we already have these kind these means
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:32.160]   of budgeting and recognizing our finances and if we're not actively doing it ourselves what
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:38.880]   makes Apple or anybody think that having it in your wallet instead of on I need a budget or
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.800]   mint or something like that. Are there plenty of FinTech apps that do this?
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:48.800]   Yeah so if you're not already good at saving and making sure that you're paying down your credit
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:56.960]   card and not going overboard with your credit I think it's wrong to assume that Apple is
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:03.920]   positioned to help people to better finance their credit just because it's Apple. When that already
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:09.680]   exists all over in the world and hasn't helped people that do struggle financially. Obviously
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:14.080]   a lot of us, yes I'm going to get the Apple credit card. I've got great credit. I know how
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:19.440]   to manage my credit cards. I have low balances on everything so for me yeah it's great but there
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:23.600]   are people out there who they're just going to get another credit card because there's another
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:29.520]   credit card and now they're up paying 24% and yeah Apple's like you can pay twice this month in
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:34.240]   order to reduce your how much you owe and they're going to say no I don't have enough money.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:41.360]   I'm just going to keep spending so it's beautiful and awesome and very dangerous to assume that
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:46.080]   having an Apple credit card is somehow going to make you better at taking care of your credit cards.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:52.800]   Also I want to get the latest hot wonderful cool Apple design product is this cool titanium credit
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:58.480]   card and because there's no annual fees it won't cost whatever cost me anything.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:02.880]   Yeah if you don't use it that's a good point you can just have a nice piece of titanium in your
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:08.640]   pocket. You might be able to kill someone with. By the way the only one of the only videos they
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:13.840]   showed and the only product video they showed at this event was a very Johnny Ive style
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:21.600]   the making of the titanium credit card video which kind of cracks me up. Am I the only one that
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:26.800]   thinks of a diagnosis or thought of a diagnosis the first moment that credit card appeared on screen
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:31.680]   the the black card for millennials if you remember. Oh I do remember that you want to immediately what
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:37.840]   I thought. Yeah here he cursed her to the fire from the people who brought you fire the fire festival.
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:42.960]   Yeah well luckily Apple has already proven that they know how to put on a music festival.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:49.440]   So this titanium well that was mostly was he's no longer with the custom company the US festival.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.440]   Yeah he wasn't an apple when he did the US festival spent almost every penny he had on that thing.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:59.040]   So really the thing that makes this different
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:07.200]   besides the titanium credit card with no number on it from other credit cards is that it's more
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:13.280]   private right like Apple Pay is private so when I use my Apple Watch or iPhone to pay
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:18.400]   at Whole Foods Whole Foods gets a token gets the money but doesn't get any information about me
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:24.320]   at all and that's what Apple is saying about this although obviously the back end transaction
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:29.280]   handled by Goldman Sachs they have to know all of that because they have to give me credit and
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:33.840]   know my address and all that stuff and I'm sure I'm not going to get a paper bill.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:39.520]   I don't know maybe I am I don't know how I'm going to pay this off. How do you pay an apple
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:45.440]   but do you write them a check? I think you pay it right in the app with what you have well you
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.640]   have to know you would have to go directly with another credit card.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:53.600]   You can't pay credit. If you have Apple Pay that's Apple Pay I believe that's connected directly
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:58.080]   to a bank account as opposed to connected to another Visa or MasterCard I believe you can do it that
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:03.280]   way. The whole principle of credit is that you can't pay you can't pay off credit with
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:07.040]   unsecured money so I'm sure that there's well you do that.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:12.000]   That's kind of an unanswered question is how do you pay it you'd have to connect your maybe this
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.840]   is a secondary benefit to Apple connect your Apple Pay account to your bank account.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:20.400]   That's something yeah or possibly a PayPal and others really love you to do.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:27.040]   Well this and there's also another benefit where if they're if you pay through actual Apple Pay
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:32.880]   with your phone you're doing it through a Transactor whereas if Apple is actually the card
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.280]   issue where they're they're they're basically keeping all the money that your Visa or your
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:42.800]   that your MasterCard would have collected as for transacting that thing so basically
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:47.840]   you're saving the money every time you pace for something with an Apple credit card as opposed to
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.560]   with Apple Pay that's connected to someone else's credit card.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:56.000]   It is nice that they're doing a lot of stuff that any bank could have done
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.360]   five years ago but they're banks they're not interested in improving their product.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:07.840]   Like the idea of what if we just don't even have the numbers on the card so people can't
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:13.120]   shoulder surf them off of you and what if we have actually have a we're not going to monetize
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:18.560]   your buying history we are obviously can't promise is going to be as secret and secure as
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:22.800]   anything else that we put on the phone because this is part of credit history this is part of
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:28.320]   credit reporting. Well yeah I mean that's a question is this go to Equifax Experian Transunion as well.
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:34.640]   It would almost have to. So there are some advantages to it there's some cashback features but
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:39.760]   not as good as what you get on most other cards. Yeah I would look at I would go to Nerd Wallet
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:45.680]   before you sign up for this card because they don't give you price matching they don't give you
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:50.160]   buyer protection they don't give you a lot of stuff that you would get just from your regular
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:55.680]   local bank or credit unions credit card so as usual you have to shop around it's not so maybe
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:00.080]   it's not a good idea to simply say ooh new credit card great I'll tap this button and go get it.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:05.040]   Although although on that point I did want to point something out Steve Aquino who does
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:10.400]   really great journalists who covers accessibility issues particularly with Apple had a couple of
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:16.000]   things to say very positive about the Apple card that won the process of because the process of
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.360]   applying is so easy that removes a barrier for people who have accessibility issues. That's a good
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:26.560]   also the fact that all these statements are again being surfaced not just as an email
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:33.360]   or god forbid a piece of printed paper but through the iPhone and the iOS interface that means that
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:38.640]   voiceover works with all that stuff so in the ability to manage your own finances if you don't
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:44.160]   if you have accessibility issues this is this is he says that's a big help for that sort of stuff.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:48.880]   So there are there are this isn't a I'm not I don't want to say that this is a bad idea
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.880]   start to finish I don't think it's bad at all but I think that again I don't like I don't like the
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:48:04.400]   the idea of people owing having a struggling to pay off 22% 24% interest to Apple and Apple
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:10.960]   making money off of that I also don't think they're doing and it's just a weird business for them
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:16.480]   to be in it's a very profitable business for them to be in but it's not this is this is this was
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:22.880]   for me this was the keynote for for almost every announcement it's like I found myself thinking
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:28.160]   what if Nabisco made each of these announcements what if Nabisco said we're doing and now we have
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:32.880]   a Nabisco credit card yes they could have done this they probably wouldn't have done this a whole
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:37.760]   lot differently because they would have gone through a a middle trans actor that would give you these
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:42.080]   features and now we've got we've decided we've because we've got lots and lots of profits we're
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:47.120]   buying lots and lots of content for our own streaming service again that's not dissimilar to how
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:53.520]   Nabisco or any other company would have done this so that's why I'm not I'm just so meh on this
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:59.440]   on this Apple card and so much of what was announced yesterday I do want a titanium card but I think
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:04.560]   you're right Andy just don't use it then yeah I'll pass to both worlds and you probably cut me with
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:12.560]   it because it's you know titanium so another thing the Steve Steve Woztak was first with I think of
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:18.080]   yeah right I think a very good point though about accessibility so that's that's good but you know
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:24.160]   that's I think before you apply for this card it would be prudent to go to nerd wallet or some
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:29.760]   other site where you can compare rates compare cash back and see if this is the best thing you can
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:36.000]   get somebody pointed out you so you get 1% on real life transactions non-apple pay transactions you
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:43.120]   get 2% on apple pay transactions 3% on apple purchases from apple but somebody pointed out or
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:50.240]   I could use my target card to buy my next iPhone at target and get 5% back and so you really it's
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:56.320]   important to consider all of these things it's sexy it's hot but honestly when you really get
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:02.000]   down to it it's not so different than a credit card yeah and because it is a master it does present
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.280]   as a master card when it's presented to to just a regular till the other the other thing that I
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:11.040]   it's they said that the knock it's another one of those announcements is going to take months
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:16.480]   before it's actually released I'm going to be fascinated by the pages and pages of fine print
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:22.960]   because something that a friend was sort of kind of almost jokingly bring up with me saying well
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:28.880]   so if you're if you're behind on your on your apple credit card does that could they turn off
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:35.680]   your access to iCloud as a way of pressuring you to pay your bill do they have the ability to limit
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:42.240]   your access to devices if they feel as though you're so far behind the problems I'm sure if
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:48.720]   it's doing that I don't I have no I'm not saying they would but I'm saying I'd be this is the sort
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:54.400]   of stuff that I I find myself ask I find myself realizing that I don't know if they could or
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:58.320]   couldn't do that they would depends on their terms of service would depend on what you what you
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:04.960]   agree to when you tapped a button and waited for five waited five seconds to it depends on what
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:09.120]   all the stuff that you acknowledge that you read and agreed to without actually reading or agreeing
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:15.120]   so one thing one thing that is clear with a whole event is this really is apple pivoting away
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:21.680]   from hardware they made all the hardware announcements by press release last week and moving towards
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:26.720]   services and that's what Tim if you know if you know if jibs jobs signature achievement was the
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:32.960]   Mac the iPhone the iPad the iPod Tim Cook's signature achievement may well be that pivoting
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:38.960]   to services and creating services the editorial on investa pedia says that the real point of
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:44.240]   the apple card is it's the ultimate loyalty tool it's it's stickiness and I would say that
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:51.120]   just as apple news is about bringing you into apples ecosystem everything announced yesterday
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:58.800]   is about bringing you into apples ecosystem and increasing your value your dollar value per user
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:06.240]   that you know not by purchases of apple products but by using apple services and that's an interesting
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:15.040]   shift to you know to apples business model it's a big it's a big shift besides uh now as we as we go
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:20.560]   down the rabbit hole here we're going to get farther and farther out and less and less details the
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:25.920]   next was apple arcade which is and we don't know when it'll be available sometimes this fall we
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:33.200]   don't know what it will cost apple says you'll have a hundred games to play for a subscription fee
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:40.800]   uh none of those games will be free or freemium knowing that purchases they'll all be you pay
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.680]   in them you know normally you pay in amount to play the game but you'll pay one flat fee and get
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:51.680]   access to all of those games it looked like they were really targeting indie game labs they didn't
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:56.800]   announce any titles uh i guess they'll all be exclusive though they did say you won't be able
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:02.160]   to play these games anywhere else and they're and they're also helping fundings uh the creation
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:06.080]   of some of these games too i didn't hear that oh that's interesting so that's a very positive
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:11.040]   thing i like uh this is one of the this is actually probably my favorite announcement because
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:16.000]   that's it solves a really really huge problem particularly for parents uh the ability to simply
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.320]   say here kid any game that's in this that's in this apple game subscription you can play it forever
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:26.960]   do whatever you want knowing that number one it's very very tightly curated you're not going to
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:32.880]   find nastiness in there because this is all essentially apple published games uh there's no place where
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:37.440]   they're going to see advertisements there's no place where they're going to be encouraged to buy
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:41.040]   more systems from an appearance point eight hundred dollars that's the most important thing is
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:47.280]   you're not going to stack up big charges for uh simpson's donuts and things like that and i love
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:51.920]   the idea of apple supporting independent creators i've some of the some of the greatest classes i
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:56.160]   saw the greatest classes offer from times in terms of creativity is gaming because this is
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:54:02.320]   probably the the last the last class of widely distributed software that you can conceivably have
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:08.800]   just two absolute mutants writing this get writing this thing uh every single night after they get
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:12.880]   off of work for months and months and months it could be just the most bizarre thing that just
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:18.320]   these two mutants think is a wonderful idea for a game and then your mind your mind is blown away
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:24.000]   because you have never ever seen anything like this before so how much is this gonna cost probably
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:32.160]   the the furthest thing from a gamer that you could ever get in the tech world i i don't play games i
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:38.240]   really have no interest in playing games i'd rather play my guitar but what they did with arcade
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:46.000]   yesterday signals to me how serious they are about services you know we all knew that this was going
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:57.120]   about big services uh event but the gaming one gaming are some of the most popular items on the
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:05.120]   app store and to pull all that stuff together and now say and we're gonna have this uh apple arcade
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:13.840]   i mean they are they are trying to uh leverage every bit of services that they can and i'm not
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:18.240]   saying that they're you know wrong in doing the arcade i think it's great that they're doing it
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:25.600]   like andy said even helping uh developers bring some of these games to life that's all great stuff
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:32.800]   but it's also uh a great revenue stream for apple to say okay here you go here under games i don't
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:37.440]   know what the average cost for games is but you know i think it's pretty typically under ten dollars
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:44.400]   for these kinds of games maybe five to eight dollars uh you get a hundred games unlimited play
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:50.000]   as long as you keep playing that monthly fee what is the fee they didn't say no no i know but what
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.840]   would yeah exactly expect ten i would say ten dollars probably ten everything there's
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:56:00.000]   mentioning has to be ten bucks yeah that's what you that you can't be so far ahead of your
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.880]   netflix absorption that people are that people last themselves is this going to entertain me one
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:12.720]   point five times more than my netflix encryption does so as as negative and skeptical as i am of
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:18.000]   all of these things i will probably buy them all and maybe that's the secret to the success here
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.920]   purposes for because well no it just makes sense you know if it's ten bucks some it depends what it
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:26.080]   is if it's fifty bucks a month i want to know but i pay sixty bucks now maybe it's a little more than
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:33.200]   that a year for microsoft's version of this uh which allows me access to some number of titles
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:37.840]   uh it downloads the game just like this does you play it's not a streaming service
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:43.360]   and it's worth it to me because it's and this is where the calculus is for me it costs about the
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:48.160]   same as two games a year yeah and so i know i'm going to buy that many games at least a year so
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:53.040]   it makes sense uh for me to buy that i think that's the calculus people will make here it's it's it's
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:58.720]   nice the the problem is that i i a few years ago i'm i'm embarrassed to indicate that this
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:02.800]   irresponsible with my money but a few years ago i actually had to make it a recurring calendar
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:09.520]   thing to audit all of my yes subscriptions yes figure out that oh i'm actually paying i'm actually
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:14.720]   paying sixty dollars a month for things that i signed up for just to try them out or write about
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:22.480]   them but then i forgot to do it uh and or even worse where we all do that in fact that's a monetization
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:30.480]   strategy right exactly so so that that's a danger for that's my responsibility yes but the the
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:37.760]   problem it creates is that it's a it's a great value to have a hundred games for 10 bucks a month
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:42.240]   but i'm a lot of people are going to have to say i'm already paying here's here's where i'm paying
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:46.800]   for hulu here's what i'm paying for netflix here's what i'm paying for my drop box storage here's what
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:51.440]   i'm paying for uh my my hosting for my website or whatever that isn't a calculation i have another
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:54.960]   ten bucks that's not the calculation i don't think i think people's calculation will be like more
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:59.920]   like mine which is well i played games this year how much did i spend on games this year
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:04.560]   independent of these other things i'm gonna i know i'm gonna keep doing that i'm not thinking
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:09.520]   oh i can't buy this game i gotta have my netflix so that's the amount of money apple's gonna think
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:13.760]   about is well what's that amount of money and how can we make that a little lower i think there's a
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:20.080]   second benefit that a lot of people at least this fits my mode i'm constantly looking for something
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:27.200]   fun to do another game to play and that's actually a lot of work and you often buy games that are
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:33.680]   crappy and so a curated selection of a hundred games it's almost i would think guaranteed to have
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:38.400]   one or two that i want to play for a month and if they refresh those regularly if it's the same
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:43.360]   hundred games all year that's not as good but if they refresh those regularly that's pretty compelling
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:48.160]   because it not not only is it a price somewhat similar i'm hoping to what i'd be paying probably
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:53.360]   less than what i'd be paying anyway but it's helping me by picking by putting games there that i don't
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:58.000]   have to think about and they'll just have something fun to do so i think there i think this is gonna
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:04.480]   be a success the game discovery aspect of it which is one of the hardest things exactly when you
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:09.040]   go into the app store and you're just looking for a good game to play it's difficult to know there's
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:14.000]   just so much out there and and and unless you're reading about these games you don't know what's
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:21.040]   good or what's bad or what's in your wheelhouse or in your style and this this sort of you know
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:27.120]   bundle of a hundred games and that might increase in the future gives you the chance to just play
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:31.440]   the games whether or not you like them you just try it out and go boom i played that for 10 minutes
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:35.920]   i think it's dumb i'll move on but you're you're not losing out on any money by doing that and you
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:43.440]   don't have to beg developers to make products for free these developers are getting to make
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:48.800]   these make these apps and get their apps their games funded and i actually don't know how the
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:54.960]   the money is devied out after just being funded are they going to get a cut of the
[00:59:54.960 --> 01:00:01.280]   yeah of the monthly subscription i wonder that definitely popped into my head of like i think
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:06.160]   it's great that apple is helping fund the creation of these but then what because you know some of
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:12.560]   these games are gonna is it an investment or a grant right yeah and and also is that a fixed number
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:18.320]   100 games so when they book their hundred and first game they have to drop one from the catalog or
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.320]   will the value of the catalog just get better and better and better and better and have more games
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.200]   and i think it's a good way for it to work because you want to keep it fresh
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:30.240]   presumably all these games would be available standalone for purchase right
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:37.600]   no i think they're exclusive inside you have to subscribe to get these games yeah they will there's
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:42.320]   every 100 of the games will not be available anywhere else but inside oh that i think that
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:47.920]   makes it a little harder to sell to developers because there's no opportunity are you sure it said
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:53.280]   that well we don't yeah they said that they said that they're they're arcade exclusives but that's
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:58.720]   part of the frustrating thing but what is exclusive mean only in on apple or not obviously you can't
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:04.160]   play it on an apple only in apple arcade they it was i wish i had the clip for it it said they
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:08.880]   specifically said that they're exclusive to apple rt if i'm ocean horn and ocean horn is one of the
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:13.920]   ocean horn two is one of the games they made a ton of money selling that game outright on the
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:20.480]   app store a ton millions of dollars that is a big gamble for them to say okay we'll put it in arcade
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:27.040]   they had they had sonic the hedgehog is sega gonna say oh we're gonna we're gonna turn our back on
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:32.320]   tens of millions of dollars maybe hundreds maybe two dollars maybe maybe they'll create a special
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:38.800]   sonic themed game for that's specifically for for arcade but they'll also have a paid app that has
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:44.160]   more worlds more lands or than that's gonna be a problem real thing well not not not that the
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:50.080]   arcade version is demo where but we've seen if the arcade version is worse and all kinds of
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:54.640]   different games and all kinds of compile i'm worried in that case that the if what i'm getting
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:02:01.200]   from my subscription is a lesser game or a game that isn't good enough to make money in the app store
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:06.000]   that is a non-starter well this is this is the problem with almost all these announcements the
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.800]   lack of details and the finer points that will be like for instance i would have i would think
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:17.200]   would be very exciting if the deal with developers is that we get an absolute worldwide exclusive for
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:21.840]   six months after which this is your game you can sell it or you can put it on the platform you can
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:26.720]   put it in the app store but pursuant to app store rules whatever you want to do but yeah if it becomes
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:31.760]   that if it becomes that these it goes to the lens of ghosts and wins as soon as apple decides they
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:36.640]   don't want to have an in the arcade anymore that's a problem and that is a as you say a problem for
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:41.760]   how to convince a developer to write for the spline it's already a problem for for i mean look at uh
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:48.880]   fortnight which is a free game and tim swiney the creator of it has made seven billion dollars last
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:55.760]   year in in-app purchases it's not eligible for arcade and even if it were is tim swiney gonna
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:02.240]   forego seven billion dollars this is this is the real risk that apple's gonna get only kind of
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:08.560]   mediocre games that wouldn't probably make it in the app store or or i was gonna get really
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:14.320]   fantastic games that couldn't have been made without the help of apple's funding i i think
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:21.200]   you you might be i i see this as a way for indie developers to make fantastic games because they're
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:28.640]   getting help to get these games made it's just a matter of what what then becomes of these games
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:35.680]   and and the the people that developed them once they're just in the in apple arcade will they
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:40.960]   continue to have the avenue to make money off of this game somewhere how in the future like maybe
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:46.800]   apple has a six month exclusive and then after that you can and then it's no longer in arcade but
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:51.680]   number one apple just helped a developer make a game and then number two after the exclusivity
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.840]   is over they get to do whatever they want with the game like it again we don't know the rules but
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:00.320]   i don't think it's i don't think we're looking at if you look at some of the visuals that are on the
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:06.560]   apple arcade page from apple there's a lot of these games look incredible and they look like the
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:12.640]   king the kind of games that indie developers have to work 24 hours a day seven days a week with no
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:19.840]   help and no money and to have apple come in and say here's here's some money do it make it happen
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:25.280]   hire some extra people do what you got to do then they get to actually improve their ability to
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:32.640]   make a great game and you don't have a bunch of people downloading a 599 game in the app store and
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:38.240]   saying this game is way too expensive i should get it for a dollar ninety nine because that's what
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:43.760]   most people say when they pay more than a dollar ninety nine for an app or a game they don't consider
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:49.360]   how hard the developer worked and in this case the developer worked hard the developer got funding
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:54.240]   it's ten dollars a month no matter what so it for you you don't you're not feeling the weight of
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:58.640]   what you paid for the game whether you like it or hate it this will be interesting i think the
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:03.680]   devil will be in the details if for instance i get level one of monument valley in the arcade but
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:09.440]   if you want monument valley to you go buy it this is gonna be less interesting i don't think that's
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:15.920]   what apple would do but what but what i'm thinking of is the the characters from cuphead are amazing
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:22.080]   the animation is amazing so with those developers wanted to create a new game that's optimized for
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:27.280]   a small screen like an iphone using the cuphead characters that would be if you had no idea that
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:32.960]   the console game even existed you would still think this is a incredibly cool old timey hand
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:38.480]   animated action arcade game but then so they would be almost willing to do that because it
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:43.760]   introduces people to the world of cuphead and gets them to maybe then go on to the nintendo's
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:49.680]   when they oh you're you also have a nintendo switch well we also have this really huge multi-world game
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:56.320]   called called don't don't gamble with the devil for your nintendo switch of course it's not free
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:01.040]   with your subscription but well the people you have to convince their developers and developing a
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:06.240]   game is a arduous expensive process and apple's gonna have to convince them that it's in their
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:13.040]   interest uh to give this uh an exclusive into it i wonder if hundred games are gonna be ready
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:19.360]   this fall or if it's only gonna be you know ten or fifteen of them i mean look no google and that's
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:26.160]   an apple can read google and that's stadia last week with zero games well they had a doom rehash
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:32.640]   that's it so we'll see if you're you know if you're a game studio you have some interesting options
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:38.560]   right now this is this is a very interesting play uh let's take a little break and then we'll
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:44.800]   finally talk about apple and television which is of course what everybody was waiting i was waiting
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:51.200]   personally see if oper was gonna show up and she did in a cape and a bolo tie it was interesting but
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:07:00.160]   first a word from adelassian that lassian powers our it here uh we've been happy at lassian house for
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:06.160]   the very longest of times years now using jira which is of course probably lassian's most famous
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:12.480]   tool to keep track of projects who's working on them and the status of the project it's a great way to
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:15.920]   kind of give everybody on the same page and it's nice because it integrates with the other
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:21.040]   tool we use the most confluence so we can document what's going on where our workflow is
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:26.640]   so people who come later can see what happened but that's just the start our it team is the center
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:34.480]   of our operation i bet you in your business it is too it is often the department that executes
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:41.920]   and then keeps it from breaking and then fixes it when it's broken and if you think about it
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:49.280]   everything else is is depending on it it teams have to work fast they have to work accurately
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:56.560]   applications are more complex than they've ever been incidents require a team that's open agile
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:01.280]   and can coordinate between operations and software development teams it's a challenging world
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:07.600]   expectations are high the stakes are high and it's it that's right smack dab in the middle
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:14.560]   you fall short inside of business critical workflows and and you fall a long way that's why at lassian
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:21.360]   is such a great choice software tools not just for developers but an affordable reliable suite of
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:28.000]   tools for teams of all kinds and all sizes from dev ops to agile from it apps to ops to it's m
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.040]   and whatever's next for your it department at lassian provides a technology backbone to help
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:41.920]   modern it organizations plan service and support the kind of change that propels business be an
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:50.080]   it hero take a look at jira's amazing tool everybody knows jira just loves it confluence
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:55.440]   if you've got a code base you've got to get bit bucket but then there's also ops genie and status
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:09:00.720]   page that helps you better detect incidents coordinate response efforts resolve issues faster and
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:07.280]   as a customer of the it department i think this is really important keep customers or
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:12.000]   stakeholders or partners and colleagues up to date so we know what's going on
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.840]   your it team can choose tools that are right for your current framework but trust that as you grow
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:22.160]   those tools will grow with you and it all integrates seamlessly with jira and confluence so you never
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:27.680]   have to leave that nice happy warm place that is at lassian like all of at lassian's products
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:34.480]   the tools for your it team are easy to use and importantly free to try when you go to at lassian
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:40.880]   dot com slash it found out which at lassian offering is right for your team try it lassian today is to
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:52.320]   see what it can be at lassian dot com slash it very famously in walter isakson's biography of
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:10:00.720]   steve jobs steve on his death beds said walter we've licked it we've figured out tv is this it is
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:08.720]   apple tv plus what steve jobs is talking about i think there's no way to tell what what steve was
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:14.800]   was talking about who knows but this is where they are right now and you know there were a few
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:22.800]   different announcements yesterday with uh with tv you know apple channels apple tv app and then
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:29.600]   finally the the original content and none of it is coming till this fall and we don't know how much so
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:35.760]   it's coming in may actually what oh they're going to change the app by may they're going to update
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:40.960]   may yeah apple tv plus or sorry tv plus doesn't come out to the phone oh okay got it i would have
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:48.400]   loved to have some some more detail on uh what's going on here and i said yesterday as i was
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:54.320]   walking into the event on twitter that today is the day of details and that's what really matters and
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:11:02.080]   you know unfortunately for uh for for us we didn't get a lot of details on some of this stuff but
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:08.880]   looking at the videos themselves uh and the the trailers what's funny is they didn't show those
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:13.840]   on the event at the event did they they had people come out and try to read telepromptors but they
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:22.080]   didn't show a lot of clips they they did have uh they did have some and you know there's some
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:29.120]   compelling content here and i'll be the first to admit that i was i was very worried about the
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:36.240]   content that they would have but listening to the directors and i mean you know Ron Howard and
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:44.560]   and Steven Spielberg and JJ Abrams there's some there's some big talent here making these these
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:53.920]   shows and you know as much as some of the content uh might not be for me of course not all of all
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:59.280]   content is going to be for everybody but i'm interested in watching these shows to to judge
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:05.280]   the quality and you know where apple is going with this i'm i'm really excited about what they
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:11.600]   announce now the apple tv app when you when you look at that yeah there's some some changes that
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:18.640]   definitely need to be done to the apple tv app i think it's a good step i i hate going to the
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:25.760]   apple tv app to the tv app in there and you know keep bouncing out into separate apps and
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:32.000]   bouncing all over the place so uh you know whatever changes they can make in that respect
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.600]   is going to be very welcome but you know unfortunately we're going to have to wait and see
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:44.160]   until the fall about pricing about how they're going to be released i mean are they just going
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:50.240]   to dump everything uh day one or are they going to stagger everything or there's still a lot of
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:58.400]   questions after the event possibly more questions than before the event i i think just for tv plus
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:04.160]   specifically i'm still very confused i i see that they um had some official announcements about
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:08.960]   the tv shows that we're we're going to get with tv plus but they didn't really explain to me a
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:15.520]   lot of the other things about it is this is this it is it just is the subscription service
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:20.560]   literally only exclusive apple tv made shows or are they going to incorporate some other things
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:27.920]   into that there there was mention of um being able to um buy movies and tv shows from
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:33.760]   iTunes right within the tv app but that they didn't really clarify whether or not this was going to
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:39.760]   be full any of this was going to be folded into um tv plus which i kind of don't think that that's
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:45.120]   the case i really like if that's true i'm disappointed because i wanted tv plus to be
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:53.760]   more encompassing and make it easier for me to digest a lot of media not just five tv shows that
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:14:00.400]   apple made exclusively i think they look great and they've been they're being um directed and
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:07.520]   produced and starring a lot of incredible people so i'm i love this but i want i want tv plus to be
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:14.640]   more than just a handful of exclusive tv shows which will most likely grow but i'd like it to have
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:23.920]   more in it it's more like hbo and less like um hulu let's say or or um youtube tv or something where
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:29.680]   you you get a lot of different things mixed in with it actually it's not even like hbo because hbo
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:34.640]   has a lot of movies that they provide within their service too so yeah i don't know i want more than
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:40.880]   just the tv shows yeah i really saw nothing yesterday that got me the slightest bit interested
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:46.320]   in this service it's not like again i i'm not judging it yet because we don't have any information
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:53.200]   upon which to make a judgment uh they have they have signed up some really big named uh popular talent
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:58.640]   to create shows just like every other streaming platform and just like every network and just
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:04.880]   like every premium channel uh are they going to have a catalog of other content to rely on
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:12.240]   because good luck because Disney Disney Fox merger went through which means that Disney has access to
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:18.240]   the Disney catalog the Fox catalog of course the Pixar catalog they also own 60% of hulu now
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:24.320]   which is producing their own original series content as well as having the current episodes
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:29.840]   of pretty much of most of the many of the shows that uh that people actually want to watch these days
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:35.680]   it's are they going to be sending people to Sundance and all the other uh and all the other
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:42.960]   places uh festivals to buy documentaries buy independent movies like Netflix is like hulu is
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:48.960]   like all these other channels are uh i just and then they haven't even started talking about uh
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:53.760]   talking about uh what the pricing is going to be uh but we also we they haven't and they've announced
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:59.200]   that they're going to at some date in the future make the app available for Roku but they haven't
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:04.560]   said anything about Android that's uh i consider that to be a problem and then we get to the problem
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:10.800]   of you have as good as a reboot of amazing stories is it might not be i can only speak for myself
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:16.400]   it might not be something that i like it might be one of those many many shows that i hugely anticipate
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:23.120]   but then three episodes in i find myself forgetting to actually watch it even though it's right there
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:30.720]   on my streaming box uh because uh if apple can't deliver a wide variety of stuff uh that to appease
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:34.640]   all the people who are going to be hopefully subscribing to this service they're kind of sunk
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:40.640]   and lastly i'm not this is something that i would spend i did a lot of beard stroking like last night
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:44.960]   as i'm trying to figure out why i'm having such a muted reaction to this and part of it was
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:52.080]   i don't see apple uh apple's very very proud of all the money they're putting into
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:57.760]   original content and it's it's a really huge push it's not trivial it's a huge huge push
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:03.440]   but i don't see them as being willing to make a movie that's going to get people mad
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:10.160]   i don't see them as wanting to create a series that's going to be divisive uh i i see them as
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:16.720]   if they were making their house in the prairie not breaking bad well maybe not quite that but i
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:24.240]   i see them co-producing stanley coopric movies and saying the thing is we're really really do we
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:31.520]   really have to have like hundreds of gallons of blood elevators yeah and about this ending to
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:36.480]   2001 we need some resolution there like okay what does he see maybe we have a revolution
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:41.360]   shots we see things that artists say about hbo is that they get creative freedom it's one of the
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:47.120]   ways hbo does attract such talent now apple i guess it's the same kind of question you can ask
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:53.360]   can can george stein brenner's payroll win a pennant for the yankies
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:58.560]   can you can you create a great network just by buying the best talent
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:04.320]   and maybe you can i mean these people have a great it doesn't hurt it's a good startup point
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.720]   if you trust them to do their jobs but you have to let it do their job yeah one one of the lines that
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:13.840]   kind of worried me was when tim i can't quote verbatim but talking about apples history of
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:19.520]   uh apple style of storytelling ability to tell history of telling stories and i'm like
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:26.400]   dude you don't you make gadgets you make bad services for files and stuff you've never you're
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:31.760]   not a storytelling machine your apples are you are marketing machine is not a story tell stories
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:36.960]   but this this this really is like the tech billionaire who buys a basketball team and now they feel
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:41.760]   as though they're in their their professional sports player no no no you you were you were
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:46.720]   great at writing that check and you get to wear the special hat at their uh courtside but
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:52.000]   well don't tell people how to win also we heard nothing that we didn't already know
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:58.000]   uh and and not just from links but i mean just basically this is this is so scant that it was
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.920]   just all the stuff we already knew if it aside from the originals the only thing interesting was
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:09.040]   the originals what apple's doing with apple tv is totally uninspiring mostly because not apples
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:14.000]   fault they couldn't get television networks or sport events right they couldn't get cooperation
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.800]   from any any of the content people they had to write checks for that stuff and honestly the fact
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:25.120]   that i could buy hbo go in in the app store doesn't do any good for me because i'm a cable subscriber
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:31.920]   i already have hbo i still will have to go through the abysmal arcane process of activating hbo in the
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:38.480]   apple tv by going it through a bunch of websites and logging index finity and every month i have to
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:43.520]   do that that's not going to be fixed so well that that's that's still good because remember the
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:47.920]   people who are buying these are people who don't know who don't it's old-fashioned who buy an hbo
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:53.440]   subscription that's attached to a cable box that is installed at a permanent address we're talking
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:58.000]   about kids who want to have their own so that's who they're aiming this well that's it's it's a
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.320]   difference in the way that tv is being consumed that you have to stand all a car that you're buying
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:06.400]   your buying those networks yeah and they and they'll be cheap right they're ten bucks which is cheaper
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:13.680]   than hbo now uh all a car it's fifteen dollars i think normally yeah and and to be fair it's
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:17.840]   there's they're building this thing up they don't they're not going to fail in their first two months
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:22.960]   it's going to take us three years to see once they have an opportunity to build up this offering
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:28.400]   into what they hoped it would be or in the case the apple watch they observe how people are using
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:32.800]   this and realize their first vision was totally wrong but we have to we have a chance to to
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:39.440]   mend our ways so there we can't be won't be i don't think i'll be able to say that if i don't
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:44.160]   if i don't like it by september october i think i would be wrong to say oh this is a whole this is
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:48.560]   a failure oh and they've made some progress i mean for a long time i wouldn't use the apple tv app
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:55.120]   on my apple tv now i do it is my home page now so they've made some progress
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:21:01.440]   uh the idea being that you go to one place and and find everything you want
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:07.600]   it's just it's a checkbook move any one with a big enough checkbook could could have done this i
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:14.800]   don't i don't see any apple touches to this to say that we've we've solved the problem where we've
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:20.240]   we've uh we've found points of friction that people are having with watching tv in 2019 and
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:25.520]   we've solved them they maybe they have but they didn't share it with us yesterday yeah one thing
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:31.280]   that i thought was maybe the biggest part of this announcement is you won't have to have an apple
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:39.040]   tv anymore that they're going to partner with sam san sony lg uh to put apple tv in those smart
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:45.360]   televisions kind of like that was one of the biggest points to me and again going back to what i said
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:54.240]   about uh the games arcade this announcement that they were going to put uh apple to the uh the tv
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:22:01.840]   app in the smart tv's that's all about services that's all about getting those services out to as
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:10.080]   many people as possible which again shows how important services are becoming to to apple
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:16.240]   it was just that that part of the announcement was a pretty incredible step how badly does it
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:23.040]   hurt that netflix won't play in this i don't think that i i mean obviously it would it would have
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:29.440]   helped you know to have that kind of additional but when the tv app first launched um for ios and
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:36.160]   and apple tv and all that a lot of these um streaming services didn't sort of participate in that
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:40.000]   in that find it all in one place idea that apple was doing it didn't hurt anybody
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:46.720]   um it's a little annoying it when you would you'd pop into the tv app and um netflix wasn't
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:51.840]   appearing in the you know what you've recently watched section or something like that but um i
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:58.160]   don't think it really i don't think it will stop anybody from checking out or from using the tv app
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:04.160]   to to digest their information but it's it's just one little extra thing there are a lot of people
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:10.960]   with fire tv sticks and uh roku boxes who will now be able to install the apple tv app i i
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:16.160]   am i wrong say fire tv for sure it was no that's right it was fire that was that's kind of a surprise
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:21.760]   because amazon and apple have never i mean they they're natural enemies yes but of course amazon
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:28.960]   prime is on the apple tv app yeah this range i i do think that not having netflix is a bigger
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:36.080]   prop is a non-trivial issue because i if if i understand how this app is supposed to work and
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:42.880]   i'm not suggesting that i absolutely do uh it seems as though it works best for apple if
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:50.160]   essentially the apple tv app is the hdmi one of your tv where you turn on your you pick up your
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:57.760]   remote and you are and your your screen lights up first off into the apple tv app and you never
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:04.160]   ever every time you leave that app to go someplace else apple loses a little bit so if they could
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:10.000]   have netflix if they could have convinced netflix to create a compatible version of the app so that
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:16.000]   it could be integrated into into the apple tv app they're considering how many people already
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.360]   subscribed to netflix that is another opportunity to get people to not leave the environment of the
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:29.680]   apple tv app so it's not it's not fatal but it would what a coup it would have been if apple created
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:36.640]   created a an app that was sort of like an app launcher that doesn't care if the netflix app
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:42.640]   if netflix or if hulu or if any of these other individual apps may cut a deal with the company
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:47.200]   at all they could just simply say guess what we to in to this device we just appear to be an
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:52.160]   application launcher so by the way here's all the apps that are installed on your android tv or on
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:58.000]   your roku or on your apple tv or your spark tv just drag them into this bin and now you never ever
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.400]   ever have to deal with that horrible samson interface or that samson data collection never again
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:08.320]   that's an interesting question if you put an apple tv app in and samson's tv
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:14.320]   there's all tv's really really leaky in terms of the same samson get that data i don't i don't
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:20.640]   see how you get around that i don't know maybe they they i suspect that they could
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:26.320]   does they could cloak the traffic between the app and the internet and the and the network
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:31.200]   but they wouldn't be able to prevent samson from being able to know what clicks are happening or
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:34.720]   when the launch happens and they put microphones on those tv's to listen to what you're watching
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:38.320]   they yeah i think they probably know what's going on i'm sure they thought i'm sure they thought
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:44.640]   of that you know you don't put up billboards of that size in so many places without not wanting
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:50.400]   to get caught saying oh that's right we actually are walking all of our users into handing over
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:56.400]   to samson all of their traffic data oh that was bad also in a meta topic on this apple of course
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:02.320]   is now doubling down on privacy and and rightly so i mean every single one of these products had
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:09.440]   a kind of a privacy angle on it but i i i i know i know we care about it and we talk a lot about it
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.800]   but i wonder in the long run and we asked i asked this on ios today as well but i'll ask you guys
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:20.880]   to real people are they really going to be moved by this for instance are they going to get rid of
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:27.600]   all their credit cards and use an apple credit card because it's private no that unfortunately
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:35.440]   um that the the everyday people don't care about how rich they are in data they know it i think
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:39.120]   they understand now we've made that they just don't beat that drum but they it's like well i
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:44.080]   understand i'm i wish it didn't but it does and i you know echo fax knows everything about me and
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:50.800]   that's life yeah i'm yeah it's just not that they believe that the only time people care about their
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:58.160]   privacy is when there is um a new story saying that facebook released all this data and people
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:05.840]   get upset and facebook still makes a billion dollars because people don't really care and
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:12.000]   i've said this before there are so many instances where companies will put out uh fill out this form
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.640]   and get ten dollars off you know get this coupon and people will go fill it out and give all their
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:20.960]   information away for that who doesn't have an affinity card for their grocery store
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:29.600]   so you know i really don't think that that people care as much as what we may want them to or
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:35.760]   we may think that they do i think that they care only when the headlines suggest that they should
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:43.280]   care and then they go back into their their world of uh you know facebook and and google and samsung
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:48.800]   and all of this and when the privacy ads come out they may think yeah you know what that is a good
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:54.880]   idea but are they going to give up their credit cards for an apple card no do they feel better
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:28:01.280]   by using an iphone instead of a samsung i think a lot of that depends on the price but yes they
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:09.920]   probably do feel better but there's there's all kinds of levels of caring about privacy and
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:16.560]   those levels will dictate what they purchase so if money is is um one of those levels of
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:22.000]   concerns for people then privacy will step down a bit you know and they'll go get a samsung phone
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:28.240]   with android and not not worry so much about privacy but if money isn't an issue they'll probably buy
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:34.240]   an iphone and feel better about their privacy even though they still go on facebook all the time
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:42.800]   you know so i i think that they're uh generally people will care about privacy but care to uh
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:49.040]   the levels of other categories that matter to them yeah i i do but i do think that apple has a really
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:55.120]   really good uh angles to pursue here uh i don't think them i i do agree that i don't think most
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:29:00.320]   people have privacy and security at the front of their minds either they think that this is like the
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:03.520]   weather that's something you can't change so you may as well just live in the world you live in
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:07.840]   or they're just not aware of exactly the risks that they're going under but i think that if apple
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:13.680]   has the opportunity to keep saying that our product is uncontaminated by dihydrogen monoxide
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:19.600]   whereas our competitors project is loaded with dihydrogen monoxide people are not necessarily don't
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:25.200]   don't know what dihydrogen dihydrogen monoxide is but they're thinking well it's a good thing that
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:30.080]   the apple product doesn't have it so if apple keeps saying that we are the more secure the most
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:36.080]   secure product if it's an a or b thing they're making a very very strong positive that they no one
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:41.040]   thinks that a greater greater and tighter security on their device is a negative thing no one is
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:46.720]   going to react negatively to that so they and they and and let's also give it up to apple they
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:52.800]   can legitimately make this claim they are a security security is really just one of the 10
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:58.880]   commandments that they this company was re was rebooted on and what a better way to make yourself
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:05.760]   stand out in a crowded tech market than to say your company does it i think it's a brilliant
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:11.440]   campaign move for apple to be promoting privacy and security when they are the only ones that
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:16.240]   are doing it to the level that they can claim they're doing it because that does make them stand
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:20.400]   out from all the rest of the devices it's a really a brilliant marketing thing on their part that
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:25.600]   my question is is it enough to it's good it's good it's a good thing to put in but it's a change
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:31.440]   people's buying habits and it sounds like just like what jim was saying not not really most people
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:36.960]   not really especially where money is is an important factor and and even aside from just money even
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:43.120]   just aside from whether you buy an android device or an apple device um the that what he what jim
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:48.400]   had said about and then you go on your facebook with it it's uh it we don't really understand
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:54.160]   what's being done with our data i've said this a million times um we need to be
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:59.280]   much better informed and have much more transparency on what's being done with our data
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:04.800]   so that we can make decisions about whether or not we want to pursue say for example an iPhone
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:09.600]   over an android phone because of what we do or don't know is being done with our data and and I
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:16.880]   think without understanding it we give it away much more but if we were more aware of the companies
[01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:22.560]   that were um you know sort of packaging our data and then selling it to other companies I don't mean
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:28.960]   you know x company is selling me to y company I mean these companies that collect this data
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:35.920]   and then package this data as as a as an advertisement data package to somebody that they use to
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:40.720]   advertise to us if we knew more details about that information about that stuff that was being
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:46.640]   collected I have a feeling a lot more people that right now shrug and say me there's nothing I can
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:52.400]   do about it they would look at that data and say wait what i'm not going to participate in this
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:58.720]   anymore and then back away from that and and start really caring about their privacy and and
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:04.240]   what's being done with their data if we knew exactly everything that that these companies
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:12.080]   know about us it would probably scare us to death exactly you know I mean we have an idea oh we're
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:18.400]   being tracked and oh we you know these companies are selling information about us it's probably so
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:27.760]   in depth that we would just be taken aback with it so on on we're gonna wrap it up on balance
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:34.720]   yes great event yesterday ho-hum event I what what do you all think let's start with you
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:40.480]   or me well since it was my first apple event it was really exciting and incredible but to be
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:48.480]   totally honest and because I haven't attended any other events before it felt kind of low key I
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:53.440]   expected the theater to be there was a lot of cheering I know it wasn't you and Renee but there
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:59.600]   didn't feel like it it didn't feel like it was that I don't know there's there's something about
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:06.800]   when I watched it when I've watched it remotely there's anxiety and excitement and oh my gosh and
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:13.040]   it really kind of felt like okay okay this is good wait that's all you're telling us about it okay
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:18.960]   this is good wait we don't know how much it's gonna cost yet so it felt a little more low key to me
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:24.240]   yeah details were scanned but I think people report the same thing when they went to the the
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:28.400]   filming of the moon landing they were there watching it it was much less exciting than those of us at
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:35.120]   home thinking we were actually seeing people walk on the moon I'm just kidding Jim you were in you
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:38.880]   were there but you've been to many before that was this any different from previous events
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:47.120]   and I well I've been to going to every Apple event since 99 or 2000
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:57.760]   Lori is right in in a couple of points that you know I think we all wanted more detail on this and
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:04.640]   we walked away feeling like oh I wish I knew how much this bundle was gonna cost but it's not
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:09.920]   something that Apple needs to release right now or obviously they didn't want to release right now
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:16.720]   there's still time for that to come in the fall when when they do that
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:25.360]   the the when the lights went out and and they pop back on and Steven Spielberg standing there and
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:31.680]   you know that that part was was exciting we did get some details on the shows that I think is
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:39.280]   important we got some details on the channels and and the new app you know we got all kinds of
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:46.960]   details here I think my biggest takeaway from that whole event instead of the excitement of you
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:53.040]   know hands-on area in a new iPhone you know what you see in the September event I think my biggest
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:59.440]   takeaway was how serious Apple is about services right now we've heard Tim talk about it on on
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:06.800]   financial conference calls now for a number of quarters and we've seen those services go up
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:12.960]   in in quarterly earnings and I think now we're really starting to get a
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:19.280]   little picture of just how important this stuff is and it's going to continue to be
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.040]   Andy what do you think?
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:26.720]   I thought it was a pretty boring event start to finish I thought there was so it was just
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:32.560]   criminally thin on actual details I don't think they should have held the event this early or if
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:39.600]   they had made an announcement they shouldn't have had it in the form that they decided to have it
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:45.120]   it's it was just frustrating and Laurie it's like you you welcome welcome to the world of like
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:52.000]   actually attending Apple events they are cool but it's this is why sometimes I have to take like a
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.680]   day to after I've attended an event like a particularly an Apple event because it takes a
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:03.680]   while for the reality distortion field where not only not only that but like I you know I a
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:09.360]   week and a half earlier I cleared my schedule I canceled some stuff I committed like 800 to
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:15.440]   $1,200 of my travel budget to flying out here I've got to hope I got to how to get up early to get
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:20.640]   an uber to get to the get to the theater then I had to like stand outside for two and a half hours
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:24.160]   and then to be shuttled into a place to here's where you're supposed to go here's where you're
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:28.640]   allowed to go and then once I've been through I'm sitting there and I'm realizing that
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:36.240]   what could I have done with $1,200 and four days out of my work week and exactly and so
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:42.560]   if I had to have if I had been there and had to post something like at 4 p.m. I would have been a
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:49.280]   little bit more cranky if I if I I try to monitor that very carefully but I was mad I had to get
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:56.320]   up at 9 a.m. but yeah I mean it was like I feel I feel as though this was a two-hour commercial
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:01.200]   and I don't need to be there to watch a two-hour commercial you have to give me give me data give
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:07.040]   me reasons in which I can make conclusions excuse me make a form actual real opinions that I can
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:13.040]   inform the people who are nice enough to read my stuff and listen to my stuff but don't just throw
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:18.560]   a commercial at me and expect me to say apples can have a video service and a game service
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:23.760]   and a newspaper service I get there there's only been as to my knowledge one other time that apples
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:28.640]   announced something that won't be available for six months and that was the original iPhone because
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:36.000]   of the FCC approval process they announced it in January came out in June but that's really unusual
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.040]   for Apple to make it such a big deal about something you can't get till the end of the year and also
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:45.280]   they didn't just say and we're making a phone now we can't show you the will show you like an
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:49.520]   eight second clip of this phone but let's bring out some of the celebrities that we that have
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:54.160]   been using the phone and have here's will I am pretending to use the phone it'll be out in six
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:59.440]   months yeah yeah it's not again it was it felt like a two-hour commercial I'm glad that I stayed
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:03.360]   home for this not not not that not that Apple presented you with the opportunity to travel
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:08.160]   which which would have been awesome I would I would have this this is why like I've tried I've
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:14.800]   kind of happily traded going to every Apple event to scheduling trips to San Francisco on my own
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:22.560]   accord when I can see people in Cupertino in Mountain View who are not like in the middle of
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:27.040]   like doing this huge event they can actually we can actually spend three or four hours hanging out
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:31.360]   and saying things that begin with the phrase now of course you can't share this with anybody
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:40.640]   I feel like these events this is a time fraught with peril for Apple because they are effectively
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:45.840]   deprecating hardware in favor of services they're still gonna have to make the hardware and really
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:51.360]   the play is an ecosystem play so it includes hardware and services but that's what we saw the
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:58.160]   day and yesterday and so I feel bad for Laurie because Apple announcements in their heyday
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:03.760]   when you got to see Steve Jobs no one was sitting there thinking I could have spent that 1,200 bucks
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:10.640]   better that was watching a master of the form changing the world in front of your eyes
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:17.200]   this pales compared to that so Laurie I think you're getting a different Apple unfortunately
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:22.640]   a different kind of Apple event and part of the fun was with my super super long telephoto lens
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:28.480]   they're showing the video but my lens is pointed right in the wings where I can see Steve Jobs
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:32.240]   looking and watching his reactions is he getting notes from somebody or as
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:37.120]   this was a lot more normally he's got his arms crossed and he's just watching the video and
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:41.280]   smiling and smiling and I guess that just shows that there are people in this world who care more
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:49.360]   about seeing Steve Jobs in the flesh than Oprah Winfrey. She gives off this perfume that suddenly
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:55.360]   you suddenly you realize that you have not been loved enough and you have not given enough love
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:02.080]   and you're inspired to express for you saw Christ you saw Jennifer Aniston, Jason and Mo you saw
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:09.280]   Oprah Winfrey in a cape was that a thrill? This is a funny thing that I have told a couple people
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:14.880]   I was more excited to see Camille Nanjiani on the stage than anybody else. That was the best
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:19.440]   of the bunch though. I love him. He had presents everybody else looked like Diers in that ear looking
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:24.160]   at her life. That's very true he was he owned that stage way better than anybody else.
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:29.280]   It's a stage live stage performer the rest of them are actors. Yeah and so I was actually most
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:34.400]   excited to see Camille Nanjiani believe it or not. I was told to see him too and he was funny.
[01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:41.040]   Yes. Now there's one other story that and this is really kind of in a nutshell what's going on.
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:47.680]   Apple shipped new AirPods or at least announced new AirPods and made them available for order
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:54.720]   and that was a press release compared to all the other stuff. Somehow Renee got his I'm suspecting
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:59.440]   that they are on that blonde wood surface at an apple event somewhere but I might be wrong.
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:06.400]   I got mine too. So tell us good give us a little capsule review I know you just got them.
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:12.640]   I just got them so I just hooked them up to the phone but there's a little light
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:17.120]   you can't. That's the charging light. Yeah. Yeah there's a little light on the front now.
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:22.080]   Because you can wireless charge them. It doesn't come with a wireless charger though.
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:26.880]   No. So you have to have. No but you still have the air power you're set.
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:34.960]   I do have a wireless charger so I will be trying that out as well. Are the headphones
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:39.440]   different in any way? I mean if you have AirPods already is this worth running out and getting these?
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:45.760]   They look the same to me. I haven't had a chance to sit down with my other and compare them but
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:53.920]   on first glance they look pretty much the same. Yeah I think in theory they're better but I'm not
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:42:00.160]   sure how. Well we'll wait till Renee and Jim give us their hearing test. I mean now Jim is actually
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:04.800]   I care more about what you think Jim because you're a headphone aficionado so you'll have you'll have
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:09.760]   something to say there. Jim they didn't even change like the color of the tip so that everybody on
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:13.120]   the bus can tell that you got the more and more expensive. How are you supposed to know I have the
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:18.880]   better ones? Yeah exactly. Put a red ring on it. That's a little model paint and just just do the tip.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:24.800]   Get your nail polish out Andy. Yeah. I don't think Renee no he didn't he didn't comment in any way
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:29.440]   just did a little unboxing and and that's it. Yeah I think he I think he just got him. This is an
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:34.320]   Instagram unboxing ladies and gentlemen. I think he I think he swiped him while everyone's attention
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:39.520]   was on Oprah because how can you take your eyes off of Oprah? And a cape with a bottle of tie.
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:46.160]   Super Oprah. I did love and I started the show with this but that big Vanity Fair style photo and I
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:53.680]   realized now that that was in the Steve Jobs Theater and was taken before the event so that's how we
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:58.000]   know Jennifer Garner and a lot of other people were there that didn't end up on stage. Apple really
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:03.520]   brought out the celebrities for this including the happiest little girl in the world. I don't know
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:10.720]   who she is but do you think she's excited? I think she's in I think she's in. See maybe the
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:16.720]   see with Jason in the that's what I remember. I remember her in one of the video clips I just
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:22.800]   don't remember which one got she's got to think I'm sitting next to Camille and Johnny no I'm sitting
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:26.880]   I'm sitting I mean that's pretty good of course Oprah knows how to do these she's been in a few
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:31.840]   Vanity Fair shots as as has in the middle of laughing because you're in joint because you're
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:37.280]   living and loving life. Yeah and Tim. Tim is trying to figure out what am I doing here?
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:43.360]   What's the new product? But there you go. I don't want to disappoint you further but there in the
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:48.960]   olden days this would have definitely been a very very high quality poster sized print that
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:54.880]   everybody would have been looking for like a stack of them and I would have taken three only
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:58.480]   because I want one and I know that the other one of the inner one will get crumpled up in the
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:03.680]   in the over now we know by the way where they have that big open space the top story of the
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:07.520]   Steve Jobs Theater there's the elevator over there on the right it's so they can do this
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:15.280]   as a sign of the bottom saying no riff-ref this means you Andy and then I'm looking at it I'm
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:20.480]   thinking because that's that's Camille and his wife Emily V Gordon in the back there standing on
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:24.160]   those pedestals did they have steps did they have to be helped up how did they get up there?
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:32.240]   They get up there. Which is a block of aluminium. And I'm wondering also if they rotate if like
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:37.440]   the pedestals rotate because that would be really cool okay I'm just saying like oh my god
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:44.160]   they've just stealthily shown us the new Mac Pro I don't know oh my god there it is huge they
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:50.000]   should have put a little Easter egg in there somewhere it would have been fun I was looking
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:54.400]   really really closely at like what I noticed that Oprah was wearing an apple watch I'm like
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:59.600]   what band is she using and is it one that I've never seen one of the new spring bands which they
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:04.800]   just it looks it looks purple like kind of purpley sort of a glint to it I thought I think in
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:11.920]   that maybe Tim Cook proposed for that band and said Oprah we'd like to get in bed with you
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:18.000]   he said I didn't he like hugged her instead of that I'll thank you all remember this for the rest of
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:23.600]   my life I don't see a lot of other when you hug Oprah because you know where's JJ's apple watch I
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:29.840]   don't see a lot of other where's where's I don't see a lot of other apple watches out there let's
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:33.840]   get some apple watches for what is Jennifer Garner wearing zoom in on her quick let's see
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:36.800]   she's not wearing a wedding ring good news Jim
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:44.480]   but she's also not wearing an apple watch and ain't no apple watch everyone's wearing really
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:51.120]   muted tones I think they got the memo all except Jason Momoa who looks like crocodile Dundee but he is
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:57.360]   after all from New Zealand what's that big chain and what's on the other end and ain't no apple
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:01.920]   watch a big boat anchor but he swings above his head he gets justice against the surface to all
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:05.680]   those who are ruined you can almost see the gills can't you
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:11.360]   our show today brought to get ready get your picks ready because we're gonna do that next our
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:20.880]   show today brought to you by Sophos this is a name that is cherished by cybersecurity professionals
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:27.840]   when when Russell set up our network here first thing he does put Sophos hardware in there to
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:37.760]   protect us all Sophos cyber security and because Sophos is the one of the leaders in cybersecurity
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:42.400]   they don't rest because the hackers don't rest in fact that cat and mouse game between
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:47.840]   security professionals and hackers is ramped up to a new level ever seems like every week
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:59.520]   Sophos's latest play using AI deep learning to understand how malware works and hackers work
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:06.800]   and be prepared even though it may have never seen it before so that Sophos security can
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:11.920]   interpret data and respond to threats at blazing speed even zero days now that is awesome
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:18.000]   Sophos recently racked number one by an independent security test done by the se labs
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:22.480]   they had the best protection ratings across the board for large enterprises and small businesses
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:28.240]   but now it's not just for business and this is the really good news Sophos has taken this amazing

[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:15.840]   time the free security scan i don't recommend antiviruses i recommend Sophos s-o-p-h-o-s.com
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:26.560]   Sophos.com cyber security evolved try it today Andy and Akko a pick of the week my friend
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:32.000]   we were talking about all these wonderful magazine services and game services and video
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.360]   services it's good time as any to remind everybody that your local library can also deliver a lot of
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:44.240]   that same stuff just download the RB digital app and if you had a modern library card still the
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:48.800]   one that you had in high school where they typed it out on a selector typewriter that's no good go
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:53.760]   they'll give you one with a barcode and everything but you just hook up your your ios app to your
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:59.920]   local library and you'd be amazed yes yes you can get the all kinds of new stand magazines but also
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:05.120]   all kinds of audiobooks you can get ebooks there are a lot of even actual like streaming video
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:11.600]   channels you can get access to comic books also and it's a lot of people just don't know that this
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:19.200]   is stuff that their community offers them just for free so he's just download one app and you got it so
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:25.360]   i can i can't in terms of how much you got to spend to what you get in return i don't think i
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:29.920]   will ever recommend something as good as the free electronic content you can get without even
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:34.480]   having to go to go to your library just through your phone through the RB digital app really great
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:38.240]   and it's not just RB digital you have to check with your library to see what they support
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:42.400]   some have different tools and so forth all of them it's weird and i guess this is
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:48.080]   how their relationships with publishers work you know it's a digital content you shouldn't have a
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:53.760]   due date but you do because it's a library but that's all right it's free right and in most
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:58.800]   cases there's plenty of time to listen or watch or read i think they have a limited number of
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:03.360]   licenses i think it's something right a little bit of a sense usually yeah so best thing to do is
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:07.680]   check your library see what apps they support might be canopy might be RB my their variety of
[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:14.640]   different apps canopy is i think what we use here in pedaloma but it is a really good reason to go
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:20.800]   get in your library card updated yes if you haven't been to your local library recently or ever this is
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:26.160]   as good excuse me to just go down there and see what the place is like i've got my local library is
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:31.200]   just a mile walk away and i just go there sometimes to hang out because it's just a beautiful space
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:37.600]   on a lake and and also being able to find out what audiobooks i can get what DVDs i can get
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:42.320]   what digital stuff that i can just get on the get on the thing uh there's a maker space that they're
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:47.120]   creating there so you might be able to just simply say hey i i i wish i i don't have five
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:52.640]   thousand dollars for a laser cutter uh to make this gadget that i saw reference on the web but
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:59.280]   if i just send come along with this pdf on a SD card i can actually and if i buy this the material
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:04.160]   they have a laser put laser cutter and that can just simply make this thing right in the basement
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:10.240]   of their own of my own library so definitely check it out mr rock and roll jim dallerimple
[01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:16.960]   i promised you i would have something new for you uh the next time i was on the show and it happens
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:24.800]   to be uh the very next week so i have a a new band that i want to recommend called altitudes and
[01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:33.520]   attitude now this is a uh uh like a super group a mini super group with david alifson
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:44.000]   from megadeth frank bellow from anthrax and jeff fredel who uh jeff played for uh the perfect or a
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:55.200]   perfect circle um pussover a lot of great uh hard rock and metal bands this album surprisingly
[01:52:55.200 --> 01:53:02.800]   is not as heavy as what people would think so a lot of the things that i recommend and the people
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:11.440]   like on uh mac break weekly are more hard rock than they are metal this album is one of those but
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:20.080]   imagine putting together um yeah there's there's some good sound there i love it
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:26.800]   and putting together uh those types of of heavy metal people but they're playing hard rock it's
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:34.720]   really great music i i love it you're such a sweet person jim is it because you get all your anger
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:43.680]   and aggression out in this music it could be this is good this is melodic oh yeah it's i mean great
[01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:51.760]   singing um great uh melodic pieces great choruses and great playing obviously these guys are very
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:59.360]   talented nice uh so i i would i would highly recommend it i've been love and listen into it myself altitude
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:08.080]   plus attitude that kind of describes jim daller and belin in that show plus a beard now i got to
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:12.880]   be careful because it's the last few times laurie's been on i've bought everything she's mentioned i
[01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:19.440]   have an infinity scarf pillow for flying i have the plug-in thing for my ipad
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:26.560]   what do you got first this week maybe i don't know it depends on um how comfortably you feel with
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:33.280]   having a pop sock oh i'm not a pop soccer first of all doesn't that impede wireless charging
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:40.560]   let me uh no actually i have tested this so so i can get a pop socket and charge wirelessly
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:46.080]   let me tell you what this is this is called an otter pop or otter plus pop depending on on
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:50.320]   whether or not they're worried about getting in trouble for the naming it but it's otter plus
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:55.920]   pop i call it otter pop because it's adorable to call it that and it's a symmetry case made by otter pop
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:02.800]   they also have the defender series um i think the defender series is um also for galaxy s10 i
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:08.560]   love otter boxes they really protect your thought your yeah so it's just it's your standard symmetry
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:16.160]   otter otter otter box and then they teamed up with pop socket to put this right there in the
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:22.400]   background it's and it's divoted it's divoted in this is my favorite part because i've got you know
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:28.720]   i have a pop socket right here i i i love them they're funny i think they're great but i can't stick
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:33.840]   them on my back pocket because they stick out too far right so when it's closed it still sticks out
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:40.400]   a tiny tiny bit but look how slim that is it's smoothly fits into my back pocket you can also
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:46.640]   remove them let's see if i can do this without um messing it up um you can replace them and so you
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:51.840]   can get like um i think they call them pop tops and uh no i'm not gonna be able to do it without
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:56.160]   possibly accidentally ruining it oh wait here we go yeah there we go i took off the back oh my god
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:02.960]   yeah so then you can replace that with any other um pop top can i get a sick burn pop top
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:11.200]   we make some sick burn uh pop pop sockets yes i want a sick burn pop socket do you really
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:18.560]   do you really have sick burn pop sockets no no i said it if we were to make you should make them
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:26.880]   i'm not kidding i don't think you know actually one inch buttons are super popular for punk rockers
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:32.160]   maybe we need to move on and get some pop sockets out there like maybe that's the next step
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:37.040]   you should get your street team right on this yeah yeah where's your street team yeah
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:42.880]   nice that's a good pick so yeah i love that so the otter pop if uh if anybody's
