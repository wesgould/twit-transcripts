[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.120]   and the Apple Watch, which have turned on ECG. They think it's the best things that slice bread.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.400]   I have a little more worries. The final results are in over the Super Micro Bloomberg story. Uh-oh.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:32.400]   You've got some explaining to do. And why the iPhone XR might be the best phone for you. It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest Apple news.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.400]   The festive version. I'm wearing a blinky lights because it's well, we're getting close to the holidays.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.400]   It's December 11th.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.400]   Joining us.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.400]   It's interesting. Renee Richie is not here.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.400]   He was called away suddenly.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.400]   Marie Gillier is great to have the managing editor of I'm more. I always love having a lorry on.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:24.400]   But I have to say, and maybe you know when Renee Richie is called away suddenly, usually that's for a briefing from the fruit company.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.400]   It's not. I can definitely tell you that.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.400]   It's business.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.400]   It's tangentially related.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.400]   But not direct from the fruit company.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   I see. It's a fruit company supplier.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   It's fruit company's adjacent.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   A fruit adjacent company.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.400]   Whatever the reason, thrilled to have you on lorry. Thanks for having me.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.400]   Thank you. I love it when he has to go off and do things because I get to join you.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   So do we.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   And in that goes also here.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.400]   The beautiful WGBH in Boston, Boston Public Radio, and in that go.com. Hello, Andrew.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.400]   Hello. And yes, that's the.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.400]   I actually had this thought a couple of yesterday when I'm on my Instagram and I see that there's another picture of Renee's watch of a flight that involves going to New York.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.400]   And my first thought, right?
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   My first thought was who's he meeting with and is it Apple related? And the second thought was, do we get to have lorry on the show on the show?
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   That's great. Everybody's happy about that. That's awesome.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.400]   I feel so special.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.400]   Also from the nation's capital, home of the smocking gun, Alex Lindsay.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   Hello.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   Of the Pixel Court.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   And it looks like you're in a beautiful winter wonderland today.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:52.400]   I'm just trying to get into the mood, you know, so I'm not known for being a Christmas person. So every day, every week, I'm trying to find some new Christmas-y kind of view.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.400]   All right. So you're providing the background, not us.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.400]   Oh, that's correct.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   I believe that's the case because it's nicely out of focus. There's like a depth of field thing going on. I don't think we can actually do that.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   So the key is a little clearer.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.400]   It's a magical thing.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.400]   Your hair is like actually not green. It's pretty impressive actually what you're able to do.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.400]   Yeah. Can you come up to my house and make my background look like that?
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   No, isn't that awesome?
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.400]   That's real pretty.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.400]   Is that great?
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.400]   Whoo.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   I don't know if there's a whole lot of news, a whole lot of shaking going on because as we get close to the holidays, things get quieter and quieter.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:43.400]   But I guess, let's see, there are new versions of the software out there.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   iOS 12.1.1 came out.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.400]   I downloaded it.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.400]   E-Sim support so you can now have the dual SIMs.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.400]   Promised us.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   Notification preview using haptic touch on iPhone 10R.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.400]   One tap to flip between the rear and front facing camera during a FaceTime call.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.400]   Live photo capture during one to one FaceTime calls.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.400]   The options to hide the sidebar in news on iPad.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.400]   Realtime text when using Wi-Fi calling on iPad and iPod touch.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400]   Stability improvements.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.400]   I imagine there are a few bug fixes and security fixes.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.400]   The biggest thing you'll notice, ECG is now enabled if you have an Apple Watch.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.400]   So you, now the trick is don't go to the watch app.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.400]   That's where I went.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.400]   Where's the ECG?
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.400]   Go to the health app.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.400]   And you'll get a banner right away that says, "Hey, you got ECG."
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.400]   And you can then use, set it up on your Apple Watch.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   They warn you again and again.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   If you're having a heart attack, this doesn't diagnose that.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   If you're having a stroke, this doesn't diagnose that.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.400]   Go to your doctor.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.400]   Get help.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   Don't be taking an ECG because you're feeling poorly.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.400]   But for, so really for people with these, it's for people with AFib and then like, right?
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.400]   But actually, if you are feeling poorly, maybe you should anyway.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.400]   Because almost as soon as it went live, there were at least anecdotal reports, people on
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   Reddit saying, "My favorite one was, I think it was on day one or someone."
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.400]   Like, "Oh, wow.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.400]   I want to try this new ECG feature."
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.400]   And so it says, "I'm an AFib."
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400]   Okay.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.400]   We'll try it again.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.400]   Maybe I got too much sweat.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.400]   Nope.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   It says, "Ah, damn it.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400]   It doesn't work correctly.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   Here, honey.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.400]   Put on this watch and see if you, and nope.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.400]   My wife seems to get like normal sinus rhythm.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.400]   Like, "Huh.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.400]   Maybe I should check with my doctor."
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.400]   And the doctor said, "Yep, you are in AFib."
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.400]   Thank you.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.400]   And it's good that you came in today.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.720]   Not that that saved the person's life, but that this is, it was an AFib situation that
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.400]   now they can monitor.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.400]   So that's a really cool anecdotal story and they're coming in by the dozens.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.400]   However, that said, I have to go back to what I was looking into when this feature was first
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.400]   announced, that there have been two-year studies of people with medical grade, like prescription
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:06.960]   grade body ECG monitors, then they were not able to find any sort of link between the people
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.360]   with AFib who were wearing a daily monitor and people who were not wearing the daily
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.640]   monitor that had managed to prevent heart attack or prevent stroke or prevent any of
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.000]   the things you're hoping to get.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.480]   This is still, and also it went through, it was approved by the FDA under a special, let's
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.840]   get new technology through as fast as possible things.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.640]   So it hasn't been tested as much as, let's say a drug has, that's also the reason why
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.840]   you can't get it in Canada because the Canadian equivalent of the FDA hasn't improved it yet.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.640]   But still, very, very interesting.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.640]   If it makes people more aware of their health and it gives them something active to do, and
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:47.200]   if what these people are saying that their doctors told them, "It's good that you came
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.600]   in, you were in AFib," and now they have a situation they can actually monitor, "Good."
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.040]   And I think that you've got something specific that you said that it makes us more aware
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.760]   of our health and I think that's what this ECG monitor is, the benefit of it.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.480]   Just like you're saying, there's no evidence that it would be more beneficial than just
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.720]   going to your doctor.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.360]   But I think there might be a lot of people out there who, they might be sitting around
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.360]   thinking, "I think that there's something wrong with my heart and then they use this
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.520]   ECG monitor and it comes up as not AFib."
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:26.560]   I think that that could maybe like, calm some fears about whether or not you have something
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.080]   wrong with your heart.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.720]   Instead of constantly going to the doctor because you just, your heart paced randomly
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.920]   for no reason, you can kind of test that on your Apple Watch and kind of think, "Is
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.120]   there anything wrong with me?
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.360]   No, your heart rate is up, but other than that, you're okay."
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.920]   I think in general, you're right that it's a good thing to have to make us all aware.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.600]   For everyone who wears an Apple Watch, you don't have to get a special medical equipment
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.640]   from your doctor that you have to wear around on you all the time.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.160]   It's just this thing that you already use with everything else that you do in life and
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:04.040]   you can kind of use it to help you just be aware of your heart.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:09.760]   I think a lot of times we say internally that you don't measure what matters, what you
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.400]   measure becomes what matters.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.120]   So I think that what's interesting about the watch is that you're constantly, "I find
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.000]   myself paying a lot more attention to how much I'm walking, how much I'm active, how
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.600]   many calories I'm burning."
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:29.120]   And now I have this little toy called, "EZG, I see it as a toy, but I like doing it."
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.080]   It's a fun little graph and maybe that'll bring something up.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.560]   I think that one of the things that's really interesting is that we are massively increasing
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.560]   the sample rate.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.800]   So while we haven't seen a lot of correlation in the past, we may see a different set of
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.320]   correlations when we increase a sample rate from hundreds or thousands to millions.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.720]   We may see, you know, even if it makes a difference for a handful of people, it was
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.720]   worth it.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.320]   And it's a really cool little, if you haven't done it yet, if you have the watch, it's just
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.320]   fun to watch it.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.000]   Okay, I'm going to now, Pupu, everything you all just said, you're wrong.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.240]   It's actually very dangerous to once again, I want to, it is not a good idea if you're
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.240]   having a heart attack to check your Apple watch.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.240]   There's direct correlation.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.240]   I think you're just understanding...
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.880]   No, no, I'm not.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.880]   Let me finish.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.880]   Let me also point you to this article on Medium.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.360]   I'm an Heart Doctor.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.080]   Here's why I'm wary of the new Apple watch screening for atrial fibrillation and healthy
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.440]   people just doesn't make sense.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.440]   There's also the larger...
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.520]   You're going to see all these stories and Apple's going to pump this up that it's saving
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.520]   lives.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.320]   What it doesn't tell you is the person who died because he was having a heart attack
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:43.120]   and then went to his watch because he didn't post it on Reddit.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:48.000]   If you're having a heart attack or a stroke, this is no benefit at all, A, and you should
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.200]   not check your freaking watch.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.720]   Apple says this over and over.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.800]   This doesn't diagnose heart attacks or stroke.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.160]   But people are still going to do it.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.440]   The second issue, and this is the issue John Mandrola raises, and he raised this.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.440]   This came out in September.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.920]   We talked about it then, but I just want to reiterate it, that the problem, he says,
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.440]   as a heart doctor, my opinion is, if you think an Apple watches nifty, buy one, but
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.960]   do not buy it for your health, it will not approve your health, and it could bring you
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.960]   harm.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:22.040]   In particular, the problem is that even with a 12-lead electrocardiogram, there are significant
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.400]   about 10% false positives.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.800]   That means 10% of the people with real ECGs are going to either think they're sick or
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.520]   get treatment for sickness, which they shouldn't get, which is actually dangerous.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.720]   This is going to cause a lot of people saying, "Oh, I'm running with the doctor," because
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.880]   it's not a 12-lead, it's a 2-lead, which is less accurate.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:48.280]   I think what this is indicated for, and there is a great product from a live core called
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.600]   Cardia that does exactly the same thing, a 2-lead ECG that does your iPhone.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.120]   If you have already been diagnosed with AFib, this makes a lot of sense.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.600]   So does the Cardia, because that'll give your doctor additional data points.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:07.160]   The risk is a lot of people will increase anxiety, and some people may, in fact, try
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:12.280]   to treat a heart attack or a stroke and die, because instead of seeking real treatment,
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.040]   they thought the Apple Watch was going to help them.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.400]   I think it's really important.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.000]   I think Apple's overselling this.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.400]   I think it's really important to understand the limited value of it and the risk.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.600]   I think it's very common.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.320]   Doctors say this all the time.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:34.480]   There's full-body scans and stuff out there, and the risk is that healthy people are getting
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.960]   tested.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:40.320]   When you endeavor to make healthy people healthier, he says, "You always risk making
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.320]   the worse."
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.320]   Not 100 percent.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.680]   Many people get benefit.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.320]   Probably nobody on this panel will get any problem from this.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.320]   It's just, "Please, don't think this is medical grade anything."
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.480]   You write about that.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:04.320]   There is a risk involved in implying that this is somehow beneficial to healthy people.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.040]   It's nothing to people that are healthy.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.640]   It's the risk of people getting freaked out.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.480]   If you're a hypochondriac, you're going to be measuring your heart rate all the time.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:18.320]   If you're somebody who's active in the Apple tech world, you know the difference between
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.000]   the two, but the average consumer doesn't necessarily.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:28.120]   If we're presenting too much positive information about this particular feature and then just
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.200]   an average person who doesn't really know much about it goes out and buys an Apple watch,
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.000]   specifically thinking that it's going to save their life if they have a heart attack,
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.520]   then our job is the tech writers, for example, to make that clear.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.120]   If we're not careful, we're not making that clear enough.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.160]   You're definitely right about that.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.920]   It could lead to misinformation.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.680]   The general public needs a lot more information about what it can and can't do instead of
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.160]   just like, "Isn't this great?"
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.160]   I'm not a doctor.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.160]   I'm not pretending to be.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:01.200]   I just want to pass along this from a heart doctor, sending hundreds of thousands of wrongly
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.680]   diagnosed people that doctors scares me, he says, "In addition to needless anxiety and
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:11.080]   costs, this is hazardous because while some doctors will simply reassure the patient, many
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.960]   other doctors will order tests.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.800]   Since all medical interventions come with risks, many people will suffer harm from a
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.440]   necessary test and procedures."
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.000]   Just something to keep in mind.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.800]   Yeah, that's definitely true.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:29.880]   One of the weird things about medicine from the consumer point of view is that doctors
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:35.480]   continue to insist that they can't treat healthy people for a problem, that when a
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:40.000]   problem manifests itself, when someone actually starts to have symptoms of something, then
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.840]   you can actually use that data to figure out that something's wrong with them.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.760]   But you can't really tell someone that it's not useful to say, "My watch says I've
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.880]   been AFib, but I feel fine."
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.880]   That's not useful.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.280]   That's just more data that will clutter an analysis.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:58.320]   Also, as that other doctor said, force them to put someone through a battery of tests they
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:05.720]   might not need and causing more expense and also more load on a stressed out medical system.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:11.480]   The only thing is, yeah, it is important to keep stressing, especially again, that the
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:16.920]   fact that you've got an even when you're in a controlled study, even when you've been
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:21.840]   diagnosed with AFib, the fact that you have a sensor with you did not prove that someone
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:28.040]   got had a better treatment and better safety because they were being monitored.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:33.560]   However, I think that on the whole, it's important for the most, I think the most important
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:40.600]   tool that we have as arbiters of our own health is a knowledge of what normal is that I feel
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:46.480]   right now, I'm alert, I'm awake, I don't feel any pain anywhere, I'm not aware of the beating
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.880]   of my heart, although I'm aware that it's certainly doing something.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.800]   My speech does not seem slurred, I'm not stuttering, I'm not stumbling.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.480]   And so I feel as though I'm pretty healthy right now.
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.360]   So I know that this is sort of normal for me.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:05.040]   If let's say tomorrow, I notice that I can no longer, I'm having problems getting toothpaste
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.200]   on my toothbrush because my fingers don't want to clasp anymore.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.720]   Or if I climb to fly the stairs and I'm normally not out of breath, but not out of breath,
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.360]   that's not normal, that means that's a suggestion that I should either keep an eye on this or
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.200]   at worst get medical help.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:24.720]   Again, I'm speaking broadly, when you have diagnostic tools like this, maybe you will
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.200]   just take a sensor reading just to see what's going on.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.200]   And you know that, okay, this seems normal, this is what is, this is, this is the normal
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.200]   for me.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:37.760]   But when my watch is telling me that I'm doing, my heartbeat is at 140 beats per minute and
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.200]   I've just been like cooking a roast.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.840]   I haven't been eating any drugs, I haven't been working out.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.840]   That's not normal.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.320]   And after half hour, when I see that it's not slowly going down, it's actually steadily
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.720]   maintaining.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.240]   That's another indication that this is not normal process to do something.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.280]   So that's a sort of, that's the role of consumer medical stuff.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.280]   It needs to be really, really carefully regulated.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.480]   It needs to be explained also really, really carefully.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.160]   But the big goal should always be to help this person have better awareness of what is
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.040]   normal for them and when something is suddenly abnormal.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.320]   Yeah, the kind of the difference between this and the Cartier is the Cartier is something
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:21.320]   that if you've already had diagnosis of AFib, like Jeff Jarvis of this week in Google has
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:25.760]   had, he thinks that's a really great thing because if he, you know, the AFib is sometimes
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.600]   symptomless, I suppose, you know, there will be more and more stories about people whose
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.440]   lives were saved by the Apple Watch.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.440]   That's all great.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.680]   But just don't think it's be, I think we need to be cautious.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.400]   And it's our job not to be part of the Apple hype machine, but to say, hey, this doesn't
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.600]   treat a heart attack, this doesn't treat a stroke.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.760]   If you have other symptoms, you should consult your doctor.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.760]   If you think you have AFib, you should consult your doctor and not trust the watch to do
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:52.760]   the diagnosis.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.080]   Go get a real ECG.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:02.760]   It's important to get to the hospital if you're, if you've got a fibrial, what is it?
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.120]   AFib, arterial fibrillation.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.640]   But I get, I get heart rate, rate warnings every time I watch the Taylor game.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:16.400]   And I think people understand that the heart rate, high heart rate warning and the low heart
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.240]   rate warning, understand what that is.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.080]   The ECG sounds more medical.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.240]   It makes a great graph though, like for, if you're a graphic artist and you want to.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:30.440]   It also makes great stories on tech blogs.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.240]   And so you're going to see all the people whose lives were saved, but that's only part
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.240]   of the story, I guess.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.240]   I don't know.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.160]   I, you know, if you, if you're my age, you should probably ask your doctor before, before
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.840]   trusting me.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.080]   Atrial fibrillation.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.080]   Thank you, Bramster.
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.440]   I can never say that.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.440]   Fib.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.000]   AFib is easier to say.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Fibrillation.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Fibrillation.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Atrial is much easier to say.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.560]   Before you change subjects about the update, I do want to point out one tiny little update
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.440]   that I think went completely unnoticed.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:08.920]   And iOS 12 first launched Apple removed live photos from FaceTime.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.920]   Right.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.680]   It's back.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.800]   That's one of the live photo capture during one to one FaceTime calls.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.040]   So you can't do it in group calls, which I'm not sure how you could do it in group calls
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.040]   anyway.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.440]   So one to one FaceTime, you have live photos back.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.560]   So I just wanted to point that out for anybody who liked that feature.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.560]   It's back.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.840]   Well, and there was a feature I used all the time, which was the double tap to flip it around
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.960]   because I'm talking to my mom and I want to show her the Christmas tree.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.040]   You have to go into the settings.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.760]   Now that double tap is back to and that was very useful.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.760]   They took that out too.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.760]   I'm not sure what happened.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:46.560]   It's probably just like an update to design.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.560]   Let's get it out later.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.560]   Right.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.560]   So maybe they rewrote.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.560]   I don't know.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.760]   I don't want to be too negative.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.680]   But I just know that I can't be too negative because there will be tons of stories like
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.040]   this is Reddit story of people whose lives were saved.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.640]   His doctor said you should buy Apple stock because I think they saved your life.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.600]   They're going to seize those.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.000]   That's a bus ad sort of material.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.240]   And that's when I will say I'm glad you're wearing the flashing lights because I did take
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.600]   like sort of the dark edge off this conversation.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:23.000]   Of all of you, I'm the one most likely to have a fib, a stroke, a heart attack, probably
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   during the show.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.480]   So but I did.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.480]   Just take care of Apple.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.480]   I did and I am in normal sinus rhythm.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.480]   So I'm okay.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.280]   So do you have those lights like hook up to your like your pulse rate?
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.280]   That's what it should be.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.280]   Right?
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.280]   That is my pulse rate.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.280]   Are you worried now?
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.720]   I for those listening, I'm wearing a listener's sentence.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.400]   These and I wore them for iOS today and I couldn't take them off there.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:52.240]   It's a lovely statue of Liberty style tiara, old timey Christmas colored Christmas bulbs
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.920]   that are powered by flashing LEPs.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.680]   So apparently they have various rhythms.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:01.720]   If you're epileptic, I apologize for what I'm about to do.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.720]   There you go.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.720]   That's the fast flash.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.920]   I kind of like the slow blinking.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.240]   And then I also have a necklace of the same.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.840]   But you know, I think these are LEDs, Andy.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.480]   I think the yeah, they just look like the old school lights.
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:22.160]   No, but in the 90s, I built like a ring of like holiday lights for my hat and I wanted
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.680]   them to be actually visible like in when there's lights on in the room.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.480]   And the only way to do that was with like 12 volt turn signal bulbs.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.520]   And a giant battery pack in your pocket, right?
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.200]   Because I mean, you're not joking.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:41.160]   I programmed like a pick controller in the crown of my hat so that they could flash
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.160]   throughs.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:48.400]   And then there was literally like a little like lead acid motorcycle battery in a bag
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.560]   that because it was a way to like go to Christmas parties and people would ask about the hat
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.200]   and I would have to talk about myself.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.760]   Oh, very nerd solution.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:04.440]   Maybe through maybe I can think last me about technology as opposed to so that's quite a
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.440]   look.
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.880]   You've got going with the with the pants and the shoes and that jacket.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.240]   I got to show you the jacket.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.960]   Megan, we did our iOS today gift guide earlier today.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.080]   You can see it on our iOS today show and Megan had a jacket with
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.000]   LED filaments.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.280]   No fiber optic filaments in the jacket.
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.280]   The stunning.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.680]   Yeah, it's gorgeous and 350 bucks.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:33.240]   Aida fruit will get you styling real quick.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.240]   It's amazing.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.400]   Get a Gemma controller download a sketch and boy, will you look super cool.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.560]   Three 3D print your clothing from now on our show today.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.560]   We're going to take a little break.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.800]   Come back with more and lots more news.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.760]   But first a word from Gazelle.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.520]   I know you're eyeing for the holidays.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.240]   Maybe a new iPhone, a new tablet.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.120]   Gazelle is the place to trade in your old devices.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.600]   Get some cash to subsidize your new devices.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.800]   This is really the solution for people like me who always want the latest and greatest.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.320]   You just sell the old one.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:10.640]   We periodically right about this time we get gather all the old iPhones from our staff,
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.360]   Megan and Jason, all the old phones.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:17.600]   We sell them on Gazelle because they got all new phones for the holidays.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.920]   You could do the same thing.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.320]   They give you a great price.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.840]   You'll instantly find out what your device is worth.
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.880]   You'll get, quote, right away guaranteed for 30 days.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.440]   Shipping's free.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.440]   Payments fast.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.320]   I like the 30 days because it means you have time to transfer the old data over.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.240]   Not just iPhones and iPads.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.000]   They also accept Samsung Galaxy S9s.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.880]   Older iPhones too like the iPhone 8, the iPhone 10.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.280]   Now what happens to all that stuff?
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:48.000]   They take the very best stuff they get and they certify it and they sell it.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.360]   This is also, Gazelle is a great place to get an incredible selection of quality certified
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.000]   pre-owned devices at great prices.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.360]   Going back to the iPhone 6 through 10, my mom refuses to have a modern iPhone.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:06.000]   She will only have an iPhone 6s because she needs the headphone jack.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.840]   It's a great place to get the last headphone jack's iPhones.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:15.120]   For iPads, check out their standard Air, Mini and Pro models for laptops.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.440]   You get the MacBook Air and the Pro selection.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.760]   Even Cater to Android users with a variety of Samsung Galaxy phones.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.400]   See, there's always somebody who's ready to get the next thing.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.520]   And I think most of us are willing to have the older thing and save big.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.520]   Here's the nice part.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.960]   Every device is fully inspected and backed by a 30-day return policy.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:38.840]   All of them work on the major carriers in the US, but none of them have a carrier contract.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:43.200]   Gazelle also will give you financing, which makes it really easy to buy.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.160]   On checkout, you can say, "I want financing with a firm."
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.280]   Some basic information you'll get instantly approved.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.240]   You could pay off in three, six or 12 months through bank transfer check or debit card.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.640]   All you got to do is check that box financing with a firm.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.440]   It's very easy.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.000]   Gazelle, we love it.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.960]   Go to www.azelle.com.com, give new life to use devices, train them in for cash or buy
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.440]   a certified pre-owned device.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.040]   It's good for the environment.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.960]   It's good for your pocketbook.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.040]   Visit gazelle.com today.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.040]   Get started.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.440]   This is the Gazelle season.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:24.600]   G-A-Z-L-L-E.com.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:29.080]   I like the iPhone XR.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.800]   You know what?
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.120]   There's some good news about the XR.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.280]   One of the things, there are two things you give up.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.560]   10R, which is nice about the 10R, $750 starting price.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.880]   It's a lot less than a 10S.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:47.600]   Size, I think, is kind of the sweet spot in between the 10S and 10S Max, kind of in between.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.760]   But you have an LCD screen, not an OLED screen.
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.760]   It doesn't bother me.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.600]   That's a great screen.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.840]   And you only get one lens.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.200]   Well, the tests are in.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.360]   It's the best single-end phone yet.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:05.040]   In fact, even beats the Pixel 2 in single-camera benchmarks.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:10.560]   This is from DXOMark, which often does these tests.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.760]   They gave it a very good score, which is very encouraging.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.880]   The iPhone XR offers comparable quality photos to the 10S Max.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.960]   In fact, DXOMark said it's a better flash.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:26.920]   The only thing you miss is the Zoom, the optical zoom, with the dual lens.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:33.480]   And some BOCA effects you get with the portrait mode, because in some cases it uses the dual
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.800]   lens.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.280]   It works well according to DXOMark with a human subject, but it doesn't work well with
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.720]   something other than a face.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.080]   Well, okay.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.280]   They rated the phone very good for indoor and outdoor shots.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.960]   Not as great for low light conditions, but that's a problem most phones, except for these
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.720]   new pixels are prone to.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:54.520]   It also has excellent autofocus according to DXOMark with fast response times and no
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.840]   focus stability issues.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:02.760]   So if I honestly think I have a 10R, I really like it.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:07.800]   And I think people who want to save money and maybe were worried that, oh, the camera's
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.880]   because it's got a 12-A12 bionic in there.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.160]   It's the new platform.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.840]   It's just got that LCD screen.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.280]   Looks great.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.280]   And it's got a single lens, which works according to DXOMark very well.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.120]   In some cases, better than the 10S Max.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.720]   It's even better than--
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.720]   I think--
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.720]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.040]   And it's even better.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.280]   It scored even higher than the iPhone X last year.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.280]   So that's--
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.280]   It's pretty very good.
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:40.760]   I wish that they had test for the new Pixel 3, which is also a single lens camera, phone
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.760]   camera.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.920]   But it really is reassuring to know that Apple didn't cheap out on anything.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.840]   They really tried to make the best camera, the best screen, the best everything they
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:56.120]   could while still getting the price down back to the level of a non super, super premium
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.120]   price phone.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.120]   Yes, Lori.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:04.840]   I was going to mention that when my friends ask me which iPhone should I get, because
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:10.440]   right now you can get a 7, 8, 10, 10-R, 10S.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:15.320]   There's so many now that are just straight from Apple, the current line.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.640]   And I always recommend the 10-R because it's the perfect in between.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.200]   There are a couple of people out there who I think would benefit from a 10S or 10S Max
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.880]   when it comes to the camera.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.000]   But screen quality, no.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.800]   I think the difference between them too for most of us is not even recognizable.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:36.160]   But with the camera, most people are going to be very happy with the 10-R camera.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:40.560]   So I definitely believe that the 10-R is the perfect in between.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.880]   I tried to discourage people.
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.880]   Nobody needs--
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:48.360]   From getting an 8 or a 7, because why not get the-- I mean, you say it a little more, but
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.320]   although I have to say with trade-ins, the iPhone 10-R is very affordable right now.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.360]   It really is the new CPU that is the star in that game.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.520]   You want the A12.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.520]   I really think so.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.520]   That gives you future proofing.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.520]   Exactly.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:04.880]   I think the only reason-- the only reason I like the S is because I use the Zoom a lot.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.880]   You know, like all the time.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.880]   Yeah, at least it does too.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.360]   And she says I would have to have the Zoom.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.840]   And so if you know that, you--
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.840]   Right.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.080]   If you're always tapping that 2X button, then maybe you want it.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:17.840]   There are people out there that you definitely would say you need the 10S or 10S Max, but
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.840]   that's not most of us.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.360]   Most of us don't need that Zoom.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.360]   I agree.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.360]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.360]   Although I do--
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:28.360]   I have to say, maybe in software, Apple will-- you know, I look at the Pixel 3 XL, which
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:36.440]   is also a single lens camera, but the Zoom on this is mind-boggling because of the computational
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.520]   photography they're doing with it.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:43.080]   And I wonder how long before Apple does something similar in software that makes up
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.840]   for the lack of a physical lens.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.640]   Yeah, it's totally possible.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:53.640]   The other slightly not awesome issue, but for most people it's not an issue is that
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:58.640]   the bokeh effect is only available for faces, so their depth effect.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.840]   It won't recognize an object, a cat, your food.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.080]   It won't give you that effect.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.080]   It will only do that if you have a face.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.960]   Most of us are not going to use portrait mode to do anything but take pictures of ourselves.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:14.560]   But there are some Instagrammers out there who I think would be disappointed to discover
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:20.640]   that if they want to take portrait mode pictures of their cute cups or their cute shoes, that
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.440]   they don't get to do that with the 10R.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:30.480]   Yeah, and what Lori is saying is super interesting too because remember that the whole point
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:37.080]   of those modes is to sort of computationally fake having a different lens altogether.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:41.600]   And now we're noting that one of the things you lose by getting the less expensive single
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:48.400]   lens camera is that you can't fake that the fake lens as well as you can with just the
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.400]   single.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:56.280]   And I think that the real big leaps from the next couple of years certainly are going
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:00.120]   to be in the computational end of things.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.760]   Before the show, Leo and I were talking about the night sight feature on our Android cameras
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:10.760]   and how we can take, I think for myself, I can take pictures walking at 1 AM from Lincoln
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:16.680]   Center to Penn Station to New York that would be absolutely pointless to even try to take
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:20.360]   with my iPhone or with any other camera that didn't have this feature.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:25.000]   And what you really appreciate isn't necessarily that if I zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom on this daylight
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.360]   picture of this building, there's better color and less noise.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:34.080]   The more I zoom and the more I check it out, the thing you appreciate is that I can take
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.760]   a picture I couldn't take before or I can take a picture that I would have associated
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.960]   with having a $1,000 pocket camera or $1,000 SLR.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.160]   And that's what portrait mode does and that's what night sight does.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.200]   And that's what we're going to see in the next couple of years.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.640]   We're going to see Apple get much better at low light stuff, not by getting a new sensor,
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.520]   but by again doing more cooking of the image.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.200]   And we're going to see the Google phones, which are still, they don't have a single
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.160]   dual lens pixel phone in the lineup.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.840]   We're going to see them get better at doing that fake bokeh effect and try to figure
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:13.240]   out how to do it with just one lens and just by jiggling around the optical image stabilizer.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:17.320]   This is a picture I took with a Pixel 3 in Times Square.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.320]   It's an HDR picture.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:23.440]   It's kind of remarkable what you can do.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.160]   I mean, it just blows me away.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.040]   Here's an example of the zoom.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:35.320]   This was I was standing on the street outside the Lyric theater before we saw Harry Potter.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:40.880]   And I zoomed in on, see this thing up in the right corner, the nest with the wings.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:46.240]   I zoomed in on it and I have to say the detail, it's a little bit softer.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:51.680]   But that's, first of all, a much bigger zoom than you'd get with the iPhone.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.680]   That's zooming by pinching.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:56.400]   It's a completely digital zoom and yet because of computational photography, I think it does
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.720]   a remarkable job.
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:04.080]   It's not, look, if I had my 5D Mark 4 in a 200 millimeter lens, I'd do a better job.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.800]   But I didn't.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:09.120]   Yeah, I have to unlearn so much.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.560]   I used to say I've turned off all the digital zoom features on my phones because all it
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.800]   does is make the pixels bigger.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.960]   I always laughed at people.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.960]   I saw them.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.880]   I see them pinching in thinking you're going to hate that shot.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.280]   Whether it's on the iPhone, whether it's on the iPhone, it's on the phone, it does it
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:30.240]   so well that I can't really tell when I go through my film loop how many of these pictures
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:34.920]   were at the natural resolution and some were digitally zoomed.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:39.920]   These are the things that people with professional cameras said, "Well, you can't use a camera
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.920]   phone to zoom.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.400]   You can't use a camera phone in low light."
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.400]   That's changing.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:51.000]   Alex, you're as serious a photographer as anybody.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   I'm sure you still use-
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.480]   My photos, I take the vast majority of my photos on my iPhone.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.480]   Interesting.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.480]   Interesting.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:03.200]   The thing that I'm carrying around and so I definitely have an SLR.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.920]   I have a Canon and I definitely shoot.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.360]   When I take pictures with it, it is like, "Okay, well, this is a much better camera."
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:13.920]   You definitely, it's not like I forget that if I want to take great photos that I'm going
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:21.640]   to print form of my kids, oftentimes, or my wife, I'm going to take it with my Canon.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:26.800]   There are many photos that I have printed on the walls and all kinds of other things
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.600]   that are all shot with my iPhone at this point.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.720]   It's amazing.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.920]   I think that the only two things I really carry around are my iPhone and I have one of the
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.000]   red stereo cameras.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.360]   I like taking stereo pictures.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.360]   I take lots of stereo photos.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.240]   You're using that.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:46.920]   I've been shooting stereo photos for a decade.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:54.440]   Fuji had a camera before this and then I had adapters before that.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.080]   I don't look at it as a phone.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.760]   It's nice that it has Android and everything else, but if it came out, it's a camera that's
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:03.800]   all I'd use it for because I find the process to be entertaining.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.240]   I just do it just for fun.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.280]   Do you remember Carson where that was?
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.560]   There was an article that said Apple and other companies are going to have a problem
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:17.520]   because we have reached not merely plateau, but really the beginning of the end, the
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:21.920]   decline of phones.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:22.920]   There it is.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.840]   This is from the New York Magazine and Telegencer.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.560]   We're no longer in smartphone plateau.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.320]   We're in smartphone decline.
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:35.280]   What he's pointing out is not only is it hard to find a feature in a new phone that will
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.640]   make people say, "Oh, this is much better."
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:44.200]   In between 2007 when the iPhone first came out in 2012, there were massive improvements
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:49.960]   consistently year after year and there really was an incentive to buy.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.000]   He says, "Now people really are sticking."
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.760]   We've got people in the chatroom saying, "Look at this.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.760]   They're sticking with their old phone.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.520]   We've got people in the chatroom saying, "You know that SE is still pretty good.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.440]   Why would you buy anything more than an iPhone 7?"
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:11.400]   Despite all what we're saying, normal people are not seeing the benefit of upgrading.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:16.560]   We're in a point now where people are repairing rather than replacing.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:27.360]   He likens it to the car industry where it just made sense for people to repair their
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.400]   car, not to buy a new car.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.360]   I'm not sure I completely disagree with that.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.680]   I think it's going to be a challenge.
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:40.400]   Apple already knows is one of Apple's solutions is to increase the cost of the phone.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:49.240]   To make up for a fall in unit sales by an increase in revenue by increasing the cost.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:55.040]   That's going to backfire in the long run as people are going to say, "Boy, I don't want
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.040]   to buy a phone that's over $1,000."
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:03.960]   I do think that we'll probably see a super cycle in three or four years.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:09.720]   Right now, 5G, I don't think is a big deal, but we've had the opportunity to work on some
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.920]   tests.
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.800]   We think that 5G is going to be a big deal in three or four years, but it will take that
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.800]   long.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.360]   Everyone's going to want to upgrade to get access to.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:21.120]   What will that feature be, do you think?
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:32.480]   Well, I think that there's going to be a lot of things you can do with your phone at venues
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.240]   and just walking around the street.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:41.000]   It's not so much to bandwidth, but the latency is really long.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.880]   It's way behind all the time.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:47.560]   That latency is going to go away mostly in urban areas and again in areas where there's
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:53.320]   a high concentration of venues or a high concentration of traffic where they end up supporting those
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.320]   things.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.320]   I think that that's going to happen also.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:04.040]   I think that we are going to get to a point where in three to five years we have 5G getting
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.920]   rid of Wi-Fi at home.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.200]   You're not going to-- Comcast is going to come through and say, "You don't need a router.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.440]   You're just going to be on 5G."
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.520]   Then what happens is you're not jumping from Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.880]   You're just on 5G.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:23.200]   So when you leave, when you're there, for the folks in the city, it'll stay on 5G.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.920]   For folks in the country, you'll be in 5G in certain areas.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.720]   So it'll be-- 5G will be a big deal.
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:34.200]   Apple says-- According to the Mingchi quote, Apple's not going to do 5G at least for two
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.840]   more years.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.840]   Which I think makes sense.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.280]   I don't think there's any good reason to do that.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:42.000]   I think that it's going to take a long time for this rollout to happen.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.520]   It is a little bit of a chicken or egg thing because you can't get people to upgrade their
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:51.040]   phones with-- that support 5G until there's enough places to do it.
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:57.000]   And Verizon is kind of using a non-standard, screwy 5G because they want to be out there
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.240]   first.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:04.960]   But there's a good argument for doing that so that you can get people thinking about it.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:11.040]   But back to your original point, I've got-- I still have my Pixel 1, which I bought when
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.160]   it was already out for a year because I got a good deal on it.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:18.240]   I kind of planned on getting a new phone this year because, hey, that's been two years,
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.480]   I'm kind of due.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:27.520]   But I'll be honest and say that the improvements that Google has made for the phone in just
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:32.280]   in terms of the camera having kind of wedded my appetite for-- it feels like I've got enough
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.960]   of a new phone right now that the fact that it's working perfectly, it's got plenty of
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:40.200]   storage, it's fast enough, and I haven't dropped it or damaged it, it's instilled in perfect
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   shape.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.960]   And that means that let's see if we can wait another year for something better to come
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.960]   along.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:49.040]   So yeah, it's so hard to impress us anymore because I think everything you can do with
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:54.400]   the hardware that solves a problem of mobile phones has pretty much been done and now it's
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.760]   a case of refinement.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:00.400]   So until Apple and Google and Samsung and Microsoft and everybody else come up with
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.880]   a new use for mobile that makes our renders our current phones inadequate and it's so
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:08.680]   good that I wouldn't want to be without it, I think that it is going to be a problem of
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:13.080]   getting people to buy new phones, they probably have to start making phones with certain water
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:17.040]   soluble components of it just to make sure the damps and wear out.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.240]   Well, I think that also I think that a lot of them-- I think folks are thinking about
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.200]   whether phones are going to be the future anyway.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.440]   So I mean, when we talk about wearables, I probably spend more time-- I'm starting to
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:29.800]   get to-- I don't spend more time looking at my watch, but I spend more time conscious
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.320]   of it than I was before and kind of managing things through it.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:37.120]   And of course, we're going to have AR glasses in the next two or three years from a variety
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:40.840]   of-- there's people already releasing them, but there'll be more of those.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:45.480]   And so the question is, is really how much more-- I think our screen time is also going
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.360]   on the phones, is going to reduce as some of the wearables start to become a little
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.360]   bit more transparent.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:55.560]   Yeah, I think this hit me a couple of years ago when I said, "God, I don't want to buy
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.320]   any more phones."
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.760]   And Lisa said, "You have to because you have to review them."
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:05.480]   And so I-- Perforce, we get the new phones, but honestly, there's not a lot of reason
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.480]   to get a new phone.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:12.600]   Mom, who has a 6S, as I said, just got a new battery from Apple.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:16.760]   That deal runs out at the end of the year for 39 bucks.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:19.640]   I keep saying, and I would give her a new phone.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.840]   She's not, "Oh, this has a headphone jack.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.400]   This is-- I love my iPhone 6S."
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:27.520]   And now that she has a new battery, there's no reason for her to upgrade.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.520]   So it's become that kind of mark.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.240]   Yeah, a lot of my friends are like that.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:36.320]   There's that kind of moment where these incremental changes that phone companies are making,
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:40.600]   you know, like a slightly better camera, or even if you go from something like the iPhone
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:47.200]   8 to the iPhone 10, which had a bigger display on a smaller phone, the guts of the device,
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:51.400]   it doesn't change enough from most people to say, "I want to spend $1,000 to get this
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.400]   new version."
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.160]   They're just happy with what they have.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:58.200]   You know, in some cases, it's even an issue just like you're saying, "My phone-- your mom's
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:59.600]   phone has a headphone jack."
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:04.800]   For some people, it's even like a desire to not move forward into that technology.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.240]   I already have headphones that use a headphone jack.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.600]   I already have lightning support.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:14.120]   I don't have any, you know, Qi wireless support stuff.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:18.760]   So I'm going to stick with the phone that works this way instead of works that way.
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:23.760]   So yeah, these are all sort of pointing in the direction of, you know, at some point,
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.360]   it's sort of a saturated market.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:31.920]   And there's only a certain portion of us who want the new phone every year, even every
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.320]   two years.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:37.720]   Most people want the phone that works best and they want that phone to last as long as
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:38.720]   they possibly can.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.920]   They don't want to spend money on new products every year.
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:46.080]   They want the one they have to last until, you know, 25 years from now until there's
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.640]   no such thing as smartphones.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:52.840]   So we're kind of at that point now, I think, where it's just-- there's not as many people
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:56.160]   who want to do that upgrade that they want to stick with what they've got instead of
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.840]   getting something new every time.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:02.840]   The other thing that Jake Swearngen and his New York Magazine intelligence article points
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:08.520]   out is that we're hitting commoditization where a product is a-- cars hit this, TVs
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.520]   hit this.
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.640]   He uses TVs as a good example.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:17.000]   You know, many years ago, you'd say, "I want a Sony Vega because that is a better TV."
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.720]   But at some point, all TVs were effectively the same.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:26.980]   And that allowed for companies like Vizio and the Chinese companies like TCL and HySense
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:30.640]   to suddenly take over because people bought by price.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.800]   There's no reason to-- and the same thing starting to happen with phones.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.960]   There are all these commodity phones, especially in China.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:45.560]   Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Transian, huge in Southeast Asia, Latin America, India,
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:49.840]   Africa, because the more expensive phones-- and this is killing Samsung and Apple.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:53.240]   I mean, this is a really big challenge for them.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:58.240]   Samsung's response is to create crazy phones, like the foldable phone I'll be selling next
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.240]   year.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:04.800]   Apple's response is to raise the price of the unit sales, even if they're flat or dropping
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.640]   don't impact the overall revenue.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:10.000]   But that can't go on much longer.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.720]   Apple has a good lock-in system, though.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.960]   You know, when I look at what Android does with its messaging, you know, Google just
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.000]   can't figure out how to do messaging.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.600]   Apple's got it with messages.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.600]   What?
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:21.600]   Somebody started it.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:26.080]   Somebody-- well, because it's desktop, you know, you can use it on a Mac, you can use
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.560]   it on an iPhone, you can use it on an iPad.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:29.560]   It works everywhere.
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.920]   It's got lots of rich features.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.240]   It doesn't-- you know, it turns into an SMS.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:39.720]   When you go into the outside world, you know, suddenly those are green bubbles.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.600]   Somebody said it on Twitter on Sunday, and I thought this was interesting.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.640]   I thought I'd pose this to you.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.260]   If Apple were to make a version of messages that worked on Android, wouldn't they just
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.280]   own the world?
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:55.120]   Are they only not doing it to keep the lock-in and to the Mac ecosystem?
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.520]   No, I think they're not doing it because they just don't want to deal with it.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.880]   I mean, I don't think it's a lock-in.
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.480]   I mean, they might be trying to lock in, and that might be one of the things.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:06.560]   But I think that Apple generally, when they do things that aren't cross-platform, I think
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:11.440]   that they have less to do with locking you in and more to do with the simplicity of programming,
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.360]   that they control the entire environment.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.000]   I mean, that's the whole advantage that Apple has is that they control the hardware and
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.800]   the software, and why would they--
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:19.800]   I choose on Windows as the reason.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.800]   --ex the perfect example.
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.840]   Apple Music on Android's a privilege.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.560]   They just don't work that well.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:30.260]   So I think that they just don't-- I don't think it's as nefarious as people always make it
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:31.260]   out to be.
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:34.160]   I think it's just we have a limited amount of programming and we don't like working on
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.160]   other people's platforms.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.160]   So why bother?
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.320]   We don't need to.
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.080]   So why bother?
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:44.640]   I think the big deal is that if Apple had a product or service that they felt as though
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:50.560]   they could extend and make more successful by reaching out to Android users, I think
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:51.560]   they do it.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:56.440]   If they had a goal for Apple Pay to make it like on the level of PayPal where it's just
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:00.560]   the standard that everybody's going to use to move money from one place to another, they
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:04.520]   would want to have a version of messages so that they could have-- so that people could
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.920]   PayPal each other money-- excuse me-- Apple Pay, each other money in a matter of what
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.280]   kind of phones they had.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.520]   But they just don't have that kind of ambition.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:16.520]   And as Alex says, it's really, really expensive to support multiple platforms.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:17.680]   It's such a pain in the butt.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:23.080]   It's hard enough just to add one feature to an app that's already on your platform or
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:27.640]   to support an app that's one step out of date, that's on your own platform.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:33.080]   Imagine creating a new version of messages for Android given how much trouble that messages
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:38.880]   at least causes me on iOS where undelivered messages and confusion about how I move from
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.960]   one phone to another and now my new phone is not getting this stuff.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:45.760]   So yeah, if Apple found-- I don't think Apple has a really good reason or a really good
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.320]   motivation to do it.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:50.920]   And they're not going to do it just to say that, hey, look, we've got-- look how far
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:54.120]   our influence is, look how far our reach is.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:57.360]   And the penetration for the new operating system is what?
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.120]   75% on the Apple.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:01.520]   And it's just completely fragmented on Android.
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.800]   And so it's not just supporting another platform.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.920]   It's supporting 10 other platforms to make it all work.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:13.880]   And I learned a lot about this when we built an app called Conduit, it's not Pixel Conduit.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.920]   And we worked on it.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:19.800]   And there was a Windows version for about 10 seconds.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.520]   We built one and released it.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:27.040]   And you're now supporting 25 platforms that we had to make sure that it worked on whereas
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.680]   on the Mac, we didn't have to do that.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:33.240]   And it was a really important lesson for me on not making it more complex because we weren't
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.760]   getting significantly more sales.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:40.080]   We were just getting a lot more customer support.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:45.440]   Yeah, it's nice to be in Apple's position where you're making so much money that a
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:48.680]   business opportunity like that, you could just have the discipline.
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:52.480]   And there's where Apple really excels to say, yeah, we could do it.
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:56.320]   We could make more money, but we're not going to have some discipline here and focus.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.120]   Stick to our knitting.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:03.120]   It's really the users that want it to be honest with you because Google just can't seem to
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.520]   figure out its messaging platform.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:08.520]   I would use iMessage everywhere if I could.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.720]   You always, I don't know.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:15.400]   I think a lot of Mac users who have lots of Mac, you know, Apple using friends.
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:20.200]   When you see the green bubble, you're just like, yeah, you know, like you feel like your
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.520]   wings have been clipped in this conversation bubble.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:27.640]   It gets so much worse when you have a friend who actually still doesn't have a smartphone,
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.240]   which I have a friend who still doesn't have a smartphone.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:35.520]   Those conversations are awful when you have to do group threads.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.800]   And there's one person when they respond, it looks like it's only going to you.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:43.280]   So yeah, I know what you mean.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:50.160]   When you have everybody in the same ecosystem chatting with each other, it really does help.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:55.440]   I think everything that everyone said makes so much sense that Apple doesn't need to,
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.800]   what's the point.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:01.920]   There are other sort of chat mechanisms that we could use that don't, they don't have
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:02.920]   to be Google.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.600]   They don't have to be Apple.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:09.560]   But because those are what we consider to be our text messaging apps, they're not our
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:13.560]   chat apps, they're our tech tech messaging apps in our brains.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:17.400]   We don't think about the fact that we could go to like a completely different program
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:22.520]   like Snapchat or even Facebook messages if we wanted to do our chat conversations with
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.680]   people.
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:32.960]   And yeah, the idea that Apple being able to or being willing to put messaging on Android,
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.840]   it seems like it would be like the perfect solution.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:41.520]   But it also would be so difficult and time consuming and not worth their effort to go
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.520]   across.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.400]   Yeah, they've got a discipline.
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:46.960]   Kind of impressive.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:51.200]   Rest of us would be leaping at the few extra bucks it would make us.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.800]   It's like, wow, we can own everything.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.800]   Let's take a break.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:00.320]   We're going to talk about trade war because it is, it is heating up and it is absolutely
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:05.120]   going to affect the iPhone and Apple in just a little bit.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.840]   Is there any Mac news that we can share?
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:13.040]   I guess all I would say is I am looking at that Mac mini more and more as the best Mac
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.040]   ever.
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:18.560]   I and be.
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:24.280]   I love my MacBook Air and I was concerned about speed but battery life and usability,
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:27.480]   no touch bar, the form factor.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.320]   I am using it all the time.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:34.760]   I have an, as you know, an I nine MacBook Pro, but that MacBook Air is the sweet spot,
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.520]   but at least for me and the way I use it.
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:39.320]   If I'm going to use Photoshop, I'll use my iMac Pro.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:43.680]   If I need something heavy duty, I'll use the iMac Pro or even my MacBook Pro, but for
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:51.000]   99% of what I do that MacBook Air is so nice and more than fast enough.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.400]   I have to say that Mac mini is starting to look a little superannuated with, I mean,
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:51:00.680]   the iMac Pro is looking a little superannuated with that Mac mini and the eGPU.
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:04.040]   A pair of those up and that's a pretty sweet.
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.760]   That's a pretty sweet platform.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.840]   And I could finally get that super wide 34 inch curved screen.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:09.840]   I've always.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.760]   I was looking at the exact same thing saying that.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:19.680]   No Mac, I'd much rather have a mini and like a crazy stupid looking screen and they're
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:20.680]   really, really good.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:21.960]   It's from my point of view.
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:23.840]   It's like, oh, how stupid is that until?
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.200]   Wow, I've got to use case for it now.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:31.040]   And that seems that would be a fun thing to sit down to every morning and stare at for
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.560]   10 hours a day.
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:38.520]   I know if people are aware of these, this is like this Samsung CF 791.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.480]   These are 34 inches.
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:46.160]   And the thing is essentially I have that set up, but it's three monitors with bezels.
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:49.160]   So it essentially would eliminate the bezels.
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:53.360]   The problem is I have an iMac and so there's, you know, I can't do that, but you sure could
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:58.400]   do it with, look at these, they're silly looking, aren't they?
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.920]   But and they're not expensive.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.520]   They're less than the LG Ultrafine.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:06.480]   So I'm someone who doesn't have Mac mini.
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.480]   I know what it is.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:08.800]   I know what it does.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:13.640]   But from my perspective, it's sort of a hobbyist computer.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:19.800]   So tell me as a computer user, what's the point?
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.200]   And this is somebody who is all in on Apple.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:26.760]   So you get that I'm definitely one of the average consumers when it comes to Mac mini
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:30.160]   and what it does and what the point of it is.
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:35.200]   So we haven't gotten any of the new ones just yet, but we're probably getting pretty close.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:41.680]   We've got about 30 of the older Mac minis and of different, everything from 2012 to newer
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:45.200]   ones and we use them for glue everywhere.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:50.640]   So they're, typically the form factor that we use them for is rack mounted into a variety
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:52.160]   of different kits.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:55.440]   You know, I don't know how many people really have them sitting on their desk, but they,
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:59.080]   the little sonnet rack mounts are, we have them everywhere.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:03.160]   And we use them for, again, glue, we want, I need scopes.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.200]   I need some extra information.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.600]   I need to manage logins.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:11.000]   I need to, you know, we don't depend on them that heavily.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.040]   You know, for graph, anything graphics heavy because the graphics process is horrible.
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:19.320]   And but outside of that, they have been, you know, probably one of the most used computers
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:23.800]   that we have because we can just kind of put them everywhere and then pipe them into whatever
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:24.800]   else we're doing.
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.040]   And I think that's a way a lot of professionals are using them.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.400]   I don't know if they're really a heavy.
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.400]   To have an consumer.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:35.560]   Well, but to answer Lori's, you know, hobbyist thing, no, if you put a six core I seven in
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:41.120]   there, which you can, and you add the EGPU, which gives it credible graphics before,
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:45.520]   especially if you use, you know, one of the third party GPUs, which can really have a
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.240]   real graphics card in there.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:52.120]   That's as fast as an iMac, probably as fast as iMac pro considerably less.
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:57.760]   And it gives you the option of this is the one I want, the Samsung 49 inch.
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:04.760]   So I have a table in my house that could fit that.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:10.160]   Well, the one of the things I'm looking at, three, three of those side by side by side
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.440]   for 180 degree.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.600]   You could go all the way around.
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:16.520]   That sounds very.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:21.000]   So this is, but see, I like I have three monitors, but again, the bezels screw it up.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:27.960]   If it would be the same amount of screen real estate in one monitor, that's awesome.
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:29.800]   Well, yeah.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.320]   And one of the things I'm looking at is, is I have a room that I keep, you know, this
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:34.440]   little server room.
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:41.120]   And what I've been looking at doing is getting my hard drives, my Mac mini everything all
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:45.200]   over there, which is, you know, maybe 50 feet from my office, and then just running the
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.760]   monitor on the keyboards in to my office.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.320]   And then just separating all this.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:51.600]   It's nice and quiet.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:55.760]   And it's got, you know, and I just have my screen and that's it.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:58.000]   And so you can also simplify a lot of things.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.840]   And that means that's a lot of how we use it in the office.
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:03.600]   So it's, you can mix and match.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:08.480]   You're not stuck with the, as good as the, I'm at screen is you're not stuck with that
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:09.560]   27 inch screen.
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:10.560]   You can do it.
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:14.080]   Yeah, that seems, that's what I would, that's how I would answer the question that it's,
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:19.400]   I'm kind of, after all these years, I've sort of come all the way around 360 back to where
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:24.280]   I started, where, well, well, well, well, I like it's now it's very, very useful for
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:30.160]   me to have a desktop computer that when I need a different screen, I can swap or who
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:34.160]   knows in two years from now, I might be doing a lot of video and I might want three monitors
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:35.480]   to set it up with.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:40.400]   Or now it's a right now it's just a simple like writing machine, but now I really want
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:44.400]   it to be like the hub of like an office network and I want to have a couple of raids like
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:49.880]   let's long off of it and I feel like I'll be able to keep using it for years and years
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:56.800]   and years and years, whereas my normal mode has been I can't afford to spend $7,000 on
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.800]   multiple computers.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:01.880]   So I'm going to buy a really, really good notebook and when I need to plug it into another
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:05.840]   monitor, I'll plug it into a monitor, but I'll be unplugging it at the end of the day.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:10.240]   Yeah, that's probably what I should do is use that MacBook Pro instead of getting on
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:11.240]   Mac Mac.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:12.760]   Look at this is why I want this monitor.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:15.120]   Look at this is 16 by nine.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:22.920]   Now watch when you go to the 49 inch ultra wide monitor 30.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:25.000]   Look how much more productive you're being with that.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   I am so.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.680]   Do you play a lot of Call of Duty?
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:32.280]   Doesn't matter what you're doing, although I have to say gaming would be pretty amazing
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:33.280]   on it.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:37.640]   Yeah, it's really, it's really streamlining and streamlining your aerial combat work.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:41.080]   Okay, maybe I want to try Fortnite on it.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:43.520]   I admit, maybe that's the goal.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.440]   They know who they're selling these things.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:50.400]   Yeah, but yeah, but it's more than just gaming because I honestly, you know, Alex knows when
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:54.920]   you use a final cut, for instance, you need multiple screens so that you can have the
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:59.240]   controls on one screen, the output another screen, the timeline, the third in this would
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:04.600]   give you that kind of you could have Battlefield and final cut running at the same time.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:07.200]   That's what I'm talking about eventually.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:13.000]   But my problem is I spent $5,000 on an iMac Pro, so I'm not likely to at any point be
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   replacing that.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.440]   Now, we're going to see a new Mac Pro, which we had also another way to do that, right?
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:21.720]   That's going to come out sometime in the next year or so.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:28.240]   But I have a feeling the Mac Pro will beat four or five times the price of a Mac Mini.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:31.680]   And really, most people, I don't need all the power of an iMac Pro.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:34.560]   That was a silly purchase.
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:35.560]   You just wanted it.
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:36.720]   You just wanted all the new things.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:37.720]   I get it.
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:38.720]   I'm missing.
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:39.720]   You're the other one.
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:40.720]   It's for the listener.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.720]   When you fix for the listener.
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:43.960]   I do it for you.
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:47.120]   But also, when you think about the professional use of one of the things we've done with Mac
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:52.040]   Mini's to some degree, and now I'm definitely looking at them for this, is rendering solutions.
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:57.040]   So you can put two of these per you into a rack.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:01.280]   So you can get 10 of them or 15 of them, and then you're sending out compression, you're
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:09.360]   sending out rendering, and they're relatively low power consumption and very powerful to
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:11.200]   do a variety of rendering solutions.
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:15.280]   And I think that a lot, I really think that Apple is when they rolled these out is really
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:18.880]   thinking about professionals and how they're going to use them because a lot of people
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:23.000]   have been using them in between all the other things.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:30.760]   Because the Mac Pro is not, I think the Mac Pro is going to be three you and a full wide.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.080]   And I think that's what they're going to end up putting in there.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:36.200]   Because I think that they realize that we don't care about the little round thing.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.760]   We just want to be able to put it into a rack.
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:39.880]   Well, they better not put it in the trash can.
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:40.880]   That would be a big mistake.
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:41.880]   I hope they--
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:46.360]   I think you just, you have the ears removable and some, you know, Apple-y kind of good looking
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:48.440]   way that you could set it somewhere if you want.
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:52.680]   But I think that people who are pros, we want to be able to swap out or add GPUs.
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:54.880]   We want to be able to swap the other pieces out.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:56.600]   We want it to be highly module.
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:58.080]   We want it to be racable.
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:00.840]   And I think that that is a more likely output.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.720]   Maybe not 3U, maybe it's 1U or 2U.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.040]   But I think that Apple might move more of that direction.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:08.600]   I think they've-- they went down the path of the round thing.
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:09.600]   But it's just not--
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:13.680]   Would you not welcome a cheese grater?
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:14.920]   I still have some cheese graters.
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:15.920]   I love the cheese graters.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.920]   I love the cheese graters.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:17.920]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:18.920]   They were so easy to add drives too.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:19.920]   They had so much space.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:20.920]   They were really--
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:21.920]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:24.640]   Well, that's exactly-- I mean, just that.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:28.040]   I think that there's ways that you could make that-- even the upgrade process.
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.920]   It's even easier, where you can slide things out, slide things back.
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:34.320]   You know, like pull a tray out and change your card and then pull it back in.
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:37.520]   And there's lots of things that Apple could do that innovate because we don't see a lot
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:41.000]   of innovation in the server area because people don't really care that are putting
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.400]   them in server farms.
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:47.400]   But I think that there is a way to make it a lot better for a lot of us.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:51.240]   And so I think that-- but I do think that a lot of us want rack-mountable solutions as
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:55.200]   opposed to ones we're going to put on our desk.
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:59.080]   When do you think we'll be talking about the Mac Pro?
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.080]   Earlier late 2019.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:02.840]   I'm going to guess late.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.640]   Late, really.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:12.480]   Yeah, I think we would have heard a lot more musings through the rumor mills by this time
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.520]   if there was something coming in the first half of the year.
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.520]   So I think we'll see it in the last half of the year.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:19.680]   And Annie, you think earlier than that, Annie?
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:24.960]   I think announcement at WWDC and maybe they don't want to tempt fate all the time.
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:31.320]   They announced a new powerful Mac at WWDC and had to say, hey, yeah, we meant this year
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.280]   on the Jewish calendar.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.280]   Not you.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:38.360]   But yeah, I agree with Laura.
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:41.440]   I don't think we'll see it on shelves until late in the year.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.440]   I think that--
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.440]   Which is a good thing for me.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.440]   Show it off during-- yeah.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.440]   I think--
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.440]   Put it on as long as you cancel.
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:49.120]   I can rebuild my savings.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.120]   Yikes.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:54.880]   Yeah, I definitely think an announcement in June in a release in November would make
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:55.880]   a lot of sense.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:56.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:57.880]   Let's take a break.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.960]   Our show today brought to you by the best way to buy online.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.400]   I do this all the time, privacy.com.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.760]   I've been using privacy for months.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.960]   It is a virtual Visa card.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.880]   And the minute you use privacy-- I just-- I love it.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:13.040]   There's a couple of ways you can use it.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.320]   What I do is I create a privacy card per merchant.
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:19.160]   So the minute the merchant uses that card, it's locked into that merchant.
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.360]   I could show you the credit card number.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:28.200]   It wouldn't matter because unless your Verizon or Hulu or Medium or one of the many people
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:31.680]   I use credit cards for online or Amazon, you can't use it.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:37.880]   I can also set a spending limit, which keeps people from stealing from me.
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.000]   I can freeze an unfreeze card.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.480]   So I never again do I have to worry about an online subscription going on for too long.
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.360]   I love privacy.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.080]   It is so awesome.
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.080]   Watch how easy it is.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:52.880]   Now you attach privacy to your checking account or to your debit card.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.800]   So this isn't a charge card.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:58.400]   It is immediately taken out of your checking account or your debit card.
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.200]   But to me, that's fine.
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:05.240]   I don't actually like to pay 19% interest on my purchases.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.800]   It goes out right away, which is fine.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:12.280]   It's 100% free to use because they make their money as all credit cards do from the merchant.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:17.240]   In fact, they make so much money, they even can give you up to 5% cash back.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.600]   The more you use it, the more you make.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:27.120]   You'll also know sometimes before the merchant knows if they've been hacked because you'll
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:31.400]   get notifications if a hacker tries to use the card elsewhere.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:36.040]   So if I use a card, let's say, I don't know, I'll use this Amazon as an example.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:40.000]   And suddenly I see a charge coming through from somewhere else on that same card.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.040]   First of all, it'll be declined because it's locked to Amazon.
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:49.160]   Second, I'll know, somebody got the credit card from Amazon.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.480]   That's amazing.
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:53.680]   That you sometimes would think you would know faster than the merchant themselves that they've
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:54.680]   been hacked.
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:58.760]   You'll get a decline email or push notification or both if the hacker tries to use a card
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:01.520]   elsewhere or the card goes over the limit.
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.600]   I love using limits.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.200]   I just set up a Verizon account for the iPhone XR.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.200]   And I set a limit on it.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.720]   I'm on the line with the representative.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:13.720]   And she put the charge here.
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:14.720]   She said it was a client.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:15.800]   I said, what did you charge?
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.800]   It was just over the limit.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.800]   I said, oh, wait a minute.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:18.800]   Hold on.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:19.800]   I moved the slider to the right a little bit.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.800]   I said, now charge it.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.800]   She said, I went through.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.600]   She said, you have control of that now.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.760]   I said, real time control.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:25.760]   Yes.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.480]   And I could turn it back down if I want.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.740]   It's awesome.
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:29.740]   You want this.
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:32.240]   In fact, I told her I'm using privacy.com.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:36.640]   I literally said, Eugenia, you should be doing this anytime you're using a credit card
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.680]   online, especially privacy.com.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.480]   They have a Chrome plugin.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.400]   You can generate cards in the browser.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.580]   They have a website.
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:46.600]   It's very easy to create new credit cards.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:49.320]   The expiration date is always five years out.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.280]   So you don't have to think about it or worry about it.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.240]   You've got five years to keep using that card.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:56.720]   But as I said, you can pause or freeze it anytime you want.
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:59.240]   So you never get a subscription that just goes on forever and ever.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.200]   You just turn off the card.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.320]   It also, you can use any address and zip code you want.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:09.720]   So you get real privacy here because the merchant's not getting your real address or
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.440]   real zip code.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:16.200]   Security.com will approve it even if they don't care, basically.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.760]   It is absolutely as secure as a real credit card.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.640]   PCI DSS compliant.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.160]   Same security standards as your bank.
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:29.600]   They encrypt all your information using split key crypto partial keys are held by separate
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.600]   employees.
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.840]   I mean, they really pay attention to all of this stuff.
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:35.640]   There's a webhook API if you want.
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:38.720]   So you can access transaction data in your app.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.720]   Two factor authentication.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.160]   Of course I use that.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.520]   Now, bad news.
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:43.840]   Only available in the US.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:44.840]   Sorry, Canada.
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.840]   Sorry to all our listeners outside the US.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:50.680]   But the good news is it's 100% free to use.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.680]   It costs you nothing.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:57.120]   Privacy.com has saved customers over $100 million and unwanted and unauthorized charges due to
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.680]   compromised cards, hidden fees, forgotten subscriptions.
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.400]   Never worry about it again.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.840]   Protect your privacy and your money.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.600]   Virtual cards from privacy.com.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:14.760]   I should have told Eugenia to go to privacy.com/macbreak because she would have got $5 off her first
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:15.920]   purchase.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:18.880]   But she was, she was, how do you do that?
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:25.560]   Eugenia, you got to use this privacy.com/macbreak.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.560]   All of you do.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.600]   I love it so much.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.320]   I tell everybody privacy.com/macbreak.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:39.040]   Just a little thank you for using the Macbreak offer code privacy.com/macbreak.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.920]   $5 off your first purchase.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:44.280]   But trust me, this will save you so much money in the long run.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:47.680]   And it's so, I feel good using it.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:50.160]   I have dozens of privacy cards now.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:53.280]   And they just can't be used anywhere but that one merchant.
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.280]   That's fantastic.
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.200]   And I could turn them off anytime.
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.200]   Privacy.com/macbreak.
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:02.680]   Let's see here.
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:11.000]   So China has, I think this has to do more with the battle back and forth with Huawei
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.200]   and the tariffs.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:17.560]   But China has ruled in favor of Qualcomm's patents.
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.760]   It's happened yesterday.
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:26.640]   And they've ordered, they've blocked sale and import of the iPhone 6S, 6S plus 7, 7
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:31.280]   plus iPhone 8 plus and iPhone 10 in China.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.600]   Doesn't I guess impact the most recent iPhones?
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.480]   I'm not sure why.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:42.120]   But this is going to be the new reality for every company that does business in China
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:45.520]   and any company that imports products from China.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.720]   I'm a big fan of eBikes now.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.920]   I've kind of got the eBike religion.
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:55.560]   I've been waiting for an eBike from Lithium Cycles, the Super 73.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:07:03.520]   And I sent out a note saying thanks to the 25% tariffs on eBike motors imported from China,
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:08.720]   we had to move all of our manufacturer offshore because we just got a shipment that would
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:11.800]   have cost us $300,000 in tariffs.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:16.040]   So we transgipped it to Germany and that's going to delay your bike a little bit because
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.720]   we now have to assemble it in Germany.
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:22.120]   These tariffs are going to impact everybody.
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:29.640]   Of course, the temperature has been ramped up because now the CFO of Huawei has been
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.040]   arrested.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.600]   Not saying that her arrest is illegitimate.
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:36.680]   She was arrested in Canada, will be extradited to the United States.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:44.160]   The US is accusing her of breaking the Iran sanctions by creating a phony shell company
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.320]   selling Huawei gear.
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.440]   By the way, not just Huawei gear.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:54.280]   They were selling HP gear through this shell company to Iran.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:08:02.360]   So remember, we talked about back in February, the FBI saying, don't buy a Huawei smartphone.
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:06.280]   In August, the president signed a bill banning government agencies from using Huawei and
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:08.440]   ZTE equipment.
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:15.040]   You've recently seen the administration going to other countries saying, don't put Huawei
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:17.440]   gear in your 5G equipment.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:24.160]   Again, there's clearly a legitimate case here and legitimate cause for concern since Huawei
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:27.480]   was founded by a former member of the Chinese military.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:32.200]   Their CFO, Meng Wanzhou, is actually the daughter of the founder.
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:36.320]   So there's definitely tight connections to the Chinese government.
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:42.400]   But now there's concern that China, which is not happy about this, will...
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:43.760]   I'll put it this way.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:48.320]   If I were you, Alex Lindsay, I wouldn't go to China anytime soon.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:52.840]   And I think a lot of tech CEOs are saying, I guess I'll put that trip off.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:58.560]   Yeah, this could actually end up damaging the situation for China more than I think we
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.560]   think.
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:02.680]   I think most people will say that this is not a...
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:03.680]   It hurts the...
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.880]   The tariffs hurt the United States in many ways more than China.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:13.520]   But I think that there is a chance that China gets damaged very badly here because you have
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.120]   a lot of companies that are starting to make choices.
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:21.080]   Foxconn is looking at opening up iPhone manufacturing in Vietnam.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:25.360]   You have GoPro moving some of their manufacturing.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:29.600]   And the thing is that once that starts to happen, sometimes it's a genie that's hard
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.240]   to get back in the bottle.
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:35.680]   When things start to expand out, where people don't have to start deciding that China is
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:39.280]   not a safe place to do this, I think that it is...
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:43.600]   The long-term hit is going to be a little harder for China.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.200]   Obviously, Apple may take a hit in the...
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.800]   They're kind of caught in the middle of all of this.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.760]   And so they may take a hit as well.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:50.960]   Huawei is taking a huge hit.
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:56.400]   I think that there is so much concern about the security protocols related to China.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:59.520]   I think that China really looked at 5G as something they're going to expand all over
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:04.240]   the world using Huawei technology and now country after country is starting to shut them
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:07.920]   out for security concerns, which are probably valid.
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.520]   So Canadian...
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:14.160]   Canadian telecoms are removing Huawei gear from their 5G installations.
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.640]   It's going to cost them at least a billion dollars.
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:22.480]   And BCE teles, Rogers all use Huawei equipment.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:27.960]   Huawei is the number one manufacturer of 5G gear in the world.
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:30.560]   They're the number two phone manufacturer.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.560]   And I'm not saying there isn't a real cause.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.560]   I mean, for concern, there's two problems.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.560]   One spying.
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:36.560]   They could...
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.520]   Huawei gear could be used to spy on American companies for industrial espionage.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.280]   And also the real threat of cyber warfare.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.280]   They could...
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.800]   Maybe there's a kill switch built in.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:48.080]   They could throw a kill switch and take our networks off the air.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.880]   I don't know if there's evidence of that though.
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:50.880]   That's the problem.
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:55.800]   There's a political component to this and there's a real security pro component to it.
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:58.360]   And I don't know how much of one or the other is in play.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.680]   There have been concerns expressed for quite some time.
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:01.680]   Yes.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:02.680]   Actually in Bamba era.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:03.680]   Yes.
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:04.680]   Absolutely.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:05.680]   And Trump thing.
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:06.680]   It is a...
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:07.680]   Oh gosh, no.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:13.960]   You know, concerned about it that they've found information that worries them.
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:14.960]   Yeah.
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:21.000]   It's really, really difficult when you have basically a state run country as China is,
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.200]   which is not to say that there are companies in the United States that would not do under
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.200]   handed things at the behest of our government.
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:31.680]   But the thing is they really...
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:36.280]   There's a stage at which a company in America can say no saying we're just not going to
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:39.760]   be part of that if they want to do that.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:44.960]   In China, there is a limit to how much they can push back before they can continue.
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:49.240]   They have to decide do we want to absolutely be ended as a business or do we want to do
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:51.680]   exactly as our government tells us to do.
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:57.000]   What I honestly fear more is just a heightening of tensions between the two countries.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.160]   When countries trade together, there's a natural tendency towards good relations.
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:09.200]   When they're not trading together, when people silo, that leads you to less good relations
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.560]   and ultimately war.
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:11.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:15.920]   So I think there's a larger concern here about the purely economic.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.920]   And it's getting hot.
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:21.680]   Chinese, there are Chinese companies at this point that are telling their employees don't
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:26.680]   use iPhones, use Huawei phones in solidarity.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.680]   It's getting hot.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:31.440]   And of course, as I just mentioned, China is now blocking all but the most recent iPhones
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.440]   from import.
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.200]   But that's the weird thing.
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:37.040]   It seems as though...
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:42.240]   And this isn't a bearded socialist talking.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.480]   Once you lose the support of wealthy people in your country that think that they will
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:50.960]   no longer be wealthy if this plan keeps going forward, that's when revolution happens.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:57.080]   Or that's when factions start to get lots and lots and lots of support.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:02.280]   And we might see interesting things happening the next five or ten years as people who...
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:07.920]   The first generation of the first generations of inherited wealth who feel as though they
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:14.120]   are entitled to their status are suddenly looking at the government as not people who
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:18.360]   not not people who enable and engage us and give us these opportunities.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:22.480]   Not as people who are going to try to take away our wealth from us and take away our
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.160]   power from us.
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:28.320]   And again, that's when you start to see if there is no democracy, that's when democracy
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.080]   starts to creep in.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:33.920]   And if there is democracy, that is when you start to see the opposite of democracy,
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:34.920]   keep creeping.
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:40.680]   I don't see much trend of democracy creeping in anywhere in the world at this point.
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:43.680]   It seems to be going the opposite direction.
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.680]   And again, if you're not...
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:49.280]   If you're not kind of in bed with another country, then there's always the risk that
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:50.720]   you will be at war with another country.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:55.120]   And that's really to me, I think that's a bigger concern than any economic concern.
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:59.520]   As Muslim Churchill said, "Talk, talk is always better than war war."
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:00.520]   Yeah.
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:01.520]   He's a jaw job.
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.520]   But yeah.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.520]   Rocket 88.
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:09.480]   Like Peter McKerham said, "When trade stops crossing borders, soldiers soon do."
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.600]   Apple bought a company called Bennett.
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:17.520]   Now they've released their new Bennett 3.5 inch or 3.5.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.040]   I don't know which it is.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.640]   I guess it's 3.5 sleep monitor.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:25.840]   Bennett makes a monitor that goes in the mattress or under the mattress.
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:28.760]   And the new 3.5 version is available at the Apple Store.
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:34.800]   $150, a little expensive, goes under the mattress and it will work with the Apple Watch.
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.120]   People have wondered why the Apple Watch doesn't have sleep monitoring.
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.040]   Well, this is how Apple's going to do it.
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.760]   They own Bennett.
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.600]   And it actually makes sense because you don't.
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.880]   I mean, how many people want to wear a watch to bed?
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:45.880]   You got to charge it sometime.
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:48.920]   Well, if you got a monitor in the bed, it automatically goes to the watch and that's
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.560]   nice.
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:54.400]   This is expensive though compared to the SIRDA sleep monitor, which I use, which is now
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.640]   under 60 bucks.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.760]   I'm not sure if this is better or not.
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:04.360]   It measures how much time you spend snoring.
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:09.560]   Sleep time, bed time, time to fall asleep, time awake, time away from bed, wake up time,
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:16.320]   sleep efficiency, heart rate measurements, average latest, I'm sorry, highest lowest,
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.080]   average breathing rate.
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:25.720]   It has a force sensor, capacitive touch, a humidity sensor and a temperature sensor.
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.120]   Is that a P sensor or is that a humidity sensor?
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:32.760]   It's a strap like this that you put under the bed.
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:36.840]   Now I have the SIRDA sleep monitors, which are little paddles you put under the pillow.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:37.840]   You can have two.
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.120]   One for each person if you're a couple.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:44.080]   Then I also wear this Aura ring, which I really like.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.160]   I can check my sleep through that.
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:49.080]   This is another way to do it.
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:52.200]   You'll see a heart rate curve, resting heart rate, average breathing rate.
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:55.400]   I think the snoring thing is interesting.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.400]   It must detect vibrations.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.000]   I don't know.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.240]   Total duration of snoring.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.680]   That's something I would like to know.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:06.880]   When I snore, I would like to know it.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.640]   I think more exciting to me than the ECG monitor on the Apple Watch.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:12.640]   I agree.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:15.080]   This affects more people, doesn't it?
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:20.720]   Not only that, but there's so much data that you can get from how much time is somebody
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:25.680]   spending in bed just for that and also how well are they sleeping.
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:27.520]   It's not just the numbers.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:32.520]   It's also this person used to be sleeping roughly five to eight hours a night, seven
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:33.880]   days a week.
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:39.560]   Now they're sleeping two hours at a time or now they are in bed for whatever reason,
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.360]   12 or 13 hours a day.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.360]   Does this mean depression?
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:45.240]   Does that mean that they're having trouble keeping their balance and they'd much rather
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.240]   stay in bed?
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.120]   Are they feeling sick?
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:52.680]   There's so much data that once you connect it to all this other data that can be collected
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:17:01.240]   and analyzed, it really does paint a much more perfect picture of someone's overall health.
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:05.640]   This is the aura ring told me that I went to bed last night at 10 15.
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:11.680]   I woke up at 8.04 total bedtime, then nine minutes, forty eight nine seconds, resting
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:14.800]   heart rate, fifty eight minutes, sleep efficiency, seventy one.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:18.520]   It took me 13 minutes to fall asleep.
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.880]   It's a very small amount of deep sleep.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:25.360]   That's the most important one, 16 minutes, four hours of REM sleep though.
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.840]   I was dreaming, baby.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.760]   Woke up a lot though, 11 wake ups.
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.800]   That kind of stuff is interesting.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:34.960]   One of the things this aura ring measures that neither bed it nor the sort of measure
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.600]   is your temperature.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.640]   And temperature is apparently very important too.
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.520]   I like this aura ring because I can wear a ring to bed.
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.880]   I can't wear a watch to bed.
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.640]   But I also compare it to the certa results.
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:51.920]   The certa results are pretty similar.
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:56.480]   That's an interesting comparison.
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:57.480]   It's called sleep tracker.
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:59.160]   Let me see if I have a sleep tracker on here.
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.640]   I guess I don't.
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:01.640]   I have it.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:02.640]   Oh, I know where it is.
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.560]   It's on my Android device.
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:07.920]   Too many phones, too much information.
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:11.040]   Sometimes I think knowing too much about how I know if I got a good night sleep, I know
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.040]   if I'm tired.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.520]   That's all I really need to know, right?
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:14.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:20.200]   There's probably a lot of people out there who suffer from some sort of sleep deprivation
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:23.880]   of some kind and being able to, well, not me.
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.080]   I get a great night's sleep.
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.080]   Please sleep.
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:27.080]   I'm very lucky.
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:28.080]   I'm very lucky.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:34.000]   But if you find yourself sluggish all the time and you don't realize maybe that you
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:40.440]   aren't sleeping well, being able to kind of find that out without having to go to a doctor.
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:44.400]   Although I'm saying the same things about the sleep monitor that I was saying about an
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:49.800]   ECG monitor, which I understand that whether or not you sleep isn't as dangerous as whether
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:51.240]   or not you're having a heart attack.
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:52.240]   Yes.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:58.040]   It's the same idea, which is that it's not bad to be able to kind of just get a little
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:59.040]   sleep.
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:03.760]   Just find out what your health is, what you're doing, what your body's doing when you sleep.
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:08.440]   Even like my mom, she now uses sleeping mask.
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.400]   I can't remember the name of it, the kind that gives you.
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.400]   It helps you breathe.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:12.760]   The CPAP, thank you.
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:17.160]   But she didn't know that she wasn't sleeping well.
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:23.480]   She just was sluggish and just cranky and physically she felt just kind of like she
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:24.480]   heard a lot.
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:26.480]   Sleep apnea is actually is life threatening.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:29.880]   That actually is something that needs to be treated.
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:34.560]   That was something that after months of talking with doctors, they finally decided to do a
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.840]   sleep study with her.
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:39.440]   This is a circumstance under which you could probably find out.
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:43.880]   At least you could know early on, "Oh, it looks like I'm not getting any sleep.
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:46.840]   Maybe I should go to my doctor right away and tell them specifically.
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:49.720]   I may not be getting enough sleep."
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:54.120]   Don't you know from me, just because I'm exhausted, that you're not getting enough sleep.
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.440]   Like I said with my mom, she didn't know that's what it was.
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.320]   She didn't know that she wasn't sleeping through the night.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:01.000]   She just couldn't figure out why she was tired all the time.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   She thought I go to bed at nine and wake up at seven or whatever her sleep schedules
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.560]   and didn't realize that she actually wasn't sleeping through the night that she would just
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:14.560]   wake up at 150 times a night or something like that.
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:15.720]   She didn't know she was waking up.
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:18.620]   It was just kind of happening.
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:28.660]   This is the 50th anniversary of the first demo of a mouse, of menus, of windowing, Douglas
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:34.020]   Engelbart, Doug Engelbart, then a mid-career 43-year-old engineer at the Stanford Research
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:37.940]   Institute gave the mother of all demos.
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:45.260]   December 1968, if you've never seen his 90-minute-long video, it's well worth seeing, he demonstrates
[01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:47.460]   basically all the technologies.
[01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:50.020]   We now take for granted.
[01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:55.820]   He said, "If you in your office as an intellectual worker were supplied with a computer display,"
[01:20:55.820 --> 01:21:00.340]   remember, this is in the day when you didn't have a computer display, backed up by a computer
[01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:04.060]   that was alive for you all day and was instantly responsible.
[01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:08.180]   I'm sorry, responsive to every action you had, how much value would you derive from that?
[01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:11.540]   Well, I think we know the answer to that now.
[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:12.540]   Pretty immediate.
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:20.500]   The most part about this particular article is the fact that he was inspired by, I'm looking
[01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:23.900]   for the date, it was like in 1945.
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:27.900]   Oh, Vannivare Bushes, as we might think.
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:28.900]   Yes.
[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:35.900]   This was an amazing, as we may think, this is an amazing essay that pre-saged everything
[01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:36.980]   that we've seen.
[01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:39.900]   He was the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development.
[01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:43.420]   Yeah, this is a very, very famous piece.
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:47.180]   If you haven't read it, you'll get chills when you read it.
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:49.340]   Like this guy knew.
[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:59.900]   It puts it into perspective just how important technology really is to us in our minds.
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:05.980]   We don't know that it's important to us until we already have it or if we don't have it.
[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:10.860]   We've been thinking about it since before we had technology, since we were just using
[01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:13.700]   telephones and radios and things like that.
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:20.300]   It's amazing that in such a short period of time, in the general lifetime of humanity
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:25.020]   that we jumped from not even having televisions to having the kind of technology that we have
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:30.500]   in our pockets and seeing articles that go all the way back to 1945, which to me seems
[01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:35.940]   so long ago that they were already contemplating this level of technology in our near future.
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:36.940]   Pretty amazing.
[01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:37.940]   Yeah.
[01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:43.460]   This is why the best, the only way to predict the future is inadvertently and by making
[01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:47.940]   the most ridiculous, absolutely inapplicable assumptions.
[01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:53.780]   Like, let's say that I'm going to give you 90 minutes to give a talk and I'm going to
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:59.180]   tell you that imagine that it's 10 years, 20 years from now and we have the ability
[01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:02.460]   to make transparent steel go.
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:04.180]   And then you think, well, of course, that's impossible.
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:08.820]   But if we had transparent steel, that means that we could basically make light conductors
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:09.980]   that are structural.
[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:13.940]   That means that we could make it would also be conductive, which means that we could have
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:18.420]   an electrically conductive and a light conductive material, which means that, and then, well,
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:19.420]   what do you know?
[01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:22.980]   You didn't foresee, you think that you thought that was theoretical that it would be able
[01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:26.940]   to do this, but then 20 years later, someone can actually do this.
[01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:32.860]   And it's because everyone, every future is 30 or 40 years ago, we'd talk about how, like,
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:38.380]   look how smaller microprocessor is going to get while doubling its size, excuse me,
[01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:43.060]   all doubling its power, while missing the idea of what if the breakthrough comes in
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:47.740]   battery technology, the fact that we don't have to plug things into an outlet anymore
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:54.180]   because we have tiny, tiny batteries that can power a computer as powerful as that for
[01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:56.020]   an entire day and make it practical.
[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:57.020]   So yeah, that's it is.
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:24:00.300]   And the entire, the entire demo is online.
[01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:02.660]   The entire paper is online.
[01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:06.820]   And after years of hearing about it and people reading people writing about it and actually
[01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:09.100]   seeing it, oh boy, was that a big payoff?
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:10.420]   It really does deliver.
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:11.420]   I was lucky.
[01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:14.500]   Engelbart died a few years, about five years ago, but I was lucky enough to interview
[01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:20.780]   him on the news on the old screensavers show he brought his the wooden mouse prototype
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:23.020]   that he used in this demo.
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:29.860]   And it was such an honor to meet this guy who was really such a forward thinker.
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:34.780]   And this demo, again, if you haven't seen it 50 years ago, pre-saged everything there
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:41.300]   is that that we use today, including a mouse, a cursor.
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:43.060]   Yeah, it's just incredible.
[01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:44.620]   And a pretty cool looking mic.
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:45.620]   Yeah.
[01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:48.300]   The mic is more modern, to be honest.
[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:49.500]   You want the NASA mic.
[01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:50.500]   If you can get it.
[01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:51.660]   I don't care about Bluetooth.
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:55.500]   I don't care about about the near field of communications.
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.660]   I just want the NASA mic.
[01:24:57.660 --> 01:24:58.660]   Yeah.
[01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:00.100]   It's really, really cool.
[01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:04.700]   Fun to watch this from 1969.
[01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.580]   This is a very big story.
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:09.460]   And I think very important.
[01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:14.380]   We've been debating back and forth over that Bloomberg story about Super Micro.
[01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:19.260]   The audit is complete, including servers applied to Apple.
[01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:22.580]   No spy chips found.
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:28.540]   Reuters reports that Super Micro today advised its customers as a result of a third party
[01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.940]   audit they told customers today.
[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:34.620]   And outside investigations firm had found no evidence of any malicious hardware in its
[01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:39.860]   current or older model motherboards.
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:44.860]   So I mean, we've been waiting for the other shoot a drop on this story.
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:48.100]   And it happened just a couple hours ago.
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:49.100]   Yep.
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:54.980]   And Art Delo and a company, a global firm, tested samples of motherboards and current
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:58.420]   production versions that were sold to not only Apple, but Amazon as well.
[01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:02.260]   That was where the ones that prompted the Bloomberg story.
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:06.060]   It also examined software and design files without finding any unauthorized components
[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:08.740]   or signals being sent out.
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:10.900]   Yeah.
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:16.380]   That's, you kind of knew that that was going to be the result when you realize that in the
[01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:24.500]   couple of weeks after this news broke, nobody else had anything corroborative or supportive
[01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:27.060]   that they were able to report after it.
[01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:31.100]   And it's not just the idea that, hey, well, gosh, this is news to us.
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:34.140]   Let's grab one of these motherboards and have one of our forensics guys.
[01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:37.700]   Excuse me, one of our forensics people take a look at it to find it.
[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:38.940]   It really is.
[01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:39.940]   It shakes away.
[01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:40.940]   It shakes out of the tree.
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:45.140]   A lot of other stories that a reporter might have picked up on, but didn't see the significance
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:50.700]   of at the time or a conversation that now seems to be important in retrospect.
[01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:53.460]   And nobody had anything after that.
[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:58.700]   So that's the next phase of this is where did you get this story from?
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:02.460]   How did Bloomberg okay it for publication?
[01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:09.500]   Because why didn't they retract once all these other organizations were?
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:11.020]   I think they're just trying to skip the cycle.
[01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:14.940]   They're just hoping that there's another news that's going to come up that they can just
[01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:17.020]   kind of step over it and skip the cycle.
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:20.980]   But these articles are going to keep coming out until they retract.
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:21.980]   This is an article.
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:26.300]   We're finishing our report on one that I bought in 2015.
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:28.580]   Oh, you actually are analyzing your elemental.
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:29.660]   We tore it apart.
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:31.660]   We tore it apart.
[01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:33.940]   So we're going to be posting something.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:37.180]   And they're going to keep on getting more and more data.
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:39.260]   And the thing is, is that Bloomberg just wants this to go away.
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:42.620]   It was potentially very damaging to Super Micro.
[01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:44.700]   This is the kind of thing that could end the company.
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:48.700]   And so for them to be as loose as they were with the data and have everything.
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:50.380]   This is a good example.
[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:51.380]   Everybody anonymous.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:53.660]   I get that it was important that no one knew.
[01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:56.900]   But I mean, you're putting yourself in all kinds of danger when no one wants to put their
[01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:57.900]   name on it.
[01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:00.620]   And I think that it was sloppy reporting.
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:02.860]   And these guys have had issues in the past.
[01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:05.100]   I think that it damages the Bloomberg brand.
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:10.220]   And I think that they were just trying to, they're trying to sidestep it.
[01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:11.500]   I think they just think it'll go away.
[01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:12.660]   And it's just not going to go away.
[01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:17.020]   I think at some point you're going to see Apple and Amazon and other press them again.
[01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:18.820]   They have to figure this out.
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:22.580]   And I think that we have to think about whether those reporters should be doing this again.
[01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:28.020]   Well, and in the Reuters story, they quote a Super Micro saying the company is reviewing
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:29.940]   its legal options.
[01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:30.940]   Yep.
[01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:36.940]   They've Bloomberg probably has really good insurance, but it might have limitations to
[01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:41.860]   what they, the sort of due diligence that Bloomberg is expected to perform before growing
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:43.820]   with the story in order to get the payout.
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:49.060]   So I'm going to follow this story because it's going to be an interesting tale of exactly
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:54.900]   how far a publication can stick its neck out without and still feel as though it's okay
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:58.700]   for us to move forward because what's the worst that can possibly happen to us.
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:02.060]   I think we're going to find out the worst that can possibly happen to Bloomberg.
[01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:06.860]   And the danger, the danger is not going to be the actual findings of the lawsuit.
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:10.420]   The dangers for Bloomberg are going to be the discovery and the depositions and the
[01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:13.980]   emails and the, did they try to cover this up?
[01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:16.100]   Did they try to slow it down?
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:20.540]   Where do they, all of that investigation is going to be incredibly damaging for them?
[01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:25.180]   And it's going to draw out over years when they, what they needed to do was when they
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:27.820]   realized they were in trouble, they needed to back away.
[01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:28.820]   Exactly.
[01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:34.300]   This is such a trust thing like the, especially news organizations, they rely on the trust
[01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:40.900]   of their readers and when something comes to light that might not have been right, even
[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:47.980]   if you're not ready to retract or say that we were wrong, making a statement that we
[01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:51.220]   have reason to believe that we don't have the exact correct information.
[01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:54.740]   We're going to do some research and follow up with it and Bloomberg just kind of remained
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:30:01.740]   silent in that, which I think is the biggest danger to their reputation is that now that
[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:07.260]   we see what they did with this news article, what are they going to do in future articles
[01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:12.380]   when it comes to light that the information may not be right.
[01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:17.820]   We can't even trust anymore now if somebody is to accuse them of not having correct information
[01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:23.300]   because we see under this circumstance specifically that when they were accused of not having
[01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:25.740]   the correct information, they did nothing.
[01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:30.500]   So it's a very, very dangerous situation for Bloomberg to be in right now with their
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:31.500]   reputation.
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:35.540]   Well, I think it's going to be hard for them to have any big blockbuster breakthrough
[01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:40.100]   scandal that they could cover again for quite some time because everything is going to be
[01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:41.660]   going through this filter.
[01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:46.980]   But even if it's not a scandal, even if it's just literally, you know, some company just
[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:51.780]   says Bloomberg lied about, you know, what they saw, even though they have pictures of
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:56.180]   it when I was walking down the street, now their reputation is at stake and therefore
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:31:00.740]   like that calls into question everything that they report on.
[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:03.220]   I just have to me, I just don't get it.
[01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:04.860]   I mean, they worked on this for more than a year.
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:07.460]   They had, you know, internal oversight.
[01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:09.140]   I don't understand how it happened.
[01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:12.860]   And I hope that they would step forward and say, well, here's what happened.
[01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:15.740]   They need to do a postmortem and they need to make it public.
[01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:16.740]   Yeah.
[01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:17.740]   Here's what happened.
[01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:18.740]   Here's how it happened.
[01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:23.100]   Here's why we believed it was good to go with this story.
[01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:26.020]   It is unbelievable because they are legitimate.
[01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:28.620]   I mean, they're highly respected.
[01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:36.020]   I was going to say at this level, one of the things is that people want to dismiss what
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:37.700]   reporting is all about.
[01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:42.260]   The thing is internally, you have to fight, part of the process at this level is you have
[01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:46.140]   to fight your own editors and your editors have to fight their own chiefs saying the
[01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:49.660]   prove to me that this is right, prove to me that you've got it.
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:51.940]   And you think you got it locked and you do have it locked.
[01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:56.020]   But someone upstairs is going to say, yeah, but what about this piece of information?
[01:31:56.020 --> 01:32:00.500]   I need to find another source to back you up on this or you need to find somebody who
[01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:02.900]   will go on the record on part of this.
[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:07.620]   And that's part of the challenge that gets the story tighter and tighter and harder and
[01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:08.780]   harder to refute.
[01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:17.140]   So that's why it really is baffling to me that a story can be this wrong and get through
[01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:23.020]   the process that means that there is a process that has failed immediately and catastrophically
[01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:24.020]   at Bloomberg.
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:25.020]   Yeah.
[01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:28.660]   I think we haven't heard the whole story yet.
[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:30.660]   There's something else.
[01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:33.820]   And I just don't, I can't imagine what it is.
[01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:35.180]   This is an opinion columnist.
[01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:37.220]   This was a news story.
[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:38.220]   Yeah.
[01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:42.860]   By all accounts, they'd been working on for more than a year and had a strong oversight
[01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:47.860]   from the editor in chief who's highly respected, came from the economist and it's a respected
[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:48.860]   publication.
[01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:49.860]   How did this happen?
[01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:51.100]   How did this happen?
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:54.940]   And you know, I don't know if there's a grounds for a lawsuit that's a complicated thing to
[01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:57.740]   do because of the First Amendment, but nevertheless.
[01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:03.300]   We deserve a little more information about this, not silence.
[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:06.900]   And the other thing is probably whenever agreement that those writer signed, I don't
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:09.660]   know if there's staff on Bloomberg or their staff.
[01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:10.660]   They are staff.
[01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:11.660]   They're part of the contract.
[01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:16.020]   They said, there's a clause that some or the contracts that I've signed.
[01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:20.140]   It says, by the way, you assert that you're not making any of this stuff up.
[01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:23.740]   And if you turns out that you did make up something that you put in an article that ran
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:26.940]   on a publication, we're done with you.
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:30.780]   You can, you get to fight the loss where our defense is going to be that this reporter
[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:34.340]   lied to us and you will not get the billion dollar defense.
[01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:38.580]   You will get the public defender, your cousin who was, who does state law.
[01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:39.580]   Yeah.
[01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:43.620]   One of the things we don't know is to in all fairness to the reporters is that we don't
[01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:46.620]   know that they may have been fed a story.
[01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:47.620]   Exactly.
[01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:52.100]   They could have been fed and designed a story by a group of people for whatever reason.
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:54.380]   I mean, this could be stock manipulation.
[01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:59.140]   This could be just people wanting to create a story and be an imaginative.
[01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:02.180]   I mean, because it's definitely like, hey, this is what's happening and you can talk
[01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:03.180]   to it.
[01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:06.260]   I know a guy over there and I know another person over here and they start talking and
[01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:10.020]   saying, you end up with 17 people that won't go on the record is they might all be connected
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:13.620]   to each other to some degree and all talking about it.
[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:14.620]   And so we don't know.
[01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:18.940]   I'm not saying that that's what happened, but I'm saying that we don't know what happened
[01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:22.260]   with those reporters other than they just really needed to have more actual data.
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:24.620]   They needed an actual board.
[01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:28.740]   People actually, you know, on the record reporting on it or they shouldn't have made
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:29.740]   such a big deal about it.
[01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:30.740]   I mean, they were on everything.
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:32.660]   You know, when they released this and that's part of it.
[01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:34.900]   It just got way bigger than I think anybody expected.
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:38.780]   I can't wait to hear Bloomberg's response.
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:42.380]   I hope there is one.
[01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:43.380]   Let's take a break.
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:45.300]   Your picks of the week coming up.
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:49.340]   The first word from last pass my pick.
[01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:53.060]   If you've got a password, you've got many passwords.
[01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:54.500]   Who doesn't?
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:35:01.100]   You need a password vault that's encrypted, secure that will help you create long, strong,
[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:04.540]   unique passwords for every site, every app.
[01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:08.460]   Last pass where I've been using it for a decade.
[01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:09.460]   It's the best.
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:14.460]   Steve Gibson, our security guy, actually talked to the creator, looked at the source code,
[01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:15.460]   gave it his thumbs up.
[01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:16.980]   He uses LastPass.
[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:22.260]   We use it at Twitter, the enterprise version, because if you think about it as a company,
[01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:25.900]   you're giving passwords to your employees, you're giving them the keys to the kingdom,
[01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:29.940]   the login to your bank account, your servers, your data.
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:32.780]   LastPass protects all of that.
[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:34.780]   Data breaches happen.
[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:38.660]   You cannot wait to get password security locked in.
[01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:46.420]   Make every employee on your team a part of your security solution with LastPass Enterprise.
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:50.100]   There's a few things your employees will appreciate from a convenience point of view.
[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:55.060]   It makes passwords sharing easy, but it keeps access to corporate data secure.
[01:35:55.060 --> 01:36:01.100]   Every employee has his or her own secure vault for managing and accessing passwords.
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:05.100]   LastPass Enterprise offers you centralized admin oversight.
[01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:10.380]   You can set over 100 policies, including master password requirements for the employees.
[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:12.500]   You can enable password resets.
[01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:16.660]   I get an email every time Russell does a password reset, because one of our employees has forgotten
[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:17.660]   their passwords.
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:19.740]   We require them to use two factor.
[01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:21.460]   You can do that too.
[01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:25.540]   If an employee leaves the company, you can restrict access as well.
[01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:28.580]   You get actionable security reports, shared folders.
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:29.940]   That's a nice feature.
[01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:31.420]   All the ops people have their folder.
[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:34.100]   The business department has its folder.
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:38.580]   The passwords they need are available to them, but no one else.
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:39.780]   We trusted so much.
[01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:41.220]   We put everything in LastPass.
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:46.660]   Database, longins, SSH keys, software licenses, business information.
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:47.900]   I use LastPass at home too.
[01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:53.780]   I put my passport, my driver's license, my social security numbers, everything, even
[01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:57.300]   things like my most important numbers, my frequent flyer numbers.
[01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:59.300]   They're all in LastPass.
[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:02.620]   It's convenient too, because I have those numbers whenever I need them, but no one else can see
[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:08.140]   them because LastPass data is encrypted and decrypted only at the device level.
[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:11.580]   Data stored in the vault is kept secret even from LastPass.
[01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:13.220]   It works everywhere you do.
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:16.700]   Android, iOS, Macintosh, Windows, Linux.
[01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:18.900]   There's a LastPass Chrome plugin.
[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:20.740]   There's a Safari plugin.
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:22.900]   There's an Edge plugin.
[01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:31.020]   It is the easiest way to create and remember and fill in passwords for any use.
[01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:35.580]   I tell you, with iOS 12 and now the new ability to fill in passwords, it's even easier.
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:40.700]   It's the first app I put on a new iPhone because it will sound me set up all the rest of the
[01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:41.700]   apps.
[01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:42.700]   I love it.
[01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:45.940]   No more copying and pasting from the LastPass app.
[01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:47.100]   Same thing on Android.
[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:49.220]   It's just really sweet.
[01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:52.380]   More than 16 million people trust LastPass.
[01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:56.340]   That's the number one most preferred password manager.
[01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:59.180]   You need it for your business as much as they need it for their homes.
[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:03.260]   In fact, that's one of the things we offer all of our employees because we use LastPass
[01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:07.100]   Enterprise, we also give them a personal account.
[01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:10.540]   What's nice is they can keep both accounts with the same login.
[01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:13.500]   If they use Microsoft Active Directory, it's even simpler.
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:17.900]   Then you can just log in with your Active Directory credentials, but it's still secure.
[01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:22.100]   LastPass premium for personal use, LastPass families, that's what I use at home, makes
[01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:24.340]   it easy to share passwords with my entire family.
[01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:28.980]   Their emergency access means I can designate somebody who gets access to my vault if anything
[01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:30.420]   should happen to me.
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:32.180]   That's really good.
[01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:35.740]   LastPass teams, if you have a small team, 50 or fewer, and of course, LastPass Enterprise
[01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:37.260]   for a big organization.
[01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:40.780]   It's affordable, it's effective, it's secure.
[01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:43.580]   It is absolutely a must in business.
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:47.100]   Take control of your business passwords, reduce the threat of breach, learn more at
[01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:52.180]   lastpass.com/twit.
[01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:55.420]   LastPass.com/twit.
[01:38:55.420 --> 01:39:00.020]   Lori Gill, do you want to pick a rock and roll song?
[01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:02.340]   Do you want to pick a scary movie?
[01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:04.220]   Your picks are always interesting.
[01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:07.060]   I like that you've caught on to my scary movie trend.
[01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:09.380]   Did you see the noose to Spira?
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:10.380]   I haven't seen it.
[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:11.780]   Don't break my heart.
[01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:13.260]   I haven't had a chance to see it.
[01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:15.420]   It's not available in theaters anymore.
[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:18.460]   Now I have to watch it on a boring old small home screen.
[01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:20.900]   It's coming out on Blu-ray DVD.
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:22.900]   January 29.
[01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:23.900]   I can't.
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:27.500]   It was just bad timing that I missed it in theaters.
[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:28.500]   It was a bummer.
[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:30.780]   It wasn't playing in Sacramento where I live either.
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:34.740]   I would have had to drive to San Francisco to see it, which isn't that far, but I didn't
[01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:36.980]   make any trips to San Francisco during that time.
[01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:38.940]   It was an Amazon studio production.
[01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:40.540]   I didn't realize that.
[01:39:40.540 --> 01:39:43.020]   Yeah, yeah, which is weird.
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:46.900]   I purposefully won't let anybody tell me what they thought of the movie because I don't
[01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:48.180]   want any judgments coming at me.
[01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:50.780]   I want to be very fresh when I go in and see it.
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:55.260]   So it helped to know that music was scored by Radiohead's Tom York?
[01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:56.260]   It hurts.
[01:39:56.260 --> 01:40:03.940]   Because I got, Goblin scored the original soundtrack, which I did actually go see Goblin
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:06.540]   scoring the soundtrack to Spira alive.
[01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:07.540]   Oh, you're serious.
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:10.740]   Right before the movie came out and it was beautiful.
[01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:15.300]   So I'm certainly, unless Goblin is scoring the remake, of course, I don't think it's
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:16.300]   going to be.
[01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:20.060]   So I think I should see the trilogy, the original, and then I can see the new one.
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:24.420]   Honestly, I don't know because I don't know what the new one is going to.
[01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:28.580]   It's like, I don't know whether or not it's capturing the original story or if it's taking
[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:29.820]   a different route.
[01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:34.300]   So I can't recommend to you one over the other, but I can definitely recommend to watching
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:38.100]   this, the original mother of tears trilogy because it's amazing and beautiful.
[01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:39.100]   It's beautiful.
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:40.100]   Oh my goodness.
[01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:41.100]   Best pick.
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:42.100]   What do you got this time?
[01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:49.140]   Well, this time is something much less interesting, but I just went to the absolute depth of
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:55.380]   my laziness on Sunday and just did not want to go grocery shopping at all.
[01:40:55.380 --> 01:40:56.580]   But we were out of food.
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:59.100]   I needed to go grocery shopping.
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:03.620]   So I signed up for Instacart and it was wonderful.
[01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:09.540]   So my pick is actually Instacart because I couldn't believe how easy it was to have
[01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:10.780]   all of my groceries.
[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:14.060]   I picked them right on the website.
[01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:19.780]   It's available in a lot of places and a lot of grocery stores support it.
[01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:24.220]   So my grocery store that I normally go to was right out there on the list.
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:28.100]   And for anybody who's wondering, you don't only get to pick from brand names, you can
[01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:34.020]   pick store brand, which is I buy a lot of store brand stuff because it's less expensive.
[01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:37.220]   You're not paying more to get it.
[01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:38.220]   It's the same price.
[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:39.220]   You can use coupons.
[01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:43.020]   You can use the sales that are happening in that store live.
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:45.700]   You get all of that.
[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:51.260]   I believe you pay somewhere around $10 per delivery.
[01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:57.700]   It's like a $5 delivery fee and a $5 service fee within that price range.
[01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:01.980]   And then they do recommend that you tip the person who's buying your groceries for you
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:07.100]   because they literally, there's a person who goes into the store and does my grocery shopping
[01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:10.180]   for me, delivers it to me, the woman who delivered to me.
[01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:13.660]   Her name was Leslie and she was the nicest woman.
[01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:16.540]   I actually signed up for Express Delivery.
[01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:19.260]   It was a free 14-day trial.
[01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:21.180]   This just happened on Sunday.
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:24.300]   So I've only done this once and loved the experience.
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:29.620]   But I think I'm going to end up keeping the Express Delivery, which is $99 a year because
[01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:35.420]   honestly, $99 a year is worth me not having to go to the grocery store every week.
[01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:37.260]   I also don't own a car.
[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:41.180]   So if I need to run to the store for something, it's a big ordeal.
[01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:46.660]   I have to ride my bike or call for a Lyft or Uber or take the bus.
[01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:49.740]   It's not just a hop, skipping a jump down there.
[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:53.740]   So this is for me, it's even more beneficial for just the ability to get stuff from the
[01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:58.300]   store when I don't have easy access to transportation down there.
[01:42:58.300 --> 01:43:00.020]   So thank you, Instagram.
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:05.020]   So in our area, Safeway Whole Foods Costco Smart and Final CVS Petco Smart Food Service
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:06.820]   Bevmo, Sula Table.
[01:43:06.820 --> 01:43:08.100]   I mean, it does everything.
[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:09.100]   This is awesome.
[01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:10.100]   Yeah.
[01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:11.100]   Oh, man.
[01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:17.260]   I felt so bougie doing it, but I was so happy with the results.
[01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:19.540]   Sometimes bougie is not that bad.
[01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:23.460]   It's just that issue of like, I don't have time to go to the store.
[01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:27.380]   I don't have the time to eat to make dinner, so I go out to eat a lot.
[01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:28.780]   I'm one of those people.
[01:43:28.780 --> 01:43:29.780]   No, yeah.
[01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:31.400]   You gotta start cooking.
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:32.440]   You gotta start cooking.
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:34.240]   - Well, now that I get my groceries delivered,
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:36.440]   maybe I will shop offices.
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:37.440]   Cook 'em after me.
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:39.720]   - I made veneerschnitzel last night.
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:41.840]   That's a popular request.
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:45.280]   Our 16 year old, don't tell him,
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:47.760]   'cause I used to make pork chops,
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:51.420]   breaded pork chops, and he wouldn't eat 'em.
[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:52.800]   So I pounded him flat and I said,
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:55.000]   it's veneerschnitzel, now, he eats it.
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.800]   (laughs)
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:58.520]   It's actually quite good.
[01:43:58.520 --> 01:43:59.500]   - It sounds really good.
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:01.980]   - Yeah, I like to put tamino sauce and mozzarella
[01:44:01.980 --> 01:44:03.580]   in them and then it's parmajana.
[01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:09.160]   It's fun to cook, but you're right, it's a pain.
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:10.920]   That's why we use blue apron.
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:13.360]   It's a pain to go out and shop and then plant it
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:14.640]   and then cook and all that.
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:16.440]   This is nice, Instacart.
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:21.500]   Alex Lindsay, somebody in the chat room is saying,
[01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:24.700]   could you tell us once again what flannels you recommend?
[01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:25.840]   (laughs)
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:26.840]   - Put flannels?
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:27.840]   What flannels I recommend?
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:30.420]   - Would you ever recommend flannels?
[01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:31.420]   - I don't remember.
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:33.220]   - He said I need to know what Andy's,
[01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:36.620]   I mean, Alex's flannels, or maybe it was Andy.
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:38.800]   No, it says, "And Justin Crash says,
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:41.500]   "Can Alex share his pick for best flannel again?"
[01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:43.820]   I can't find the episode where he shared his favorite
[01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:47.340]   flannel and I want to get one for the cold weather.
[01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:48.740]   - Well, I mean, the one that I wear,
[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:51.060]   probably more often, I don't wear them on the show that often,
[01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:53.340]   but the one I wear the most is a Lindsey plaid.
[01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:56.420]   So it might be that.
[01:44:56.420 --> 01:44:58.320]   There's a Lindsey plaid, it's very Christmassy.
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:00.320]   It's red and green, and so,
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:02.760]   especially around the season, I tend to wear them.
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:07.160]   The, they may, LL Bean makes them seasonally,
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:08.800]   so sometimes they're available,
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:09.920]   I don't think this year they're available.
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:11.920]   So as a Lindsey, you're always like,
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:14.840]   not this year, they, they, they kept stood.
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:18.000]   You know, so, I don't, I don't honestly know
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.800]   if you can get the Lindsey plaid at Duluth Trading Company,
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:24.320]   but that's my choice for flannel.
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:26.700]   - I'm a big Duluth Trading Company guy.
[01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:27.780]   I get all my underwear.
[01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:30.260]   I love Duluth Trading Company.
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:34.460]   And I also use, there's some microfiber ones
[01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:37.540]   that are made by Eddie Bauer that I, that I wear,
[01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:39.700]   because they're kind of thick and they never, ever wrinkle.
[01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:40.800]   It seems to be impossible to wrinkle.
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:43.160]   So when I travel on planes, they turn out to be great
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:45.140]   because they're thick and they're, they're kind of,
[01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:47.620]   they're, you know, they're synthetic so that they,
[01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:49.860]   they wash easily and they don't, they don't smell a lot.
[01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:52.060]   And you can wear them, especially when you're traveling
[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:53.260]   20 or 30 hours.
[01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:55.580]   So that's the other one that I, that I use anyway.
[01:45:55.580 --> 01:45:58.560]   - That's my recommendation for flannel battles.
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:00.600]   - I don't remember when I talked about flannel before.
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:01.600]   - I don't either.
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:02.800]   Maybe he's hallucinating.
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:04.200]   I don't know.
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:05.200]   - I do admit I wear them a lot.
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:07.440]   I mean, I don't know where I, I wear.
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:10.600]   - Justin crash, did you, I mean, when you were watching
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:12.560]   the show earlier, did it look like I had lights on
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:14.040]   or anything like that?
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:16.080]   (laughing)
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:16.920]   - There you go.
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:18.280]   - You know, I, I think that we're so close
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:20.280]   to turning Twit into a lifestyle brand.
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:21.880]   - It's really, it is.
[01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:25.660]   - It is, we got mattresses, we got routers,
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:28.060]   we got password managers.
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:29.420]   Get some flannels.
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:31.900]   Let's take a look at the 2019 Alex collection.
[01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:34.500]   - Oh, love that idea.
[01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:36.420]   Love, what is your pick of the week?
[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:38.100]   So by the way, I want to thank you,
[01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:40.260]   'cause I don't know if you saw my gift guide earlier
[01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:44.500]   in iOS today, but I did throw in that sound devices USB
[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:47.140]   mixed pre three, love that thing that is awesome.
[01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:48.140]   - It's getting 50, isn't it?
[01:46:48.140 --> 01:46:50.240]   - Love it, $650.
[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:53.720]   It's almost, it's a, just a little tiny bit short
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:56.060]   of a full Alex, but it's awesome.
[01:46:56.060 --> 01:46:57.980]   - But it is amazing, it's an amazing little box.
[01:46:57.980 --> 01:46:59.320]   - I love it.
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:01.580]   - My recommendation is actually not nearly as expensive.
[01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:03.860]   It's an app called Tin Type.
[01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:06.060]   I don't know where I saw it, but I down wanted it.
[01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:07.060]   I just have so much fun with it.
[01:47:07.060 --> 01:47:08.660]   - Oh, it's so good, I love it, yeah.
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:12.140]   - It's so great, it's a dollar, and I think I have,
[01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:14.460]   I think I posted a picture on Instagram
[01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:16.860]   right before the show of--
[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:18.540]   - Oh, look, oh look.
[01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:20.600]   - There, yeah, right before the show.
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:24.040]   - Right, during the Civil War, Alex Lindsey was famous--
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:24.880]   - Exactly.
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:26.040]   - For podcasting.
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:27.740]   - Doesn't it look like that?
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:31.720]   - So it's a really fun app as far as the,
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:33.320]   the filters work out really well.
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:35.660]   So if you really need that, if you want to spend a dollar
[01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:38.520]   so you can have that one in poster look,
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:40.080]   this has been the easiest way to create
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:42.860]   the one in poster look, and I've found that
[01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:44.860]   it's provided a lot of entertainment for--
[01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:47.260]   - Show that one again.
[01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:49.200]   - Show that one again, Karsten.
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:53.140]   The battle has been raging all day in the distance.
[01:47:53.140 --> 01:47:56.840]   I am unable to ascertain when anything has been gained
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:00.780]   or not, oh, how long for this war to end.
[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:05.920]   We need a little Civil War music going on,
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:08.480]   a little fiddle in the background.
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:12.700]   How I will hail the day when I return to the bosom of life.
[01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:15.660]   There, we got the pan and scan, that's good.
[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:17.220]   It's going the wrong direction, but okay.
[01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:18.060]   - That's okay.
[01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:20.360]   (laughing)
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:21.200]   - There we go.
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:26.160]   - Our bandwidth is down to 2G, edge speed.
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:29.440]   - But yeah, it is, it is utilized either of my message
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:32.900]   gets to you, margaram, I do not dare know.
[01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:34.600]   (laughing)
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:36.880]   Know that the last message, text message,
[01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:41.880]   I sent to you was art emoji, art emoji, crying face.
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:44.140]   (laughing)
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:47.560]   - What was it?
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:48.380]   Oh yeah, Tim type.
[01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:50.120]   That's the ifstimatic folks.
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:51.420]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:53.020]   It's a fun app for a bucket.
[01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:54.300]   It's a lot of enjoyment.
[01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:58.460]   Andy and I co-pick of the week.
[01:48:58.460 --> 01:49:02.180]   - Closure on my three week adventure of having the SSD
[01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:05.220]   and my 2015 MacBook Pro die on me.
[01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:08.980]   I did finally replace it and I didn't wanna talk about it
[01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:11.140]   until I knew that it actually worked.
[01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:16.140]   Apple used a standard, but not really standard SSD module
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:19.860]   for storage in the 2013 to 2015 MacBooks.
[01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:22.660]   So it was technically not some,
[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:25.740]   it was standard enough that they could buy the connectors
[01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:28.380]   in bulk, not so standard that it is possible
[01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:30.980]   to simply go out and buy a replacement module
[01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:32.440]   and stick it in.
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:37.440]   So the standard right now are M.2 SSD modules.
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:45.460]   And so I bought a Samsung 970 EVO 512 gigabyte
[01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:48.580]   basically a direct replacement for the size
[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:49.900]   that I had in there before.
[01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:52.360]   This was a module that was released in 2018.
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:54.140]   So the controller is brand new.
[01:49:54.140 --> 01:49:56.160]   This memory style is brand new.
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:57.140]   It's super, super fast.
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:57.960]   It's wonderful.
[01:49:57.960 --> 01:50:00.860]   And to get it to work inside your MacBook,
[01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:05.380]   all you need is this dubiously, really sketchy looking,
[01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:09.400]   but it's just as simple as that $10 little adapter
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:14.400]   that you snap onto the end of this M2 module.
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:17.600]   That will just basically switch out the pins
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:20.360]   and give you the correct sort of connector.
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:25.200]   And the 970 EVO is shorter than the original module.
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:27.200]   So it's not as though you're gonna have
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:28.960]   to sort of squeeze this thing in.
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:31.160]   I just literally snapped this thing onto the end
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:33.100]   of the new Samsung module,
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:36.600]   stuck it into the connector inside my MacBook.
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:40.000]   The tie down screw that keeps it from shifting out,
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.300]   lined up perfectly, absolutely no problem,
[01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:44.720]   Bob's your uncle and the adapter is like 10 bucks.
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:46.520]   You can get it pretty much anywhere.
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:48.420]   I got both my stuff on Amazon.
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:50.120]   The module was 120.
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:53.720]   I think the adapter was like 10 or 12 bucks.
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:58.100]   So easily under $140 and imagine how much it would cost
[01:50:58.100 --> 01:51:01.560]   to actually take this in to Apple and get it repaired.
[01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:04.320]   And that shows you how much I'm going,
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:07.220]   how interested I am in taking really good care
[01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:10.840]   of this 2015 MacBook Pro because it is repairable
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:12.400]   and it's still good.
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:13.320]   - Oh, it's good, yeah.
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:14.480]   - Totally.
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:15.320]   - Oh, you need to take,
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:18.360]   and also just take a stop down to, I fix it.
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:21.920]   It'll give you the teardown guy, which is easiest pie.
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:25.200]   And also, they'll sell you the P5 Pentaloab screwdriver
[01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:26.760]   you need to get out the,
[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:28.520]   before you can put in the,
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:32.120]   replace the proprietary SSD you need to get out
[01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:35.360]   the proprietary screws holding the case together.
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:38.360]   - I got the, from other world computing their kit,
[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:41.320]   which includes the screwdriver and it's a mercury.
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:42.760]   Although some people said the mercury's
[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:44.160]   are not that good as SSDs,
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:46.840]   but that's my upgrade for the 2015.
[01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:48.200]   And I was very happy with that.
[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:49.040]   It really did.
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:51.600]   - Yeah, I'm just glad that I decided not to upgrade it
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:53.840]   to a terabyte because I think I would just get myself
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:54.680]   in trouble.
[01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:55.520]   - Yeah.
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:56.880]   - Also, you put a terabyte in the thing,
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:58.840]   then now you've got a terabyte you need to back up.
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:01.560]   And also, I would just run out of space
[01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:05.120]   by not backing things up and not taking things off
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:05.960]   when I don't need it.
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:08.120]   - Oh, last, these are the last few that you can do that to.
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:10.440]   I don't think you can do it to the new ones.
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:12.440]   - Exactly, everything else is soldered directly
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:14.080]   onto the motherboard.
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:16.560]   So, and remember that it wasn't just,
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:18.360]   hey, wow, I've run out of space.
[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:20.760]   I think I want to, I want to electively swap in
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:22.120]   a higher capacity SSD.
[01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:24.880]   It's no, my MacBook was dead.
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:28.080]   It was, you cannot boot it because the,
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:30.880]   whatever section of the SSD was had the mounting
[01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:33.280]   and boot code had died and perished.
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:35.160]   And so it was just, and not only that,
[01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:37.960]   but even booting it off of an external SSD,
[01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:39.960]   which is what I'd been doing for the past couple of weeks,
[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:41.960]   was not working out because, as we saw
[01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:43.200]   during the middle of last week's show,
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:48.160]   I had the most malicious, horrible Godzilla style crash
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:49.600]   in right in the middle.
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:52.920]   And so, but again, I have this going for the past four
[01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:53.880]   or five days.
[01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:55.200]   It's working perfectly fine.
[01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:56.160]   Sleep works fine.
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:57.280]   Deep sleep works fine.
[01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:01.280]   That was sometimes an issue with other volumes before this,
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:04.920]   before Apple, I think it was before 10.1 free or something.
[01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:09.920]   Before Apple basically made the operating system support
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:14.120]   all these modes on different kinds of internal drives.
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:17.520]   So it'll work out great and it'll keep your thing,
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:19.640]   it'll keep your MacBook live for another couple of years
[01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:22.160]   and 130 bucks, easy, easy.
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:27.800]   - Eddie, I was following your updates on Twitter live
[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:30.760]   as you were posting them about this replacement.
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:33.560]   I was watching the Game Awards and would pop back
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:35.680]   into Twitter and I'd see something that you pop up
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:37.160]   and I'd go back and watch the awards
[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:38.960]   and I'd pop back into Twitter and see another thing
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:39.800]   that you posted.
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:42.280]   Like I was watching you actually, like,
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:43.440]   is it gonna work?
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:44.280]   Is it gonna work?
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:46.920]   And then the screen where you show, it did it, it worked.
[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:49.320]   It was like, yay, I was so happy for you.
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:50.480]   It was great.
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:52.080]   - I will, I have to admit,
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:53.840]   as I admitted later on in the Twitter feed,
[01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:55.160]   I did weasel out.
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:57.040]   I only started posting those pictures
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:00.320]   after I rebooted it and made sure everything worked fine
[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:03.480]   because you do the research.
[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:05.000]   - But for me, it felt new.
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:08.480]   - It was, I'm glad I had you all,
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:10.680]   along with me on the journey.
[01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:12.880]   I wanted to make sure people knew
[01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:14.240]   that it really is that simple.
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:16.840]   It's not the horror show of a modern MacBook
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:19.720]   where you have to attack something with a heat gun
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:22.200]   to separate the glue that's holding everything together
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:24.680]   and you will definitely destroy something
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:27.320]   and you'll have to replace it just to get them motherboard.
[01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:28.920]   It's easy peasy.
[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:32.320]   You take off screws in the back, you remove the back,
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:34.480]   you unplug the battery just for safety
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:36.640]   and then you just unplug one module,
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:37.720]   plug in a new one.
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:39.160]   You're good, I'll just run hold.
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:42.040]   - I am not, I, as you know,
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:44.480]   I had a bad Kickstarter habit for a long time.
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:46.560]   - I think we all have.
[01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:50.040]   - I've kicked it, except that now I'm back for one thing
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:51.680]   and it's only because I've bought things
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:53.920]   from these company before Sanho.
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:57.360]   I bought way back when when the MacBook came out,
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:00.640]   they made a very nice dock for the MacBook
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:02.640]   that just plugged into the Type-C port
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:04.920]   and added a bunch of nice functional ports.
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:06.760]   When I got the new MacBook Pro
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:09.840]   with the dual Type-C, I got their special dual-site.
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:12.840]   They call, the brand of these is Hyperdrive
[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:15.920]   and they are back on Kickstarter with a new one
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:17.040]   that just went up yesterday.
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:20.880]   It's already raised 304,000 with a month to go.
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:25.040]   The first USB-C hub for the iPad Pro
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:26.360]   and as you can kind of see,
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:28.400]   it is designed a little differently than,
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:32.160]   I can use these, this is the one I got for the MacBook
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:33.240]   but this one's a little different
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:35.880]   because first of all, it's centered as it should be
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:37.400]   and it matches the color.
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:40.600]   That's really ugly for me to use a gold hub
[01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:44.960]   on a Slate MacBook Pro but what's nice is this,
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:47.560]   it adds HDMI USB-C for power
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:50.200]   and if you want micro SD and SD card reader,
[01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:54.760]   Type-A USB and, yes, there's an audio jack.
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:58.000]   Oh my God and if you hurry
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.360]   and I think this is really only gonna be
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:01.880]   for people watching live, you can get it
[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:03.640]   for half off what they will sell it for
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:05.840]   which is $100, $49
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:08.040]   but there's 102 left of those so,
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:11.040]   now the good news is I think there's more
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:14.360]   of the more expensive $69.
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:16.680]   Eventually they plan to charge a hundred bucks for it.
[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:18.600]   I got two, one for me and one for Lisa.
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:20.800]   I am a big fan of the iPad Pro
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:23.760]   and I've used HyperDrive dongles as you can see
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:25.240]   from my MacBook and my MacBook Pro
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:27.400]   and I really think that this is a company
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:28.720]   that knows what they're doing
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:30.480]   and this will be a nice addition
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:33.480]   instead of carrying a bunch of Apple provided dongles
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:36.240]   and so forth by using this HyperDrive
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:40.840]   you'll be able to add to the capability of your iPad.
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:44.880]   It works with the case on, has a little bracket to steady it
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:48.280]   and boy that's a lot of additional functionality
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:51.000]   with one little doohickey and at 49 bucks
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.480]   that's really a good price.
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:56.600]   So hurry as you listen to this, go to Kickstarter,
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:57:00.960]   search for I think the search term would be HyperDrive
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:03.000]   for iPad Pro 2018.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.120]   This would be a good thing to pick up.
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:08.280]   The first HyperDrive, this is my third,
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:09.640]   this will be my fourth.
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:12.720]   The first one I got the USB-C connector did get loose
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:14.520]   and wobbled and eventually they stopped working.
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:16.240]   That was one for our MacBook
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:18.200]   but I think they've gotten better.
[01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:20.640]   They've, you know, this is, I don't know
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:22.440]   how many products they've offered now.
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:24.560]   Quite a few, eight different products.
[01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:27.000]   This is their eighth product on Kickstarter
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.840]   so I think they're pretty reliable company.
[01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:33.840]   HyperDrive for the iPad Pro, that's my pick
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:37.400]   and they've already, they got funded within a day.
[01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:41.640]   So I think they'll be making it.
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:43.520]   I like the idea a lot.
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:46.960]   It's as if people want to have ports and functionality
[01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:47.960]   and a thousand dollars.
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:50.840]   I thought this will not all of a sudden make it possible
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:54.800]   for you to access external storage or anything like that
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:57.040]   till Apple adds a driver but it'll let you read cards
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:57:57.880]   into all that stuff.
[01:57:57.880 --> 01:57:59.960]   That looks amazing.
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:03.800]   Just the knowledge that if I take this one thing with me,
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:06.840]   the number of times where I've had to head out
[01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:10.240]   to an Apple store because I took almost enough dongles
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:12.160]   with me for everything I needed to do but I did,
[01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:14.880]   oh, it turns out I do need HDMI.
[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:15.960]   Oh darn it.
[01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:18.360]   - Yep, this is very handy.
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:21.240]   And I love it that they put a headphone jack on it.
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:22.320]   - Yeah.
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:24.480]   That's really a reason to get it.
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:26.600]   There's your headphone jack right there.
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:28.680]   - I wish that the only thing that makes it better
[01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:33.640]   is if they designed it to look like a frog design component
[01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:37.000]   just to put that thumb in the eye of Apple designers.
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:41.480]   I said, this is the old Apple when we didn't design things
[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:42.600]   to be functional.
[01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:46.280]   - Sorry.
[01:58:46.280 --> 01:58:47.120]   Sorry.
[01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:48.960]   - Sorry.
[01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:50.480]   - Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to the end
[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:53.560]   of this fabulous radio program,
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:56.080]   Lori Gill, rock and roll star.
[01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:59.160]   And it's just completely incidentally managing editor
[01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:02.000]   at imore.com at @polic on the Twitter.
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:02.840]   Great to have you.
[01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:03.680]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:04.520]   - Thank you.
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:05.360]   Thanks for having me.
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:06.200]   - Happy holidays.
[01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:07.040]   - You too.
[01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:08.400]   - Are you going anywhere for the holidays?
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:09.680]   Do anything fun?
[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:12.160]   - Family is in town so it's just gonna be,
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:13.560]   just a quick drive.
[01:59:13.560 --> 01:59:15.320]   - And I told Carson get you on more
[01:59:15.320 --> 01:59:17.800]   and if you ever come to the Bay Area,
[01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:19.760]   let us know so we can have you in studio.
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:20.600]   'Cause I'd like to be here.
[01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:22.240]   - Yeah, I need to make that happen for sure.
[01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:23.080]   - Someday.
[01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:23.920]   - Yeah.
[01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:26.480]   - Maybe we could set up some lights,
[01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:28.880]   get some amps, have a show.
[01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:29.960]   (Lori laughs)
[01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:31.000]   - I can rock out for you.
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:32.520]   - I would love to see you sing.
[01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:34.600]   Are you playing anywhere soon?
[01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:37.720]   - Yeah, I'm playing on the 22nd locally.
[01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:38.560]   - Sacramento.
[01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:41.480]   - It's so small that it's just a house show,
[01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:43.560]   which is typical for punk rockers.
[01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:45.640]   - I think house shows are the best kind.
[01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:46.840]   - I completely agree.
[01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:48.000]   - Yeah.
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000]   All right, well, I guess people could go to your website
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:51.400]   or something and figure that out.
[01:59:51.400 --> 01:59:52.240]   - Yeah.
[01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:55.760]   - And I think to them is an exercise for the reader.
[01:59:55.760 --> 01:59:57.760]   - Ask a punk, I think is what the address is.
[01:59:57.760 --> 01:59:59.320]   (Lori laughs)
[01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:00.440]   - They'll know, man.
[02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:04.560]   - Mr. Andy Naco, you see him or hear him regularly
[02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:07.160]   on Boston Public Radio, WGBH.
[02:00:07.160 --> 02:00:08.680]   - And of course, every week on this show
[02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:11.040]   and you could read his stuff on his website,
[02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:14.360]   new and improved IHNATKO.com.
[02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:15.920]   - I finally fixed my database problem
[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:17.560]   so I can actually start posting to it again.
[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:19.160]   - Woo hoo!
[02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:20.960]   - Can I just say get WordPress.com,
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:23.040]   do you want to have to worry about it?
[02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:25.960]   - I have WordPress.com for a site project.
[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:27.320]   - It's tempting isn't it?
[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:28.560]   - Hopefully I can show off.
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:32.840]   It's, you know, you pay somebody to take responsibilities
[02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:36.480]   off your hands and they know better than you.
[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:37.560]   - No more database problems. - Spend more time
[02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:38.960]   on it than you are. - I wanted to thank you arms.
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:40.960]   - And yeah, and you don't end up having your blog down
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:42.720]   for about a couple of months because.
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:43.800]   (Lori laughs)
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:45.640]   Because every time you tried to fix it,
[02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:47.000]   you ran it to some sort of wall
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.120]   that you just didn't have the coverage or the time
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:50.800]   or the patience to get across.
[02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:52.400]   - No, I've been there a million times.
[02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:54.080]   I used to do self-hosted WordPress.
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:55.720]   I completely know.
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:57.600]   I know what it's all about, baby.
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:02.440]   - Mr. Alex Lindsey, rock on,
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:06.760]   pixacore.com @alexly on the Twitter.
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:10.320]   And I want to talk to you later in the day.
[02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:13.120]   We have much to discuss.
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:13.960]   - Sounds good.
[02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:17.360]   - Mr. Young, Mr. Lindsey, just a personal message.
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:21.520]   But one of them involves December 23rd
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:27.800]   and a bottle of Louis XIII cognac.
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:28.760]   - Did you find it? - I did find it.
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:29.760]   I did find it.
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:35.480]   We do have it and we will have lead glass,
[02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:39.440]   specially designed, very expensive glasses,
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:41.920]   cognac glasses to drink it out of.
[02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:43.640]   So that was his incentive.
[02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:45.120]   - I think you really gonna do it.
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:47.080]   - Of course I was gonna come the matter what.
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:49.640]   I told you, if you do the show with me,
[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:51.760]   we will have Louis XIII.
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:53.640]   - Can I go to the next show too?
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:56.440]   - Lori, do you like cognac?
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:58.360]   - Oh, it looks so delicious.
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:00.920]   And specially designed lead glasses.
[02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:01.760]   That's a win.
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:04.840]   - Lori, this is a $3,000 bottle of cognac.
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:05.840]   - Oh my gosh.
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:07.200]   - This is not, this cognac.
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:08.440]   - So I no longer boogie.
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:09.880]   It's you guys that are going to do it.
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:13.120]   - Oh, we're, hey, I'm unapologetically boogie.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:16.280]   This is made, this is a hundred years.
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:18.720]   - No, the people who make this cognac
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:20.720]   never get to taste the final product.
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:24.920]   They take some a hundred years to make.
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:25.840]   - That's insane.
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:26.680]   - Yes.
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:28.520]   Yes.
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:30.360]   - Can I send you like a Tupperware shot glass?
[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:31.200]   - No.
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:32.040]   - No.
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:32.880]   - Okay.
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:33.720]   - No.
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:35.360]   You have to come out Andy, you have to come out.
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:37.800]   - But Lori, seriously, Carson will call you.
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:39.640]   If you wanna come down for, it's our,
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:42.680]   see I had to incent people 'cause it's our holiday twit.
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:45.240]   On a Sunday, it's the Christmas, the eve of Christmas Eve.
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:46.680]   - Right before Christmas Eve, yeah.
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:48.280]   - September 23rd.
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:50.280]   - I mean, I know.
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:51.920]   It sounds really awesome.
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:54.040]   - Got these glasses that are specially designed
[02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:56.080]   so you can warm the cognac in your hand
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:02:58.320]   and as you swirl it around.
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:00.160]   - So excuse not to be with the family.
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:01.680]   - You don't need to be with the family.
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:04.520]   Just us, your family or family on the air.
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:07.520]   And while John Slanina will not let us do cigars
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:10.440]   in the studio, we can, I know maybe we have.
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:12.200]   - That was, I mean, you gotta do this.
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:13.040]   - That's the point.
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:14.040]   - How are you gonna dip the cigar?
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:16.240]   - See? - Oh, no, we'll be sending them out.
[02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:21.280]   - I'm telling you, I'm willing to do the cigars too.
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:22.920]   What's your favorite cigar, Alex?
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:28.280]   - There is a, well, I have some,
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:30.400]   I actually have some Cuban ones at the house.
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:32.960]   - Okay, well, you bring me a couple of Cubans?
[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:34.520]   We can, let me see if I can find them.
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:36.000]   They're little ones, they're like cigar.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.120]   - That's perfect, so you're a cigar.
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:42.960]   - I like a Maduro, but we will get cigars
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:44.880]   if cigars are desired.
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:48.120]   And just to see Lori with a cognac
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:49.640]   in her one hand and a cigar in the other
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:51.240]   would be worth the price of admission.
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:53.920]   I'm telling you. - I think that might be fun.
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:55.960]   - Okay, folks, if you're gonna have
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:03:59.000]   the really expensive cognac and the Cuban cigar
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:02.800]   and the glass, and the crystal snifter,
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:05.080]   you're gonna have to get like the smoking jacket
[02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:07.320]   and the ascot. - Oh, I have the smoking jacket.
[02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:11.000]   - I'm asking, I am absolutely wearing my smoking jacket
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.040]   and ascot.
[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:14.080]   - All right, all right, I gotta, I don't have,
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:16.640]   I have, I can provide you with a smoking jacket.
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:17.720]   I have a smoking jacket here.
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:20.000]   - Okay, okay, I have two. - I have two to get an ascot.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.480]   - The ascot can be any scars. - I think you like,
[02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:24.680]   you keep a spare, I like that you keep a spare smoking jacket.
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:26.240]   That's nice. - Of course.
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:27.080]   (laughs)
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:29.000]   - All right, Leo, you bring the smoking jacket.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:30.400]   I'll be ready for it.
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:33.280]   - And ask, any silk scarful do is an ascot.
[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:34.880]   I mean, if you wanna do a regular Hermes,
[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:37.160]   but any silk scarful do.
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:38.880]   - I'll see if I can find my Cubans cigars.
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:40.640]   They're packed away somewhere, so I'm gonna--
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:42.520]   - Oh, I don't want stale Cubans cigars.
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:43.640]   Come on, they could be stale.
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:45.600]   They've been around, so, so they, you know,
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:47.200]   so they were given to me and then I, of course,
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:48.560]   set them down and I was like, oh no.
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:49.720]   - I know, I haven't spoke to cigars.
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:51.720]   - Here's the problem is, you get cigars
[02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:53.720]   and then you wanna say, if they're good cigars,
[02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:55.040]   you wanna save them for the right time
[02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:56.960]   and then you save them for the right time.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:57.800]   - That's right.
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:04:59.560]   - The right time is never comes.
[02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:00.720]   - Never comes. - Exactly.
[02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:02.280]   - And then they're not smokeable.
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:03.120]   - Then I go.
[02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:05.480]   - I'm just thinking,
[02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:11.360]   I don't know where to go with this,
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:15.280]   but I'm thinking maybe a Davidoff, short perfecto,
[02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:16.560]   something like that.
[02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:17.400]   - Oh yeah.
[02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:20.640]   - I'm just thinking, we don't wanna big,
[02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:22.280]   John's going crazy, by the way.
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:24.280]   - It was just, it was just dying.
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:25.680]   - It's just getting filtered.
[02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:27.560]   - You gotta filter in there, don't you?
[02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:28.720]   Just filter in.
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:30.240]   - How about this?
[02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:34.280]   From Nicaragua, the illusion, the ebelene.
[02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:37.560]   It's from the Champagne region,
[02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:40.280]   so it's perfect to go with the Champagne-based cognac.
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:45.360]   Anyway, this is completely off topic.
[02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:49.240]   - This is really a kind lifestyle brand here.
[02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:51.200]   - Why do we not have our own lifestyle brand?
[02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:52.360]   Why? - I know.
[02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:57.200]   - Thank you so much, Laurie Gill, Alex Lindsay,
[02:05:57.200 --> 02:05:59.360]   Andy and I, thank you all for being here.

[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:37.240]   I can't promise you all a sniffer of brandy,
[02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:38.280]   but you can have a sip.
[02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:39.120]   You have a sip on that.
[02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:39.960]   You have a deal, Mike,
[02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:41.880]   to allow you to touch the hem of his robe.
[02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:43.360]   (laughing)
[02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:44.920]   We'd love to have a big studio audience

[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:34.920]   because break time is over.
[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:35.760]   Bye-bye.
[02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:45.760]   (upbeat music)
