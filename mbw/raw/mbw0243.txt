[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.760]   in studio with us today from the Pixelcore.com,
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.880]   Pixelcore.tv2 for that guild of multimedia artists living
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.920]   and working together in the podcast or TV.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.080]   Have you recovered?
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.520]   From Namahoon.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.360]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.720]   From the NAB show, yeah.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.280]   Oh boy.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.780]   Yeah.
[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.480]   I got back on Friday.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.080]   I couldn't think anymore.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.560]   Yeah.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.720]   It was fun, though.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.500]   And what was mind-boggling about it was-- well, first of all,
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.180]   there's that whole final cut thing we'll
[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.540]   shall talk about in a second.
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.640]   But I think it's so cool.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.060]   And this is kind of part of the story.
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.600]   The cost of doing television production is plummeting.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.380]   And the fact that Final Cut itself is $2.99
[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.060]   is part of the story.
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.120]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.140]   But let me introduce the rest of the panel.
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.900]   Neil I Patel is here just for the early part of the show.
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.180]   Neil I, of course, formally at Engadget.
[00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.700]   He is now at something brand new, which we'll ask him about.
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.900]   And you could find him and his cohorts,
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.180]   including Joshua Topolceget.
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.500]   This is mynext.com.
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.980]   And--
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.540]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.460]   Good to have you back, Neil.
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.420]   We're going to talk about your article today
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.540]   on the Samsung Apple patent diff boot.
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.980]   It's something.
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.060]   I want to find out all about it.
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.780]   But also here with us today, the lovely,
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.340]   and talented Wonder the Spot Dog or whatever.
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.180]   Andy Inako.
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.020]   And he actually has a picture of a puppy.
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.380]   Is that your new dog?
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.020]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.260]   But my business has been expanding.
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.220]   So I was able to hire a personal system to--
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.860]   That's his headshot.
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.620]   He's just doing it in exchange for publicity.
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.940]   Good, right.
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.940]   He's trying to get an acting career going.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.340]   Good, look and fella.
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.340]   Great.
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.060]   Well, he's not bad.
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.620]   Not very good for the FedEx delivery.
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.180]   He tends to chase the guy off the porch.
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.940]   But--
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.340]   Other than that, that was good for a FedEx delivery.
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.340]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.100]   Well, except for the slobber on the playbook.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.780]   But other than that, Andy is at the Chicago Sun Times,
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.180]   his website, cwob.com.
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.820]   And actually, Andy has a playbook.
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.060]   And we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.180]   Mine's supposed to come today.
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.060]   The new Blackberry.
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.180]   Mine's supposed to come--
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.380]   Oh, wait, no, mine's not coming today.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.540]   Well, as it turns out, you probably
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.540]   were right not to get one.
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.540]   And also, what is that?
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.180]   That's the new T-Mobile device?
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.300]   Yeah, that's the T--
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.980]   Yeah, the new T-Mobile with the extra special 3D camera
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.500]   feature.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.340]   So that's how they're going to fight the iPad
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.260]   with the stereoscopic 3D.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.180]   I want one.
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.700]   I will say it's really cool to unbox something.
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.860]   And you get another thing.
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.900]   You run boxing, OK.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.500]   OK, device, OK, power, little manual, OK, USB connector.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.740]   Oh, red, green glasses.
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.260]   This is awesome.
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.780]   No.
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.780]   No.
[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.780]   Really?
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.300]   Yeah.
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.740]   Yeah, but this play is hilarious.
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.740]   It's anacolist.
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.740]   That's how they're doing it.
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.260]   Oh.
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.380]   It has multiple 3D modes, one of which is red, green, and aglips.
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.140]   Those are the anagliff glasses that come with it.
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.140]   Those are actually--
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.140]   At least they're not cardboard.
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.300]   They're fashionable.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.740]   Oh, no, they're actually good.
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.180]   Like, high quality, you could actually pay upwards of $3
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.500]   for eye wear of this caliber.
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.820]   You know, I have a lot of those red and blue glasses.
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.260]   And those are some of the nicest ones.
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.260]   Those are really pretty.
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.060]   And by the way, now you have two different eye
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.780]   colors like your dog.
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.580]   Exactly.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.020]   One red, one blue.
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.100]   All right, let's talk a little bit as long as we've
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.740]   got Nila here.
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.460]   And Nila does have to take off quickly.
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.860]   So I would like very much to get him on.
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.580]   You just wrote a very good article about--
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.740]   It was on thisismynex.com, your new website,
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.540]   about the Samsung Apple lawsuit.
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.580]   So Apple is suing Samsung.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.900]   In fact, Apple was pretty outspoken.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.380]   They say, they're copying our stuff.
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.900]   Slavishly copying.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.500]   That's what they say.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.420]   Slavishly copying and pervasively copying.
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.980]   At one point, they say the Samsung Galaxy S line
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.620]   might as well be an iPhone.
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.620]   What?
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.260]   They're not holding back with the Gorseman from Apple.
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.660]   Good point.
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.500]   So first up, we should say you're standing on this is you are
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.380]   an attorney.
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.780]   Are you practicing now?
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.900]   No, I've practiced for a long time.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.100]   But I was a copy of attorney.
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.300]   This is your field.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.620]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.900]   Well, I'm not a patent attorney.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.700]   I was a copy of attorney.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.420]   But I have a lot of patent attorney friends.
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.540]   I've been doing these breakdowns for a while.
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.460]   I feel like I know what I'm doing.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.900]   And this isn't just a patent lawsuit.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.660]   There's trademark in it too.
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.260]   Right.
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.820]   It's actually really, really heavy weight.
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.020]   So if you look at how Apple sued HTC or how they sued Motorola
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.580]   or Nokia, it's a bunch of patents.
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.260]   And they're very fundamental system level patents.
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.740]   This is how the touchscreen works.
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.100]   This is how multi-touch works.
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.460]   All this very wonky technical stuff that normal human beings
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.300]   would not be able to figure out at first read.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.940]   The this lawsuit is much more you made your stuff look just
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.900]   like ours, right?
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.740]   And you made it look just like ours.
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.300]   And you did it intentionally so that people would be like,
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.540]   that is just like an Apple product.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.620]   I'll just buy that instead.
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.180]   This is--
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.700]   Listen to this.
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.100]   That's a lot of the lawsuit.
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.740]   Jury trial demand, complaint for patent infringement,
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.020]   federal false designation of origin, unfair competition,
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.380]   federal trademark infringement, state unfair competition,
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.260]   common law trademark infringement,
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.460]   and an unjust enrichment.
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.860]   Yeah.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.340]   What's unjust enrichment?
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.860]   Unjust-- it's actually a catch all at the very end.
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.100]   So if everything else fails--
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.220]   So you got rich.
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.340]   If everything else fails, Apple can say, well,
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.500]   they took our stuff and made money on it in a way they shouldn't
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.660]   have.
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.140]   Huminy.
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.660]   So--
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.980]   So if that'll get wrapped up in a trademark infringement
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:31.500]   patent infringement--
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.500]   Are they--
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.980]   That's like the last quiver or dying breath of the lawsuit.
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.460]   Justin--
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.580]   Are they asking for an injunction?
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.260]   Do they want to stop halt sales?
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.020]   I mean, they're asking for the whole kit in kaboodle.
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.300]   They want them to stop sales.
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.460]   They want to be prevented from ever violating their patents
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.960]   again.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.860]   And that's up and down Samsung supply chain and divisions.
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.060]   They want trouble damages for patent infringement.
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.220]   They want-- they want an accounting of Samsung's profits
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.780]   so they can figure out which were improper profits.
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.340]   They want money for corrective advertising.
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.420]   So the claim is that because they violated the trademarks
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.620]   and the trade dress of the products,
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.780]   that Apple has to do some additional advertising
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.500]   to restore their brand, essentially.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.700]   And so they want money to restore their brand in that way.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.020]   I mean, it's a long list of damages.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.340]   But the damages at this point, if I was Apple's lawyer,
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.740]   I would list everything I could think of.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.260]   I want everything I can think of because some of it
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.700]   will get wheeled away by the court, some of it
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.380]   will go whittle--
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.500]   if this ever gets to a jury, which would be years and years
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.940]   from now, some of it will get whittled away there.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.140]   So the list of damages looks enormous and ridiculous now.
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.500]   But that's really the-- we're going
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.060]   to put everything in the kitchen sink in in hopes
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.660]   that we get 50% of it or--
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.820]   So this is just typical.
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.100]   But here's something that's not typical.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.060]   Apple is a big Samsung customer, more than $5 billion
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.100]   worth of Samsung components in 2010.
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.500]   At $5.7 billion, actually.
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.500]   It's really, really enormous number.
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.900]   But the thing about that is Samsung,
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.900]   we think about companies and sort of the American corporate
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:00.460]   sense, right?
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.860]   So Apple is incorporated in California
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.780]   and it has Steve Jobs as a CEO and a board of directors
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.380]   and everything flows down from them.
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.540]   Samsung is this Korean cable arrangement, which
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.060]   has relatively formed us.
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.740]   It's this enormous company that has multiple divisions
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.140]   with multiple division heads who want--
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.420]   They make bulldozers.
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.580]   They make bulldozers and sinks.
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.140]   Samsung Electronics, they have the consumer business
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.140]   and the manufacturing business.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.020]   There's got to be some relationship between two.
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.260]   I wanted to touch on this, but quite frankly,
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.180]   I'm not an expert in Korean business structure.
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.860]   And I didn't want to speculate too heavily
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.300]   on how this might affect Samsung.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:40.100]   So you're saying the components that Apple buys from Samsung,
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:46.780]   the 4% of their income, it may be a different division.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.580]   So maybe that division will just say, oh, that's fine.
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.180]   Go ahead and sue those sons and customers.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.740]   As far as I know, Samsung and mobile,
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.220]   when they go out to design a phone,
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.980]   they have to bid on processors, like Apple does.
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.700]   And they have to bid on displays and RAM and all that stuff.
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.420]   So you see Samsung phones, the Tegra processors,
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.620]   the Qualcomm processors in them,
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:09.140]   the Samsung's Windows Phone Products, Microsoft said,
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.700]   you have to use Qualcomm processors,
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.140]   and they went out and did it.
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.700]   So there's a bit of a division just because of the structure.
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.900]   And like I'm saying, I didn't want
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.940]   to get too far down this road because I'm not
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.620]   an expert on Korean business organization.
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.820]   But there is a distinct division
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.260]   between the elements of Samsung's business.
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.540]   And I don't think Apple is worried
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.660]   about disturbing the relationship with Samsung
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.660]   with the semiconductor because they're in a fight with Samsung.
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.340]   And you have to think that they've factored into it.
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.500]   But there is also that element of, well, they just
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.100]   do Samsung and I bet these guys have lunch together
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.420]   and they're not happy about it as it comes.
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.540]   Well, look at the, this is part of the complaint.
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:52.540]   Apple's filing, comparing iPhone to the Galaxy S,
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.500]   there's some merit in this.
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.900]   I mean, if you look at them side by side,
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.500]   but all smartphones look like iPhone.
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.860]   What we can think about this is like a Gucci bag.
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.340]   I mean, Gucci goes after people who basically
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.020]   make bags that look exactly like Gucci.
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:04.860]   You know, it's the same.
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.660]   The idea is that we've created a certain look.
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.020]   We've created a certain experience that,
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.860]   and if you make one that looks exactly the same,
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.060]   that's counterfeiting.
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.860]   You know, that's the argument that--
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.060]   Is this counterfeiting?
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.060]   No, you're not posing as an iPhone.
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.860]   I mean, go ahead and go back to the tablets.
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.380]   I mean, once you've decided that your design
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.340]   can see it is going to be no buttons
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.500]   as little decoration as possible,
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.060]   can you possibly now say that you have a design trademark
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.780]   on the idea of simplicity?
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.860]   I mean, yes, this looks exactly--
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.220]   These look almost exactly like iPads,
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.980]   but can you really say that the fact that it's a black square
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.340]   of glass without any buttons on it,
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.340]   that that's something that happens--
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.340]   But I think the problem--
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.980]   I think that's all they did.
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:43.940]   I don't think that'd be a problem.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.220]   And I'm not the expert on this panel.
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.580]   But I would say that when you start making the interface
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.780]   look identical to the iPad experience as well,
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.980]   that's when things start to get stickier.
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.620]   Right, so I mean, if you look at--
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.420]   You know, there are a million ways to design a fan.
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.060]   I mean, first of all, you can look at the market
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.260]   and you can even look at some of Samsung's products.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.980]   And you can see there are a million ways to design a phone.
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.020]   And if you look at, again, their Apple suits
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.220]   against Motorola, HTC, they didn't do this trade dress stuff.
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.700]   They didn't do this trademark stuff.
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.780]   They focused very deeply on sort of core Android system
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.140]   patents.
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.100]   It's when you--
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.540]   Because if you look at Motorola's blur or HTC Sense,
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.100]   those interfaces are totally different.
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.740]   If you look at the Droid X, it just
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.900]   doesn't look like an iPhone.
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.060]   If you look at an HTC, what's new on the sensation?
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.660]   It just doesn't look like an iPhone.
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.260]   Well, they all have big panels of glass.
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.260]   Well, no, because--
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.420]   They all have home, well, like I said--
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.140]   This is sort of an in total kind of equation, right?
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.980]   It's not, you know, I have panel of glass
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.900]   and you add it up to these icons and it has a--
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.580]   you know, the back is black.
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.620]   That's not how this works.
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.260]   The sort of--
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.860]   So you don't think this challenges Android?
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.260]   It's not-- there's a bit of Android.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.900]   The patent challenges are Android.
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:59.020]   But the trademark stuff, that's all about when a consumer
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:03.180]   walks into a Verizon store and the guy says, you know,
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.820]   we don't have the iPhone yet, but this fascinate from Samsung
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:07.620]   is basically an iPhone.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.340]   It looks just like one.
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.180]   It works just like one by this instead.
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.140]   And the consumer is like, yeah, that looks like an iPhone.
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.540]   They walk at the door.
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.700]   That's the problem, right?
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.140]   And that's what Apple's getting at is you are basically
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.940]   copying our products in order to get people to buy them,
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.460]   because what they really want is an iPhone.
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.020]   What about this image?
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.740]   What about this image that was just sent to us from our chatroom?
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.140]   This is a Samsung F700.
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.700]   I just came everywhere.
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.220]   This came-- I mean, this has been sent to me like 500--
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.940]   OK, so this came out--
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.660]   well, not-- it was released February 2007.
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.020]   The iPhone came out January 2.
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.620]   Clearly, this had a bit of a design before the iPhone came out.
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.460]   This is the kind of thing they show in court, right?
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.460]   No.
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.420]   No.
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.860]   I mean, yeah, I mean, sure.
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.700]   I mean, this image is like doctored, right?
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.220]   I mean, that wasn't Samsung advertising for it.
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.820]   And you know, that hand image--
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.460]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.420]   But the phone's the same?
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.620]   No, but the phone isn't the same.
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.100]   So if you look at the design patents and what they have,
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.460]   the patents say have specific claims.
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.620]   Let me see what you're making.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.620]   OK.
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.620]   OK.
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.140]   So--
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.140]   So this isn't germane, then.
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.660]   It's germane in that, yeah, there
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:12.980]   were other touchscreen phones like this.
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.900]   And Apple's complaint is very histrionic
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.780]   in saying that they completely invented
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.980]   the idea of a phone, right?
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.100]   That's like Apple, you know?
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.900]   If you look at the design patent or the trade dress--
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.100]   let's see, I'm trying to bring this up here.
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.020]   If you look at the specific trade dress elements
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:35.460]   that Apple's claiming, which I am trying to find--
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.260]   so you've got rectangular products
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.340]   you have with four corners that you're
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.380]   formally rounded, substantial blackboarders above and below,
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.700]   which you don't have there.
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.460]   I mean, you have the casing, but they're not part of the glass.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.700]   You have a metallic surround.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.660]   You have a grid of colorful square icons,
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.860]   which you don't have there.
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.180]   Those are not colorful.
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:51.780]   OK.
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.140]   Right.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.220]   I mean, you have four icons in the bottom,
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.700]   the springboard that our application icons that don't
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:56.980]   change.
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.220]   I mean, this is like the technical nitty
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.980]   gritty of what they're after.
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.460]   And I don't think that this is trade dress.
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.940]   So a lot of this hinges on what do consumers perceive
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.580]   when they look at this thing, right?
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:11.740]   Do they think it's an iPhone?
[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.620]   And it doesn't matter if it came before or it came after.
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.220]   So in court, you would hold this thing up.
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.020]   And the ordinary consumer in the market
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.700]   would say, oh, that's an iPhone.
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.580]   Even though it came out, you know, whatever, six months before,
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.980]   the action in the marketplace has been such that consumers now
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.220]   associate that product with the iPhone and with Apple.
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.100]   And that's really the crux of it, right?
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.140]   I mean, that's the first thing Apple is arguing
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.060]   is that Samsung is taking our relationship with consumers
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.660]   and they're trading on it by copying the things that
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:44.180]   indicate to consumers this is an Apple product, this is an iPhone,
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.180]   this is an iPad.
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.420]   I have to say what I'm going to do.
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.620]   This image that I'm showing right now is from your website.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.820]   This is my next.com.
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:56.380]   And that is pretty striking.
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.180]   There is a lot of similarity there.
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.100]   You know, we say it all the time.
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.420]   I think what's really telling about this is, you know,
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.860]   there are Android fanboys in this world who are very vehement
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.420]   about Android doing everything right and Google
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.540]   doing everything right.
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.100]   And even amongst them, and even the feedback I've gotten
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.660]   from them has been, yeah, Samsung probably went too far here.
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.660]   Touchwiz as always.
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.260]   More so than other Android phones.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.780]   Yeah, almost completely so.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.100]   And if you talk to HTC, if you talk to Motorola,
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.140]   they're trying to do something different.
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.500]   They're trying to meaningfully differentiate their products
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.900]   away from Apple, right?
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.540]   If you look at HTC Sense, it is totally different.
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.140]   It's got all these widgets and active wallpapers
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.100]   and integrates with your social networks.
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.220]   And Motorola does kind of the social networking thing
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.660]   with Blur and they've got their own widgets.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.260]   And, you know, they're out there.
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.340]   They are doing something completely different.
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.580]   You know, that's sort of what the patent system is designed
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:45.620]   to make you do, right?
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.900]   It says, OK, well, Apple did the grid.
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.140]   So now everybody has to try to do something different.
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.460]   And, you know, in some way that's supposed to push innovation
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:53.980]   forward.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.580]   Now, Apple did something similar with Microsoft
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.860]   over the recycled bin.
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.060]   This was some time ago.
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.380]   So that was a long time ago.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.100]   It was the night, a long time ago.
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.700]   And what happened in that suit?
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.900]   So that was a copyright suit.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.660]   And Apple's entire strategy there was flawed.
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.420]   I think they learned a lot from it.
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.820]   So Microsoft released Windows 3.1.
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.380]   And they had a license to some parts of the Mac OS interface,
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:21.100]   like the original system 6, system 7 interface.
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.180]   And Apple said, well, you had a license to some parts,
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.660]   but you took the whole thing.
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:29.380]   And we will claim a copyright to the whole thing.
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:33.260]   The look and feel of Mac OS will kind of copyright to it.
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.060]   And the court said, well, that's not how copyright works.
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:36.700]   And you lose.
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.620]   And that took 10 years for the court to take it out.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.740]   It took a long time, I remember.
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:40.500]   It took a long time.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.860]   And it was doomed from the start.
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.940]   I don't think just reading it's them or anything in a sense.
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.900]   They're not claiming anything like that.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.540]   Now they're claiming, again, it's all
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.180]   about the relationship with the consumer.
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.540]   They're claiming, you know, you made your trading
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.820]   on the elements of our interface, our packaging,
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.780]   our hardware, our software, that say to consumers,
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.260]   it's signal to consumers, this is an iPhone.
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.980]   You do a great job of comparing icons in your article.
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.700]   Again, this is my next.com.
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:07.220]   The phone.
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.860]   You know, this is right from Apple.
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:10.700]   This is Apple stuff.
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:14.780]   So the picture gallery, even the settings button is a gear--
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.820]   Yeah, I think the most telling one, whatever, to keep.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.940]   I think the most telling one is the bottom, the music player.
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.740]   So in the middle there is the Samsung's touch
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.300]   with music player icon.
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.420]   And on the left is the iOS iTunes icon.
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.900]   And on the right is the sort of desktop windows
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.660]   and OS 10 iTunes icon.
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.460]   And it's the same.
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.460]   I mean, that's a copy.
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.820]   And iTunes is like one of the most powerful brands,
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.820]   media brands in the world.
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.180]   And to rip off that icon basically says to consumers,
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.060]   oh, this is music.
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.180]   This is iTunes on my Samsung device.
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.700]   And that's not a lab.
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.020]   I mean, there's like, you find whatever.
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:51.660]   It's a phone icon.
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.900]   It's green, whatever.
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.340]   When you rip off the icon of the most powerful media company
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.980]   or powerful media brand in the world, which is iTunes,
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.420]   you are really treading on the internet.
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:17:59.900]   Yeah, ready.
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.420]   Yeah.
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.020]   So it sounds like not only do you
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.740]   think that this suit has merit, but you
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.780]   think that Apple will be successful.
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.140]   You know, it's--
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.260]   I know it's unpredictable.
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.580]   Success is a murky thing to define a lawsuit, right?
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.260]   70% of cases settle.
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.620]   And like we've been saying, Apple and Samsung
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:20.780]   are huge partners in many more ways than they are competitors.
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.620]   I mean, Apple can't make the A4 or A5 processor.
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:24.500]   That Samsung's helped.
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.100]   I mean, there are vanishingly few other foundries
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.380]   in the world that can do it at that scale and at that cost.
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.940]   So what's success?
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.300]   I think success for Apple is Samsung stops making touch
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.100]   because it's exactly like iOS.
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.740]   Samsung starts to be more innovative, right?
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.180]   And that's kind of like success for the consumer as well.
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.500]   I mean, if the end result of this is
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.740]   that Samsung has to go and make touch was better
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.340]   and start making phones that don't look like the iPhone,
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.580]   that's kind of a win, right?
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.180]   I mean, because then the people who want an iPhone
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.260]   can go buy an iPhone.
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.820]   And the people who want something new and different
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.780]   can go buy whatever Samsung makes next.
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.740]   And so we'll see.
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.300]   I mean, you know, there's people hate patents.
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.620]   People on the internet particularly
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.420]   hate the idea of ownership, which I think is very funny.
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.540]   And they hate the idea that Apple can own a messaging icon.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.260]   And there's a certain aspect of that that's true.
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.180]   I mean, it feels ridiculous.
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.260]   But at the end of the day, you know,
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.820]   they're just using the, you know,
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.380]   they're availing themselves with the resources
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.380]   of our society, right?
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.220]   Which is bad.
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.060]   - This is what you do.
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.060]   - Copyright protection, right?
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.140]   So whatever, they're doing it
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.260]   and those systems are designed to make companies
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.420]   actually compete.
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.620]   And I think we're all better off if, you know,
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.020]   whatever, Apple wins or they settle or whatever it is,
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.420]   we're actually all kind of better off
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.940]   if Samsung stops copying Apple in touch with it.
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.740]   And they start doing their own thing
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.660]   because that will force Apple better the next time.
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.260]   - Let me make the opposite argument,
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.420]   a little bit of the opposite argument,
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.420]   which is that all of these user interfaces and designs
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.740]   and everything are influenced by the other.
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.340]   I mean, this Windows lawsuit, for instance,
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.140]   yeah, Windows looks a lot like Macintosh,
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.740]   but that was good for Windows users
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.500]   that there was some consensus about how to do a GUI.
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.540]   Wouldn't want something can vastly different.
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.580]   I don't, the real, I guess it, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.620]   but it strikes me that the crux of this is,
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:11.620]   is Samsung trying to succeed by tricking consumers?
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.500]   - Yes, that is, I mean, you got it, that's the not, right?
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.060]   I mean, that's fundamentally it, they're saying--
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.500]   - They can be inspired by it as long as that's okay.
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.820]   - Right, well, yeah, right.
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.900]   I mean, that's why the Motorola suit
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.420]   and the HTC suit and Nokia suit and whatever,
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.860]   all those other Apple Android lawsuits,
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.180]   those are all about very technical,
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.860]   underlying system patents, right?
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.380]   How did you make the computer work?
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.700]   How are you addressing the RAM, all that stuff?
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.700]   This is about, I mean, that stuff is in here,
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.460]   but it's almost the foundation, the meat of the lawsuit,
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.700]   the front half of the lawsuit is all about
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.900]   stop pretending to be Apple.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.220]   - Well, let me ask-- - Stop pretending to be Apple.
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.780]   - Maybe this is the wrong audience, but come on.
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.500]   Alex Lindsay, would you accidentally buy a Samsung Galaxy S
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.420]   thinking it was an iPhone?
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.620]   - But I could see my parents doing that.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.460]   - Really?
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.580]   - I can see my parents not knowing the difference
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.580]   between these two--
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.980]   - Oh, honey, it looks just like an iPhone.
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.620]   - Yeah, I could definitely see my parents
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.180]   walking into Verizon store and walking out thinking
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.980]   that they've got something that was just like the iPhone.
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:09.820]   - I don't think so.
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:13.020]   - I can't imagine even the most technically--
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.380]   - No, I haven't heard this so many times.
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:16.380]   Wait, you haven't heard this?
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.140]   The Galaxy S on Verizon, fascinating, right?
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.220]   Well, before the iPhone came to Verizon,
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.740]   people wanted a Verizon phone.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.620]   They had Verizon contracts, they're happy with the service,
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.500]   whatever, and they would go into the store
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.700]   and say, is the iPhone out in Verizon yet?
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.900]   And the salesmen would say, no, it's not gonna be out.
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.060]   Maybe it'll come later.
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.700]   Right now we have the Fastenate,
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.940]   which is designed to be just like the iPhone.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.700]   And I've heard this story from multiple people.
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.660]   I mean, verbatim, the salesman said,
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:41.500]   this is just like the iPhone.
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.100]   - But they're not confused, they know they're not buying
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.300]   an iPhone, they're just buying something
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.780]   that has the iPhone's capabilities on a carrier.
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.220]   They prefer, what's wrong with that?
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.780]   - But it does, but the thing is that the box
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.500]   looks like the iPhone box, the interface looks
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.140]   like the iPhone interface, the hardware looks like.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.740]   When you add all those things up
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.220]   and you add in this message, it's just like the iPhone,
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.740]   you get this likelihood of confusion with consumers.
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.140]   They say, oh, this is good enough.
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.980]   And that is bad for the market, right?
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.260]   I mean, you don't want people buying the bad thing.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.660]   You don't wanna disincentivize the originality
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.180]   and say, oh, well, let's just buy the copy that's cheaper.
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.540]   Right, you don't, that's kinda bad.
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.660]   You wanna incentivize people to pay to creators
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:15.660]   and the innovators.
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:19.860]   - So people, so this doesn't damage the lawsuit.
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.540]   If people know it's not an iPhone,
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.340]   there's still that deception there if you're saying,
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.900]   well, we designed it to be just like an iPhone
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.780]   for Verizon, basically.
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.380]   In other words, they don't have to be confused
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.220]   that they're buying an iPhone.
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.060]   I doubt there's very many consumers
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.260]   that would think they're buying an Apple product.
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.020]   - But I think you and me and all the listeners to show
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.620]   and Andy and everybody else in the studio,
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.100]   like I think the, we're all too smart.
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.020]   (laughs)
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.020]   That's kinda the issue, right?
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.820]   It's, we all know, I mean, Sam's gonna call this damn thing
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:56.300]   the Galaxy iPhone and we would still know it's not an iPhone.
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.340]   But, you know, my mom or the average person on the street
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.980]   or whoever, they're like, oh, it's an iPhone.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.740]   So I mean, at what level do you say,
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.380]   well, that's trademark infringement, right?
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.620]   I mean, is it Galaxy iPhone?
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.060]   Is that going too far?
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.820]   Is copying the interface exactly going too far?
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.220]   I mean, those are, that's why we have a court, right?
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:14.820]   I mean, Apple can say you're going too far,
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.500]   Samsung can say we're not going too far.
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.500]   - Right, and then the court decides.
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.180]   - And I think that this is also, typically these kind of
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.380]   lawsuits are also a message to everybody else saying,
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.300]   you know, we've got money to the,
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.100]   we've got money that goes to the core of the earth
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.460]   and we are willing to spend it to protect this.
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.460]   And so if you decide you're gonna go down this path,
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.580]   you just need to know that there's gonna be, you know,
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.140]   this is how we're gonna react in the future.
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.020]   And so I think that that's also a big message
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.220]   to a lot of other manufacturers that, you know,
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.420]   this is gonna cost you 10 to $20 million to take the court.
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.220]   You just need to make sure that it's worth it.
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.820]   - Is it relevant that Apple's asking for a jury trial?
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.620]   - No, that's just what happens.
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.980]   - Okay. - Yeah, that's what you do.
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:56.980]   I mean, getting to that jury trial is a long, long way away.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.020]   - Well, and that's another question.
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.900]   Presumably Apple phoned up Mr. Samsung and said,
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.180]   dude, I'm gonna sue you, let's settle.
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.580]   And Mr. Samsung said, no way.
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:08.420]   - No, no way. - Well, number one is,
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.180]   I don't think that would necessarily be the case.
[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.020]   I mean, I think- - Oh, come on.
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.460]   No, you don't go right to a lawsuit.
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.780]   - Do you? - Sometimes.
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.580]   - No, what do you say?
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.420]   - They must have approached it and said, let's say.
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.780]   - They must have official communication.
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.020]   - Yeah, we want you to license this.
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.060]   And Samsung said, no, we don't feel this is an issue.
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.460]   - Well, no, I mean, so I don't think,
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.340]   I mean, so that the patents maybe, right?
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.380]   I mean, especially with a supplier relationship,
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.700]   like Apple has with Samsung, I can see them saying,
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.780]   okay, we need to license these patents,
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.420]   we gotta build the chips, we'll take it,
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:37.420]   whatever it is.
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.940]   With the interface, I mean, I don't know.
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.580]   I mean, I don't think Apple is interested in licensing out
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.940]   elements and design patents of the iPhone interface.
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.100]   I think they would, you know,
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.260]   - Right. - To themselves and do that.
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.420]   - So they're what they would have said is stop.
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:51.860]   They said stop doing this.
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.300]   You have to stop doing this, it's illegal,
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.180]   we're gonna sue you.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.460]   And Samsung said, no, we think we're in the right.
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.860]   We think there's meaningful differences
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.620]   that consumers understand between your interface
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.500]   and our interface and Apple said screw it,
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.620]   we're suing you.
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.940]   - I mean, I do think this happens all the time
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:07.580]   that you might buy a car that looks like a fancier car
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.420]   because it's got the same body.
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.260]   - So I mean, trade dress lawsuits,
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.300]   I mean, a lot of them have to do with cars.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.900]   I mean, for REC's people, for violating
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:15.980]   it's trade dress all the time.
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:16.820]   - Right.
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.620]   - And, you know, that's like,
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.580]   it's funny that everybody is,
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.860]   like sort of most smart people are very wrapped up
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.420]   in the machinations of our government, right?
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.260]   They're into politics and they care about
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.060]   who the president is and who's in Congress.
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.980]   And then there's this third branch of the government
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.340]   that's like all but ignored.
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.740]   And it's like really important, right?
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:35.660]   And there's this, you know,
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.940]   trade dress is one of those things.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.300]   And trade marks are one of those things
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.620]   where they affect you constantly.
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.940]   I mean, we live in a branded society, right?
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.980]   Everything is a brand, everything as consumer meaning
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.700]   everything informs your decisions
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.940]   to be a rational actor in the marketplace.
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.300]   And all is to do with trademarks and trade dress.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.900]   And so the lines of what can one company do
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.580]   to blur your understanding of where a product
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.980]   is coming from are sort of always in play.
[00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.580]   And, you know, it's not, oh my God,
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.060]   has anybody ever won one of these lawsuits?
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.380]   Where this law came from?
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.780]   It's, oh my God, Apple is a company I know,
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.620]   suing Samsung company I know for violating trade dress,
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.060]   not Ferrari suing some car supplier I've never heard of.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:14.900]   - Right.
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.420]   - And that's sort of the big issue here.
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.620]   - Yeah, I mean, you could see Apple suing
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.380]   all those Chinese companies that made exact iPhone clones.
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.220]   There were dozens of them.
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.060]   - Yeah, but they wouldn't get, you know,
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.180]   the Galaxy S is one of those popular phones in the market.
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.020]   - Right.
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.980]   - You know, I would argue that one of the reasons for that
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.140]   is because it looks just like the iPhone.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:30.980]   - Oh, okay.
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.220]   - Now, Galaxy S is really good hardware.
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.820]   I think if you ask how much do they love TouchWiz,
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.020]   they'd be like, I rooted my phone
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.140]   and installed stock Android on it.
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:40.980]   - Right.
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.260]   - And except for the people who were like,
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.180]   yeah, it's really great, it's just like the iPhone.
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:47.620]   - I don't think anybody loves TouchWiz for what it is.
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.900]   - So TouchWiz, yes, the I've never seen TouchWiz
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:54.020]   'cause I use the Nexus S, which is a Google visualization.
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.420]   It doesn't have any of the Samsung dressing on it.
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.020]   So I don't see that.
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.860]   Maybe that's why I don't understand this lawsuit.
[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.180]   - Yeah, I mean, if you use TouchWiz, I mean,
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.740]   you know, it's fine, you know, I mean,
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.740]   it's a skin on Android, just like any other skin
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:07.660]   is a skin on Android.
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.500]   - Right.
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:09.660]   - But I think you look at what HTC does
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.540]   or what Motorola does with their skins,
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.700]   they go flying on.
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:13.540]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:17.140]   - And again, you know, I don't think I can stress this enough.
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.740]   You don't see Apple suing HTC or Motorola
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.780]   for trademark or trade dresser and his other stuff.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.620]   - Yeah.
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.460]   - Because they're not doing it.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:24.620]   - Yeah.
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:27.860]   - Yeah, but you couldn't make this icon mine
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.620]   with the Motorola phone, right?
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.780]   You couldn't do it.
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.700]   And the fact that you can speak to volumes
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:33.820]   about what Samsung is trying to do.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.300]   I mean, you know, I think the most telling one
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.980]   out of all of these, this one's so ridiculous,
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.860]   is the phone icon, right?
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.700]   There are 10,000 ways to design a phone icon.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.780]   You don't have to make it a green gradient
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.740]   with an angled white phone on it.
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:47.580]   And they just did it.
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:48.500]   I mean, they made a choice.
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.580]   And they made it different.
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.340]   It's like, if you one thing and they just copied it,
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:52.340]   they're like, oh, we just copied it.
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.700]   You know, some designer got lazy.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.700]   This is like, they made it slightly different.
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:56.540]   - Yeah.
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.380]   - You know, like they had to be like,
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.380]   well, this is what it's gonna look like.
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.020]   We're gonna take a meter.
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.180]   - Yeah, I might like this better.
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.020]   However.
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.460]   - It is nice.
[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.700]   - Yeah, the ones on the right is where,
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.020]   if you look at the video, the ones on the right
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.060]   of the Samsung, the ones on the left of the Apple,
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.460]   I think in every respect to Samsung,
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:11.300]   actually it looks better.
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:12.620]   - Doesn't matter.
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:13.860]   - The context icon is way better, actually.
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.140]   I really like that.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:15.980]   - Yeah.
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.580]   - By the way, before we let you go,
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.420]   you know, I won more little bit,
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.460]   which is the funniest thing of all,
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.220]   although it's a sideline to it.
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.700]   Apple's lawyers apparently don't feel as strongly
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.500]   about copyright as Apple does,
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.260]   because these two images in the complaint
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:34.500]   were stolen from Engadget and Android community.
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.500]   - Yeah, well, just that one image on the right there.
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.020]   The one on the left is Apple's patent.
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:38.860]   - Okay.
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.940]   - So what they did was they put in their design patent
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.780]   and they went and found an image that looked just like
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:43.620]   it in a galaxy.
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:44.620]   - Which is from?
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.220]   - And so that's from Miriam.
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.420]   It was, no, it's actually,
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.900]   a picture just like that is on Engadget,
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.580]   but that's Miriam's war,
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.260]   who's their mobile editor is,
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:57.220]   - Maybe they licensed it through Getty Images.
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.740]   - Maybe they did.
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:28:59.700]   Yeah, I mean, it's just funny.
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.900]   You know, it's this thing.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.580]   You've got these copyright and IP attorneys
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.700]   and trademark attorneys, you know,
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.900]   at Morrison Forster, which is Apple's law firm.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.100]   You know, you can't blame Apple on this,
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:09.940]   they're attorneys.
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:12.620]   But you've got these high powered IP attorneys
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.500]   who are a huge firm.
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.180]   - Where are we gonna find this clip art?
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.020]   (laughing)
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:16.860]   - Right, and they're making,
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.180]   they're making these very pedantic claims about copying.
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.020]   They're saying you copied this icon
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.460]   or confusing consumers, you're doing all this stuff.
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.740]   And then it's like one very tired associate
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.100]   was like given the job of go find a picture
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:29.940]   that looks like this.
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.860]   And they search Flickr and they grab the picture.
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.340]   - Well, here's the question I have for you actually,
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:34.740]   is from a copyright perspective,
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.460]   is that really, is that a copyright infringement
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.020]   to use it in a lawsuit?
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:39.860]   - Yeah.
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.700]   - Yeah, I mean, it's not, it's like,
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.380]   I did a bunch of, it was actually, it's funny,
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.020]   you know, all this, I did this huge article
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.140]   on all the other stuff.
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.460]   And you know, that's more important.
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.260]   That's the billion dollar lawsuit, right?
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.140]   And then I couldn't stop thinking about
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.700]   whether or not it's copyrighted infringement
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.260]   'cause it just doesn't come up.
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.180]   It never happens.
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:00.060]   But you know, law firms have threatened to sue each other
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.220]   over copying bits and pieces of the complaint.
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:04.580]   You know, this document is a copyrightable thing.
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.820]   And you know, it's just funny that, you know,
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.740]   it's this mistake that everybody makes, right?
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:10.580]   "Oh, I can just use it.
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.940]   "It's not for a commercial purpose,
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.620]   "or I can just use it, it's very use."
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.900]   And that's not how our system works,
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:19.660]   but because it feels very instinctively to everybody online
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.500]   that that's how it should work,
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.460]   we just assume that that's how it actually works.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.180]   But the underlying system isn't ready for that.
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.260]   It's not ready for the internet.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.660]   It hasn't been for a long time.
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.500]   So that's why it's funny.
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.420]   It's, you know, it's funny that you have
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:31.780]   these high-powered attorneys
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.940]   making the same assumptions about copyright
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.940]   in a patent lawsuit that everybody else makes,
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.620]   you know, because it's just so easy and natural.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.180]   - Anyway, I would thank you so much
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:45.260]   for coming in here, Neelai Patel is at thisismynext.com.
[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:49.220]   That is the name of the site until their next thing.
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.260]   Joanna Stern, Neelai, Joshua Topolsky,
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:53.540]   and others, until they start that up.
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:55.260]   What is, what is, you could talk about it.
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.340]   What is it?
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.380]   - You know, we wanted to do the next generation
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.540]   of online publishing.
[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.060]   And, you know, we, our partners at Espionage,
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.860]   they've built a platform there that is--
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.620]   - It's a sports, isn't that a sports?
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.460]   - They do sports, right?
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:08.620]   But they have this huge, you know,
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.500]   they have a huge technical team behind them,
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.100]   of developers and encoders and designers.
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.100]   And they're, the platform they've built underneath
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.700]   the sports site, the actual CMS of the thing,
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.380]   is in its next generation.
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.260]   I mean, the first time I saw it,
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:24.180]   I actually started laughing because it made the idea
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.940]   of using like WordPress or whatever,
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:26.780]   whatever we had using.
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.260]   - Whatever, what I was using, yeah.
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:29.100]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.420]   - I mean, you know, I think there,
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:31.820]   the rumors, I don't know this for sure,
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.580]   but you know, the rumors are that what
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:34.820]   a gadget I've been using will then
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:35.980]   be on the Having a Post system.
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:36.820]   So who knows?
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.940]   - Just tell me that you guys aren't gonna start
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.380]   a 24 hour network all about technology.
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.220]   That's all I wanna hear.
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.140]   - It's gonna be called this day in tech.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:45.980]   - Son of a--
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.980]   - No, but look, we're gonna do this,
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.220]   we know we wanna do, we wanna combine this long form stuff.
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:53.900]   I love writing this long form stuff.
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.740]   I feel like there's not enough of it.
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:56.580]   - I agree.
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.820]   That's like this article is fantastic.
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.620]   - Right, and we've all been writing editorials
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:01.540]   and it's been really great.
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.980]   So we wanna combine more of this long form stuff.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.980]   We wanna keep doing the news like we've been doing.
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.260]   We wanna really blow out reviews.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.740]   I mean, we wanna take the idea of a tech site,
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.060]   a community of people that read it
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.860]   and all the media goes around to it
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.180]   and try to push it into the next generation
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.180]   of what publishing is and not just have it be
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.260]   a river of posts.
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:24.340]   And there's always room for that river of post
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.380]   and that endless stream of news,
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.140]   but I think there's a lot of room for smart people
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.340]   and smart readers to interact and think
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.900]   and kind of get deeper on the things they love.
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.220]   And yeah, that's where we're going with it.
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:38.580]   I know it's very vague, but yeah, I gotta say something better.
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:39.420]   - I love that.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:40.940]   I can't wait. - Actually, yeah.
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.580]   Stephen Levy was at Food Camp last year
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.420]   and he says, you've heard of slow cooking.
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:47.700]   I do slow writing, slow journalism.
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.540]   - Yeah.
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:52.300]   - And I think we need more long form, thoughtful pieces.
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.140]   - I love all of it.
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.900]   I love stuff that I can look at on Flipboard really quickly
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:57.900]   and just kind of go through it.
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:02.100]   And then I expect when I get something from the economist
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.180]   or something from Wired,
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:06.220]   I expect that to be more thought out,
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.860]   more researched in the same way.
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.340]   - That's why God and Marco created Instapaper.
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.900]   (laughing)
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:13.740]   Right?
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.380]   - You know, actually, when you watch this
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:18.820]   in my next one of the first things people,
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.860]   we heard from people is we wanna use Instapaper.
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:21.700]   - Yeah.
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.380]   - And I think, you know, 'cause all we've been doing
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:24.540]   is like editorials and reviews
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.980]   and it's been very relaxing to step out of the news cycle
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.180]   of, you know, I have to write a post every 20 minutes
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.300]   and start thinking about things.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.380]   And I think you'll see that reflected in what we do next.
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.220]   - Okay.
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.300]   - I'm very passionate about that.
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:38.780]   So it'll be good.
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:39.900]   I mean, we have a lot of plans.
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.260]   If we can pull off half of them by the fall and just half,
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.220]   I think it'll be really great.
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.460]   If we pull off all of them, we will blow up the universe.
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:47.300]   - I can't wait.
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.140]   - That is fun.
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.380]   - Neelai, thank you so much for being here.
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.420]   We appreciate it.
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:51.380]   - Hey, thank you for having me.
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.500]   It's been great talk to all of you.
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.980]   - Neelai Patel, this is mynext.com.
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.300]   Do read the long form.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.580]   We just did the short form.
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:58.660]   Believe it or not.
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:59.500]   (laughing)
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.780]   - Do read 45 minutes later.
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.780]   - Do read the long form of the article
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.460]   'cause it's actually fascinating.
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.020]   And as soon as I lean saw it,
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.540]   she said we gotta get Neelai on the show.
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:08.540]   Thank you, Neelai.
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:09.380]   - Thanks for having us.
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.220]   - Take care.
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.700]   We will continue Mac Break Weekly on the air.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:12.780]   Andy's been very patient.
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:13.620]   Thank you.
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:14.460]   (laughing)
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.500]   - I'm smart enough to, I'm listening.
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.340]   I'm taking notes, Neelai.
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:18.620]   That was really good analysis.
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.420]   - Yeah, I was really glad to get him on.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:21.740]   - And I'm with you.
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.900]   How many times have you read like Engadured Pieces
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:27.060]   and thought, man, if this guy had another two days
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.260]   and unlimited time to write this,
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.660]   I'm liking what I'm reading so far,
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:32.940]   but I know there's so much more that they could be saying.
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.300]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.060]   - I keep thinking about a time when I was talking
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:40.540]   to one of the old time local TV news broadcaster
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:44.340]   who said that the day the TV news started to go downhill
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:46.260]   is when they stopped shooting things on film
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.860]   and started doing things on video.
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.340]   And when they got a satellite truck,
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:50.460]   that was the worst thing of all.
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.860]   When they cause, he was saying that when I knew
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.620]   what we're gonna be doing a story on film,
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:57.060]   we had a minimum number of time it would take
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.300]   to actually develop the film,
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.820]   cut it together, put it together.
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.180]   And that gave me X number of hours or minutes
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.060]   to actually think about what I wanted to write
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.300]   and what I wanted to say.
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.380]   Rest now, you just have to go for the live shot.
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.100]   And that's so, I'm really excited to see what's the web
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.460]   with these guys gonna be doing on the new site.
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:12.940]   - It's kind of bold in this day and age
[00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:14.500]   of short attention spans to say,
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.900]   we wanna do long attention span journalism.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:17.740]   I'm thrilled.
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.100]   - I'm really thrilled doing it.
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.180]   - Thank these tablets.
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:22.260]   They've given us mediums that we can actually take
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.860]   interesting things off the web
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.300]   and actually make them stuff we can read on the subway.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:27.700]   - That's actually a very good point, isn't it?
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.020]   - Yeah.
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.180]   - We're gonna take a break, come back with more
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.300]   Andy and Akko is here, Alex Lindsey too, with lots.
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.460]   If this is maybe the longest Mac break weekly ever,
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.420]   well, we're gonna try to wrap this up in about 45 minutes.
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.260]   There's a ton like least story.
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.100]   - A ton to talk about.
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:40.940]   That's just the beginning,
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.740]   that's just the tip of the legal iceberg.
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:43.740]   - That was us getting warmed up.
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.820]   - This week in lawsuits will continue in a moment.
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.900]   But first, why don't we have one like that?
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:49.980]   - We do.
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:51.060]   - This week in law.
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:52.220]   Is it this with Denise Howell?
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.460]   - It's just about lawsuit, one lawsuit.
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.060]   - No, but I mean, oh, believe me,
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.980]   this will be the topic of the next this week in law.
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.780]   We do that every Friday at 11 a.m. Pacific,
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.140]   2 p.m. Eastern right here,
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.620]   live.tv/watch.
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:07.100]   And Denise always brings an actual lawyers.
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:07.940]   - That's crazy.
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:09.060]   (laughs)
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:09.900]   - Instead of us.
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.140]   That was why we had an ill-ion, 'cause he knows.
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.740]   - And this week in law is mostly copyright patent.
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.620]   - No, that's everything, but it tends to do with technology.
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.100]   So, and of course, as a result,
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:22.340]   there's a lot of IP law, intellectual property law
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.260]   that they talk about.
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:25.220]   But, golly, there's a ton to talk about it.
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:27.260]   In music industry, it's not just lawsuits.
[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:29.460]   I think lawsuits are kind of ultimately boring,
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.780]   but I think the debate behind them,
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.220]   the thing like the trade dress debate is fascinating.
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.940]   That's the interesting part of the law.
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:39.420]   - Hey, this portion of whatever show we're doing,
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:40.780]   Mac Break Weekly 243,
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.740]   it brought to you by our friends at Citrix.
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:45.100]   They do that great go to meeting.
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.700]   I am a fan, I know you are too, Alex Lindsey.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.260]   We do go to meetings all the time now.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.300]   Unfortunately, as this business has gotten bigger,
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.740]   we've had to do more conference calls.
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.380]   It's such a, I hate meetings.
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:56.220]   - It is. - I like it.
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.220]   - Freaking hate meetings.
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.860]   - You know, I'm not a big fan of meetings either,
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.940]   but what I hate more is actually going to them.
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:01.780]   - Well, that's true. - I like them.
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:02.860]   - I like them. - This eliminates that.
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:07.020]   - You wear a nice shirt and you don't need,
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.180]   you just need to make sure you have a nice shirt.
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.020]   - No pants.
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:09.860]   - Well, I just want you to say that on.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.700]   - I didn't want to say that on.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:11.540]   - I know what you're saying.
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:12.700]   - Didn't want to say it on the butt.
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.180]   - And actually, if you have one of those modern webcams,
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.260]   you could have a background that looks like a busy office.
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.940]   - Yes. - Instead of your den
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.340]   or out by the pool.
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.420]   See, this is the beauty of go to me.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.660]   By the way, works well with the iPad.
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.500]   They have a free iPad client.
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:29.940]   I was really surprised 'cause I was on a go to meeting
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.060]   with the iPad and I went outside,
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:32.660]   Chris has got the wifi and I went outside
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.340]   actually 'cause it would work on 3G too.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.100]   And I'm sitting here and then I realized,
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:40.540]   oh, I plugged in my iPhone headset with the microphone.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:41.380]   I don't need a phone.
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:42.380]   I'm just sitting here with the iPad
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.580]   and having a meeting, it's amazing.
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:48.620]   Mac or PC, go to meeting.com/
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:49.660]   No, I guess not slash.
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:51.540]   Go to meeting.com, click the try it free button
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:52.820]   and use the promo code MEC.
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:55.700]   - We couldn't do the Pixel core anymore without--
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.940]   - No, I couldn't do what we're doing.
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:00.180]   It's really, if you're gonna have to have meetings
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.100]   and you do as you get bigger
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.940]   'cause you gotta all be on the same page.
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:03.900]   It's not just as you get bigger
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.220]   as teams get distributed because now and now,
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:09.180]   more with you certainly, but more and more and more with us,
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:11.740]   we're working with people who are not on site.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.300]   And go to meetings is fantastic.
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.140]   - And it's great for meetings
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:15.980]   and it's also great for training.
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.380]   So you wanna train a bunch of people on something,
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.740]   you wanna be able to share your screen.
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:19.580]   - Since then right here.
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.300]   - Yeah, and that's what we use it probably
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.340]   for more than anything else.
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:25.340]   - We had a, I was sitting in a training
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:28.420]   where the trainer was in London
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:29.780]   and he's training people all over the world.
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:33.340]   I'm in Petaluma watching how to do match moving.
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:34.900]   And so there's a bunch of us crowded around.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:35.980]   - Watching's the key word.
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.500]   You can do a lot on a phone call, but you can't watch.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.540]   - And the people are raising their hand
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:40.780]   and he's answering the questions.
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.860]   And we've got a moderator and it's all like,
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.580]   you're like, they must have been doing this for a while.
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.420]   - I've had a, I don't know what,
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.620]   they have a larger group product.
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.700]   So we actually use a webinar.
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:53.540]   - Go to webinar.
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:54.940]   - That's what we actually have that
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.940]   and that'll handle up to 100.
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.940]   - I'm giving a webinar, I'll have to get the details
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.340]   'cause I'm giving a webinar in the future of work
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.180]   in next month or so.
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.540]   - It's like go to meeting on steroids.
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:04.580]   - Yeah.
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:06.260]   - Go to meeting, try this one.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.700]   For most businesses, this is what you need.
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.420]   - Yeah, that's what I have really big group.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.180]   Training collaboration, presentation, great.
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.380]   If you have a sales presentation
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:15.420]   and you don't wanna fly out to the client,
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.460]   clients even love using this.
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:18.140]   Go to meeting.com's, you see,
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:23.140]   click the try it free button, use the offer code, Macbreak.
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:29.620]   Here's one more note that just came in via our chat room
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:35.540]   and a credit to Jeff, this article from Mac Rumors,
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.980]   it gets even worse, apparently.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:41.420]   Let me see.
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.320]   It's not coming up.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.580]   Analysis of Apple's lawsuit against Samsung
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:48.820]   includes iOS device sales numbers.
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:49.780]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.860]   So there's more information in here about sales,
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:56.300]   that stuff that maybe Apple doesn't typically review.
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:01.140]   Apple notes that either as of or by March 2011,
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:05.660]   they had sold 108 million iPhones,
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:08.980]   60 million iPod touches, so that's 168 million
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.100]   of the little devices and 19 million iPads,
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.740]   that's 187 million iOS devices.
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:21.980]   And they're doing a little math,
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:25.100]   they're saying that 18 million iPhones are sold
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:28.540]   during the quarter, four and a half million iPod touches
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:33.180]   sold during the quarter, and 4.2 million iPads sold
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.220]   during the quarter.
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:36.780]   During the quarter?
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.740]   That's actually a little lower than maybe you might have
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.980]   thought. - A full full full full.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.780]   - First quarter of 2011.
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.020]   Now the reason MacRumors mentions this
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:48.260]   is because everybody thought they might have sold
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.300]   as many as twice as many of that.
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.620]   So maybe the iPad, I think if you roll in the fact
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:58.180]   that iPad one was the dominant version selling
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:59.300]   at that time, right?
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.140]   People were, and new iPad two was on its way.
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.180]   I would expect to drop in sales for them.
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.620]   - Well, yeah, and I also think that,
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:09.100]   yeah, I mean, I think that people are waiting
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.180]   for the iPad two if they're gonna,
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.980]   typically people upgrade, I don't know if the iPad,
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.180]   I think that's why you have low numbers.
[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:17.140]   Wait a minute, wait a minute, we get Q2 numbers.
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.220]   That's when you see the iPad two take off.
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:23.220]   All right, let's move on from legal stuff.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.580]   I'm a little disappointed.
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.300]   You know, I bought a MacBook here the day it came out.
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:30.140]   - Yes.
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.620]   - It has a Toshiba SSD in it.
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:36.100]   I checked, I ran the little system thing.
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.980]   Now they're putting in, I'm a little faster apparently.
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.900]   They decided they wanted a considerably actually faster,
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:46.900]   Samsung SSD in the new MacBook Airs.
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.980]   - So I'm just trying to find somebody
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:50.540]   to pom it at MacBook Air off on
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.100]   so I can get the new faster one.
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.540]   - And he's that make a dip, wait, wait, wait,
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:56.900]   that's not Andy, and he's that make a difference?
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.180]   - I'm really not sure.
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.820]   I've seen, I've seen the, I don't have one of the new SSDs
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:03.420]   myself, I've seen the numbers.
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.420]   And based on my own experience with MacBook Air,
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.260]   I don't think that you'd be kicking yourself
[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:10.620]   that you didn't wait until the new SSD came out.
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:12.380]   Faster is always better, but.
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:13.860]   - Yeah, I still like it.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:15.300]   - What would you have done with the three months
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.820]   in which you did not have a MacBook, a really nice time.
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:19.580]   - You would have stared at the windows
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:20.420]   what you would have done.
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.780]   - I might give it to the Vorac.
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.580]   (laughing)
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:24.420]   - It's so far.
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.380]   - You act as though it's like one of those
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.500]   like novelty cans of nicks nuts saying,
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:32.500]   John, which you like an SSD powered MacBook Air.
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.760]   (laughing)
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.380]   - All right.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.700]   (laughing)
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.180]   - I think for folks who are really pushing it,
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.340]   maybe it would be different.
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:43.620]   Like if you're trying to do video or audio
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:44.940]   on your little MacBook Air,
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:46.900]   but I think that for the average user,
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.260]   I can't imagine that speed being pushed.
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:49.500]   - I was looking at the numbers in a non-stick.
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.860]   It is a lot, the new Samsung is faster.
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:53.740]   Of course, maybe you should buy it now
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:55.380]   before Samsung pulls a plug in.
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.020]   - What applications are you using on it that would
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.500]   know everything that arrived?
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.140]   - That's exactly the thing.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.820]   If you're using the sort of applications
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:05.220]   where a really, really fast, super fast disk access
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.020]   is gonna be a transformative thing,
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:10.780]   you probably shouldn't have bought yourself a MacBook Air, sir.
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:15.260]   - Well, I did also buy the new MacBook Pro with an SSD.
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.300]   I should look and see which ones in the MacBook Pro
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.100]   that I just got, the i7.
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:20.380]   - That thing was a Thunderbolt.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.620]   - Yeah, like a Thunderbolt.
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.100]   - Did you see a lot of Thunderbolt at the MAB show?
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.820]   - Oh my gosh, I saw so much Thunderbolt.
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:29.020]   I was all hard drives or what else?
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:31.380]   - So, you know, someone, I was just commenting
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:34.340]   on someone's comment about, someone talking about Thunderbolt.
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.420]   Adobe was talking about Thunderbolt.
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:38.100]   And I said, I am more excited.
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:41.100]   The only thing, the only hardware addition to the Mac
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:44.820]   that I was more excited about than Thunderbolt is the mouse.
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:48.180]   You know, because I mean, it is, when you look at the throughput
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:51.020]   that it's providing and what it's gonna allow us to do.
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:53.340]   So, we saw a bunch of drives.
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.340]   One of the things that I didn't really realize
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:57.460]   is that you could do stuff like,
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:01.020]   so LSE was showing some of their little big drives
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:02.260]   with SSD drives.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.460]   And you can take four of the drives
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:09.100]   and raid two pairs of RAID 0
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.740]   and then pair them as a RAID 1, so they're mirrored.
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:15.820]   So they're mirrored, but RAID 0.
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.020]   - Zero plus one, in other words.
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.300]   - Yeah, zero plus one.
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.940]   And now, so you got four drives that now,
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:24.660]   I mean, the throughput is like over a gigabyte.
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.340]   - The nominal throughput of Thunderbolt is what,
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:27.500]   three gigabits per second?
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:28.660]   - No, no, 10 gigabits per second.
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:29.900]   - 10. - Each way.
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.220]   So now, so then you combine that with,
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:33.300]   you've got those four drives.
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.900]   Now you combine the fact that you can do
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.980]   a dual link black magic card that's gonna let you
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:42.980]   pull in uncompressed HD footage,
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:45.580]   or even uncompressed 4K footage.
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:49.300]   Okay, so the thing is, is that what I,
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.140]   I had, we had to build drives from scratch
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:53.020]   to get them fast enough
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:55.900]   when I first started shooting uncompressed HD.
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:59.580]   Now, we could take my F950, which is 444 uncompressed.
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:02.060]   It's 190 megabytes a second.
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:06.420]   And I could redundantly capture it live
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:08.700]   on a laptop to external drives.
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:09.540]   - Wow.
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.740]   - So I could capture two copies of it at that moment,
[00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:14.100]   live on a performance.
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.860]   - Taste one of the drive dies or something you've got,
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:16.700]   you've got a backup.
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:18.020]   - Well, usually what happens is mission critical.
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:20.220]   - At the end of every show, the first thing that we do,
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:21.700]   no one moves any of the computers.
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:22.540]   - Make a backup.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:23.380]   - We make a backup.
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:25.220]   And so the thing is, imagine being able to have a backup.
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.260]   - And that takes a long time, by the way, that is.
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:28.420]   - When you're captured, when you're captured,
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:30.260]   uncompressed, it takes, it can take an hour and a half,
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:31.660]   two hours of it just sitting there.
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:34.180]   - You remember Mac Break Weekly, or Mac Break Rather,
[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:35.700]   just sitting there waiting.
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:37.460]   And everybody's got their hands in there like this.
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:38.980]   - Everyone's like, you know, just let it pass.
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:40.940]   - So imagine being able to get that copy
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.140]   in real time, you know, capture.
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:46.460]   And so the thing is, is that it is a profound change.
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.260]   And so there's a lot of hardwood drivers.
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.460]   The other thing that I saw, we do--
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:50.540]   - Now this is all hugely expensive.
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:51.540]   Is there gonna be anything for--
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.260]   - No, no, these are not particularly--
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.900]   - Well, come on, four SSDs right there.
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:56.740]   - They're--
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:58.460]   - I mean, this is not something I would buy.
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:45:59.860]   This is something an Alex would buy.
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.700]   - I think that the drives are in the $500 range each.
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:03.540]   So they're not--
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:04.540]   - It's too grand for the drives.
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:05.540]   - Yeah, so it's--
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:06.380]   - All right.
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.780]   - But the raid that I've been using otherwise
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:09.620]   is $6,000.
[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:10.460]   - Yeah.
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:11.300]   - And so it's a big drop.
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.660]   And that's going all the way, that's going overboard.
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.740]   But then they also, like, Sonnet was showing these,
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.260]   it's a four by compact flash.
[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.700]   So a lot of us capture video on compact flash.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:25.300]   It's got four compact flashes with Thunderbolt.
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:28.820]   So you can plug four, if you're shooting at an event
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:31.500]   or something like that, you can plug four compact flashes in
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.580]   and it will capture them to an external drive
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:36.340]   as fast as the compact flash is capable of writing.
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:39.780]   All four of them at the same time.
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:43.140]   From a production perspective, it is just
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:44.980]   a complete game changer.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:45.820]   And the more--
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:47.900]   - Are we gonna see, I mean, I guess the reason
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:51.180]   that you talk about this is that very few people need
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.020]   10 gigabit throughput.
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:55.460]   So I mean, I guess we'll see external drives
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:58.380]   that have fast throughput, but that's--
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.700]   - Nobody really needs that, right?
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.500]   - Well, no, you might really need 10 gigabit throughput
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:04.100]   when that's also your display driver
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.100]   and you've got two drives.
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.580]   10 gigabit throughput is also gonna be really, really useful.
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.580]   Obviously when you're doing backups and stuff like that.
[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:12.100]   So this is one of those features
[00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:13.980]   that everybody is gonna benefit from.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.140]   - When we've done an all stop, we fully expect Apple
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:20.220]   with a by WWDC to have Mac Pros and Minis
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.500]   and iMacs and everything else.
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.340]   We're already seeing--
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.180]   - Right now, only the MacBook Pro has the accessible.
[00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:25.700]   - Yeah, which is exciting.
[00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:28.660]   Now, what I've been wanting for years is the--
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:30.860]   Well, since USB 3 came out was,
[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:33.380]   I wanna have Mac Minis that I can use as streaming boxes
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:35.180]   that can take uncompressed video.
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:37.060]   And that has been something that's been kind of
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.500]   a distant dream. - Right.
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.300]   - Until now, where now, as soon as the Mac Minis come out,
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:42.740]   it means we're gonna be able to really connect
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:45.540]   real devices to it, to have it do work.
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.900]   And if you combine a quad i7 into a Mac Mini
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.220]   and then give it Thunderbolt,
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:51.060]   you have a--
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:51.980]   Now you really have a server.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:52.820]   - Right.
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:53.820]   - And that's the whole thing.
[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:56.380]   And it's not a server with delicate fiber,
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.980]   you know, and fiber channels and all these other things
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:47:59.980]   that are really expensive.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:01.220]   It's just something like,
[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:04.700]   get a bunch of Mac Minis and hook up Thunderbolt to it.
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:07.900]   It really changes a lot of things really quickly.
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:08.940]   It's very exciting.
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:12.460]   - Apple will release its quarterly results on Wednesday.
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.220]   So we'll know how well those new MacBooks are doing.
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:16.860]   But Gene Munster at NPD is saying,
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:20.220]   he sees a, he thinks it's gonna be like a 47% increase
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:23.060]   in Mac sales, MacBook sales, just because of this new--
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:24.260]   - And then they'll have another one in the next one.
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:25.180]   - I know it's so me.
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:26.020]   I wanted it.
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.860]   And then they'll have one for the other two other machines.
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:29.820]   - And if I hadn't just bought one, I'd have one.
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.100]   - Well, you know, Andy wrote a great article.
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:33.860]   I love this article, Andy, in Macworld.
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:35.500]   Macworld.com to upgrade or not,
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:38.940]   in which he talks about that tough decision
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:40.500]   about whether to buy the new thing.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.140]   And we're all swayed by the shiny.
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.020]   But I thought you did,
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:47.540]   I thought you did a very intelligent analysis.
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:49.900]   - Yeah, because there are two different ways
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:52.260]   that I can write about a piece of technology.
[00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:54.260]   One is, you know, this guy who all I have to do
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:56.820]   is sign for a package and I get to get the $500 thing
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.180]   at least for a month or two.
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.980]   But then when it comes time to actually spend my own money,
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:04.380]   that really becomes a much more complicated decision tree.
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.900]   And yeah, with the, I really think that,
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:11.380]   I tried to drive my MacBooks the way I drive my cars
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:14.900]   where as soon as I can sense that one more mile
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:17.340]   and this thing is gonna fall apart like the Blue's Mobile,
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:18.860]   that's the time I think that, okay,
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:20.540]   I've gotten all the value that I can out of this
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:22.460]   and it's time to get something new.
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:25.660]   So it's, when it's time to upgrade a MacBook,
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:28.460]   that's the time when you realize that there has to be
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:30.260]   a very long list of new features,
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:32.260]   things that I can do with this that I can't do
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:34.740]   with the old one that really forces your hand.
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:36.860]   And that's really the decision that you make
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:38.820]   for every time you wanna spend more than $50
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:39.900]   in a piece of technology.
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.220]   What can I do with this new one
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:43.340]   that I can't do with the other one?
[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:46.460]   - Well, see, I'm just gonna go out and buy a new SSD
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:48.740]   for my MacBook here for thousands of dollars
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:50.900]   and I'll get incredible throughput.
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:53.460]   - Well, and I think one of the other things though
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.660]   is I think that it's me, Andy.
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.060]   - I don't know, you're so rational and I'm going,
[00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:59.460]   but I want it.
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:02.020]   - Okay, oh, and I want it too.
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:05.060]   It's just that there's someone explained to me
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.420]   the difference between being cheap and being frugal,
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:10.340]   that if cheap means that under no circumstances,
[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:12.740]   like we use spend a dollar, frugal means that you'll spend
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:15.460]   $10, but you wanna get $20 worth of value for it.
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:16.460]   And that's why--
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.300]   - You're smart, that's right.
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:21.620]   - That's why, when it came time to buy the MacBook,
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:24.140]   it was like, do I want to spend a little bit more money
[00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:25.380]   get the SSD? - Yeah.
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.740]   - And I just had to translate it into,
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:30.260]   it'll be faster, it'll be a little bit more durable,
[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:33.420]   but to take the amount of money extra that you would spend
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:36.500]   getting half the capacity as an SSD,
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.620]   you could buy two backup drives,
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:42.220]   a two-year subscription to an offsite online backup service.
[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:44.700]   And you'd also have a nice other pocket drive
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:48.540]   for backing up and storing all your photos on.
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:50.860]   Can't you do more with that sort of stuff
[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:52.300]   than you can with Salt State?
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.500]   Although, man, yeah, it is cool,
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:57.180]   when you use the first time you're using an SSD-based machine.
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:58.020]   - Oh man.
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:00.300]   - And you just, and you're at the coffee shop
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.340]   and you check the time, so ooh, I better,
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:04.100]   I'm gonna miss my train if I don't leave soon.
[00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:05.900]   The first time you just slammed the lid closed,
[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:08.900]   throw it into your bag and leave without waiting for an LED
[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:10.300]   to start snoozing.
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:11.140]   That's when you realize that,
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:13.500]   oh, this is why people spend $600 for this feature.
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:17.860]   - So other world computing, selling a upgrade to the SSD
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:21.940]   for my MacBook Air 4G,
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:23.740]   1200 bucks for 360 gigs,
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:26.140]   that's only 200 bucks more than I paid for the Air.
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:30.140]   - But it's tempting, hovering, hovering,
[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:32.060]   I'm not gonna do it.
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:34.820]   - And the other thing is, is that with this much throughput,
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:37.380]   I can definitely see, I think that we're gonna definitely see,
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:40.140]   at least the Air's, if not a lot of the other computers,
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:42.940]   slowly reduce all of the connections on the side.
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:44.420]   - So, yeah, well that's the point, right?
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:45.940]   - Yeah, that's the one connector.
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:46.860]   - One connector.
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:48.100]   - The thunderbolt.
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:49.700]   - All of your connectors that you have,
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.740]   that you want at home will be in your monitor
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:53.620]   and then you'll just have a thunderbolt
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:54.460]   that connects to your monitor.
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:55.940]   That's the question, what about you when you're on the road?
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:57.660]   Are you gonna have a massive dongle?
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:59.220]   - We talked about this last time.
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:01.140]   - I mean, I can see having a USB and a thunderbolt.
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:02.860]   Like I can see Apple just going, okay, here's the deal.
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:04.460]   USB thunderbolt power.
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.140]   And those are the three that you're gonna get.
[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:07.820]   And that's it.
[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:09.540]   And when I looked to the side, I could, like,
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:11.100]   oh, and maybe a headphone check.
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:12.100]   (laughs)
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:13.620]   - That's it.
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:14.820]   - I'm gonna go back to where we were.
[00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:15.660]   - Yeah.
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:17.620]   - And you're carrying it around.
[00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:22.340]   - Imagine, no, but no ethernet, no Firewire, no second USB.
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:23.940]   You know, like if you want all those extra things,
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.020]   that those are things you get the dongle.
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:26.060]   - I just wanna go on record, Andy,
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.900]   that I'm so impressed that you were able to not pull
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:31.620]   the trigger on an iPad 2, not pull the trigger
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:33.860]   on an Nikon P7000.
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:36.140]   Of course, you bought the most expensive of the three.
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:37.100]   (laughs)
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:39.580]   - Okay, the difference is that I directly make money
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:40.460]   off of my MacBook.
[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:41.300]   - Right, no, no.
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:45.220]   And I also realized that I had a three-year-old backbook.
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:47.540]   The track button didn't work anymore.
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:48.900]   - It was tough.
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:52.740]   - It was starting to be, it really wanted to go back to Jesus.
[00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:55.980]   And so I decided after three years of very, very long,
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:58.220]   very, very stylish service, little of number nine,
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:00.460]   had earned its place on the Valhalla shelf
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:02.140]   with little of the number one through eight.
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:04.460]   - If there's a MacBook Pro Heaven,
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:07.340]   I'm sure they have a hell of a throughput.
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:08.740]   We're gonna take a break, come back with more.
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:10.100]   You're watching Mac Break Weekly,
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:13.020]   Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core is here,
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:14.340]   back from the NAB show,
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:16.500]   I'm sure with lots of juicy things you'd like to buy.
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:18.140]   (laughs)
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:20.660]   My wallet, my wallet is like literally like,
[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:22.660]   you know, in Indiana Temple of Doom
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:23.740]   when you're holding onto that rock
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:25.540]   and it's like burning through the bags?
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:26.380]   So my wallet's like right now.
[00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:31.380]   - I think more of myself as Ulysses tied to the mast
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:33.820]   with the sirens call.
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:34.660]   Remember that when he said,
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:37.620]   oh, tie me to the mast no matter what I do.
[00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:38.820]   Do not untie me.
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:42.060]   And the sirens are going, please Ulysses, please come.
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:42.900]   - More many years.
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:43.740]   - More many pretty things.
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:44.820]   - Come here.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:50.020]   - Andy Naco is also here and he has heated the sirens call
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:52.220]   but only once out of the three possible times
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:55.660]   plus his good faithful dog.
[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:58.220]   Whatever his name.
[00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:00.020]   (laughs)
[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:01.740]   Andy apparently can't afford a real dog
[00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:03.500]   so he uses surrogates.
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:07.500]   - Okay, when I was in bold, as always,
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.700]   whenever I'm staying at somebody's house and they have dogs,
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:13.580]   I have such like, if there's a biological clock
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:16.180]   for buying a dog, I feel with the ticking of that clock
[00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:17.100]   like, oh.
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:19.780]   - I have the MacBook Air of dogs.
[00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:20.940]   If you'd like a pat beyond,
[00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:23.380]   I'd be glad to put them in a box and ship them to you.
[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:24.220]   - He's cute.
[00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:25.060]   He's cute.
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:25.900]   He's cute.
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:26.740]   - You would love him.
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:27.580]   He's about, he's seven pounds.
[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:28.820]   He's this big.
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:30.420]   You could keep him in your pocket.
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:31.900]   - I spend so much travel time traveling.
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.060]   - I know what I'm saying.
[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:37.380]   - I think I keep telling myself that my biggest recommendation
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:39.380]   as a responsible dog owner is that I realize
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:40.980]   that I probably can't own a dog.
[00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:43.580]   - Really?
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.660]   You could, I've seen people on the plane with dogs
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:46.780]   in their pockets.
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:47.620]   Isn't that legal?
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:48.460]   - That's just so nice.
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:49.300]   - I see that.
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:51.860]   - I'm like, really, really you're keeping a dog on the plane?
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:53.580]   - Well, you don't want to put it in the cargo compartment,
[00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:55.260]   especially if it's seven pounds.
[00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:57.900]   - I want to be able to throw a baseball
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.460]   and not know that I'm going to be crushing my dog to death
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:01.460]   if I miss time to throw.
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:02.620]   (laughs)
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:04.940]   - I want the Toyota Corolla dog.
[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:08.740]   - That's actually why Henry does not like Ozzy
[00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:09.900]   because he can't.
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:11.940]   He can't do that.
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:14.260]   By the way, just a real quick picture from the,
[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:15.780]   and again, thank you to the chat room
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:16.620]   who was feeding me stuff.
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:18.500]   Caffeine Free Dave, who was a little,
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.020]   I'm afraid a little bit too energetic
[00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:21.620]   for somebody who's not on caffeine.
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:24.340]   So it makes me wonder Dave, what you are on
[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:27.740]   has given us this image of the new prototype.
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:31.260]   This is from the 2011 Geneva Motor Show,
[00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:34.900]   VW Micro Boss with an iPad in the day.
[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:35.740]   - Dash.
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:38.060]   - I'd buy it.
[00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:38.940]   That looks cool.
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:42.740]   They're bringing back the Micro Bus.
[00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:43.580]   - With an iPad.
[00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:44.420]   - With an iPad.
[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:45.260]   - Modern.
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:46.100]   - Look at this streamlined dashboard.
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:47.780]   You can put it all on the iPad.
[00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:48.620]   You don't need it.
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:50.100]   - You just gotta make sure you're always driving south
[00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:52.340]   or southeast so that you can actually see the screen
[00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:53.180]   and get it done.
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:56.500]   - As long as the selections could be an issue, couldn't they?
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:00.060]   - As long as the radiator is not under the driver seat.
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:02.460]   - You know, or the passenger seat will all be fine.
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:03.700]   - Toyota's gonna sue him saying,
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:05.980]   that's stealing the trade dress of the Scion.
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:07.820]   It looks exactly like the Scion.
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:09.380]   - I don't know.
[00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:10.740]   - Oh, it's in the house now.
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.460]   That's a good image.
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:15.140]   - I like to drive you Micro Bus right into the house.
[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:17.420]   - That's not a house, that's a really nice garage.
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:18.340]   - That's not a Micro Bus,
[00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:20.020]   it's just a really nice iPad holder.
[00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:21.660]   - That's a car house.
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:23.860]   (laughing)
[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.780]   - We'll be back with more Mac break weekly in just a bit,
[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:27.180]   but first of all, from FreshBooks,
[00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:29.260]   if you are in business for yourself,
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:33.660]   you know that one of the most annoying parts of business
[00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:37.820]   is the invoicing, but it's also the most important part.
[00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:40.020]   That's where you get paid kids.
[00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:42.900]   That's why FreshBooks came along to make it all easier.
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.740]   I remember when I first started using FreshBooks,
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:46.820]   and I have used them since 2004,
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:49.340]   now I think they first started.
[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:50.660]   It transformed my life.
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:54.140]   I am not, I am, as you probably gathered,
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:55.500]   Mr. Organization.
[00:56:55.500 --> 00:57:00.220]   And I would invoice people months, nay.
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:04.900]   - At least one occasion years after I did that.
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:07.860]   - I gave up, so if I didn't invoice you after six months,
[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:09.780]   I was like, you know, they're probably not gonna pay me now.
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:13.460]   - No, they really questioned my integrity.
[00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:15.100]   I said, you're what now?
[00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:16.580]   You're invoicing us now?
[00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:19.580]   So that stopped when I started using FreshBooks.
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:21.180]   First of all, it's very easy, upload your logo,
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:23.300]   and now you do it all in the web, or on your iPhone.
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:26.260]   There's an iPhone app that does the invoicing too.
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.340]   Now I think about the iPhone app.
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.420]   I guess you could do this on the web too,
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:31.340]   it'll track time, and then just pump the hours
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:33.100]   right into the invoice.
[00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:35.420]   So if you do get paid by the hour,
[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:38.140]   this is a fantastic tool for you.
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:39.820]   Really simplifies things.
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:42.460]   I worked with, I invoice people in Canada as well as the US,
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:43.820]   so I had to use multiple currencies.
[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:46.700]   They handle all the currencies easily.
[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:49.540]   You know, so that's pretty neat.
[00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:51.700]   If you work internationally, not more and more do,
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:53.740]   you can automatically send a bill
[00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:56.100]   and automatically charge your credit card.
[00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:57.540]   So the client can pay automatically,
[00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:58.420]   of course they have to let you,
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:57:59.540]   but once they authorize that,
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:01.260]   you get paid right away as soon as you send the bill,
[00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:02.660]   and you don't even have to think about sending the bill,
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:04.700]   because the invoice is automatic too.
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:07.340]   And I like to pay it now button on these invoices,
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:09.900]   because, let's be honest, most clients do wanna pay right away.
[00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:12.300]   They just wanna get it out of their brain.
[00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:13.140]   So they'll push that button.
[00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:14.100]   They'll use the credit card
[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:16.420]   or one of 11 different authorization services,
[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:18.140]   and boom, you're paid.
[00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:19.540]   If they don't pay right away,
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:21.500]   automated late payment-alignment reminders
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:23.340]   make it easy to collect.
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:25.980]   And if they are old-fashioned,
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:27.340]   and they like paper invoices,
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:30.140]   you can do that too for a small additional charge.
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:31.300]   I used to do that for Rogers,
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.140]   'cause they wanted paper.
[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:33.980]   - Paper.
[00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:34.820]   - They wanted paper.
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:35.820]   - So that was a while ago.
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:37.940]   They may have updated now.
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:40.300]   But that way you send them electronic
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:42.260]   and then you follow up with paper, that's really.
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:45.980]   - If your client asks you to deliver your video on VHS,
[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:46.820]   they're gonna want paper.
[00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:48.380]   - They're gonna want paper.
[00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:49.220]   - They're warning you.
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.060]   - Try it free right now.
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:51.740]   It's actually free for three clients.
[00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:53.700]   So if you're just getting started,
[00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:54.540]   that would have been enough for me
[00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:56.660]   for most of the time I was doing invoicing.
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:58.820]   By the time you have 20 clients,
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:00.740]   maybe you got somebody to do this for me.
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:02.060]   - I guess year was the first year we broke
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:02.900]   into more than three.
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:03.740]   - More than three.
[00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:05.100]   But three is good.
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:07.980]   So anyway, free to start with up to three.
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:09.780]   Then they have accounts for larger.
[00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:11.340]   They mighty oke account,
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:13.340]   the evergreen or the seedling account.
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:14.860]   I like the names.
[00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:16.380]   FreshBooks.com.
[00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:17.940]   Yes, they're still sending out birthday cakes
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:19.460]   one each week to new users.
[00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:23.220]   So sign up today and you might get a birthday cake tomorrow.
[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:25.140]   - And we would still put into the seedling account.
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:26.420]   - I know. - 25, that's 25.
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:27.620]   - That's a lot of clients.
[00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:29.540]   That's a lot of clients.
[00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:32.260]   And all the features you get, it's just fantastic.
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:34.220]   - Fantastic.
[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:35.740]   FreshBooks.com, try 'em today.
[00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:38.380]   I get a lot of emails and tweets these days from people
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:40.900]   who say, "Hey, I tried FreshBooks on your recommendation
[00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:42.820]   "and I'm very happy."
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:44.820]   It really does make things easier.
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:46.140]   - Apple maybe.
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:48.860]   Apple could be.
[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:50.420]   And we might find out Wednesday
[00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.500]   'cause their earnings are gonna come out.
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:56.100]   And you know how Wall Street reacts to those good earnings.
[00:59:56.100 --> 01:00:01.100]   The first trillion dollar company in market value.
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:03.100]   How would they do that?
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:06.620]   Well, let's see, what would their share have to be?
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:11.980]   So if they got their shares up to $430,
[01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:15.300]   that's a 28% increase in stock price.
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:16.580]   You think they could hit $430?
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.940]   Scott Bourn probably would say, "Yeah, of course."
[01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:21.420]   - Some people already targeted them over 500.
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:25.340]   - They would then, wow.
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:28.460]   Let's see, no, they wouldn't make trillion.
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:32.620]   That would only make them maybe a bigger than Exxon.
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:34.540]   - I think that was the point.
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:35.820]   That's where they have to get to to get bigger than Exxon.
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:38.900]   - Now to get to a trillion, what would they have to do?
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:40.060]   - They'd have to double that again.
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:41.060]   - Double it again. - A little bit more.
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.540]   - Yeah, Apple would have to hit $1,000 a share.
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:44.700]   - Yeah.
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:47.540]   - 'Cause they got $921 million shares outstanding.
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:49.380]   - But at the pace they're going, it's possible.
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:52.700]   - Yeah, well, they've got an average 59% annual growth rate.
[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:53.660]   So three years.
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:56.180]   - And that you can't keep growing that rate.
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:57.180]   - You can't keep doing that.
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:58.740]   - Wow, we've been talking about Apple
[01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:00.300]   not doing that for a long time.
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.300]   But I know, they keep surprising everybody, but no,
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:03.460]   they're not, especially with,
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.300]   do you think these new ideas can you really come up with us?
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:07.300]   - And Steve's not at the helm.
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:08.140]   Or is he?
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:08.980]   - He seems to be pretty safe for that.
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:10.940]   - It's hard to say because he was in fact at that event.
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:12.460]   - He may not be actually at the helm,
[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.220]   but I think he's got a cell phone to the person.
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.220]   - He's got a walkie talkie.
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:16.260]   - Yeah, there's like,
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:17.420]   - Hey, Helmsman.
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:18.260]   - Yeah.
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:20.620]   He's got a red phone.
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:21.460]   (laughing)
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:22.820]   - Do, do, do, do, do.
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.420]   - But you got it, you got to imagine,
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:25.500]   if they're going to continue to this growth,
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.860]   realize that that's the past three, three, four years
[01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:32.260]   of coming up with practically a new epshaping product
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:34.300]   almost every like year and a half.
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.900]   So once they get the iPad three,
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.700]   which will have pretty much everything,
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.260]   including unicorn burps,
[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.420]   as far as all the features it can possibly put into a tab.
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:47.140]   But what are they going to do in 2013, 2014?
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:49.140]   That could possibly match that sort of thing.
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:49.980]   - I know.
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:50.820]   - Are they now going to be,
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.980]   we're going to start to see flattening out of the curve
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.180]   after 2012.
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.180]   - I mean, if it doesn't flatten out,
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:57.260]   I think pretty soon that we may end up in a situation
[01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:00.100]   where Apple has to bail out the US government.
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.300]   It's going to be serious.
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:02.140]   I mean, they're going to,
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:03.980]   - Well, you saw that, we got some cash later on here.
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:05.260]   - You saw that article that said,
[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:06.540]   Google could actually,
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.260]   actually just the combined value of Larry,
[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:11.780]   Sergey and Eric could buy the music industry.
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:13.620]   And just, you know, say, okay, guys,
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:15.780]   we're tired of all this bitchin and monom.
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:17.300]   Just, you know, we want to buy you.
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.260]   - And it would work if it would actually work better
[01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:22.260]   if Amazon and Google and Apple split it up
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:24.500]   so that there wouldn't be any antitrust issues.
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.340]   And then the three of them could just say,
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:28.020]   okay, now we're going to change the whole business model.
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.140]   And they couldn't talk to each other about it.
[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:31.060]   They would just have to wink at each other across the room.
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:32.700]   Otherwise it would be anti-trust.
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:34.100]   - So I want, this is the,
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.220]   I should have put this up at the top.
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:37.780]   And I apologize for not doing the official retraction
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.920]   portion of our program.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.500]   I was wrong.
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:43.420]   I was wrong.
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:45.860]   Maya Kopa, no, I wasn't that bad.
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:47.540]   We were, it actually wasn't even on this show.
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:48.380]   It was on Twitch.
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.140]   I was talking about color.
[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:52.500]   And with Robert Scobel was on the line.
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.420]   And I think we had Brian Brushrud in the room.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:56.420]   And we started talking about the fact that color,
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.300]   which is that iOS app, it was also on Android.
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:01.540]   And another a couple of programs,
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:03.420]   without notification,
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:06.380]   open the microphone on your iPhone
[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:07.900]   and gathered sound.
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:10.980]   Mike Elgin in Computer World, quoting us,
[01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:13.860]   a couple of days ago mentioned color, shop kick,
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:16.780]   and into now all of which use the microphone
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:20.220]   to gather information and to now listens
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.340]   to what you're watching on TV or fingerprints it.
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:27.340]   And then somehow says, hello, I don't know what it does.
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.340]   I don't have that app.
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:30.860]   - We know about color.
[01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:33.900]   Turns out color does a fingerprint of,
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:37.180]   this was unclear to me and Robert Scobel clarified this later.
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:40.180]   But in the show a couple of weeks ago, he said,
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:43.700]   "Color turns on the mic, listens to the room,
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:45.780]   "and somehow figures out if there are other phones
[01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:47.340]   "in that room."
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:49.060]   He doesn't use Bluetooth in other words,
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:52.340]   or Wi-Fi to figure out who's nearby.
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:55.300]   So clarifications, I got one from Nathan Sharf
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:57.340]   who is at into now.
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:59.060]   He says, "I wanna clarify a few things
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:00.860]   "that we're set about into now.
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:04.820]   "The into now system, no audio is ever sent back
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:06.540]   "to our servers."
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:08.300]   And Robert Scobel sent me a note saying,
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:12.580]   "Color says the same thing, no audio is ever sent back
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:13.980]   "to the servers, they're not recording audio,
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:15.020]   "they're not transmitting audio,
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.540]   "they're not fingerprinting the audio,
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:17.700]   "in the case of color.
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:20.380]   "Get this."
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.220]   According to Scobel,
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.260]   they're listening to five seconds of audio
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:24.420]   when you shoot a photo.
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:27.820]   To see what the background audio level is.
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:29.780]   He says, "They just wanna know
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:32.260]   "if you're in a noisy room or a quiet room.
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:34.900]   "That helps to figure out if another camera
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:36.460]   "is in the same room as you."
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:39.180]   Okay, I'm just gonna read this.
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:41.300]   I'm not gonna editorialize.
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.180]   This listening isn't recording anything though,
[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.180]   just setting a bit in the database,
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:46.860]   like noisy room or quiet room.
[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:51.740]   My concern, whether they're sending,
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:52.580]   first of all,
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:54.860]   this is what the companies say,
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:55.700]   and I believe them,
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:56.540]   I have no reason not to believe them,
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.340]   they're nice fellows.
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:04:59.340]   But that's not my concern.
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:01.620]   My concern is that they are able to turn on the microphone
[01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:05.940]   without saying any point to the end user,
[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:07.180]   we turn on the microphone.
[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:09.060]   Whether they're sending it back or not,
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:11.580]   whether you believe they're sending it back or not
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:12.380]   is not material.
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:16.140]   Their fact is that the way Apple's terms of service work,
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:19.020]   I guess, are you do whatever you want,
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:20.660]   and you don't have to notify.
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:22.340]   Doesn't that bother anybody?
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:24.580]   - No, I agree with you.
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:26.900]   There's a reason why one of the first things I do,
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:29.540]   I did with the new MacBook was to cut up my little dot
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:31.140]   of gaffers of black gaffers tape
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:32.900]   and put it over the camera,
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:36.300]   because there are times when you're running a go-to meeting,
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:37.700]   let's come, sorry.
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.860]   You're running a web chat client,
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:42.220]   you're running your access certain sites,
[01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:43.660]   and for no particular reason,
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:44.980]   you see that green light turn on
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:48.260]   and you don't suspect that anything untoward is happening,
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:51.660]   but you would have expected some sort of a dialogue box.
[01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:53.980]   Oh, by the way, I really want to turn on the camera right now,
[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:55.260]   is that okay with you?
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:57.500]   So, yeah, though I agree,
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:59.340]   you have a right to be kind of skeaved up by that.
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:01.780]   - The Into Now program, does it?
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:02.620]   So this is it.
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:03.460]   - You listen to this.
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:06.820]   - It listens to this, it's kind of like a Madome or Soundhound.
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:09.380]   It listens to the show or Shazam
[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:11.940]   and then tells you what you're watching.
[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:12.860]   - And then you check in.
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:14.500]   So this is Eileen's phone,
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:17.140]   she apparently doesn't mind that it's listening.
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.020]   They say it doesn't send anything back to the server,
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:20.540]   I don't know how it would do that without checking
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:22.820]   with the server, but let's, I'll presume they're not lying.
[01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:24.860]   - They could just do a hashtag.
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:27.100]   - Yeah, there's some hash that sends back.
[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:28.740]   It just bugs me that companies,
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:30.660]   now on Android they do tell you, but you,
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:32.420]   I mean it's a long list and you just go,
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:33.620]   "Yeah, yeah, whatever."
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:38.100]   I just, I think it, yeah, I guess we're trusting
[01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:40.700]   that these companies are not sending it back,
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:42.220]   and if they say they don't, they don't.
[01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.980]   And we're trusting that Apple vets this stuff
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:46.300]   and makes sure that it's private,
[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:49.660]   but I sure would, I would just like a little warning
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:51.100]   when I first installed this program.
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:53.180]   Hey, here's why we turn on the microphone.
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:55.140]   Here's what we do with what we turn on the microphone.
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.360]   Is that okay with you?
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:59.380]   - I think it's a good idea.
[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:00.580]   - So the retraction is--
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:02.780]   - You just have a big long thing that says agree.
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:04.380]   - Yeah, well that's the problem.
[01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:05.580]   - But I mean that's what they'll do is they'll say it,
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:06.940]   they'll never see it. - Right, you never watch stuff
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.420]   and then they'll know it.
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:11.860]   The retraction is that I guess we implied,
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:14.900]   or we weren't sure that the data was sent back to the server.
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:18.540]   It struck me that they would need to do that
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:19.740]   to get the information they wanted.
[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:21.660]   There is data sent back to the server,
[01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:23.260]   but only that you're in a noisieroom or not,
[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:27.340]   a noisieroom in color, and maybe a hash for into now,
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:31.580]   or into what or into, what's it called, into, into whatever.
[01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:35.540]   Into now.
[01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:38.540]   - And then I don't know about the shop kick,
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:42.620]   but I guess similar idea for shopping just bugs me.
[01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:45.140]   I think we should know this, that it's the news.
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:48.220]   - If it's a function of that application to grab audio,
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:49.940]   then you're gonna assume it, but yeah, anything else.
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:51.060]   - It's a camera application.
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:52.620]   - If your camera application are not shooting video,
[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:53.660]   you would not assume that it's--
[01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:56.340]   - Yeah, I mean if I use Madomi or Shazam, I know,
[01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:57.620]   and I'm holding it up to the radio saying,
[01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:58.460]   what the hell is that song?
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:07:59.620]   Well obviously it's listening,
[01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:00.940]   but actually you're holding up to the radio
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:01.780]   and telling everyone--
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:02.620]   - Shh, shh, shh, shh.
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.380]   - I'm trying to get this, I can't hear it.
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.380]   I can't figure out.
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:08.860]   Everyone at Starbucks, just be quiet just for a second.
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:11.260]   So I stand corrected.
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:12.460]   - You know what I'd love to see?
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:15.540]   I'd love to see that if there was a standard interface
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:17.380]   for these kind of privacy settings,
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:20.700]   in terms of what gets sent out over your 3G connection
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:22.100]   or over your wifi connection,
[01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:25.300]   and it would just be one like sort of just gadget sort of thing,
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:27.380]   where if you can imagine like a pipeline
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:29.660]   of the things that the app must have sent out,
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:31.660]   but it goes into this box and then there's a pipeline
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:33.740]   out up there to the internet,
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:36.100]   where you can simply check off in system settings.
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:37.500]   I never want video to go out,
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.940]   I never want audio to go out,
[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:41.900]   I never want GPS information to go out,
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:44.380]   all this sort of stuff that you can simply check or uncheck
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:46.340]   so that at a system preferences level,
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:48.660]   you can simply say, under no circumstances,
[01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:51.940]   do I ever want you to send audio without my mic
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:53.940]   was at least saying it's okay for you to do that.
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:55.620]   - And perfect con fair.
[01:08:55.620 --> 01:09:00.020]   - Uncle Fubar in the chat room is little snitch for iOS,
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:01.020]   which is exactly what you want.
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:03.660]   - Yeah, of course Apple wouldn't approve that.
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:04.500]   - New.
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:10.300]   - Apple can make changes, in fact, the in app purchase issue.
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.860]   Apple made changes, so in earlier versions of iOS,
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:15.900]   if you logged in, you probably have this problem
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:19.140]   with Malachi, you log into one of these programs
[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:21.100]   with in app purchases and you give it your password
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:23.540]   for 15 minutes at password, you don't have to reenter it.
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:27.220]   - So I have to admit that I haven't given Malachi
[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:30.060]   anything that has in app purchases because of that.
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:31.620]   - Well, that's the problem.
[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:32.460]   - So I was kind of careful early on,
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:33.300]   I was like, oh, I'm happy to do that.
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:35.860]   - So Malachi's playing like the Smurf Village game
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:38.460]   and you've logged in within 15 minutes,
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:39.980]   all he has to do is tap a few times,
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:41.180]   give me some more of Smurf berries
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:42.500]   or whatever the hell it is.
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.340]   And you could spend hundreds now.
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:46.660]   - I used to watch him, I used to complain all the time
[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:49.620]   about on an iPhone, if you want to purchase an application,
[01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.980]   every single time you have to put your password in.
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:54.460]   And I complained about that until I saw how quickly
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:56.700]   my three year old son can get to the app store
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:58.220]   and start clicking on things and trying to buy them.
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:09:59.780]   And I was like, I'm really glad that they're asking
[01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:01.540]   for that password because he doesn't know it yet.
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:04.340]   - They did, I think in 4.3, they modified the way it works
[01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:06.620]   so that in app purchases, at least you need a password
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:09.020]   that hasn't stopped a class action lawsuit
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:12.900]   from some parents that say, hey, you know.
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:14.260]   - I want those Smurf berries back.
[01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:17.100]   - I want my Smurf berries.
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:19.540]   And I hope you enjoy Smurf berries, kid.
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:21.540]   That's all you're eating at school lunch program
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:23.180]   for the next three weeks.
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:25.340]   - Apple apparently changing how apps are ranked
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:27.060]   in the iTunes store.
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:29.020]   - Rumor, rumor, we don't know, Apple hasn't said anything.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:31.180]   - Oh, we know, it's things changed pretty quickly.
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.820]   This is from Giga Ohm.
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:35.020]   It changed the ranking, you noticed that?
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:36.700]   - That's been what I've been reading, I didn't notice it.
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.140]   I don't pay enough attention to the rankings.
[01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:40.580]   But it does appear that they've changed something.
[01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:44.900]   It looks like it's based on some kind of usage
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:48.060]   rather than how often people are actually using it.
[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:50.780]   - There is a flaw in the app reviews.
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:53.460]   I mean, there's been a flaw in the rankings
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:55.260]   and iTunes, whatever. - Yeah, and iTunes.
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:57.460]   - You know, you hate the podcast system
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:58.980]   but all that, but that's all right.
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:02.780]   - Well, but I think that the issue is that it is a,
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:04.700]   you kind of want to constantly change this
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:07.020]   because the reality is that if it stays stagnant,
[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:08.620]   it is going to be manipulated.
[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:09.980]   And there are a lot of people that have figured out
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:14.860]   how to manipulate, you know, that'll game that system.
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:17.260]   Yeah, so it's beyond just, you know,
[01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:20.740]   what you want in a best case scenario is people,
[01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:22.100]   you're actually producing a great product
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:23.980]   and people are buying it or downloading it.
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:25.500]   And because of that, they are,
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.980]   you're ending up high on the ranking.
[01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:29.940]   And that's not oftentimes not the case.
[01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:31.060]   - Yeah.
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:33.580]   This is actually according to Inside Mobile Apps GIGO,
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:35.700]   I'm quoting them.
[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:38.060]   Several ad network and paper install executives
[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:41.180]   have noticed a change with App Store rankings
[01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:45.500]   apparently taking into account daily and monthly engagement.
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.420]   In other words, not merely the people bought it
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:48.780]   but that they used it.
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:50.340]   Androids done this for some time.
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:54.500]   Facebook appears to be one of the winners,
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.140]   well, what a surprise.
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:57.740]   From the algorithm change,
[01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:59.940]   which apparently occurred around April 13th or 14th,
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:02.660]   jumping to the top of the free iPhone App rankings
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:05.780]   after being number 13 for a long time.
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:06.620]   It wouldn't make sense.
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:08.060]   Everybody uses Facebook every day.
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:10.500]   - I imagine Facebook, Twitter, those are probably ones
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.340]   that are-- - But then excuse it
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:12.180]   the other way, right?
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:13.940]   Because there's so much engagement with a Facebook app
[01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:15.540]   that doesn't, that's just the nature of Facebook.
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.580]   You might not get engaged with Instagram every day
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:20.660]   or whatever, but you might love that app might be a great app.
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:21.820]   - I don't think it's one way or the other too.
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:23.540]   I think they're probably calculating,
[01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.460]   just using it as part of the calculation.
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:28.500]   - Right, but it illustrates difficult to,
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.580]   these rankings are difficult.
[01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:31.060]   And that's my problem with rankings in general.
[01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:32.540]   What does it mean?
[01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:35.060]   - Yeah, I think the only really suitable test would be
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:38.660]   to have the OS just randomly delete apps off of your phone
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:40.460]   and see which ones you actually notice
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:41.940]   are missing as a pre-installed.
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:44.220]   That's the photo app I want,
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:46.380]   the one where every, if it gets removed,
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:48.100]   someone will notice within 36 hours
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:49.460]   and immediately reinstall it.
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:51.100]   - Oh, but don't you have a checklist of,
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:52.540]   here's what I removed, did you miss it?
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:54.020]   - Isn't it like throwing away a gift?
[01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:55.540]   - Isn't it like throwing away a gift though?
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:57.420]   I mean, you kind of like, you know, you look at this
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:59.220]   and you've, I've gotten so many apps on my iPhone
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:01.740]   and I look at it like, I know that if I delete it,
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:02.740]   I'll never use it again.
[01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:04.740]   - Like, you know, it's like goodbye in the lab
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:06.180]   because you're gone, you know?
[01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:10.220]   And I barely knew you, but I'm gonna have to let you go.
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:13.300]   - The deeply paranoid chat room, by the way, points out,
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:15.420]   rightly so, that well, how are they tracking
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:17.180]   that engagement?
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:18.180]   Are they watching us?
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:20.540]   - They have already, I mean, in the terms of agreement,
[01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:23.380]   they say that they're gonna take non-person,
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:26.220]   aggregate non-personal information about usage.
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:29.020]   It's part of when you say, I agree when you get it,
[01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:30.900]   it's in that, it says basically,
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:33.540]   we're not gonna take personal information,
[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:35.020]   but we are gonna aggregate information
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:36.580]   and we believe that that's non-personal.
[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:38.180]   - I guess that's my point in general,
[01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:39.580]   is that the cell phone is the most
[01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:43.940]   a mind-bogglingly efficient way to spy on anybody anytime.
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:46.220]   It knows where you are, it knows what you're doing,
[01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:48.380]   if it's got a microphone so it can listen to your calls,
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:50.820]   it's got a camera so it can see you dancing around
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:51.820]   in a maid's outfit.
[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:54.820]   It knows, maybe for you.
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:56.220]   - Did I just say that?
[01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:57.580]   - Did I say that out loud?
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:00.220]   - So, this, I mean, you're carrying around
[01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:02.860]   a little spy device in your pocket all the time,
[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:07.060]   and that's why I think companies gotta bend over backwards
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:11.900]   to protect us because the potential for abuse is horrible.
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:14.300]   - What concerns me is when you build a system
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:18.180]   that allows you to gather that kind of information,
[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:22.060]   what happens when you get a subpoena from the FBI
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:24.220]   or the-- - No, now drop box is said.
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:26.780]   We will unencrypt and give anything
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:28.980]   that the government wants to them anytime.
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:32.620]   - Right, so what happens when Apple has all this capability
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:34.780]   and they're not using it right now that way,
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:37.020]   but what happens when they get that subpoena
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:38.860]   that says we want this guy's phone,
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:40.420]   we wanna hear the audio all the time,
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:41.420]   see the video all the time,
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:42.860]   'cause we think he's a terrorist.
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:45.900]   And how does Apple, you know,
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:48.700]   because they built those capabilities into it,
[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:51.260]   that's the part that can be a little bit frightening.
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:53.060]   - Hey, the white iPhones almost here.
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:55.300]   According to someone in the UK, right?
[01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:57.540]   - It's been cited in the UK, it's on Verizon's list.
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.440]   Maybe we'll get a white iPhone.
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.220]   I don't, does anybody even care?
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.660]   - Yeah, that's my point.
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:05.820]   I mean, at some point, Apple should,
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:09.260]   so it's interesting to me that they're still pursuing it,
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.820]   that after a couple weeks to lay,
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:13.180]   sure after a couple months to lay,
[01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:15.380]   sure at this point they have to say,
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:17.540]   you know what, we really thought it would be simpler
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:19.180]   than this, it was much more complicated.
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:20.260]   - We'll put it in this next one.
[01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:23.260]   - We'll make sure that we'll make the next iPhone
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:24.860]   five double white.
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:26.660]   It will be Martin Mulwhite.
[01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.500]   That's, it'll be Lawrence Wilk White.
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:30.660]   That's how white we will make the next iPhone
[01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:33.420]   to compensate for a year of non-white iPhone.
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:34.940]   - Phone's white people like.
[01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:41.300]   There was another, oh, the iPad two story.
[01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:46.780]   Jesse Jackson at Democrat, Illinois,
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:50.100]   says the nation's economic woes are due to the iPad two.
[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:52.380]   I'm not even gonna play the clip, it just sounds crazy.
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:55.700]   Especially since the same Jesse Jackson Jr. a month ago,
[01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:58.380]   said that every student in America
[01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:01.180]   should have a federally funded iPad.
[01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:04.140]   But they're putting people out of work
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:07.020]   and China's benefiting Steve Jobs is rich.
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:08.940]   I'm confused. - I don't understand.
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:10.660]   - I don't understand. - I don't understand.
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:12.740]   - He says librarians and textbook makers
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:13.660]   are gonna be out of work.
[01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:14.580]   - Yes, they will. - Next to the iPad.
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:15.420]   Yes, they will.
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:16.340]   You're right, Jesse.
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:18.020]   - Welcome to progress.
[01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:19.980]   No, I'm not saying that it's not progress,
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:21.220]   but I'm just saying that it's like,
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:23.660]   yeah, so we don't have as many horses either.
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:26.780]   I mean, it doesn't mean that we shouldn't have cars.
[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:31.780]   This is 2011 version of the internet is made of tubes.
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:36.660]   Get ready, the remixes will be here soon.
[01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:39.940]   - And also people tend to forget that as,
[01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:43.340]   yes, certain parts of industry are gonna be put out of business,
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:44.700]   but it actually creates,
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:47.540]   it will also create new jobs for new people.
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:48.980]   So. - Because VHS was going
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:50.540]   to kill the movie industry.
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:51.940]   - Right.
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:53.980]   - This is called progress.
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:56.060]   If you were a buggy whip manufacturer,
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:57.900]   you were pissed off at Henry Ford,
[01:16:57.900 --> 01:16:59.740]   but doesn't mean we should stop making cars.
[01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:01.980]   - If you were a scribe, the printing presses,
[01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:02.980]   those monks. - Let me tell you.
[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:04.660]   - Let me tell you, those monks were pissed.
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:06.300]   - They're like, we're gonna go buy some wine instead.
[01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:08.900]   - Well, you know who the Luddites originally were,
[01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:12.340]   who were led by a guy named Ned Ludd in Great Britain,
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:15.460]   who was pissed off at the automatic looms
[01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:17.500]   that were taking weavers jobs away
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:20.460]   and they destroyed looms, the original Luddites.
[01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:21.700]   This has been going on for a while.
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:22.540]   - Yeah.
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:25.540]   - And fluffy, I apologize for saying pissed off.
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:27.900]   - Apparently that's offensive.
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:30.900]   - But you know what, Ned was worse than pissed off.
[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:33.780]   He was peeved, he was irritated, he was angry.
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:36.540]   - He was put out, put out.
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:38.340]   - His Elan was seriously dampened.
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:39.180]   (laughing)
[01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:41.500]   - His Elan from now on.
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:43.380]   Okay, from now on, we're gonna substitute,
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:48.380]   anytime I say peoed, we're gonna edit in Andy saying
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:51.700]   his Elan was seriously dampened.
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.780]   He was unchuffed.
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:54.940]   - Copyright, Bob and Ray.
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:56.780]   - Thank you. - Oh really?
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:57.940]   - God bless them.
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:17:59.820]   It all comes back to Bob and Ray.
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:02.660]   - God bless them. - God bless them.
[01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:04.980]   - Bob, if you're listening or someone who knows Bob
[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:06.060]   is listening.
[01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:07.620]   - Thank you, Bob, Elliot.
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:09.540]   - Chris Elliot is Bob's son.
[01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:10.780]   You might be listening.
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:12.020]   - Yeah, there you go.
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:12.860]   Awesome.
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:15.740]   - I was just, I was, when I was in London,
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:18.460]   I was trying to explain Bob and Ray to Robert Llewellyn.
[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:21.420]   And as always, hitting my head against the same problem
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:24.740]   you always do where every Bob and Ray joke and routine
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:26.940]   looks like nothing right, paper.
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:28.220]   - It's very simple. - It's all the way
[01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:29.260]   that they deliver it.
[01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:32.780]   So you find yourself describing two men climbing stairs
[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:34.660]   endlessly opening the wrong doors,
[01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:36.620]   trying to get to the Commissar's office.
[01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:38.500]   And somehow that being the funniest four minutes
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:40.300]   you listen to on the entire drive ride ball.
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:41.820]   - You just had to be there, I guess.
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:42.660]   - Exactly.
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:45.300]   - Hey, by the way, we did, we neglected to plug that
[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:48.780]   appearance on Bobbie's show.
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:49.980]   - Oh, yes, carpool.
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:52.380]   - Andy Enoco, I don't know if it's now the latest,
[01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:54.460]   it was the latest last week, carpool.
[01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:56.020]   - I think it's now like two episodes old,
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:58.820]   but it's still available for download at reasonable prices,
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:00.540]   IE free, free action store.
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:02.340]   - And a great show, I love Bobbie.
[01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:03.260]   - It was a whole lot of fun.
[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.700]   I mean, if you can imagine a four hour conversation
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:06.780]   that I was kind of sorry to see,
[01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:09.020]   and that's what it's like to hang out with Bobbie
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:10.940]   with Robert Well and for an afternoon.
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:12.340]   It was really wonderful.
[01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:14.700]   - Okay, I'm accepting votes from the chat room now.
[01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:19.260]   Do you want to see the Apple Store dance by the little kid?
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:22.140]   Or is that just going to make you upset and angry?
[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:24.380]   - In three.
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:26.660]   - Two.
[01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:27.500]   - Nice to have a ride.
[01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:28.820]   - In the Apple Store.
[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:30.780]   Doing a dance for you.
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:31.620]   - Uh huh.
[01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:32.460]   - Yeah, you.
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:36.660]   - Yep, I will be dancing to dance with me
[01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:38.980]   by Pitbull and Liz.
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:39.820]   Here we go.

[01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:58.300]   but I think he wants to be the next Rebecca Black.
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:00.300]   (laughing)
[01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:02.660]   And by the way, nobody is looking at him.
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:05.820]   Apparently this happens so often in Apple Store
[01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:08.620]   is that, didn't I just Dean do this?
[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:11.100]   Nobody's not even, they're not even just like, yum, what?

[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:30.100]   where are the guys?
[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:30.940]   - That's the three, when I do it,

[01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:49.620]   - Uh, she's back.
[01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:54.620]   ♪ Nobody's going to get it, yeah ♪
[01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:56.100]   - Somebody's saying in the chat room,
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:58.580]   can I please have my three minutes back?
[01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:01.780]   No refunds, no returns.
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:03.100]   This is Mac Break Weekly.
[01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:04.300]   We are gonna talk about
[01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:09.140]   onible.com, my friends, the source of,
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:10.140]   is he still dancing?
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:16.980]   The source of audio books that you will love forever.
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:18.420]   I'm listening to The Dreaming Void right now
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:19.260]   by Peter F. Hamilton,
[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:22.220]   and I cannot believe how good it is.
[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:24.980]   Andy Inako, I'm sure you've got some wonderful book
[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.420]   to recommend for us.
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:30.020]   - Yes, and this was after listening to Pina Fe
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:31.940]   on NPR the other day.
[01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:33.740]   You probably heard about our new book, Bossy Pants.
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:34.740]   - Bossy Pants.
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:37.300]   - Which is just, it's exactly the sort of,
[01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:39.460]   when you have a famous, funny person write a book,
[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:42.340]   this is the sort of book you want them to write.
[01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:44.060]   You want them at the top of their career
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:46.300]   when they're still very, very happy and optimistic
[01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:48.700]   and surrounded by all the blessings in life
[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:51.220]   and able to see all the humor and good cheer
[01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:53.780]   in the path that their life has taken them thus far.
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:55.860]   So it's just a series, it's not really a memoir,
[01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:58.060]   it's not even a book, not a behind the scenes look
[01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:01.380]   at 30 Rock or any of the shows that she's ever been involved in.
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:04.420]   It's just a series of really, really funny,
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:07.220]   true to life essays taken from all kinds of components
[01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:11.300]   from her life, ranging from Second City, 30 Rock,
[01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:15.500]   starting out live to just reacting to people on the internet
[01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:18.660]   and just doing things like photo shoots,
[01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:22.300]   how unreal it is to actually be treated
[01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:24.420]   as though you are the prom king, queen,
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:26.780]   and all the auditors put together.
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:32.060]   There's so many, Audible gets just about every celebrity memoir
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:34.180]   that gets, I guess, published, gets promoted.
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:35.940]   But you know what I'm talking about here,
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:38.740]   when I tell you that I'd describe these books
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:42.060]   where this person had a hit movie or like was an A-list actor
[01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:45.540]   about 10 or 15 years ago, or he or she was on a big hit TV
[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:48.700]   show about 15 years ago, and now they really,
[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:52.180]   they haven't worked in about 10 or 10 years
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:53.820]   and they're all bitter about it.
[01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:56.500]   And then they suddenly say, "Okay, now's the time
[01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.700]   "I start telling the stories about when I was struggling
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:00.260]   "on the air a week ago."
[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:03.220]   - I can't wait to read this actually.
[01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:06.860]   - They're gonna find out exactly what a bastard Gavin McLeod
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:08.580]   was on the low set.
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:10.700]   He was never kind towards me.
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:12.340]   - I wish he would touch, so she doesn't talk a lot
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:14.260]   about 30 Rock, that's too bad, 'cause it's one of the--
[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:16.740]   - She does, she does, there's a chapter two about it
[01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:18.140]   and obviously she has nice things to say
[01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:20.260]   about the cast of the Rogers and stuff like that.
[01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:21.100]   - Sorry to tell you about that.
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:24.860]   - It's not like, I guess the, another recommendation
[01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:27.980]   that would be comparable would be Born Standing Up
[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:29.780]   by Steve Martin, where the whole point was to have
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:31.940]   very serious and really interesting dissection,
[01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:34.580]   but here is a period in my life when I was building my act
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:37.140]   and took it to the height of standup comedy
[01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:38.780]   and then why I left it.
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:42.620]   This is more like, she came up with a couple dozen ideas
[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:45.140]   of things that she could write humorous things about
[01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:46.980]   and damn, they're funny.
[01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:47.820]   - She's right.
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:49.780]   - Just listen to the sentience right by her,
[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:51.620]   it's right by Tina Fey herself and of course,
[01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:52.900]   she's a perfect match for her.
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:54.980]   And if you're a fan of 30 Rock, you can't imagine,
[01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:57.260]   this is Liz Lemon talking about her life,
[01:23:57.260 --> 01:23:59.820]   'cause she's absolutely-- - Is she still a thing?
[01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:01.700]   If you're looking for a spiritual allegory
[01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:04.500]   in the style of C.S. Lewis, I guess you could piece
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:07.300]   something together with Lauren Michaels as a symbol for God
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:10.420]   and my struggles with hair removal as a metaphor for virtue.
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:11.260]   (laughing)
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:12.620]   - Okay, that's enough.
[01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:15.580]   - I can't wait, Tina Fey reads "Bossly Pants."
[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:17.180]   Now, here's the reason we're mentioning this,
[01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:18.420]   you can get this for free.
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:20.100]   - I see about audible books, they play everywhere.
[01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:22.260]   Of course, I'm playing it on the computer right now,
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:24.580]   but you could play it on your iPhone, your iPod,
[01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:27.580]   your iPad, your Zoom, if you've got one.
[01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:30.620]   A Kindle, many GPS devices, pretty much anywhere.
[01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:31.860]   I'm playing it on my Sonos now.
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:34.420]   Sonos has just added airplay capability,
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:37.380]   which is so fantastic, so I can airplay it
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:39.100]   from my phone to my Sonos.
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:41.060]   - You know, I first had my long experience
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:42.500]   with a Ford Sync.
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:43.660]   - Yeah. - And I literally,
[01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:46.700]   I walked in, I got your email, he said, "Wow!"
[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:48.300]   I was like, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:50.260]   "I turned the car on and it started playing my audio book."
[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:51.660]   - Isn't it awesome? - Like, I didn't even touch
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:52.500]   anything. - I don't even think
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:53.340]   it started playing an audio book.
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:54.540]   I was like, "Oh, I need to get a Ford."
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:56.020]   - I love it. - This is not a Ford end,
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:57.300]   but it works really well.
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:58.340]   It works really well.
[01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:00.300]   Oh, damn, how do you get back in here?
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:02.540]   - Yeah, it's out. - Oh, no, oh, no, he's back!
[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:04.100]   (screaming)
[01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:06.540]   It works very well with your Ford, with your...
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:09.060]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:10.580]   It works very...
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:12.700]   Apparently, he's getting the geniuses involved now.
[01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:14.500]   It works very well with your Ford,
[01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:17.820]   with your anything you can listen to.
[01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:19.620]   - No, when you're driving, it's just a contest.
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:20.460]   - It's just a contest.
[01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:22.900]   - For covering, you know, I have it on my Honda.
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:24.780]   When I clean, that's my big one.
[01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:25.820]   - Audible, tuck.
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:27.740]   - Cleaning and yard work, that's one Audible.
[01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:28.980]   - Slash, mag break.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:33.180]   - This kid's actually not too bad.
[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:34.980]   I like the slow-mo.
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:37.340]   He's like, really putting some effort into this.
[01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:40.140]   - He's cabin-packing, he's pop-up against the--
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:41.340]   - This is obviously something he's been doing
[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:42.340]   in the mirror for quite some time.
[01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:43.900]   - I think he practiced.
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:46.740]   - Oh, I think he practiced.
[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:47.740]   It's kind of cute.
[01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:50.500]   And it kind of--
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:51.340]   - How many views?
[01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:52.180]   I just want to know how many views.
[01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:53.020]   - Oh, let's see.
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:53.860]   That's actually good.
[01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:54.700]   - That's really interesting.
[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:56.020]   - Audible, 208,000, that's nothing.
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:58.900]   Although, Rebecca Black has now knocked Justin Bieber
[01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:03.980]   off the list of most watched videos with 11,
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:05.860]   something like 11 million views.
[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.700]   - I just, no, I'm sorry, 11 million.
[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:12.140]   - 100, 11 million, I left out at zero.
[01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:16.500]   - I just want to say that the fact that a 12-year-old,
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.820]   however old he is, 12, 15-year-old kid,
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:21.140]   went in an Apple store and turned on an eyesight
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:25.060]   and got 200,000 views should terrify folks in Hollywood.
[01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:26.060]   - Yeah, that does.
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:27.180]   - To try and desperately figure out
[01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:29.420]   why people watch this crap.
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:31.500]   Wait a minute, we just spent millions of dollars
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:34.380]   for Game of Thrones and this kid's got more views.
[01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:36.340]   But what do we have to do here?
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:38.700]   Audible.com/Macbreakby-the-way,
[01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:41.180]   if you did watch Game of Thrones on HBO,
[01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:45.380]   stop and get the freaking book on Audible, all of them.
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:47.460]   Just like four or five of them.
[01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:50.100]   And read the book before you watch the movie.
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:51.180]   So much better.
[01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:52.780]   I mean, it's okay, they did a nice job.
[01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:54.380]   It's kind of the, it's good to watch
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:55.700]   if you've already read the book.
[01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:57.140]   'Cause then it's kind of like, oh yeah, I remember that.
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:58.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:00.180]   But really, it's not so chaotic.
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:01.980]   It's hard.
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:02.820]   - I'm hard.
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:03.640]   - Did you watch it?
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:04.480]   - No, it's on stars.
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:05.320]   - First of all, I don't have stars.
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:06.160]   - No, it's not on stars, HBO.
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:07.080]   - Is it on HBO?
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:07.920]   - Yeah, never mind.
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:09.460]   - Debut, this Sunday.
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:11.140]   I like Sword and Sursary.
[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:12.900]   First of all, a lot of gratuitous nudity.
[01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:15.460]   Oh, that'll, that'll, I hate it when that happens, don't you?
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:17.820]   Your clothes just seem to fall off all the time.
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:19.620]   And then, or see, I'm serious.
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:20.980]   - That's like a we are HBO.
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:22.420]   - Yeah, it's kind of their trademark, isn't it?
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:23.820]   - We are HBO, we are HBO, we can put.
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:24.760]   - Yeah.
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:27.900]   We can say bad words and take clothes off like us.
[01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:29.900]   - Can't do that on broadcast, can ya?
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:34.260]   - I think the book's better and sexier.
[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:36.380]   But anyway, that's just me.
[01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:37.180]   And it is on Audible.
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:38.500]   Audible.com/Macbreak,
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:39.740]   if you sign up for the gold account,
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:41.060]   you'll get your first book free.
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:43.340]   It's yours to keep forever.
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:45.140]   And, why there's so many good choices.
[01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:47.340]   I think a game of thrones would be a good choice too.
[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:50.780]   - You know what we didn't get to,
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:52.380]   and we probably should mention before we get to our picks
[01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:53.300]   of the week, but I don't want to,
[01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:56.380]   we did talk quite a bit about it on last Mac Break Weekly
[01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:58.380]   and on Twitch, which of course,
[01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:00.140]   or did we talk about it on the last Mac Break Weekly?
[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:01.460]   - No, Mac Break, it came before the--
[01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:04.540]   - Yeah, Final Cut 10.
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:07.860]   Apple gave us a preview at the Final Cut.
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:09.300]   - So many, 2000 people.
[01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:11.020]   - 2000 people at the NAB show.
[01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:12.420]   - 1700 people there watching.
[01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:15.260]   - Was a huge amount of concern from pros that I talked to
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:16.580]   that Apple might dumb this down,
[01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:18.140]   might do an iMovie with it.
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:20.300]   They did radically change the user interface,
[01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:23.380]   but both you and Larry Jordan seem to agree.
[01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:25.180]   And boy, Larry reassured a lot of people.
[01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:26.580]   I was talking to some editors who say,
[01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:29.180]   if Larry Jordan says it's okay, it's okay.
[01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:33.060]   Agreed that it was actually a really exciting change.
[01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:34.500]   And the best news for people like me,
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.500]   $299 in the App Store in June.
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:38.180]   - It's a complete rethinking of the process.
[01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:39.180]   I mean, I think that,
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:40.860]   people have been asking on the, what do I think,
[01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:42.100]   you know, on the IRC?
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:45.060]   And they didn't just rewrite the application.
[01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:47.220]   They had to rewrite it, of course, to make it 64-bit,
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:48.660]   to make sure that it's ready, you know,
[01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:51.540]   to incorporate what they wanted to do next.
[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:53.020]   And they didn't just rewrite it.
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:54.500]   - And it uses Grand Central Dispatch,
[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:57.220]   and you know, I mean, it really uses Apple's core technologies.
[01:28:57.220 --> 01:28:59.420]   - Right, and you know, this is, you know,
[01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:01.780]   it's fully integrated with the new operating system.
[01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:04.420]   It's fully ready to take full advantage of everything you have,
[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:07.460]   whether it's, you know, multi-processor, GPU, all the RAM.
[01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:09.860]   You know, so they, but that required a rewrite.
[01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:12.180]   And so then when they rewrote it, they also rethought it.
[01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.820]   And they had already,
[01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:16.180]   they'd already been rethinking the way iMovie worked.
[01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:19.380]   And it's clear that it has the same DNA as iMovie.
[01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:23.020]   Whether it's based on iMovie or not is no one knows.
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:26.460]   But it definitely has the same DNA as far as the interface,
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:29.220]   which is great if you're already using iMovie.
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:31.580]   Right now, when you went from iMovie to Final Cut,
[01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:33.380]   it was like going to two different,
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:35.940]   like it was like going from England to France.
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:37.340]   You know, it's like completely different language,
[01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:39.740]   completely different look, croissants.
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.060]   You know, anyway, so.
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:42.980]   - So it's a, you know, it's a, you know,
[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:45.220]   it's a stain for foreigners with a strange accent.
[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:46.060]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:47.460]   So it was just, it was very hard to integrate.
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:48.620]   You know, you just wanted to, you know,
[01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:50.420]   figure out where to get some, you know, anyway.
[01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:54.620]   So, so the issue is, is that they,
[01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:56.900]   they've really integrated all of that.
[01:29:56.900 --> 01:30:00.020]   So now there's a seamless move that the interface
[01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:03.460]   that you're used to in iMovie is just iMovie on steroids,
[01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:05.900]   where they're not limited by, let's keep it simple.
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:08.620]   Let's make, but what I will say is that,
[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:09.940]   while they're not limited to,
[01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:11.900]   we're only going to give you four choices.
[01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:15.340]   They did focus very, very heavily on workflow.
[01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:17.900]   What you didn't see Apple talking about
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:20.580]   during that event was features.
[01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:21.420]   I mean, there were a lot of features
[01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:22.260]   that they were pointing out,
[01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:23.580]   but what they were really focused on is,
[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:25.060]   how do we make this faster?
[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:26.380]   How do we make it easier?
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:28.700]   How do we make it so that you can get through a lot of data
[01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:30.500]   quickly and more effectively?
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:31.620]   And I think that they did a pretty good job.
[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:33.940]   Now, no one's going to know until we actually play with it.
[01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:34.860]   We're not going to get to see it.
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:37.140]   I'm not going to get to play with it until June.
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:40.660]   And so, so no one knows what it's,
[01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:41.820]   how it's really going to perform.
[01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:43.780]   I think it looks very promising,
[01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:46.780]   I think for short form, it's, it's going to be a home run,
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:47.940]   I think when you're talking about,
[01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:49.380]   I can't wait, I'm actually very excited,
[01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:52.420]   but I'm not your, I'm not your typical pro user, you know?
[01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:54.620]   There's a lot of things that they do, locking audio
[01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:57.460]   to the, to the video, grouping things that could make,
[01:30:57.460 --> 01:31:00.060]   making complex edits, especially short form edits,
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:02.020]   really easy and really, really, I mean,
[01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:04.660]   exponentially faster.
[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:06.300]   Now, we don't know what the other components,
[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:08.820]   like the color, the component, the motion,
[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:10.980]   I think a lot of us assume that,
[01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:13.580]   that the DVD Studio Pro is probably dead.
[01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:15.020]   I mean, Apple doesn't do plastic.
[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:16.820]   I don't think that we're going to see that.
[01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:20.060]   We saw secondary color correction in the new Final Cut.
[01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:21.180]   So you don't need built in?
[01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:22.900]   Which is where it, where it belongs.
[01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:24.940]   I mean, they took that technology and they put it in tight.
[01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:27.140]   I would be very surprised to see color.
[01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:28.660]   I think we're going to see motion because I don't think,
[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:29.980]   they didn't show us anything about motion.
[01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:31.620]   Motion's inexpensive anyway.
[01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:32.740]   I mean, it'd be an easy thing to make it
[01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:34.780]   a $99 product on the app store.
[01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:36.180]   That'd be sensible.
[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:38.980]   I'm, so the one thing that I'm missing is soundtrack.
[01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:42.100]   And I don't, you know, I don't, if I was going to guess,
[01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:44.180]   I would say soundtrack, motion and Final Cut
[01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:45.300]   would all survive.
[01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:46.460]   Separate.
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:49.220]   Soundtrack is probably the least likely.
[01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:51.580]   I could see compressor becoming export options
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:52.420]   out of Final Cut.
[01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:53.260]   Right.
[01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:54.100]   You know, not be a standalone application.
[01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:55.500]   It should be standalone though, don't, don't,
[01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:57.380]   some people use compressor standalone.
[01:31:57.380 --> 01:31:58.980]   Oh, I use compressor standalone.
[01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:00.620]   Although I have to admit that I--
[01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:02.580]   You could make that a $50.
[01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:03.500]   Part could, you could.
[01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:05.980]   And I have to, you know, I think that there's a lot
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:08.100]   of other standalone options that I usually prefer,
[01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:10.500]   but because it's shipped with Final Cut, it's usually easier.
[01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:13.820]   I mean, I do most of my compression in episode pro,
[01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:17.180]   which is a much more expensive, but much more specialized tool.
[01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:21.580]   But it's, so anyway, the, I think it's pretty exciting.
[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:23.180]   I mean, think when you combine this with,
[01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:24.500]   when you look at the new Final Cut
[01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:27.660]   and then you look at Thunderbolt and these drives,
[01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:30.580]   you're talking about having this crazy fast laptop.
[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:32.380]   You know, you could be sitting in the field doing things
[01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.340]   that are just, it's just really, it would be hard
[01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:36.660]   to even imagine being able to do 10 years ago.
[01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:39.020]   So, so I think that it's, I think it's really exciting.
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:41.980]   Of course, a Mac break studio, we are going to go crazy.
[01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:45.060]   The moment's released with videos and, you know,
[01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:46.220]   coverage and everything else.
[01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:49.500]   So we, we're really excited about it.
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:51.420]   And I do think the hard, the people that are going to have
[01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:55.300]   the hardest time with Final Cut X or 10 is,
[01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:57.020]   are the people who are going to be hot,
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:58.500]   are the people who do this every day,
[01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:01.660]   who know every shortcut, every piece of every, you know,
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:02.820]   all of those things.
[01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:04.260]   I think they're the ones that are going to have a hard time
[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:06.460]   because they no longer have that advantage.
[01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:08.100]   They no longer know what all the quick keys are.
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:11.220]   They no longer have a workflow that is particular
[01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:13.300]   and can get things done really quickly.
[01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:15.340]   I think people coming into the, into the market,
[01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:17.420]   I think are going to have a, people who are like me
[01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:19.940]   who understand how to edit, understand the rules of editing,
[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:21.780]   but don't necessarily know every keystroke.
[01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:22.620]   This is going to be good for us.
[01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:24.260]   People using iMovie, this is going to be good for us.
[01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:26.060]   People who want a less expensive editor
[01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:27.900]   that's very powerful are going to do well.
[01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:30.620]   I think the people at that top 1%, top 2%,
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:32.260]   it's going to be a painful transition.
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:34.100]   And I think some of them will go back to Abbot.
[01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:34.940]   - Yep.
[01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:37.420]   But I don't think Abbot really cares if it gains, you know,
[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:40.020]   I think, I think Abbot's market share will double.
[01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:43.620]   - What profit is a trillion dollar company?
[01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:44.460]   - It's going to make money.
[01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:48.580]   - To lose a few Walter Merches and gain the world.
[01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:50.340]   - I don't know if they'll necessarily lose Walter Merch.
[01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:53.620]   I think that I was told that by some folks
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:55.220]   that were at the infamous meeting,
[01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:56.620]   it was like 50 people or 100 people,
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:58.820]   that there were a lot of big film editors,
[01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:00.980]   who's who of film editors were there looking at it.
[01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:03.220]   And so I don't, you know--
[01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:04.420]   - If Walter's going to listen to them.
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:06.540]   - I'll tell you what happens is the big prize
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:07.900]   for Apple will be Walter Merch.
[01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:11.900]   If Walter Merch edits a feature film in the new Final Cut.
[01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:13.060]   - Game over, man.
[01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:14.420]   - No, it really is game over.
[01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:16.380]   I mean, it's going to be that, that, he is,
[01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:18.980]   but remember, he's who put Abbot on the mat.
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:21.540]   You know, he's the one, he's also who put Final Cut
[01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:22.380]   on the mat.
[01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:23.780]   - And every editor looks at, oh, no, he's definitely
[01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:25.500]   who put, it was called Mountain.
[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:29.940]   And so he is the market maker in the editing world.
[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:31.740]   And it'll just be, we should have him on sometime.
[01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:32.660]   - Love to, can you hear him?
[01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:33.500]   - He's a fan of him.
[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:34.340]   - He's a fan of film.
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:35.180]   - He is?
[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:36.020]   - Yeah.
[01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:37.020]   - I ran into him in Borters Bookstore.
[01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:39.660]   - Oh, next time you see him say, hey Walt, come on on.
[01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:40.500]   - Yeah, we'll see if we can--
[01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:41.340]   - We'd love to have you on the show.
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:42.180]   - It'd be great to have a cut up on a one
[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:43.420]   with your name written on it.
[01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:46.860]   - I'll write it on it right now.
[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:49.020]   - I'm not a video editor, but I was talking to a lot of people
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:52.540]   who do, like, just huge intense months of work that way.
[01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:53.780]   And they've been telling me that they've been actually
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:56.340]   looking for an excuse to move away from Abbot
[01:34:56.340 --> 01:34:57.580]   and towards Final Cut.
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:59.100]   There's something that three different people
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:00.900]   told me in separate conversations
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:03.380]   because they do like the, they love the,
[01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:05.580]   they, Abbot is the standard that,
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:07.420]   when they're trying to hire people to cut,
[01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:09.980]   or they probably studied on the Abbot system,
[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:12.700]   but they love the fact that Apple is actually listening to them
[01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:14.780]   when they have a problem with the product,
[01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:17.500]   or with getting certain materials.
[01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:19.900]   And Apple will actually listen and help with us.
[01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:22.260]   I have it as more like, eh, well, I'm sorry.
[01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:23.980]   Get nothing we can do for you.
[01:35:23.980 --> 01:35:26.900]   As a matter of fact, I also heard that one large, huge
[01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:31.540]   government agency is actually now going to be switching
[01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:33.660]   from Abbot to Final Cut.
[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:36.580]   And this is in an organization which they're not even allowed
[01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:40.900]   for security purposes to use Mac OS systems.
[01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:45.580]   But this organization that spends so much time producing,
[01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:48.420]   distributing video is just so much,
[01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:50.980]   that's such a preference for Final Cut,
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:53.100]   that they're just going to make the switch and just do it.
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:53.940]   - Interesting.
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:55.500]   - And what's really exciting is finally,
[01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:58.340]   we have three very different approaches to editing.
[01:35:58.340 --> 01:36:00.260]   You know, they all kind of looked the same
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:01.140]   for the last 10 years.
[01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:05.100]   And so, Premiere, Abbot, and Final Cut all were kind of moving
[01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:06.980]   towards almost the exact same editing.
[01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:09.820]   You know, just who do you happen to like?
[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:12.420]   Premiere, I think, is the integration with the other tools,
[01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:14.820]   Photoshop, After Effects.
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:18.220]   Audition is going to have some people go,
[01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:19.660]   Premiere is the only way to go.
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:22.540]   People who need scale, I need 10,000 to 50,000
[01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:26.460]   to 100,000 objects, you gotta use an Abbot for that.
[01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:27.300]   To date.
[01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:29.940]   And then people who want this new fangled thing
[01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:32.300]   that is super efficient and less expensive,
[01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:33.620]   you know, Final Cut's gonna be a great solution,
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:36.060]   but it's really finally given us a choice.
[01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:38.100]   It's the exact opposite of how we started this conversation
[01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:39.700]   with people copying the iPhone.
[01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:42.420]   It's people like really looking at three completely different
[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:45.700]   ways and people really having a great, you know,
[01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:48.740]   they're all great applications and that's the best part.
[01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:52.100]   - All right, well, so I did wanna mention that.
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:54.660]   There's also a story that we won't go into great detail
[01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:58.500]   but Adobe has in some ways capitulated on the flash issue
[01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:02.580]   by adding HTTP streaming, Apple's HTTP Live Streaming Standard
[01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:04.340]   to the Adobe Flash Media Server.
[01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:05.500]   That's good news for us.
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:06.340]   - It's very good news.
[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:09.620]   - And others who use the Flash Media encoder
[01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:13.500]   and streaming servers, I presume that our partners use stream
[01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:16.900]   and Justin.tv are using Flash servers
[01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:18.220]   'cause that's what they're serving.
[01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:19.540]   - I don't know if they're using it yet.
[01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:21.740]   - But have as a, an interesting trick.
[01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:23.060]   So we'll keep an eye on that.
[01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:26.540]   Meanwhile, time for our picks of the week and Alex,
[01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:28.860]   you dibs this week's pick.
[01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:30.380]   - I did this last night, I was like, I get to talk about
[01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:31.460]   this one.
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:35.100]   So this, someone, it's rare that one of our hosts
[01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:37.380]   will send out an email to everybody saying,
[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:39.060]   "I dibs this."
[01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:39.900]   - I dibs this.
[01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:44.740]   - So this is one of the coolest apps on the iPhone.
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:45.580]   - It's pretty cool.
[01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:47.580]   - So it's called Photosynth.
[01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:48.980]   Now, people have heard of Photosynth before.
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:51.980]   You can, so with Photosynth, you can,
[01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:55.060]   typically what happens is you can view it.
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:56.060]   They had a Photosynth viewer.
[01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:57.860]   Now this is by Microsoft by the way.
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:38:00.380]   So, and this is part of the Microsoft Research Group.
[01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:04.340]   They don't really make products,
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:05.860]   they just kind of noodle about.
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:08.740]   Some of the technologies will end up somewhere at times.
[01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:10.700]   - And they released them several years ago for Windows.
[01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:13.300]   - So they released, yeah, but this is a,
[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:14.660]   now they had a viewer on the Mac,
[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:15.740]   but what they didn't have is something
[01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:16.820]   that would actually take photos.
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:17.660]   And so what you can actually do.
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:21.780]   - I took this picture this last night of my front yard.
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:26.140]   And there is another program that'll do this 360,
[01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:28.900]   something 360 on the Mac around the iPhone.
[01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:31.140]   But this does actually, I think a little bit
[01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:31.980]   of a better job.
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:32.820]   - Here's the thing.
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:35.420]   - What I will say is that I would love to see
[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:39.460]   image warping, image equalization and some blending,
[01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:41.220]   which it doesn't do very much of.
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:43.940]   But what I will say though is that the interface,
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:44.780]   you hit tap to start.
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:45.700]   - It's very simple.
[01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:47.100]   - And then you just simply move it.
[01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:50.140]   And as soon as the little green dot goes outside
[01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:51.380]   of the area that you've already captured,
[01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:52.660]   it just captures another image.
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:53.500]   - Right.
[01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:57.940]   - And it's just, I just love the like fluid nature
[01:38:57.940 --> 01:39:02.940]   of capturing that is just, you know, it's just so,
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:05.580]   if I get this to work.
[01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:10.060]   - And here's, so I've captured a couple of these,
[01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:11.020]   you know, these images here.
[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:12.100]   And you just kind of move it around
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:13.500]   and it just keeps on snapping.
[01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:14.340]   - Yeah.
[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:15.180]   - And you can show people.
[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:16.020]   - It makes it, it makes a 3D.
[01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:17.540]   So you've you done a 3D of our studio?
[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:18.380]   You want me to?
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:19.220]   - I just started doing it.
[01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:20.060]   - Okay.
[01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:20.900]   - But anyway.
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:22.220]   - While you were talking, I was doing it on here too.
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:24.460]   - Yeah, so the point is that you need to do this.
[01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:25.900]   - As soon as you get outside of that region,
[01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:28.340]   choose that little green dot goes outside of the region.
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:29.260]   It takes another photo.
[01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:30.860]   And you do have to, you know, what you will see
[01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:33.100]   is some edging if you're creating parallax
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:34.060]   by moving the camera around.
[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:35.580]   So you do want to focus on having it
[01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:36.780]   but it's pretty accurate.
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:37.620]   - But it's pretty accurate.
[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:39.060]   - But it is, it's fairly accurate.
[01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:40.300]   It is, it's just a lot of fun.
[01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:41.460]   And it's free.
[01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:43.580]   People oftentimes say that I'm not the most
[01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:46.060]   Rugel recommender on Mac break.
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:47.900]   So every once in a while,
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:50.060]   I like to throw a free one to average out the system.
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:51.100]   - This is the other program,
[01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:52.740]   which is not free 360 panorama.
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:55.620]   And it's kind of okay, but it makes a lot of mistakes.
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:56.780]   I think this one does much better.
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:58.940]   - This one's a much, the disadvantage is
[01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:02.900]   you can only view it on Microsoft's site, right?
[01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:05.940]   You need to use a photos and player to view it back.
[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:08.180]   - Yeah, that's the only thing I don't like about it.
[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:10.740]   It will say the individual snapshots to your photo roll.
[01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:12.660]   So if you then want to use auto stitch
[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:14.140]   or something to stitch together.
[01:40:14.140 --> 01:40:16.260]   So even on that basis, it's a really,
[01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:19.180]   it's the easiest way to simply paint a whole scene
[01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:20.740]   to make sure you get full coverage
[01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:22.780]   then later on you can stitch it together.
[01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:24.540]   I really wish there was some way
[01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:27.180]   that I could save this thing locally
[01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:28.500]   where I don't have to publish it
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:30.220]   and share it with the entire world
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:32.260]   because they're, I mean, it's one thing
[01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:34.340]   when you're in the head of the Statue of Liberty.
[01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:36.180]   It's another thing when you're at a party or something
[01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:37.300]   or you're just at some place
[01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:39.500]   where you don't want the whole world to see here.
[01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:41.740]   Here are the 19 people I was with in this room
[01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:42.580]   at the time.
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:44.100]   - Yeah, there's no easy way to share that.
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:45.500]   - Yep, yeah.
[01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:47.660]   You can't tweet it or something like that.
[01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:49.660]   - Yeah, but I mean, it's a free app.
[01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:51.100]   It's part of the R&D group.
[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:52.260]   So they're just kind of noodling about it.
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:53.180]   Like, okay, we played with this
[01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:55.340]   and we're gonna throw it up and let you noodle with it.
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:56.420]   And then people like me will say,
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:58.140]   well, we really want this, this, this, and this.
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:41:00.020]   And hopefully lots of people give them that feedback
[01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:01.020]   and then they'll do whatever they do with it.
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:03.140]   But it's-- - Do you have any photosense
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:04.860]   we can show on here that you shot?
[01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:06.980]   - Yeah, I have on your site if I go to photosense.
[01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:09.540]   - I don't have any on my, you have to upload them.
[01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:11.820]   My premise is uploading them 'cause they're gigantic.
[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:13.460]   - I haven't, I've been doing the other photosense.
[01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:15.580]   So if you go to photosense, I think.com,
[01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:17.860]   I did, I have the opposite of this,
[01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:20.740]   which is you take pictures of a scene from different angles.
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:23.940]   If you do a search for Christ the Redeemer,
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:26.100]   you'll see when I actually took from a helicopter.
[01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:28.620]   So it's the opposite of this where we went around
[01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:32.540]   Christ the Redeemer with a helicopter in Rio de Janeiro.
[01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:35.740]   And I took a couple hundred photos with a 5D.
[01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:37.300]   - And not alone, by the way.
[01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:39.020]   There seems like there's quite a few people to say.
[01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:39.940]   - There's one way, you'll see.
[01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:40.980]   - And here's yours. - There's mine.
[01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:42.300]   And it's very Cynthia.
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:43.860]   Look, if you look at it, I'm very proud of this.
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:45.140]   - Oh. - Oh.
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:47.220]   - A little sad, unhappy puzzle piece.
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:49.940]   That means Silverlight has crashed a burn.
[01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:51.860]   - As it goes. - Oh, Silverlight,
[01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:54.020]   you broke my Macintosh.
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:55.940]   - You know, it's really cool.
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:58.060]   - I'll get, so I'll get the updated Silverlight.
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:41:59.860]   - But everybody can do this as an exercise at home.
[01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:02.660]   - There's a lot of us that have been playing with photos
[01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:05.340]   since because it creates this huge dot matrix
[01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:07.060]   to connect the all the images.
[01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:08.900]   And as a result, we're trying, a lot of us
[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:11.900]   try to strip the dots out to create 3D geometry.
[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:12.900]   'Cause it doesn't really work.
[01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:13.900]   - It does it really well.
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:14.900]   - It's doing a good job.
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:16.540]   - Yeah, and it's fun to look at it.
[01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:18.780]   It's free, it's fun, and it really does it.
[01:42:18.780 --> 01:42:19.860]   It's so much fun.
[01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:21.780]   And it's an experimentation.
[01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:25.300]   Photosynth is generally this big lab of people being able
[01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:26.980]   to capture experiential information
[01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:28.020]   and collaborate with it.
[01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:32.700]   And it's just really fun to see what that group is working on.
[01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:33.540]   - So.
[01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:36.420]   - And the inatko, your pick of the week.
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:37.820]   - I have two related things.
[01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:38.660]   Do we have time for two?
[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:39.500]   Or should I just go to one?
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:40.540]   - Go ahead.
[01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:43.460]   - Go ahead. - When has time ever impacted us?
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:45.500]   - Oh, when I was in Boulder,
[01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:48.300]   someone was carrying this case,
[01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:51.780]   which I decided is about the best iPad case I've ever seen.
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:52.700]   - I need it.
[01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:55.660]   - It's by Osprey, it's called the Vere.
[01:42:55.660 --> 01:43:00.660]   And it is almost exactly the right size for your iPad.
[01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:04.860]   - It's somewhere between a Fanny Pack and a backpack.
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:08.460]   - No, it's a regular like shoulder pad,
[01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:09.980]   shoulder strap. - Oh, okay, right.
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:11.260]   - You will be, although perhaps you've been--
[01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:13.260]   - Call those a messenger bag.
[01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:14.660]   - You might be bored. - You might be bored.
[01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:18.580]   - I'm from the hangover saying, it's called a satchel.
[01:43:18.580 --> 01:43:20.140]   - In the joke for one.
[01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:23.220]   - But see, it's exactly the sort of thing
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:25.460]   I've been needing for a long, long time.
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:28.060]   Where I just wanna go out to the basement place with a wifi
[01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:29.660]   and do some work, hang out for a little bit.
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:31.580]   I don't need to take my whole laptop bag.
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:35.180]   And also especially when I'm at conferences and stuff
[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:37.540]   where obviously I travel with my laptop bag,
[01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:39.780]   but I feel like an idiot because I've got this huge
[01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:42.140]   like laptop bag with just like,
[01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:43.860]   three pounds for the technology in it.
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:45.780]   This is small enough, you can actually sort of stuff it
[01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:47.980]   inside the magazine pouch or your laptop bag
[01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:51.420]   and sneak it on board as just one carry on item,
[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:52.620]   like all together.
[01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:55.140]   But it's got room for your water bottle,
[01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:58.540]   it's got pouch for your phone.
[01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:02.500]   It's not like form fitting so you can easily stuff
[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:04.340]   like your jacket and other stuff.
[01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:06.540]   And it's got a million like little tiny little pockets
[01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:08.460]   that are very in our organizers
[01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:10.060]   that are very, very well thought out.
[01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:12.580]   So in terms of I've got four hours inside this,
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:15.580]   inside this new city, I wanna take a long, long walk around.
[01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:16.940]   I've got my camera, got my water,
[01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:18.500]   got the things I'm gonna be walking around with.
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:21.540]   And I'm not unduly burdened down.
[01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:23.740]   It's just exactly what I was looking for.
[01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:25.460]   And it's only about 50 bucks.
[01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:26.500]   So it's pretty cool.
[01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:27.340]   I like that.
[01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:28.340]   It's not crazy, too.
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:32.300]   And it comes in wild salmon, panda and glacier.
[01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:34.140]   Definitely good for glacier.
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:35.860]   Twerp, paint and black.
[01:44:35.860 --> 01:44:38.500]   The second thing is kind of related.
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:40.500]   It's paid by, this is a,
[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:42.500]   I've been looking for a long time
[01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:46.180]   for a case for the Apple wireless keyboard
[01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:48.620]   because I travel with it all the time,
[01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:50.940]   whether it's just across the street
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:53.660]   or across the country or across the world,
[01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:55.740]   because whenever you wanna do serious writing,
[01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:57.660]   you're gonna need to have a real keyboard with it.
[01:44:57.660 --> 01:44:58.620]   And it kind of bothered me
[01:44:58.620 --> 01:45:01.500]   that I was just sort of tossing this bare keyboard
[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:03.700]   just in my bag unprotected.
[01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:04.980]   I always feared that I was gonna be
[01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:06.660]   start shirring off keycaps
[01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:09.060]   when I keep stuffing books and stuff inside my bag.
[01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:11.980]   So on a basic level, this is a really nice,
[01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:14.140]   very simple look folding folio
[01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:16.300]   that will just protect your keyboard.
[01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:18.500]   The keyboard connection will hold in with a couple of clips,
[01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:20.420]   but it's easy to take it out.
[01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:22.260]   Then, this is why,
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:24.980]   I almost wanted to give them the 30 bucks for this
[01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:28.340]   just as a reward for being really, really clever people.
[01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:30.180]   Because you don't have to take it out.
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:33.540]   What you can do is you simply take this,
[01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:35.180]   fold it back like this,
[01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:36.820]   put these two tabs together.
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:40.420]   And what you have is a stable typing stand
[01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:42.860]   for your tablet.
[01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:44.020]   - Whoa.
[01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:45.620]   - And not only that, but,
[01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:46.500]   so not only that,
[01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:48.460]   but it's the only thing that I found
[01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:49.580]   that's portable,
[01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:50.700]   will solve the problem of,
[01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:54.900]   yes, but how can I type with my iPad in my lap?
[01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:57.700]   Like if I'm at a keynote presentation or something,
[01:45:57.700 --> 01:45:59.060]   it's absolutely stable,
[01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:00.540]   it's very, very simple.
[01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:03.180]   And when you're not using it as a typing easel,
[01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:06.860]   it's literally a zero space solution
[01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:08.300]   because when you're done with it,
[01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:09.140]   you take it apart.
[01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:10.660]   And once again, it's just a simple,
[01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:13.860]   couldn't be simpler folding folio for your stand.
[01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:15.020]   That's only 29 bucks.
[01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:16.460]   - You hear that noise, that's money just going
[01:46:16.460 --> 01:46:18.620]   right out of my wallet.
[01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:19.820]   That is awesome.
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:21.660]   - That's how the order kind of work.
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:25.180]   - Yeah, so do you put that in your Osprey?
[01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:27.780]   Will it fit?
[01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:30.020]   - Of course, yes, I've got my Osprey in here.
[01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:32.460]   I've got another iPad in there.
[01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:34.100]   I don't fit in my car.
[01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:36.500]   - You practically have a laptop in there.
[01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:39.260]   - Yep, I pretty much got the entire world covered
[01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:40.580]   with just this one little bag.
[01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:43.380]   I mean, I've taken a certain amount of pride
[01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:46.660]   in seeing how successful I could be
[01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:48.620]   on my little trips without having to take
[01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:50.980]   as little taking as little stuff as possible.
[01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:52.900]   The crowning achievement was when I had it,
[01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:56.020]   I was giving a speaking thing in Philadelphia
[01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:57.700]   and it was just going to be an overnight.
[01:46:57.700 --> 01:46:58.740]   And I said, you know what?
[01:46:58.740 --> 01:47:00.540]   I'm not even going to take a piece of luggage.
[01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:02.580]   I'm just going to take my iPad case
[01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:05.420]   with a change of unmentionables on a toothbrush.
[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:07.380]   And that's all I'm going to be traveling with.
[01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:08.620]   And now it's going to be, no,
[01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:10.300]   I'm not even going to take the big iPad case.
[01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:11.980]   I'm going to take this little Osprey beer.
[01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:13.820]   I'm going to look as though I'm just running away from it.
[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:15.460]   You could almost like put at the end of a pole
[01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:18.100]   of your shoulder, pretend you're running away from home.
[01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:19.260]   That's how small it is.
[01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:20.700]   - 29.95. - 29.95.
[01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:21.780]   - 29.95. - In case.
[01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:23.260]   I like in case. - Yeah, it's stuff actually.
[01:47:23.260 --> 01:47:25.060]   - Yeah, extremely well thought.
[01:47:25.060 --> 01:47:27.580]   - You really, anyone, I'm sure that there are people
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:30.220]   at Apple who are like, damn, I wish that I could say
[01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:31.420]   that we designed that.
[01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:34.540]   - It's just such a clever idea.
[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:38.600]   - My pick of the week is only 111 gigabytes.
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:42.100]   $50.
[01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:44.820]   And if you do not run out and buy it immediately,
[01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:46.060]   you will deeply regret it.
[01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:48.460]   Of course, I need say no more.
[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:52.020]   I'm talking about Portal 2.
[01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:57.140]   Now available on Steam and you know what?
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:47:57.980]   It's on the Mac.
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:48:00.180]   - Hello, investors, Cave Johnson here.
[01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:01.500]   Now I know you've sunk a lot of money
[01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:03.060]   into the dual portal device,
[01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:03.900]   but I'm here to tell you,
[01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:05.540]   we're not banging rocks together over here.
[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:07.900]   We know how to make a quantum space hole.
[01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:11.340]   Carolyn, see, Portal here or there?
[01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:13.340]   Look at this thing go.
[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:18.820]   Now, we have run into a reproducible human error problem.
[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:20.740]   Lot of expensive equipment getting broken.
[01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:22.980]   But don't worry, Cave took care of it.
[01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:26.740]   Gentlemen, I give you the long fall boot.
[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:28.500]   Think of it as a space suit of armor
[01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:30.180]   for the portal device.
[01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:32.940]   I'm not gonna lie to you, it's expensive as hell.
[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:34.260]   Check this out.
[01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:36.100]   We told this chest subject to just go ahead
[01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:37.700]   and try to land on our hands.
[01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:42.940]   - I cannot wait.
[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:44.060]   It's downloading right now.
[01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:45.260]   - All right, show you the game.
[01:48:45.260 --> 01:48:46.980]   - So anyway, we're between banks right now.
[01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:48.500]   Just make those checks out to cash.
[01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:50.300]   Cave Johnson, we're done here.
[01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:52.660]   - Portal two on Steam.
[01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:56.540]   And I'll tell you, as soon as Steam came out for Mac and Tasha,
[01:48:56.540 --> 01:48:58.820]   I was so happy 'cause it really gives us parity in many ways.
[01:48:58.820 --> 01:49:00.820]   And this is an example where this game came out.
[01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:04.100]   Mac, Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,
[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:05.940]   all at the same time, and we were not left out.
[01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:08.540]   And let me tell you, if you haven't played Portal 1,
[01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:11.460]   play it and then play Portal 2.
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:13.060]   Have you played Portal 1?
[01:49:13.060 --> 01:49:16.300]   - I am just trying to stay in the top 10,000 in Angry Birds.
[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:17.940]   - Forget it.
[01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:19.260]   - I woke up this morning.
[01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:20.100]   - I woke up this morning.
[01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:22.900]   - You know, we ranked at 11,000 and I was like,
[01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:23.820]   (grunts)
[01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:25.660]   and then there was like a 15 or two.
[01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:26.500]   - 10 of you, nine of you,
[01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:27.340]   and I pushed myself.
[01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:29.100]   - You were a homeless free time.
[01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:31.540]   - I pushed myself back to 9,000.
[01:49:31.540 --> 01:49:34.220]   - It's not 110 gigabytes, I'm sorry, it's 11 gigabytes.
[01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:36.140]   But it was too much for me to put on my MacBook Air
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:39.620]   with a 64 gigabyte hard drive and nothing free.
[01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:42.580]   So, or even actually on my MacBook Pro,
[01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:44.900]   which is pretty much done, I think as well.
[01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:48.740]   So, it'll be running on the big machine a little later tonight.
[01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:51.660]   - I'm just excited when I have 15 gigs on my computer.
[01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:52.500]   I feel like it's--
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:53.860]   - I know, I know.
[01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:56.460]   And so when a game is 11 gigs,
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:58.060]   you kind of look at it, it's cross-eyed.
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:00.740]   That's, I don't know if I can put it on there.
[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:02.580]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:50:02.580 --> 01:50:04.860]   - Hey, thank you Alex Lindsey for joining us.
[01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:07.420]   Alex is of course the man in charge of the Pixel Core.
[01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:10.540]   - We are having so much fun next door.
[01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:12.140]   - You are next door, are you moved in?
[01:50:12.140 --> 01:50:13.700]   - We're almost moved in.
[01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:15.860]   - Alex is gonna be in the new studio.
[01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:17.220]   - We got the green screen, we're painting it right now.
[01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:18.700]   - I saw it, I looks good, the code looks good.
[01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:20.020]   - We've got, you see, we got the little--
[01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:20.860]   - I saw the lighting rig.
[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:23.100]   - We're gonna have, lighting room, and we have,
[01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:25.220]   we can do black curtains, so we can do Charlie Rose.
[01:50:25.220 --> 01:50:26.820]   - Sure, that's awesome.
[01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:28.740]   - And I'm building a set, what was I thinking?
[01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:29.820]   (laughing)
[01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:31.380]   - Yeah, I'm like black green screen, like--
[01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:32.480]   - You got a green screen in a black curtains,
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:33.380]   you got all you need.
[01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:36.380]   - Exactly, I'm simple to learn.
[01:50:36.380 --> 01:50:38.060]   One of these days, I'll learn.
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:40.140]   - Instant studio, just add three cans of paint.
[01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:40.980]   - Yeah.
[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:43.180]   - Hey, by the way, I'm gonna be speaking in San Rafael,
[01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:45.980]   May 13th, on the 3D Advertising Summit.
[01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:48.620]   So I'm gonna talk about 3D compositing on set,
[01:50:48.620 --> 01:50:49.620]   if anyone's in San Rafael.
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:50.460]   - Oh, that's neat.
[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:53.660]   - And it's, the, I am the most least interesting person
[01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:54.820]   speaking there.
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:58.220]   There's guys, I mean, just some of the top guys
[01:50:58.220 --> 01:51:00.460]   in stereo production are all speaking
[01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:01.540]   at the 3D Advertising Summit.
[01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:05.060]   It's, you can go to kurner.com to find out more about it.
[01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:07.380]   But I just, it's funny, there were guys next to me
[01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:09.660]   on the picture, on, on, when they're announcing it,
[01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:11.900]   his grand hander sent, and I just took a class from him.
[01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:13.580]   And he knows a lot more about it than I do.
[01:51:13.580 --> 01:51:15.820]   I felt like, am I really on this panel?
[01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:17.420]   - So, what is that?
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:18.740]   - So anyway, oh, no, that's great.
[01:51:18.740 --> 01:51:19.780]   - This is my event.
[01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:21.100]   I'm doing it the next day.
[01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:22.060]   Ted X Marin.
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:22.900]   - Wow.
[01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:26.460]   - In San Rafael, I'll be moderating the next Ted X in Marin.
[01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:27.300]   - Where is it?
[01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:28.140]   - In the same area.
[01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:28.980]   - Where is it?
[01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:30.820]   - It's gonna be on the Communication Revolution.
[01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:33.940]   - The Canbar, where's the Canbar Center for performing arts?
[01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:35.220]   - Canbar Center for the performing arts?
[01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:37.540]   I have no idea, but I better find out before May 12th.
[01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:41.820]   Well, now you have a reason to come into San Rafael.
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:43.260]   San Rafael's a great place, no matter what,
[01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:44.420]   I used to live there.
[01:51:44.420 --> 01:51:47.220]   But now you have the 12th and the 13th.
[01:51:47.220 --> 01:51:49.060]   - It's gonna be fun, I love, yeah, I really--
[01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:50.580]   - Come to San Rafael and make a week of it.
[01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:53.180]   John Perry Barlow will be there, I'll be there.
[01:51:53.180 --> 01:51:54.760]   I'm also going to, did you know this?
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:56.020]   I'm going to France.
[01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:58.380]   - I've been there.
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:51:59.380]   - You were just there.
[01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:00.220]   - Where in France?
[01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:02.020]   - I got an invitation in the mail yesterday
[01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:03.340]   from President Sarkozy.
[01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:05.980]   (laughing)
[01:52:05.980 --> 01:52:07.060]   All I gotta say is,
[01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:08.780]   well played, well played.
[01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:10.940]   - It's funny when you get this big envelope that says,
[01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:14.300]   from the President de la Republique,
[01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:19.460]   to, and by the way, I am the Fonditer de Tuit El Else.
[01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:20.620]   I don't know what a Fonditer is,
[01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:22.940]   but I like it better than Chief Tuit.
[01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:26.300]   So I'm apparently being invited to the EG8 forum,
[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:30.780]   which is a forum of internet entrepreneurs and CEOs
[01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:34.180]   a few days before the G8, Sarkozy,
[01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:37.180]   who's hosting the G8 in Doville a couple of days later,
[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:39.820]   wanted to bring people together to talk about
[01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:40.980]   the internet and government,
[01:52:40.980 --> 01:52:43.220]   and what governments should know about the internet.
[01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:44.060]   So--
[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:44.940]   - And what French has stopped doing?
[01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:46.300]   Are you going to watch a lot of tell 'em now?
[01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:47.140]   - Yes.
[01:52:47.140 --> 01:52:47.980]   (laughing)
[01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:48.900]   I couldn't, you know, I couldn't,
[01:52:48.900 --> 01:52:50.140]   it's like, how can you say no to this?
[01:52:50.140 --> 01:52:52.020]   Because, you know, they're asking, of course,
[01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:53.820]   all the other heavy hitters,
[01:52:53.820 --> 01:52:55.780]   but here I am this little guy.
[01:52:55.780 --> 01:52:56.620]   - I'm thinking of--
[01:52:56.620 --> 01:52:57.460]   - And I want to tell them,
[01:52:57.460 --> 01:52:58.700]   protect our freaking internet.
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:01.140]   Freaking internet.
[01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:03.020]   So anyway, so I don't know if you can come to that.
[01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:04.500]   - I don't think you can. - When is it?
[01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:06.660]   It's May 24th, 25th in P&E.
[01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:08.660]   - I'll be in Japan. - I'll be in Japan.
[01:53:08.660 --> 01:53:09.500]   Oh, shut up. - I think I have
[01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:11.500]   some really great speed pens there.
[01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:12.500]   (laughing)
[01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:14.660]   I would steal lots of pens.
[01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:16.980]   - I think they believed it when I said
[01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:19.860]   I was the president of the internet on my about me page.
[01:53:19.860 --> 01:53:20.700]   So they invited me.
[01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:21.540]   - Call the president.
[01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:22.380]   Who are we gonna have to talk about it?
[01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:24.220]   - Call the president. - Call the president.
[01:53:24.220 --> 01:53:26.060]   - Do you have a time to have a sash made?
[01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:27.460]   - I should get a sash.
[01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:29.700]   - That's great.
[01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:34.500]   - Andy Inako is the guy at the Chicago Sun Times, man.
[01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:35.700]   He writes such great stuff there.
[01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:38.540]   And of course on his own blog,
[01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:41.900]   which is www.c-dub-ob.com.
[01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:44.940]   Thank you for being here in your little dog spot.
[01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:46.300]   - Shush, shush, shush.
[01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:47.820]   - A friend's dog, a friend's dog.
[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:49.220]   - My canine nephews.
[01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:51.660]   - Shush, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.
[01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:52.580]   - Shush, shush, shush, shush.
[01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:53.420]   - Spotify. - Spotify useful
[01:53:53.420 --> 01:53:56.180]   when Leo asks pressing questions.
[01:53:56.180 --> 01:53:57.180]   - Yeah. - About electronics
[01:53:57.180 --> 01:53:58.620]   that Andy and Mary not have.
[01:53:58.620 --> 01:53:59.740]   - Andy and Mary not have. - That's when we know
[01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:01.420]   that that's why Andy has a dog.
[01:54:01.420 --> 01:54:02.260]   - I actually did not ask you--
[01:54:02.260 --> 01:54:03.300]   - This track shows the wonder dog.
[01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:05.060]   - I did not ask you about your review
[01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:09.060]   of the Blackberry playbook, which you have, and I don't.
[01:54:09.060 --> 01:54:11.660]   - I can talk about it now.
[01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:16.060]   It's probably going to be more of a preview
[01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:18.740]   than a real review, 'cause there's a lot about this
[01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:19.980]   I really, really like.
[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:22.860]   And I feel as though, given that they've promised
[01:54:22.860 --> 01:54:26.260]   a couple of final elements to come in a couple of months,
[01:54:26.260 --> 01:54:28.620]   I'm not gonna give absolute final judgment.
[01:54:28.620 --> 01:54:31.700]   So very soon I'm gonna be having my review of this,
[01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:37.700]   of the LG, and I'll probably mention the Blackberry with it.
[01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:40.340]   - You know, I just ordered my next Android phone,
[01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:44.180]   which is the G2X LG Optimus 2X from T-Mobile.
[01:54:44.180 --> 01:54:45.940]   I'm excited about that, that's got a Tegra.
[01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:48.380]   - I really want-- - See, one definite thing.
[01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:50.500]   You know, you can argue about the technology,
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:52.420]   you can argue about the presence of apps and stuff flash.
[01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:54.580]   You gotta admit that Android phones,
[01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:56.540]   they have very satisfying names.
[01:54:56.540 --> 01:54:57.540]   - They do.
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:55:00.540]   - This is the-- - The NG in Victor X2.
[01:55:00.540 --> 01:55:02.900]   - At least they got freaking names.
[01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:04.540]   - But a lot of those commercials kind of scare me.
[01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:05.380]   - I know, I know.
[01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:06.500]   - I know, those are the Motorola Droid,
[01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:08.900]   or the Verizon Droid ads, I hate those.
[01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:10.580]   I think they've gotten off of that.
[01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:13.620]   - Good, Andy, thank you for being here.
[01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:17.660]   We'll get more of a playbook review next week,
[01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:20.100]   'cause I'm getting mine supposedly today.
[01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:21.740]   I have to say, the very fact that you have to have
[01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:24.140]   a Blackberry to get email or have a calendar kind
[01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:26.180]   of turns me off, we'll see.
[01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:28.060]   - Yeah, I think that's when those things are gonna fix
[01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:29.340]   the couple months, there's been so many--
[01:55:29.340 --> 01:55:31.060]   - Six months, yeah, I paid for it for,
[01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:33.900]   I bought it next coming today, not in a couple months.
[01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:37.220]   - Thank you, Andrew.
[01:55:37.220 --> 01:55:38.660]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:42.060]   Do we have any more plugs, anybody else going anywhere else?
[01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:43.900]   - On the 24th of May, I'm getting my own new--
[01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:44.740]   - We're getting buy-out and getting three panels
[01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:47.220]   at the Boston Comic Con at the end of the month.
[01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:49.220]   - Oh, cool, that'll be fun.
[01:55:49.220 --> 01:55:50.060]   Boston Comic Con.
[01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:51.620]   - And to me. - Boston Comic Con.
[01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:53.300]   - My God, if you're in New England,
[01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:54.300]   they have such a--
[01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:58.180]   - Every, like you look at the guest list for San Diego Con
[01:55:58.180 --> 01:56:00.860]   and you think, gee, I probably can't see all the great guests,
[01:56:00.860 --> 01:56:02.980]   but here are the 18 that I would really, really,
[01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:04.500]   really like to fly out to see.
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:06.900]   They got those 18 plus four more.
[01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:09.500]   They got Adam Hughes, they got Frank Cho,
[01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:11.340]   they got Frank Quietly, who are gonna be interviewing
[01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:13.500]   on stage, they got Neil Adam, who are gonna be interviewing
[01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:15.660]   on stage, they've got like so, oh.
[01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:16.980]   (groaning)
[01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:17.820]   - What are the dates on that?
[01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:20.220]   - All the money that I was going to spend
[01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:22.180]   like on airfare hotels, I can now spend
[01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:24.700]   more comics at the show, can be both of you.
[01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:26.500]   (laughing)
[01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:28.580]   - Thank you, Andrew, thank you.
[01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:29.540]   When is it, Andy?
[01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:33.540]   - The last weekend, it's like April 29th, 30th,
[01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:35.500]   and there's a 31st in April, the 31st.
[01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:36.420]   - And, well.
[01:56:36.420 --> 01:56:37.260]   - Made first, maybe.
[01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:40.820]   - Okay, we are gonna cover Dragon Con in September
[01:56:40.820 --> 01:56:42.780]   and I guess Comic Con in San Diego, is that over?
[01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:43.620]   No.
[01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:44.500]   - No, we're hoping-- - That's just coming up.
[01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:45.940]   - That's July, we're gonna cover that, yeah.
[01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:47.020]   - Secret.
[01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:47.860]   - Secret.
[01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:50.340]   I know, I wanna, I'm trying to convince Lisa that we spent
[01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:51.900]   so much money on the studio.
[01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:52.860]   I don't know if we can go to SIGGRAPH.
[01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:56.620]   That's in Vancouver next in July.
[01:56:56.620 --> 01:56:59.100]   - It's in, I think it's a very last week of July,
[01:56:59.100 --> 01:56:59.940]   or first week of August.
[01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:01.020]   - I really wanna do that.
[01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:02.020]   - 'Cause I love Vancouver.
[01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:04.620]   - It's like even the geekier version than any being.
[01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:05.460]   - Yeah, I know.
[01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:07.940]   - I have to go play Portal 2.
[01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:09.700]   We'll see you all next time, get back to work now.
[01:57:09.700 --> 01:57:11.100]   Break time is over!
[01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:13.700]   (upbeat music)
[01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:16.280]   (upbeat music)
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:18.860]   (upbeat music)
[01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:21.440]   (upbeat music)
