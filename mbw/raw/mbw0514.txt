[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.200]   curse.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:13.560]   That's the first day of the year.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:36.080]   And who's a separate legal entity from the British Queen?
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:51.360]   You may have seen him in kinky boots.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:05.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.160]   It is not by the way I book Re says Federation Day.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.480]   It's confederation day.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.960]   We no longer have the British North America Act.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.640]   We have to wing it on this whole confederation.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.080]   You know, here in this country, confederation is not a good word.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:33.520]   Well in your country, liberal doesn't seem to be a good thing either.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.760]   Are you planning to exit from the EU?
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.760]   We Brexit it early.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.760]   We Brexit it late.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.760]   I don't know.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.760]   Quebec keeps trying to can exit.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.760]   You want to keep exit?
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.760]   That's right.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.600]   They had two referendums when I was a kid.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   I remember.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.160]   And they lost by, I think, 49 or 48%.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.160]   Close.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.880]   I thought it meant we would break off from the country and hopefully go someplace warmer
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.880]   like the Caribbean.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.880]   Float south.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.880]   I was really forward.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.880]   Yes.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.880]   Next to Jamaica.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.880]   Just park us there.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.880]   More snow.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.480]   It would be such a great platform.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.120]   But then you'd have to get a third queen.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.560]   No, she's queen of Jamaica too.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.560]   Perfect.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.560]   Perfect.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.360]   It's all in the cards.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.000]   I like how this is coming together.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.320]   You're going to have to change so much money when Charles becomes king.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.320]   My god.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.720]   Do they do that?
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.840]   Do they put the reigning monarch on?
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.560]   I know the queen is on a couple.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.040]   Like the queen is on the dollar bill but we don't have a dollar bill anymore.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.560]   And she's on the coins.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.000]   So I mean, we changed.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.880]   I think Laurier is on the five and people keep turning him into spots.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.360]   We had to have the government ask for the spot.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.360]   I remember that.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.360]   We're a fun.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.440]   Is this part of that same institutional cultural problem where you had two football
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.520]   teams called the Rough Riders in the same league?
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.520]   Yes.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.800]   We had seven teams two of which were called the Rough Riders.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.760]   I'm not saying it indicates a problem.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.560]   I'm saying that that indicates something unique and wonderful about the Canadian national
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.560]   character.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.760]   They were two leagues that joined.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.480]   Each league had a Rough Riders and no one was like Sam Steele staring at you across the
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.480]   border.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.480]   No one was willing to flinch.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.920]   I'm pleased to say that a Google search for Canadian Spock money actually delivers.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:23.880]   He really does have that luck, doesn't he?
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.120]   Please sit down to this.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.280]   Can you find like the wizard?
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.320]   I hope there was an actual press conference in which the treasure had to say, "God, come
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.320]   on."
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.240]   He worked hard on that portrait.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.240]   He stopped turning into Spock.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.920]   The hoser stopped turning him into Spock.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.560]   The Bank of Canada feels that writing and markings on bank notes are inappropriate as
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.880]   they are a symbol of our country and a source of national pride.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.600]   Now there are sources of international pride.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.160]   It doesn't work with Alexander Hamilton.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.160]   It doesn't work.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.160]   You can make almost anybody look like Spock.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.920]   Nor does it work on Abe Lincoln.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.920]   There you go.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.920]   See?
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.920]   Next you're going to say it's disrespectful to turn George Washington into a mushroom.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.120]   Here in Scotland it works.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.120]   Spock's vacation.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.920]   Is that an iOS 11 feature?
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.920]   It's a notification.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.640]   Okay, Neil deGrasse Tyson trying to get him on it as usual.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.720]   No, he sensed that people were having fun somewhere and he had to find it and squash
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.720]   it.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.720]   I will be there.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.640]   If you say something, I'll take Neptune away from you as well.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.600]   Hey, speaking of which, congratulations.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.640]   If you were watching our live stream right before the show we showed the clip from the
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:36.400]   new screensavers on Saturday where we interviewed a space scientist who had made one of the
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.880]   instruments, the Jade instrument on the Jupiter probe.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.360]   It did it since when you say the Jupiter probe's insertion was successful, that sounds park
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.360]   as a waiting.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.160]   But that's exactly what happened yesterday.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.160]   Last night, actually.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.760]   That's what I got drunk when they're pick up truck in the middle of a field at midnight.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.760]   Next thing you know.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.760]   And now it's time for the Jupiter.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.760]   But it was a very challenging thing.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:05.280]   A launch five years ago they covered millions of miles and hit it within 20.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.640]   And all the instruments apparently intact and they'll be fired up in the next couple
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.640]   of days.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.640]   Amazing.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.200]   Pretty cool first pictures we think beneath the cloud cover of Jupiter.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   You can see that interview.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.560]   Well, wasn't there like a premature engine shutdown during injection that like for about
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.920]   like 30 seconds you see everybody in the room going, "Oh, holy mother of God."
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.920]   Until like they got the flumbering back and it fired back up.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.920]   It's better than a versatile.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.920]   And it cures us like clouds.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.920]   You see a shopping mall.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.920]   Is that right?
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.920]   Wouldn't that be funny?
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.360]   Let's see here.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.960]   We're kind of jamming because there's not a lot of news.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:47.080]   This is that time period in the life of Apple where there's just really not much to say
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.080]   in between them.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.080]   You made us today Leo.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.640]   It came out like five minutes before the show.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.640]   New betas today.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.640]   New betas.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.640]   All the new betas.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.160]   It feels like that's every week.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.680]   So I think it was supposed to, well not supposed to, but they usually do every two weeks and
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.680]   last week was two weeks.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.840]   So people got nervous this week and we're just waiting and waiting and then they finally
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.840]   unleashed the hounds.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:11.440]   I have to admit that I haven't installed a beta on an iOS tablet until this weekend.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.680]   I installed a bunch of them.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.200]   And it's so easy now.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.120]   It's become like, I think the last time it was like you hook it up on your computer and
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.400]   you had to move the stuff over and do all the installations.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.920]   And now it's just like, oh I just download a little 8K registration and then just hit
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.920]   go.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.480]   They said the public betas would start this month for WatchOS 2 and iOS 10.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.480]   Is that the case?
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.480]   iOS 10 and Mac OS.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.480]   They're not doing WatchOS 2.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.480]   Are you watching this?
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.480]   No.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.960]   There's a fiddly or installs and they're not really for everybody yet.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.400]   Have they started the public betas?
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.520]   No, that should be soon-ish like in the next couple weeks.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.800]   It's just the time we should warn people not to do it.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.760]   Yeah, I mean like my, I want the betas because I have to be because I write about them and
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.400]   I still like, it's not anything I'd recommend anybody put on their normal phone.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.840]   Just don't do it.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:03.200]   Josh Windish, our resident Apple fanboy, like the day of WWDC, which is WatchOS 2 and iOS
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.120]   10 on his phone and his watch.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.120]   It's how tempting Leo.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.120]   I know.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.400]   Well, he said he was very pleased with WatchOS 2.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.280]   I don't think he said a lot of problems with it.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.280]   Yeah, I just played like my kids both have beta on their iPad and they were like-
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.720]   You put iOS 10 on your kids iPad?
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.720]   Are you insane?
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.120]   They're using the, the only reason they have it there is because of the playground, you
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.800]   know, Swift playground, which they are rocking.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   Oh, you're kidding.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.640]   Like they're six and eight years old and there's this competition.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.280]   If one of them gets further ahead than the other one, then the other one then comes over
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.280]   to me and says, okay, how do I do this?
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.280]   What is a function?
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.480]   It's like a function is kind of like a tool that you build.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.480]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.480]   How are you?
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.040]   Your kids are like five and three.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.040]   Six and eight.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.040]   Six and eight.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.520]   Okay, they're a little older than they used to be.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.280]   Yeah, no, it doesn't happen.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.280]   Yeah, it is.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.760]   It's, it's, I don't-
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.920]   It's awfully young to be learning Swiss.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.520]   They've still been alive for a few years and I've been trying to develop Iowa software.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.520]   Exactly.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   No, no, they, they've got a solid, they, they, we got a solid command of functions now.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.520]   That's amazing.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.960]   And understanding how to do it, how that works and how like say, my, you know, my daughter
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.920]   was like, oh, that saves so much time.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.920]   She's like, what?
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.920]   She's doing all this stuff.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.920]   So then she's like, and then she built a function and she was like, okay.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.120]   And then now every time she sees it, she goes, so how would I build a function for that?
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.720]   She's like six years old.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.720]   Magical.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.400]   Yeah, yeah, it's, it's pretty, pretty cool.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.720]   I don't think it's really designed for the age group that it would, it definitely is
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:34.800]   a lot more hands on, which is for me, I love because it is, it's kind of a father kid time
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.280]   to, to hang out.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.920]   So, so we sit there and I, you know, explain to them what that stuff is.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.920]   And it works and we go through it.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.920]   What's her vision?
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.320]   So we're so, we're so proud of our daughter.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.600]   She's complaining about Apple developer guidelines on a college level.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.600]   Wow.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.760]   So anyway, it's, it's, it's, it's, I thought that the, when I first saw the graphics for
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.560]   it, I thought, oh, that would be a little corny, but they, they love it.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.560]   And how about using an adult?
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.560]   Do you see, get something as an adult that you would be?
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.240]   I mean, that's what, I'm kind of interested in playing.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.480]   Well, I think that there's going to be a lot of opportunity there because, you know, if
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.120]   you, if you look at some of the stuff that they showed, anybody can build a Swift Playground
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.120]   book.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:19.400]   So the stuff that is up there right now that the kids are playing with is, is pretty basic,
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.080]   but you can definitely build things that were much more complex.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.480]   So one of the things that I've been playing around with is like, if I want to build a book
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:31.960]   on how to integrate coding with, let's say, little bits or with, you know, doing some basic
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.440]   back and forths, you know, you can build something that gives people basically kind of a safe
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.920]   place to play where they can, they don't have to write all the code.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:47.280]   So you could write your own workbook as difficult or as easy as you wish and then offer it to
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.320]   people and they can install it and download it or whatever.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.160]   Those are just documents.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:57.320]   Yeah, they're basically, it's an whole nother level of iBook kind of thing.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.920]   That's really intriguing.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:04.160]   So, so, so while this is great for kids right now, what they put out, you can imagine that,
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.240]   you know, you can have lots of teachers building their, you know, building their own.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.120]   I mean, I think that was one of the big successes of iBook was not, iBooks was not so much that
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.840]   the publishers jumped on it or that it became this revolution, but teachers used it all
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:19.160]   over the place to, to, and chaired a lot of iBooks to, to do their own stuff because
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.160]   they were able to build it.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.280]   And so, so having this back end where they can actually, you can actually put that together,
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.880]   you can take whatever, obviously there's going to be a lot of stuff that's made by companies
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.960]   that are specializing in it and we're evaluating how deeply we want to get into doing stuff
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.560]   around this, around, we'll play ground, but the, but anybody can put those together.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.840]   I mean, it's still a challenge.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.720]   I mean, it's, it's got to figure out how you're going to say it and what you're going to expose
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.600]   and so on and so forth, but you can have parts of the code that are being activated by functions
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.560]   that you're giving the user and so on and so forth.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.240]   And so, so those are, it's a pretty exciting platform.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.080]   I think that there's a lot of opportunity there and I think that getting into the kind
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:03.560]   of the internet of things stuff with Swift could be really interesting for a lot of the manufacturers
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.560]   too.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.240]   So you can see how I can move a sphero around or change the colors of my lights and I don't
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:11.320]   have to learn how to code everything from the ground up to do that.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.880]   And the interesting thing about Swift Playground is that it's, it's got the entire code base
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.880]   in there.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.880]   We call them Swift is in there.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.600]   You call it, you call those things.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.160]   It'll, it's got it all built in.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.800]   So it's a, it's a pretty interesting platform.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.520]   So anyway, that's why the, that's why the kids and I have and actually my wife has iOS
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.400]   10 on, on their lap, on their iPads.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.400]   What's the timeframe?
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.320]   Does anybody know for Swift three?
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.360]   Cause that's a big change.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.920]   Is this going to be Swift three when it comes out probably, right?
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.920]   Cause that's, I think so.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.760]   Yeah, I think it's, yeah, I aimed for that.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.600]   Cause that is a huge, I mean, that's a, it's not source compatible.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.800]   I mean, it's a big change.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.080]   So, okay.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.560]   Is not Swift three now or is it Alex?
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.560]   Do you know?
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.560]   I, I do not know for sure.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.560]   But I, I can't imagine they would build something that's not getting released till the fall
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.840]   to not be compatible with the thing that's released in the fall.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.840]   It's possible.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.840]   Swift three is expected to be released sometime in late 2016.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.200]   So they're very, you know, cagey about this.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.240]   And I, and I think at the beginning, if you were learning the, what, what you're learning.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.400]   The basics are basic.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.760]   I think it's the basics are basic.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.760]   So I think that, uh, but it's, it's, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.160]   even cross language, frankly.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.600]   I mean, you know, if statements and loops and.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.600]   Fucks.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.760]   And I think just right now, just getting, you know, getting around the basic, uh, nomenclature.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.880]   It's so funny how the, you know, the, uh, uh, you know, even my kids are getting used
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.680]   to the little brackets and the, you know, the curly brackets versus the parentheses and
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.680]   where they got to put them.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.400]   And, you know, and all that stuff is, I think that, and I underestimated how important that
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.400]   was.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.640]   I really felt like, Oh, I just make something very graphical, you know, more like light
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.520]   bought, but more, and that's why I think why my kids have done so well on it is because
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.760]   they played light bot for hours.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.760]   Light.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.760]   That's really great.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.960]   So they, so to them, the first levels of all this code are just more light bot, you know, and,
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.160]   um, and so they, they completely understand how to do that.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.440]   Um, so I really felt like I should stay graphical, but, but by seeing the code, it does help a
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.400]   lot for them to kind of, uh, understand what they're doing.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.720]   So it's, um, it, it, I think it's, uh, it's pretty cool.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.320]   And we've mentioned before, but the apple has open sourced, uh, swift.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.760]   There is a Linux implementation.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.320]   There will be a kind of a more complete implementation with swift three, they say be the first
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.200]   version of swift on the next to complete, contain the complete.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:27.840]   So you'll be able to do that on, on Linux and then IBM has really weird speaking of playgrounds,
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.400]   swift playground online.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.600]   I'm not sure what IBM's intention is with swift, but you feel like they're up to something.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.200]   Well, and I think that the, the, the interesting thing here is with an open source platform
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:43.680]   and a, and a very, uh, robust teaching mechanism, you could end up with, you know, that could
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.200]   be the next generation of coders.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.880]   You know, I mean, it's, it's a, you know, it's going to be hard pressed for a school to
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.240]   find resources that are better than the swift playground platform to teach coding.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.760]   You know, that's, that's the issue is it's going to be very difficult to find something
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.760]   that's competitive to that.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.520]   There's a lot of things that people have been using, but they're not nearly as robust as,
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.400]   as what swift playground looks like so far.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:08.400]   This is the IBM, uh, swift sandbox, which is, you know, just kind of like a, a REPL
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:16.800]   for a swift, but it's online, which is wild, uh, swift, uh, swift laying.ng.blumix.net.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.560]   So I think what's interesting is the idea that swift may end up being more than just
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.840]   an Apple programming language.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.920]   It's very clear Apple's all in on swift that all Apple development will be a, for, for
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.240]   all platforms to be swift, uh, sooner than later, I think.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.160]   And then people, the people I talked to who you swift really are high on it.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.320]   And I think Federica said parts of finder and parts of other core, uh, applications already
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.520]   being rewritten partially in swift or updated in swift.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.520]   Interesting.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.520]   Uh, all right.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.200]   We got really the big story of the week and the almost the only story of the week is about
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   Apple music.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.320]   So we'll, we'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:58.040]   Um, and, uh, and then if you guys could find something else to talk about, that'd be great.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.040]   Anything.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.040]   I just, you know what I don't want?
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.680]   And I know what we will end up doing is, is doing the usual rumor mill tour, right?
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.600]   Of the iPhones next iPhone and the next MacBook.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.080]   It's clearly dark blue Leo.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.080]   No, no, no, it's black.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.080]   No, no, no, like, royals.
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.360]   Just like, come on, guys.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.920]   Uh, I'm really, I'm really holding my breath for a new MacBook Pro though.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.080]   I have to say and, uh, you'll get one.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:24.320]   I, I, I went to the, I actually got in the poem where I, as I mentioned earlier, I, uh,
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.360]   went to the Apple store online and checked today.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:33.200]   So like just in case, I mean, I think there would be a fairly large noise when that happens,
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.520]   but I just, just in case I missed that.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.960]   But no, no, yeah.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.880]   And we'll talk about the organ donor app, which is actually very interesting.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.120]   We want to encourage everybody to do it.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:47.880]   So I'm sure that's all three a is pick for the week.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.440]   Our show today brought to you by Adobe marketing cloud.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:55.040]   Now if you're, uh, in business or you work in the marketing department or your marketing
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:01.560]   professional of a business, but, but also if you own a business, marketing is, uh, is
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.320]   a complex and challenging thing.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.920]   I think a lot of us, and I really include myself in this, are seat of the pants marketers.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.560]   Well, that seems like a good idea.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:15.440]   There's really a lot, uh, and especially nowadays in the internet, you're about marketing that
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.480]   is, that is science.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.760]   If you want to keep up to date on the latest marketing trends and technologies, you're
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.160]   going to love these white papers from Adobe and their audio white papers, which is really
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.160]   great.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.800]   It makes it very easy for you to listen, uh, on the, on your way to work to kind of be,
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:34.080]   uh, you know, keeping up to speed in your downtime.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.360]   The series of audio podcasts includes topics like learning the difference between an eye
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.800]   confess, not to knowing what I'm talking about here.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.640]   Interaction metrics, engagement metrics and value metrics.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:48.480]   I better listen to that one to help figure out what part of your creative is working.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.480]   Seems like that would be important.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.800]   Creative person creating a personalized content that's relevant to customers using predictive
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.800]   analytics.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:00.480]   You can tell I need to listen to this, creating a 360 degree view of each customer no matter
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.640]   where they're interacting with your brand and a lot more.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.360]   What's nice is you don't have to read these.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.200]   You can, but they've made them, uh, audio.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.720]   In fact, they got really good readers, some of the best readers from Audible.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.880]   In fact, so all you have to do is search audio white papers for marketing on iTunes.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:22.040]   They're free and you'll gain great insights into the latest marketing trends and maybe
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.840]   even be entertained.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.520]   You can find out more at adobe.com or, uh, search.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.080]   You got, you just, yeah, right there.
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:33.080]   Listen to these white papers, uh, or just go to iTunes.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:38.120]   I don't think that Malcolm McDowell is reading this current crop, but they have a lot of
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.120]   them.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.120]   It's really good.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.400]   Search iTunes or you can even Google Adobe audio white papers for marketing.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:48.120]   I'll go right to that iTunes page and we thank Adobe marketing cloud for their support.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:54.240]   Appreciate them, uh, reaching out to our Mac break weekly audience.
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.680]   I think they, uh, they think you guys are pretty valuable customers.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:03.960]   Uh, Spotify says, Apple's holding up our app.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:08.120]   Apple says, well, you dopes, the rules have never changed.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.720]   I don't know who's right on this one.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.880]   Um, everybody's wrong, Leo.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.880]   Okay.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.080]   Everybody can be wrong.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.080]   Everybody can be wrong.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:22.760]   I do know that it's true that Apple is a direct competitor to Adobe.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:28.480]   And so it's not unreasonable for, I mean, to spot a hand to Adobe, but that's a spot
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.480]   of five.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.960]   They're frenemies with Adobe.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.760]   I don't think you could say they're frenemies with Spotify.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:40.760]   Uh, every, every, uh, new Apple music subscribers, probably one fewer Spotify subscriber and
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.280]   vice versa.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:50.360]   Um, first of all, I think, you know, the first thing to get clear on is what is the new Spotify
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.600]   app doing that Apple doesn't like?
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.680]   It is directing people away from the app store and towards a Spotify web presence in order
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:02.240]   to sign up for subscriptions, which is counter to apples.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.600]   I don't know who I'm directing and it turned off the ability to sign up within the app.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:12.120]   Well, what in the past they've done, uh, is charge you an extra three bucks because of
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.200]   course, Apple takes 30%.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:20.320]   So if you subscribe as I do unaccountably, because I guess I'm a doofus to Spotify through
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:25.320]   the, uh, uh, Apple, Apple store, you paid extra three bucks.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.480]   And they, their current app also does, does the redirection, which it shouldn't be doing.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:33.000]   So I mean, it's not, you mean, they actually redirect you or they say, you know, it would
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.800]   be cheaper if you went to the, uh, they have a weird pop up that says for a premium experience
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.720]   click here and then it clicks you to the website.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.480]   But the current one was approved.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.840]   So, I mean, like there's been, there's been several tiers of this for a while.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.000]   Like it's been long rumored that Netflix, for example, has had the 15% rather than
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.760]   30% levy for several years and that other really big subscription based companies have
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.760]   had, uh, deals that were, that were lower than 30%.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.560]   And that's coming to everyone.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.560]   Some people are getting it now.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.640]   Some people will be getting it in the fall, but subscriptions for everybody on the second
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.360]   year of recursion will be getting the 15%.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.600]   So that, that's going to be going across the board, but some companies, we live in a
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.520]   world now where it's middlemen, you can't have multiple middlemen because everybody
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.200]   is trying to take 15 to 30% of the same pie.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.960]   So if you own the music and you sell it directly, you don't lose any money.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.440]   But if you sell it to Amazon or then wants to sell it to Apple and then wants to sell
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:28.400]   it to you, suddenly you have two middle companies and they both want 30% and that 30% just doesn't
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.400]   exist for them.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.720]   So that's when you get into these, these contentions about, and this only applies to digital goods,
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.720]   physical goods.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.720]   There's no charge on.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.480]   Some people were confused about how Amazon retail apps, for example, were.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:44.200]   Bruce Sewell, Apple's general counsel writes, we find to Spotify and publicly, we find it
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.600]   troubling that you are asking for exemptions to the rules we apply to all developers and
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:54.600]   are publicly resorting to rumors and half truths about our service.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.720]   What is the rumor and half truth that Spotify's?
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:04.000]   Spotify was making the case that they were trying to play that because Spotify is a competing
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.480]   service, their app is being withheld or being treated as a second tier priority for the
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:15.600]   app store when really as legitimate as any concerns were that Apple would use an app
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:22.520]   store to exert control over the market, it's never proven that they've actually done that.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:32.800]   So I do know when I am using Audible or Amazon Kindle on iOS that I can't buy books in those
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.720]   apps, I'm sent to the web or com or comexology.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:40.760]   And see, there's a whole dimensions to this discussion.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:45.640]   It's cut, it's haven't you ever had an interaction with a cellular phone, a cellular company
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:53.680]   or cable company where they're charging you for the service fee for having tickets emailed
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:57.560]   to you but there's also a service fee for having tickets printed and there's also a service
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:04.080]   fee for picking up tickets elsewhere or I'm going to give you a $40 service fee for switching
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.920]   your sim for a new one that you need to get the service that you're paying for.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:12.720]   There comes a time when you say you are charging me because you feel as though you can, you're
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:17.560]   not giving me anything in return for this enormous amount of money in the case of the
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:22.560]   cut that Apple is taking from a lot of these online sales.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:28.960]   I think there's just going to be even greater pushback when you have situations like, again,
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.400]   I make my purchases through comexology every Wednesday for my new comics and I have to leave
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:41.040]   the app in order to do that because there is just not an extra 30% in comexology's profit
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:47.880]   margin to give to Apple for the purpose of doing a simple credit card transaction which
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.560]   pretty much they could get a much better deal on anywhere else.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.360]   So why does a Spotify just do that?
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.280]   Say, if you want to subscribe to Spotify, you can't do it in the app.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.520]   You have to go to the web just as the Kindle app does in the comexology.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.520]   Would that be okay?
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.240]   Well, remember that the comexology app doesn't send you anywhere else.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.000]   All it can do is if you want to do something within the app is it will let you, excuse
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.560]   me, it will show you the catalog and you can push the button to add it to your wishlist
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:20.600]   or your pull list and then go to comex, manually on your own, go to comexology.com and then
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:25.080]   see, oh, there's my wishlist all populated with these comics that I've chosen and then
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.920]   make the purchase.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:33.280]   Spotify, I think that it's a, they're trying to skirt around the rules of the developer
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.960]   rules that Apple set up, but also they're trying to make things oddly enough easier for
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.000]   the user rather than just be silent as now.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.320]   I hope you're going to figure out that we also have a website and you can also buy things
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.760]   off of our website.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:49.480]   They're trying to figure out a way that they're kind of testing the electric fence.
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:53.840]   Just look for weak spots that if we put a link here that people can tap and we word it
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.400]   in such a way that doesn't look like we're directing people away from the app to make
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:02.280]   a purchase, is that going to, can we sneak that through and Apple has said, no, we're
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.960]   not going to sneak that through your tribe.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.640]   We want our 15 pennies off of every dollar.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.120]   We want our 30 pennies off of every dollar.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:16.480]   And a great number of Spotify customers do subscribe through iTunes.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:21.560]   So this is not something that Spotify can walk away from either.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.200]   It's hard to say.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:29.600]   I think you can make the argument that Apple gets a bigger benefit from Netflix operation
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.640]   in on iPads and on the Apple TV.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.680]   And Netflix gets from the bringing Apple customers to the service.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.760]   And so the idea that Apple is taking even one penny from that transaction above what
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.520]   it costs to simply process a credit card is absurd.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:50.840]   And I think that for a great many other services, you can make exactly the same sort of argument.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:56.360]   There's so many places where if you're a small developer and you don't have the resources
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:01.720]   to do your own marketing transactions yourself, I know a lot of developers who do think that
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.280]   30% is they wish it were less, of course.
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.560]   But that's a headache that's off of their hands and they're actually kind of willing
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:12.520]   to spend 30 cents off of every dollar to not have to just get an amount of money every
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.160]   month for their purchases.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:21.120]   But so many of these other businesses, you just have to ask, how is Apple delivering
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:26.760]   30 cents per dollar of service to Comixology?
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:30.280]   And I think that that's something that nobody has a really good answer for.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:34.680]   I think the argument is that it's kind of like saying, why should Macy's pay for space
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.680]   in the mall?
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.800]   Ah, yeah, but I mean a credit card company Visa takes what?
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.280]   5% of the transaction?
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.480]   Probably less.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:49.080]   So I can see Spotify is already paying that.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.600]   Here's what by the way, according to Jonathan Prince, who is the Spotify communications
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:59.280]   director, he said, this is the thing that bothers Apple premium feature.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.720]   You discovered a premium feature.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.080]   You must have a premium subscription to unlock it.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.080]   Got it.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.080]   Now, does that got it?
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.440]   Take you to the Spotify on the web?
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:13.440]   Well, he says no offer, no purchase, no link to anywhere at all.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.440]   I don't know.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.000]   Unfortunately, I can't tell because I don't have it on my--
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.720]   There's so much to unpack here.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:23.600]   And one of the things that's super interesting is you can look and say, well, Google was
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:27.040]   a tremendous benefit to Apple because people could access it and search the web.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.480]   But Google was playing billions of dollars for access to Apple's customer base.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.840]   And there's a feeling that access, because traditionally, the iOS customer base has been
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.680]   sort of a premium base.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:40.560]   We're willing to pay a lot of things for services that that was valuable.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.320]   Apple has given free apps, free access to app store infrastructure for years.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.800]   And that's partially subsidized by paid apps, paying their fair share.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.680]   And there was maybe a pessimistic belief that if you made subscriptions and in-app purchases
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:57.480]   free from iTunes, that almost every app would just move to subscriptions or in-app purchases
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:02.600]   that were outside the iTunes ecosystem, thereby radically reducing the amount of income that's
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.880]   coming into the app store and making it run at a loss, which is something that Apple is
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.040]   just religiously unwilling to do.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:13.600]   And also, when you look at things like comicalogy or you look at things like TV stations, the
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.200]   rights and monies that pass back and forth is much is really complicated.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.640]   And 15% in some ways is incredibly cheap and 30% in some ways for some developers, especially
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.640]   early on.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.640]   I mean, now they're starting to resent it.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.280]   But in the early days, you look at blog posts by like Craig Hockenberry.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.480]   And it's like only 30%.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.720]   This is ridiculously great.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.520]   I can't believe Apple is doing this.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:34.880]   So depending on who you are, what your exact market is and what business you're in, 15%
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.640]   could be incredibly cheap.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:42.720]   And again, if you own the platform, it's like in Apple retail, Beats headphones are essentially
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:47.120]   free, but other companies have to give Apple a wholesale discount, which is not 15%, but
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.600]   55%.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.880]   And that's just how retail works.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.920]   And you can't set up a boutique inside retail because then you're giving 55% or 55%.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:59.360]   We've just come to a point in time when platforms are the gateway to all these services and
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.960]   there's going to be a shaking out.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.040]   And the last sort of thing I'll point out is that Spotify is any horrible business.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.760]   We've talked about this on the show before.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.760]   There's almost no money to be made in streaming music.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.440]   And it's going to be the companies like Apple and Google and Amazon that have ancillary
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:16.200]   business is that they can use the streaming music service to add value that are going
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:20.520]   to really want to do them because for them, if it's break even, it doesn't matter.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.160]   For Spotify, it's literally life and death.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.360]   And I think that's why they're fighting so hard.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:28.800]   But I don't think the business is going to exist for them either way.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.440]   And I think that obviously they have a competitive issue.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.800]   I mean, they cannot continue to compete with music.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.400]   I mean, they do OK right now.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.000]   They got ahead at the beginning.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.120]   But they're not going to be able to continue to stay ahead as new users make decisions
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.160]   and as people start to look at it.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.720]   And I think the big competitive advantage, again, for music is just simply that I hold
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:55.000]   down my little thing on my headphone and say what I want to hear and I hear it.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.160]   And that tie-in I think is probably more compelling than anything else that music has
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.520]   to offer.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:05.200]   But it'll be enough for a constant erosion for them.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.320]   The price point, of course, becomes another issue.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:13.560]   So trying to find some way around that point where they have no room to give back.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:18.080]   But I think that it is-- so I get that where they're coming from there.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:23.760]   But I do think that saying that Apple shouldn't have to pay anything for-- or shouldn't have
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.200]   to charge anything for their platform.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:31.000]   And they are providing a platform and access to a group of people who consistently spend
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.280]   more money than anyone else anywhere else.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:39.360]   I think that saying that Apple shouldn't be allowed to take advantage of that or get
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.560]   some residual from that.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:47.240]   I think it gets into if you don't like it, then don't put it on there.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.160]   I guess I just don't understand.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.280]   If you don't like the percentage, then if you don't want to follow the rules, I get
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:57.200]   that they need to because they can't survive without that platform.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.440]   But it seems like Apple built the house and can charge the rent that they charge.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.120]   Apple pays for beats on Android.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:08.000]   I believe Apple pays a percentage to Google Play for Apple Music on Android.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.640]   Sorry, say that again.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.640]   Apple pays.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.640]   Apple pays.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:17.680]   If you subscribed Apple Music through the Android store, you will obviously-- Google
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.760]   will take its cut.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.080]   We don't know what the cut is.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.080]   I think it's similar.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.240]   I think there's a great variance across the industry.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.200]   Of course, the big competitor to all these guys is YouTube because it's almost unlimited
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.600]   free music, sometimes of dubious licensing.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.600]   Right.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.920]   Yeah, it's hard because it's a bad business.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.800]   But I want to see the competition at the same time.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:43.280]   It also seems like a little back hat and slap at Apple customers because-- or iPhone
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:49.560]   users because-- I mean, just the course of events, you wouldn't say anything.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:54.840]   You would just have this service and you'd say, a premium is available elsewhere, whatever.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.200]   I don't know how you would do it.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.000]   I'm sure there's a way to do it within Apple's.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.320]   But I think that they just figure out, oh, you're an iPhone user.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.080]   The only way you're going to be able to figure this out is if you do it through the app.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:08.120]   Yeah, I mean, it's a terribly bad model for customers.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:12.120]   And the assumption is that you had a preexisting subscription and you've just gone to download
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.320]   their client on iOS.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.320]   Right.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.480]   Therefore, it's not necessary to send you to the store.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.600]   If you are not a customer, then you discovered it through the iOS app.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.280]   And that's what triggers Apple to believe that they deserve a cut.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:26.480]   And again, it's terrible, terrible for customers and not a very optimistic model.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.960]   But it's difficult to-- Apple is-- it's one of those things where Apple's going to have
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.120]   to be hurt and hurt badly in the market for them to want to-- for-- right now, they believe
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.920]   the relationship goes in the direction of Apple.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.560]   You know, they have this wonderful product, super successful.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.680]   The app store is successful beyond belief.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.160]   When you start to become like Microsoft or BlackBerry, then you start to become
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.360]   re-incredibly friendly to developers and services because you really, really need them.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.520]   But you know, and Google can be friendly at some times and then just clone your business
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.880]   on other occasions.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:56.160]   When you're successful business, it's really hard for people who don't have a lot of money
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.160]   to throw around.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.320]   Well, there's a third party in this that we're kind of leaving out, which is the music
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.320]   industry.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.800]   And I think the music industry has an-- this is going to be an interesting part of the equation.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:10.240]   I mean, don't-- on the one hand, they have a definite interest in having competition
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.640]   to Apple-- iTunes and Apple Music, right?
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.960]   You want to have a vigorous ecosystem.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.400]   Otherwise, Apple is too powerful.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.200]   Especially if Apple buys title as one last--
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.200]   Right.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:24.920]   On the other hand, Apple-- and part of the reason they probably are interested in title
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:31.160]   has-- because of Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre and Taylor Swift has great relationships with
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.360]   the music industry and particularly with artists, right?
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.120]   Artists love-- I think it's safe to say artists love Apple.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.320]   They're very happy with Spotify due to the amount of money that's in person.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:44.320]   So-- Why do you do not happy with anybody providing a free access to their music?
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.600]   I think that that is-- and that's most likely something that will most, I think, will probably
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.600]   largely fade away.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.040]   So, but the music industry will have something to say about this.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:57.720]   What do you think-- I guess actually, it's the music industry would like this to continue.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:02.920]   Artists would like it-- loves Apple and say, "That's fine.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.360]   We'll just go through Apple."
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.360]   Right?
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.360]   Is that fair?
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.320]   And what is the music industry going to do about this?
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.480]   Because they want to keep Spotify alive and yet the same-- I mean, they are artificially
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.480]   doing it.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.480]   I don't think that they do want to keep Spotify.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.320]   No, I think that they want some competition there, but I think that one of the things
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:24.200]   that they like is that title provides an opportunity to get a higher margin if they continue to
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:28.400]   use that business model, especially if Apple bought them and decided to continue to use
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.400]   that business model.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.880]   There's a higher margin there available for the artist.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.600]   So, Spotify's just screwed, basically, no matter what happens.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.720]   Yeah, I give them three to five years.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.720]   Does not--
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:38.720]   You said?
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.920]   It was slack in the market.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.200]   I mean, a lot of businesses exist in the slack in the market.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.280]   When that slack goes away, it's just very hard for that business to continue.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.800]   There's no slack for someone.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.440]   No, I mean, it gets pulled tightly, oh.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.800]   Again, it happened in smartphones.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.160]   Companies-- Microsoft can keep Windows, phone going as long as it wants because it has so
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.960]   much money from other sources.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.320]   Palm and BlackBerry, not so much.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.240]   They didn't have ancillary income to keep them going.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.880]   That makes it very hard.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.680]   I think that Spotify had a time when they needed to be creative.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:09.000]   They needed to figure out a way to really develop a brand that people were really attached
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.280]   to, find ways to do more with the artist.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.320]   They're attempting to now, but I think that's a little too late.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.040]   I think there could have been ways to be creative about that.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.800]   I don't think that they may not go away.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.800]   They may get bought.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.320]   They may-- so on and so forth.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:26.920]   But I don't think that they will exist as an independent entity.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.320]   Microsoft, for instance, did really well and then failed at this area.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:34.360]   So they could be another opportunity.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:40.740]   This is then a last ditch attempt for Spotify to gain the attention of the Federal Trade
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:41.740]   Commission and--
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:42.740]   Elizabeth Warren.
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:43.740]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.440]   And hope that they can-- because basically they're shooting the moon.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.440]   At this point, they got nothing to lose.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:51.280]   Is that how you feel?
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:56.400]   Is that-- in other words, let's just see if we can get anybody to believe the fact that
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.400]   the same thing.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.120]   Michael Garhamberg had a really good take last week where he said that when a company turns
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.920]   to the courts, it's usually not on the way up.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:03.920]   It's their last ditch.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.920]   No?
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.440]   That's-- there are plenty of counter examples of that.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:15.680]   Well, and I think Spotify-- there's some merit to what Spotify's saying, yes?
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.480]   I think there is.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:24.440]   I mean, I'm-- again, I'm not a business analyst, so I can't say what Spotify could or should
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:29.640]   do to be around in the next five years without being relabeled Facebook music.
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:37.000]   But-- no, actually, that might even be a good fit for both companies.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.720]   Facebook has been failing to get the deals they need to get.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:47.720]   Spotify is just basically this big ball of legal papers that are valuable to have in
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:51.520]   one way or another unless the entire music industry just hates Spotify and just wants
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.320]   it to die, die, die.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:56.120]   But the thing-- they have a valid point.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:59.200]   I do think this is going to be a conversation that's going to be-- that's going to continue
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.400]   to be had over the next three, four, five years.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.240]   Again, it comes back to the point of what is Apple delivering for that 30 cents off of
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.160]   every dollar they're charging.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.720]   And yes, they could say, oh, well, we were delivering all these wonderful iPhone customers,
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.160]   but guess what?
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:19.640]   There is no other way to get a app on this phone other than to go through the Apple store.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.840]   The iTunes-- the iTunes store, which means that there's no way to get an app on this
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:25.160]   phone to those customers unless you give.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.520]   You let Apple, what it speak.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:32.960]   And I think that it should be able to participate in some of the profits that are regenerated
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.800]   by the store, but it's going to become more and more of a hardship.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:43.360]   When the Apple store-- excuse me, when the app store began, there was one big loaf of
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:48.600]   bread that's being sliced into moderately very few pieces.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:52.040]   And so there are a lot of opportunities for a lot of those early developers to be very,
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.040]   very happy.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:58.880]   Now it's a situation in which you are either a gold mining farm that makes crap apps that
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:04.960]   just simply generates money based on the ability to psychologically torment people who have
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:10.760]   a brain that's wired up to not be able to reject a bad deal when an offer is made to
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:14.240]   you at the time when your brain is most successful to it.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.560]   But there are now thousands and thousands of people who just cannot make a dime off
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.560]   of it.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.080]   And that 30 cents is really, really important.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:25.600]   And it's-- again, they're very, very valuable customers, but when you're telling these people
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:30.480]   that there is no way you can possibly get your product, get your work of art, your work
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:36.880]   of creativity published unless you get approval, go through all these hoops, some of which seem
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:41.400]   unerucent, unnecessary, and then also give them 30 cents off the top, there are going
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:45.360]   to be a lot of people who are going to-- it's not going to kill the iPhone, it's not going
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.840]   to put Apple in any danger whatsoever.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:52.680]   But it means that when some people have an idea for an app, they're going to start to
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.680]   see what are the alternatives.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:59.000]   We will make an app-- we'll make an aversion for iOS, but is there a better deal we can
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   get elsewhere?
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.280]   We've already seen a lot of Mac OS developers already turn tail and run because they're
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.480]   just-- it's not even the 30% cut.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:12.440]   It's like you are wasting too much of our time with stuff that is not important to us
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:16.160]   the developers, the developer of this app, or the customers of this app.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:24.480]   You are making us do stuff that only makes Mac OS more important and more salient to Apple,
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.640]   nothing for us or for our customers.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:33.800]   And so what happens when the day comes when Apple says, we feel as though Mac OS is not
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.720]   secure enough by allowing unsigned apps.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:40.600]   So from now on, you can only install apps that are completely signed and can only be
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.080]   bought through the app store.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.840]   Think about the revolution that would happen then.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.000]   You would have a lot of people saying, OK, goodbye.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   We're not doing this anymore.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.680]   This is not worth it for 8% of the desktop market worldwide.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:41:00.560]   And as the iPhone's market share continues to not necessarily drop but not grow at the
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:06.440]   same rate as the Android installed user base grows, there might be a time when a lot of
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:11.120]   people are saying, we will, of course, we cannot be credible unless we're doing versions
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.520]   for iOS as well as any other platform we're doing.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:17.200]   But we are going to put most of our effort in the one where we can actually make the
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.440]   most money and that might not necessarily always be iOS.
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.440]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.880]   I don't think it might not always be, but it'll be that way for the next 10 years.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.560]   We're far from that point.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:27.560]   Obviously.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.520]   It's not just the number of users.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.240]   It's the quality of the purchase.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:34.840]   And I think that that is the thing that Android still has a lot of trouble with.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.360]   And I think that is the hard part.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:41.320]   When you compare apples to apples, that gap is a lot narrower than it looks.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:46.400]   Oftentimes when you look at the broader number, you're also looking at phones that are blister
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:50.920]   packed phones that are sold to be used for like six months.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:56.640]   You're talking about limited feature phones that are being sold in developing that markets
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.960]   that are relatively new to the smartphone market.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:03.200]   You're not necessarily talking about the same person, the same sort of consumer that's buying
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.200]   iPhones.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:11.440]   But I guess if I'm going to be honest, I wish that Apple had a really good answer for why
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.080]   30 cents off of every dollar.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:20.560]   I wish it were something better than because you're only alternative is to not sell.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.840]   What makes us think that's a high number?
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.920]   So again, when we talk to people in the past and no one mentions it now, but is it a high
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.560]   number based on what metrics?
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.920]   Because there are people who sell through stores, but selling through stores has all sorts of
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:33.920]   awareness.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:38.800]   There's a complete package from transaction to delivery to marketing to featuring that's
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.280]   provided for that 30%.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:41.280]   I'm not sure.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.520]   I think the assumption is these days that it's a high number, but I'm not sure everyone,
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:48.080]   especially those who remember selling software prior to the, because it's easy after the
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.720]   app store to say, "Oh, this is a lot of money."
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:53.160]   But if you remember selling before the app store, again, the initial way of a developer
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.680]   is wasn't like, "This is a lot of money."
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:57.480]   This is, "Oh my God, I can't believe they're all doing this for 30 percent."
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.440]   So I'm interested in what if any of this changes.
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.440]   No, I mean, I mean, I mean, I'm saying it's a lot of money.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.680]   But I think there are limits to what Apple's app actually providing.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:11.640]   I can't name the number of times where I have had the actual name of an app that I wanted
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:16.040]   to buy and download, but could not find it in the app stores.
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:16.840]   That's anti-marketing.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.920]   You're great if you're one of the top selling apps, you're great if you're an editor's choice
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:30.080]   app, you're great if you won an annual award, but it's not helping you squat for actually
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.080]   marketing your app.
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:37.480]   It does depend very much on what the market is and what the app is or whatever.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.560]   Google is still the same, right?
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.800]   Google is still 30 percent.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:46.320]   30 percent is reasonable in some cases and it's clearly not, whether it's reasonable
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.200]   or not, it's not viable for Spotify.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:52.040]   So it's a blanket number Apple just pulled out of the year.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:55.600]   It sounded good at the time and I'm sure what it is still for a lot of developers.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.920]   It looks like Google's still using it.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:58.640]   So I mean, it's not just an Apple.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.480]   They looked at Apple and I said, "What is Apple charging?"
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:05.040]   Well, I think we underestimate, I mean, as someone who's developed software, I think
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.920]   we underestimate the cost of a sale and I think we also underestimate the cost of
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.920]   the online.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:12.080]   Well, what I'm saying, I think for some software developers it makes a lot of sense.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:17.440]   But if we gave big business, you know, people who already have it established a much lower
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.680]   rate, then you'd have all these little developers going, you know, we're getting screwed.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.080]   You know, so you know, I agree.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.080]   No, no, I agree.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:24.080]   For me that it is, I'd be upset.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.880]   I'd be like, "Well, it's going to 15 percent for subscriptions.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:26.880]   That'd be the issue."
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.880]   And I think that's Apple's response to this issue.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.880]   I'm sure that that's not sufficient for Spotify, particularly since it doesn't kick
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.840]   in till after a year of subscription.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.240]   So you know, the first year of a new customer is still going to cost you 30 percent.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:43.680]   If I were Daniel Eck, if I were Spotify CEO, at this point I would be doing everything
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.120]   I could to carry favor with the music industry.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:50.720]   I would get rid of the free tier or whatever it is I needed to do because your success
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:54.320]   or failure at this point is going to depend on how much the music industry goes to the
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.320]   bad.
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.320]   Or Mark Zuckerberg, like Andy suggested.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.320]   Well, I do like that idea.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.320]   I'm sure he's considering that as well.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.320]   Highly viable.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.720]   That's probably the only reasonable exit you can see.
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:07.720]   I think Spotify is way too valuable for anybody to prefer it not to exist five years from
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:08.720]   now again.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.960]   It'll be, it might be rebranded by then.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:15.520]   The executives and the engineers might have already moved on after being an incompatible
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:17.200]   fit for ever buys them.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:23.200]   Or the executives who run the company may be now a CEO, co-CEO of the company, but it's
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.000]   too valuable to not exist anymore.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   And the music industry, like most content providers, they're like Facebook might say,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.960]   "Oh, it's free when you have your Facebook account or with this."
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.520]   And the danger for them is that like book, like authors, they don't want their work to
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.920]   be seen as zero value.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:39.920]   Even if you are quote unquote paying with data or paying with attention, they want money
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:45.320]   to exist alongside with what they're producing because in their minds that that represents
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:48.080]   the value, long-term value of what they're creating.
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:53.560]   But you can, the music industry is in a lot of the same trouble that for instance, the
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:46:03.000]   news industry is in that it's, you can basically, you can say, you know what I insist that
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.720]   my work is more valuable than free and I refuse to give what, to put my music on a streaming
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:11.720]   service and give it away for free because I live bibble-blah.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.320]   Well, that's nice.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:19.080]   And by all means, you're responsible for your own choices and no one should complain that
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.080]   you're behind the times.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:24.160]   That's your choice to make, but you're not fighting people who are being mean and unfair.
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:29.840]   You're fighting a generation that does not associate itself with, "I'm going to give you
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:35.160]   $9.99 and you're going to give me 12 tracks that I will then keep and own forever."
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:42.240]   This is a generation that thinks of music as a very fluid and fungible sort of item that
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.800]   only exists in terms of a monthly access.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.840]   So the thing is, once I have to really...
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:56.160]   Because I'm an old foggy, the better analogy just for this purpose is that buying music
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:03.640]   that is not available online, I have to freaking love a band or love an album in order to buy
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.640]   a CD.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:08.440]   And if that band decides there's not going to be available through iTunes, it's not going
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.040]   to be available as Amazon MP3.
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:13.560]   You only have to buy a physical CD.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.560]   Oh boy, it's not that...
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:19.880]   I'm not going to protest and say, "Oh, you're going to stick it to you by not actually buying
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:20.880]   this."
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:21.880]   I'm going to say, "Okay."
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:26.800]   How much did Sam Goody take of the face value of a CD?
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.720]   It must have been around 50 percent.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.960]   Well, it wasn't contracting the printing.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:32.960]   How much was Alex?
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.440]   You worked in a record store.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:37.240]   Yeah, so $16.
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:42.240]   The one stop would get it for $9.99 or something like that.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.040]   So it's still roughly a third.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.600]   So this gets into the little one versus...
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.880]   So if you were a direct retailer, you would buy it at that.
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:51.880]   So if you were Sam Goody or Camelot or National Record Mart or whatever, you would get it
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.040]   at that price.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:57.040]   But if the one stop, but all the little guys had to buy it from the one stop and then they
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.600]   would get it for that and then they'd have to...
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.440]   But they would get it for $2 more than that.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.440]   And so they would get a lower...
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:12.640]   But I just mean, if you're the record company, you're still only getting 60 percent of the
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.440]   face value of the CD.
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.440]   But it was more.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.440]   It was a big number.
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.920]   Was it more than 70 percent?
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.240]   It wasn't more than 70 percent.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.920]   No, no, no, it wasn't not percentage wise.
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:22.320]   It was just an absurd amount of money.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.320]   It was a lot of money, right?
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.440]   Well, they got a certain percentage of the retail.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:30.680]   You have to remember that the cost of a production of a CD one on was doing in early
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:31.680]   90s was 44 cents.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:36.440]   But I think that's when Apple said 30 percent, that seemed like a good thing or not an unreasonable
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:37.440]   thing based on...
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:40.240]   No, I don't think 30 percent is unreasonable.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:46.600]   But I think that's the problem is that all the other distribution methods generally are
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.840]   more expensive than that.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:48.840]   Precisely.
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:49.840]   O'Sell is 55.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:52.800]   I still remember when I was writing actual physical books and they would say 55 percent
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.120]   inside you just go, "Ah, cause you helped me."
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.120]   You got maybe 7 to 10 percent of...
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.120]   Of the 55?
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:00.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.840]   I just wanted my signing bonus to be a certain...
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:07.920]   Whatever that was, I can be happy with that number because I may never see another dollar.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:13.400]   There's always a middleman and they always take a cut and Apple's cut is not unreasonable.
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.400]   The real problem is that Spotify's business model sucks.
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.400]   That's a real problem.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.480]   Yeah, multiple middlemen is not sustainable.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:20.480]   Right.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.480]   Anymore.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.480]   Right.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:25.440]   That's the fundamental issue and that's not going to go away anytime soon.
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:28.720]   Well, and I still think that I think we're going to see whether it's title or whether
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.720]   it's Apple.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:33.440]   I think that the move that needs to be made at some point, I think everyone's afraid
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.200]   to make it because of the ripples that it'll make.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:39.280]   But cutting the music industry out of the middle of that I think is probably the next
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.280]   step.
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.200]   I mean, for someone like Apple and that's what...
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:48.480]   With the talent base that Apple picked up with Beats, it wouldn't be very hard for them
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.000]   to move into being the producer.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.720]   Did you see that Rolling Stone article, Alex?
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:53.720]   I did not.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:54.720]   Tell us about it.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:55.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:59.080]   So the Rolling Stone was talking about how Apple has been secretly, quote unquote, "funding"
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.080]   videos by Drake.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:05.120]   Tim Cook had input into the M.I.A.'s video and I still would love to hear back on this.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:08.040]   What could Tim Cook tell M.I.A.?
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:11.920]   I think you got to do the Roger Rabbit in that part, not the cabbage patch.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:12.920]   This is Tim.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:16.440]   I mean, they have been funding and getting in deeply involved.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.480]   That's my point, exactly.
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.880]   So that's the strategy, right?
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.720]   These suck up to the artists.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:24.120]   By the way, the artists are more important than the music industry because the artists
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:28.920]   will ultimately will drive this, not capital records.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.600]   So suck up to the artists, make them happy.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.240]   And if you make the music industry happy too, that's not so bad.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.920]   But those connections are, is that why they want to buy title?
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.640]   And by the way, that's a rumor.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:38.840]   Did Apple even confirm that?
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.440]   I think that they didn't say that.
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.440]   No, absolutely not.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.680]   But it would kind of make sense.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:44.200]   Tim, it's not a lot of subscribers.
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.240]   You don't buy it for the subs, do you?
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.920]   And by the way, if you buy title, you don't get the deals either, right?
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:56.000]   Because Prince's deal, for instance, with title is with title and doesn't get transferred
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.120]   to a new owner.
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.120]   Those are all renegotiated typically.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:01.320]   Probably depends on the different contracts.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.320]   Typically, typically.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:07.160]   Also, Rolling Stone is all about Larry Jackson, who is one of the people who is in charge
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:08.560]   of Apple's original music content.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:13.880]   And he was talking about Tim Cook, contributing to the MIA's, Borders video, Andrei's Hotline
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:17.960]   Bling video, Taylor Swift's tour movie and the weekends can't feel my face.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.960]   Those were all funded by Apple.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.880]   Well, there you go.
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:22.880]   Right?
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:26.360]   The thing is that for Apple, it would be almost a rounding error to completely compete
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:29.320]   head to head with every record company there if they wanted to.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:32.360]   They just wanted to say, hey, let's sign Taylor Swift.
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.840]   Because a lot of these, the more established ones like Taylor Swift, have their own publishing
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:36.840]   company at this point.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:37.840]   They're not.
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:41.240]   The music industry is more of a distribution method for them.
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.240]   And the question is, what is it?
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.640]   How much of a future is a distribution that's there?
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:45.640]   Right.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:48.760]   Well, when you look at a Katy Perry who's got 90 million followers, what does she need
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.160]   from her record company?
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.160]   Nothing.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.160]   Nothing.
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:59.080]   And that's the, she could tweet that she's got a new album and she'll sell a million.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.960]   You know how music shows us get a lot of downloads, right?
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.000]   Well, and Beyonce and all the big, the big stars today.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.560]   Right.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:11.400]   And that's why if you're Apple, you go to Drake Direct, you go to the weekend.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:15.000]   And I think the part of this is this embrace of having them get that there could be a better
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   side as they negotiate the next deal with the record companies.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   Sure.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.640]   Because a lot of them are caught in these three or five year.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.920]   Talk about business models.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:27.080]   The record company is not exactly a great business model either.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.080]   Right.
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:30.440]   I mean, he's historically the only so much though.
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:31.440]   Right.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:37.560]   I don't think we have the story about from last year about how we're all yankovic finally
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:43.840]   after what 17 years is now has now completed the terms of his original album on track.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:44.840]   You're kidding.
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.200]   He's doing his contractual obligation album now.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.440]   No, no, he's done.
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.440]   He's free.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:56.120]   And now he's, and now that is now, that's 2014, 15, 16, he's basically saying that he
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:53:01.000]   may not necessarily be releasing albums anymore, that it may make more sense for him to release
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   individual tracks.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   Sure.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.040]   I mean, the whole business is completely different.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:10.680]   The question is not like, the question is now, what can Apple give to Taylor Swift that
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:14.880]   would not be greater than what Taylor Swift would bring to Apple?
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:18.160]   And there's a question about how much of that deal would be great.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:24.200]   You're going to give me X, X, X options on Apple stock over the next five years.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.360]   We're going to, here's what I'm going to do.
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:30.360]   I'm going to do and I'm going to be, my parents is going to be limited to X.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:35.840]   Your window of exclusivity is going to be Y of new, what I'm thinking, what gets me
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:40.880]   most curious are new artists who are coming up who aren't growing up with necessarily
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:45.040]   the old style fantasies of I'm going to be the Rolling Stones.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:49.280]   I'm going to be making $100 million a year off my records and off my tours.
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:54.000]   These are people who basically are thinking about, I'm going to have my own music business
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.840]   called myband.com.
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:01.160]   And if we can make a good living wage and enough to put somebody into a 401k, that will be my
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:03.240]   definition of success.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:08.600]   And these people are going to think, well, why would I necessarily want to be, I'm sorry,
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:13.920]   they wouldn't necessarily not want to do a deal with Apple or with Google Music or with
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:18.160]   Amazon, but they would be like, let me take a look at other ways that I can distribute
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:21.400]   this that will actually work towards my business model.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:24.160]   Because I think that most of these people who are growing up who want to make a business
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:29.800]   of publishing music and touring, they're not thinking in terms of the way the music business
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.640]   was through the 1960s to the 1990s.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:37.000]   There's a great quote from a music manager who says, it's just a partnership to do cool
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.320]   stuff.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.520]   It's almost like getting paid to wake up and eat breakfast.
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:41.720]   You're going to do it anyway.
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:49.560]   Boy, it makes the beats acquisition look like a good thing in terms of the long-term strategy
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:50.560]   of this, right?
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:52.760]   Well, it kind of starts to make sense.
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:58.140]   You've got a kind of failing music service and a headphone business you didn't want,
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:03.360]   but what you got was Jimmy Iovine and relationships with the music industry and a long-term play
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:08.080]   that makes you the incumbent in the music business, right?
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:09.720]   Makes you the big boy.
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:13.040]   Like platform exclusives in the early days of console gaming.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:16.720]   And I think that the other thing is, Apple has a lot to gain by.
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:19.240]   They can do things that wouldn't make sense for the record industry.
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:24.200]   So for instance, Apple growing their installed base from the 15 million or whatever the number
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:28.040]   is right now to 100 million is worth a lot of money to Apple.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:31.960]   So exclusives can theoretically be worth a lot.
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:34.480]   So signing, let's say a Taylor Swift and saying, "Here's the deal.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:40.160]   We'll pay you a 15 million dollars for the exclusive for a year for your album or whatever,"
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:42.600]   plus all the sales that you would normally get.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.600]   This is a sign.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.600]   Apple is no law.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:47.840]   One of the things when we were talking about this on Sunday, I think that Apple used to
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:48.840]   be it was a hardware business.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.960]   It's not a hardware business anymore.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:58.160]   And so this is all part of a transition for Apple into a hybrid product business.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:03.440]   Yeah, content being a content business, being a cloud services business.
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.240]   Very different.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:11.840]   Well, I hope they don't move to the old saying about Hollywood is that they don't make movies,
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:12.840]   they make deals.
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:13.840]   Right.
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:22.120]   But if you think about it, the hardware business fueled all of this, obviously.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:27.240]   But until recently, the whole point was all of these synergies helped sell hardware.
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.840]   We kept saying that it's all about selling more iPhones.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:33.440]   But I think that we come to the time now in Apple's life cycle where it isn't anymore
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:34.440]   about that.
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.240]   It's revenue for customer and all these things help provide.
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.240]   It's revenue for customer, isn't that interesting?
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:39.240]   Right.
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:41.640]   But I think we're looking at the transition and I think of Apple manages that transition
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:45.640]   well because they're still making an enormous amount of money on the hardware, considerably
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:49.000]   more than what they're making on the software or the services.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.040]   But that won't always be the case.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.960]   I think there's a lot more upside for that.
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:57.000]   I think the one thing Apple does have to be careful of is actually going down this path
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   too quickly.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.200]   I think sometimes you think, oh, they could just because they really could just put $10
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:04.400]   billion into something and just push it down the path.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:07.760]   But one of the big advantages, for instance, one of the things that undermines Spotify's
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:12.680]   ability to claim any kind of antitrust is that Apple doesn't have the majority.
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:14.120]   It doesn't have a control state.
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:15.680]   It's a very competitive environment.
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:18.400]   And that really undermines all the arguments around antitrust.
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:22.320]   People can say, well, the iPhone is different, but it's still a phone.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.760]   And it's a minority phone.
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.240]   And I think that Apple, I think the one thing that--
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:28.160]   Apple's probably very careful to walk that line, aren't they?
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:30.160]   And I think that--
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.160]   It's a mutual man.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:34.040]   It's a 100 million users, let's say, with Apple Music.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:38.960]   And the next closest thing was $10 million, Apple would have all kinds of antitrust issues
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:40.440]   that they'd have to deal with.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:49.560]   And also, what seems to be a layman as antitrust is just simply the facts of life of a successful
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:51.840]   company entering your business.
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:56.960]   I mean, the most-- I was really sad, as a lot of people were last week, to learn that
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:03.400]   TechServe in New York is legendary, independent Apple store and service bay is closing.
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:09.080]   And it's not because of Apple as an antitrust corporation, it's that they have Apple stores
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:14.040]   and they're basically sucking every customer away from any independent repair outlet or
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:20.880]   any retail outlet, not necessarily because they're mean and they're unfair, but because
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:27.480]   they decided that it's very valuable for the company to not only be providing that part
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:33.320]   of the customer experience, but also to capture customer data in the form of they can actually
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:37.760]   take a look at almost every iPhone that breaks, almost every MacBook that breaks and use that
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.360]   to inform the design of new hardware.
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:44.280]   And they really believe that's going to be part of the beautiful experience, that beautiful
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:47.000]   package that they deliver to their customers.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:53.640]   And if TechServe goes away-- sorry, the fact that TechServe had to go away, it's not antitrust,
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:56.520]   that's just unfortunate facts of life in the business world.
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:59:00.120]   Although, and by the way, TechServe was a sponsor and I too am saddened by it.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:03.560]   I think it's a good thing for the ecosystem to have these third party.
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:08.520]   TechServe was in its way even more fun to be at than any Apple store.
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:10.520]   Well, I think of my friend Tom Santos--
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.720]   You think they could have a couple of bottle of Coke at an Apple store.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:17.160]   I think of my friend Tom Santos who ran MacAdam in San Francisco, which was a great
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:23.640]   Apple var and independent Apple store, and that was where I would go to buy my Mac Cube,
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:24.640]   for instance.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.760]   You were trying to dash when we have to.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:33.000]   It was the tradition in every household in Massachusetts that you would drive about
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.960]   an hour to Nashua, tax-free New Hampshire.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:41.160]   You would save enough money on state sales tax to pay for gas and have a really nice
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.960]   dinner once you get there.
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:43.960]   And so that's why it gets--
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:48.680]   But Tom always complained, and I think a lot of the vars did complain, that Apple would
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:54.640]   not-- they would play some games in not getting them the latest stuff right away, undercutting
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:56.360]   them a little bit in other ways.
[00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:02.480]   And of course, once the Apple stores gained steam, it was hopeless for these guys.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.400]   And just the same way that I think losing Spotify would be a loss for us as end users.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:11.360]   I think losing those independent resellers is a loss for us as end users.
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:16.040]   And I mean, I don't think Apple's being mean about it, but I do think it's a shame.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.040]   It's a shame, right, exactly.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.040]   I think that--
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.040]   Just like--
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.040]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.880]   You have to see where you fit into an ecosystem, where you are.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:28.560]   And I think that a value-added reseller needs to find how they're really going to add value.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:32.640]   What are they going to be-- what part of the market can they serve that going to an Apple
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.640]   store--
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:38.080]   Like as a video or audio professional, going to an Apple store does not help other than
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.480]   buying the base component.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:43.680]   So how do you package those things together in a way that makes sense?
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.680]   And I think that--
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:47.160]   Well, I think TechServe was doing a pretty good job.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.600]   They were doing system integration.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:52.280]   They were-- I mean, they were really a great-- they added a lot of value.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:56.160]   Yeah, there's lots of what Alex is saying.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.600]   Another thing-- but another part is that sometimes it really just--
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:02.360]   It's not enough, seems like-- it seems like you're reacting to a change in the weather
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.160]   that you really can't do anything about.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.440]   It's not any fault of your own.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:10.560]   If Walmart comes into your town and they are-- it's the one that was super stores that
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:16.840]   is selling groceries and vegetables and they have a tire store and all these other sort
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:22.000]   of things, it doesn't matter that you are objectively providing better produce at
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.480]   competitive prices and better personalized service, people are going to see Walmart that's
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:28.080]   going to be closer to the highway.
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.120]   Yeah, there's very little you can do.
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.600]   It really is like nail boards over the windows.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.600]   You will either--
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:38.960]   Well, and some consumers-- well, musicians probably are rooting for the end of the death
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:43.040]   of Spotify and increasingly rooting for the success of Apple.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:48.600]   Just as probably initially authors and publishers rooted for the success of Amazon, be careful
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:53.560]   what you wish for though because a shrinking ecosystem and a monoculture is not long run
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:54.880]   good for anybody.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:58.040]   The other thing that's happening is that-- and this happens more in video-- but companies
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.360]   might want to do their own services.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.720]   They might decide that this record label is going to put out its own service because it
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.240]   doesn't have to pay any percentage or share any revenue with anybody and they barely do
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.400]   it with artists.
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.280]   And then movie companies might do the same thing.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.720]   You'll have to go to WarnerBrothers.com to get the Warner Brothers catalog.
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:16.360]   And that'll be horrible for consumers because right now we sort of have iTunes gets us almost
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:19.000]   everything or Google Play gets us almost everything.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.640]   And I think the math on that is going to get harder and harder to justify.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:28.280]   I mean, so it's one thing when people are getting a small number of dollars right now
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.920]   at 15 million or 30 million paid subscribers.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:35.760]   But when you get to 100 million, 150 million, 200 million, whoever gets to that number,
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:39.360]   those numbers get to be pretty big numbers even if they're small percentages and it becomes
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.600]   difficult to think that you're going to go do that on your own.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:45.480]   Now there's a handful of people like Peter Gabriel who sell all of this stuff I think pretty
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.480]   much directly.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.240]   And he doesn't really get a lot of air play.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.320]   He doesn't really get a lot of, but I'm sure he makes plenty.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.120]   And that's the way he likes to control it.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:58.240]   But I think that for most people that model is going to become more and more difficult
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:00.640]   as the number of subscribers grow.
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:04.560]   I mean, it's one thing when subscriptions were a small percentage of the market but they
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.840]   are about to become 80% of the market.
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:11.360]   And giving those up will be very difficult to survive on or to at least really make a
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:11.920]   good living on.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:21.760]   So it's for instance, and I think that's very, that's not very different from the careers
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:27.000]   and journalism these days where it just simply, there is still opportunities for success as
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   a matter of fact.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.440]   And from some perspectives or even greater opportunities for success than there were
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:36.880]   when I started out like a quarter, God damn it, a quarter century ago.
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:45.360]   But it's the definition of success has changed where if I had pursued a traditional path,
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:50.640]   let's say I got started even five years earlier, if I were five years older, my idea of success.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:57.680]   It'd be quite Silverman and with my tech history.
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:01.520]   My end game goal would be I'm going to be an executive editor, I'm going to be a publisher,
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:05.160]   I'm going to be an executive at the company that works for, I'm going to have a job of
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:09.400]   responsibility, I'm going to have a suite on the top floor with the ebony, everything
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.800]   in the solid gold, whatever.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:17.680]   Now it's more like I can do my journalism and I can also the fact if I if this column
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:21.920]   is successful or if my traditional journalism is successful, I will have other opportunities
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:28.160]   to make money doing other things that support and surround that journalism as well.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:31.400]   So it's it's a music I think is going to be exactly the same way.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:35.640]   Again, I don't think that the people who are growing up today who are 14, 15, 16 years
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:39.520]   old composing music in their bedrooms that are thinking that I'm going to be making a
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:43.320]   million dollars every three months off of album sales and concert tours.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:47.920]   I think that their goals that they can define success as I'm going to if I'm really wildly
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:52.880]   successful, I'm going to make maybe $200,000 a year, which is I just make a living.
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.560]   Yeah, which is which is which is good living.
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:59.720]   That's yeah, that's that's if you don't get into to cocaine or folk dancing, you can
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:04.160]   get tired age 40 because your your time will be completely funded is focused on a very
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.760]   expensive habit.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:07.960]   Very special shoes.
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.840]   Can you eat for food dancing?
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.240]   It's the same in immediate.
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.880]   I think they'd what their dream is.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:16.160]   Can I how can I get Tim Cook to advise me on my music video?
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:20.920]   Yeah, I mean, I think I think that's where a lot of these these these companies go astray.
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:26.080]   They really think that they're going to say, Hey, I got I know how I can keep these people
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:30.440]   on board, I'll just dangle these really, really lucrative recording contracts with our publishing
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:33.680]   company, not realizing that these people don't care about that anymore.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:37.160]   They'll say, we'll make you an exclusive and we'll make sure that you're available on our
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.840]   our online store.
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:39.840]   So that's great.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:44.200]   So and I'll be getting all the data back on who's buying my music so I can contact them
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:47.360]   about my upcoming tours are the things well, no, that's proprietary.
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.680]   We we protect the security of our customers data.
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:50.680]   Say, well, thank you.
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:54.000]   I don't want to deal with Apple then because I would much rather have I got I got an email
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   this morning.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.680]   I didn't notice because I was out of breakfast from Louis C K's like auto mail box saying
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:04.520]   that Oh, by the way, I'm doing a secret comedy set at the Paradise Theater in Boston.
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:08.640]   So smart tickets go and tickets are only available by going to the box office physically
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:12.760]   and buying tickets and they're available as from the moment that this email goes out and
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.000]   the show is tonight at eight.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   So smart.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.440]   That's that stuff that he can do because he has he people are buying things directly
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.440]   from him.
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:23.720]   Someone like the Louis C K who has the ability to say, I don't want a deal with that.
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:27.800]   If Apple said I want if Apple offered him a deal that was different from the deal that
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:34.560]   he has at FX, which is basically I agree to make TV shows for you and you don't have anything
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:39.240]   to say about it except for that you're going to be paying me a very small amount of money.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:42.040]   Apple might say, but Tim has some notes for you.
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.040]   He's Tim.
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.040]   Like I don't care Tim.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.280]   Tim's not a comedian.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.880]   I don't care what this rolling stone articles really interesting.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:54.080]   They point out that Apple has an exclusive with Chance the Rapper and his coloring book.
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:07:00.120]   You can only hear an Apple music because chance has no label and is not selling downloads.
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:05.360]   They talk about Larry Jackson who's running all of this and he was at an airscope with
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:11.280]   Jimmy Iovine and Jackson sign Lana Del Rey and says that because Del Rey was an artist
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:15.280]   made for and by the Internet.
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:19.800]   So rather than spending money on radio, he convinced Interscope to channel all the budget
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:23.920]   into videos to appear on YouTube.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:29.040]   And in fact, without any singles and radio rotation, her Apple-born had debuted at number
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.040]   two on Billboard and went platinum.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.560]   Well, and one of the things you can do that now, you can do that.
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:34.560]   That's the future.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:41.880]   And one of the things to think about is that as music gets bigger, whether it's whatever
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:45.240]   subscription service gets really big, it really becomes the next radio.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:48.440]   And right now, I think the next radio is really YouTube at the moment.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:53.520]   But I think that a lot of us don't really listen to radio stations anymore.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:08:00.880]   You just hear my kids just constantly running around calling out play, whatever.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.680]   And that's their experience.
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:04.800]   They don't have any experience of...
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:08.600]   You just look at this next generation.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:12.400]   They don't have an experience of listening to the radio.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:17.520]   No, in fact, one of the record executives that quote in this article says, "Apple's the
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.720]   MTV of now."
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.400]   Apple is as important in music now as MTV was in the '80s and the '90s.
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:25.920]   I think that's probably true.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.560]   And YouTube, maybe as well, right?
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.960]   Although YouTube is not always official in music, again.
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:36.840]   Well, what's interesting, Apple funding videos is very interesting, isn't it?
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:43.720]   Do they want to become the official place like Vivo is for music videos?
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:46.600]   Is there an Apple.com/trailers?
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.600]   Is there a...
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.600]   Or is it on iTunes, I guess?
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.600]   I think they want...
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:53.600]   I think over time, they want to keep on having more and more exclusives on music.
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.040]   I mean, that's how you grow that number.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:59.560]   So I think an exclusive video is the easy way to do that first, but being exclusive to
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:03.040]   and showing that that's got some legs and it generates revenue.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:07.280]   I think they are doing it very slowly and very carefully because the other thing is that...
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:10.400]   Obviously, I mean, I think that you can't be in the music industry and not realize what
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:14.000]   Apple could do to you at any minute.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.040]   But at the same time, you don't want to scare everybody off.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.640]   I think they're happy to have a subscription service.
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:22.400]   I think the industry was trying to hold that out for a little while.
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:28.320]   And so I think that Apple is going very cautiously toward that, but I think at some point they
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:32.600]   start to, especially with these new bands that just aren't even making it to radio,
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:37.160]   aren't even making it to releasing CDs, I think that that's going to be a place where
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:40.400]   it gets really interesting where Apple just starts sucking them in the way YouTube has
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.400]   in some ways.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:45.640]   You know, a lot of these, whether it's Facebook or YouTube or Apple, I think all of them are
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:49.800]   really looking at how do we build the relationship with these bands before they become the next
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.240]   Beyonce and Taylor Swift.
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:54.320]   I don't know.
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.320]   I have to...
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:58.800]   There are times where I have to be very, very clear that I'm not saying that a proposition
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:03.920]   is wrong, only that I don't understand the logic behind that proposition.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:08.920]   I still can't figure out what Apple can tell an up-becoming artist.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:12.080]   I'm not talking about someone who's already has a real good career growing.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:16.640]   I'm talking about, again, the person that is 14 right now, but is going to be a huge
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:21.040]   star when they're 17 or 18, I don't understand what they can offer them that would be better
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:25.880]   than exploiting whatever resources they can exploit independently.
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.240]   Well, I think that you give...
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:30.880]   Ask Chance the Rapper.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:36.600]   Yeah, but I think that providing PR, if you're a little band trying to get out there, and
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:41.000]   we'll say it's not 15 million subscribers, let's say it's 100 million subscribers, and
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.720]   100 million subscribers, we're going to give you X amount of money upfront, which is what
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:48.280]   the record companies do, but we're also going to...
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:51.960]   Maybe we're going to give you this much money upfront, and then we're going to promote you
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.200]   on the front pages.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:56.120]   We're going to put you on one, we're going to put you on...
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:02.320]   There's all these other things that Apple can do for you that take a lot of the risk
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:03.600]   out of you getting off the ground.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:06.240]   That's pretty clearly the point of beats one, right?
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:09.960]   How many artists can they do that for?
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:10.960]   Sorry?
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.960]   I mean, how many artists are...
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.960]   I'm not thousands, obviously.
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.720]   Well, I mean, it's always been that way, right?
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:17.720]   It's always been that way, right?
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:21.640]   You've always had one of the eight lucky bands that have blessed you by Apple.
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:22.640]   You actually...
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:23.640]   So, MCA...
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:28.000]   I'm just saying that I like the YouTube model where you get...
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.600]   You're popular and successful because you have 5 million people subscribing to your channel,
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:38.200]   and every one of your pieces of music gets at least 2 million views.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.200]   And nobody...
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.320]   You didn't have to cut a deal with anybody.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:43.160]   You didn't have to get blessed.
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.600]   You didn't have to sign any contracts.
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:49.240]   I will give you something exclusive, and you will promote me, and you will...
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:52.240]   Please, oh, please, big corporation, help make me a success.
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.920]   Please help me find my audience.
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.600]   It's the audience finding this person.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.640]   It just seems like an old fan of...
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:05.680]   Yeah, but ask Jack Conti of Pomplamoose, how YouTube fame and stardom made him no money
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.200]   at all.
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.200]   That's why he founded Patreon.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:12.120]   Remember, they did a tour, and they lost their shirt.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:17.520]   And I think Pomplamoose is a great band, and they did well on YouTube, but it wasn't
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:19.520]   enough for them to make a living.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:24.960]   Well, and I think the thing is that the big advantages...
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.440]   The record companies have been screwing these artists for a long time.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:32.840]   I had a set of friends that were in Pittsburgh, and they put together a band, and they got
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:38.200]   signed by MCA, and then MCA paid for them to put their album together.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:43.200]   And then MCA just got bought by somebody else who wasn't interested in releasing it, but
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.440]   still owned all the copyrights.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:47.400]   And so basically they lost access to all their songs.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.400]   And if you don't think that...
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:52.120]   And that was happening probably a thousand bands a year, or like that.
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.280]   You know, like just make sure that's not like an isolated thing.
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:56.920]   When I was working in the industry, there were bands that were constantly getting driven
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.600]   under by these record companies.
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:05.000]   And so there are a lot of reasons why these guys don't necessarily need to be part of
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.440]   that little wheel.
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:13.720]   In addition to that, how many songs can you actually write at two million views a pop?
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:14.960]   That's a couple thousand dollars.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:19.320]   It's not enough, that's maybe enough to help with your parents rent.
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:23.320]   But it's not going to be millions of views as not going, it's just not enough.
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:28.320]   What you want to do is turn that millions of views into either sponsorship, some people
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:29.320]   paying for something.
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.680]   Which to tour, into a successful tour.
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:36.520]   Or into a tour, or into those types of things, or into a record contract.
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:39.600]   And that's what everyone's trying to do, and what if Apple becomes that record contract?
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:40.960]   I don't think the record contract...
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:41.960]   Well, okay.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.560]   How long would it take for Apple to start screwing these artists?
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.240]   Not as badly as MCA.
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:50.960]   I don't think they do though, because the thing is that Apple...
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.640]   The thing is, is that Apple has...
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:56.080]   This is a much different thing, because Apple is...
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:00.360]   I would argue that it's a different culture, where it'll be very much like everyone's going
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:01.360]   to get...
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.960]   You know, you're going to give you this great deal to get started.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:08.920]   Apple doesn't need to necessarily twist every little piece of blood out of you to get it,
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:11.920]   because they just want to do increase the number of subscribers that they had.
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:16.400]   And so, what they're trying to get out of it is very different.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.200]   Because they don't have to make money.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.040]   They don't have a guy there that's got to make money from you.
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.200]   They're playing this bigger thing.
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:27.920]   And you get this opportunity now, as a man, you still have to promote yourself.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:31.000]   I mean, Apple's going to give you a head start, because they want to make money on that,
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.080]   and they want to expand their service based on you.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:35.600]   But then you have to go out and promote yourself.
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:38.720]   You have to do all the things that you would have to do otherwise, except that every time
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:44.400]   someone watches your video, you get paid for it.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:47.680]   And you do that to some degree with YouTube when they watch your videos.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:51.840]   But it's a lot easier to listen to it, say, "Hey, I want to listen to this band than it
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:52.840]   is to find you on YouTube."
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:53.840]   No one...
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:58.200]   Look, artists are just very confused, at least as confused as we are about what it looks
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:02.400]   like to be successful artists in this day and age.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.000]   And I do agree with Andy that I think that is not going to be the same.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   It's not...
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.720]   We're not going to see that many more is going on.
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:08.720]   And we don't know what's going to happen.
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:13.600]   Well, also with media, also with apps, almost every industry where you create content.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.200]   Or every industry.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.240]   Like the razor blade industry.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:22.240]   Think about, you know, if you were Gillette and you're looking at a company like Harry's,
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:24.280]   you got to say, "What the hell?"
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:25.600]   We're being disrupted.
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:26.600]   We're being disrupted.
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.600]   And we don't like it.
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:33.800]   Harry's is a place where you can go and get great razor blades at half the cost of a Gillette.
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:34.800]   What a pro.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:35.800]   What a pro.
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:37.720]   Oh, I was trying not to call it out.
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:39.400]   I was in there like, "Should I say something?
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.400]   That was amazing."
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.400]   What a segue.
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:43.480]   I mean, it was like a beat to beat segue.
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:48.400]   But it's not an accident because really the people who advertise in these shows are the
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:53.200]   same people who are benefiting from this new disruptive economy, right?
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:59.640]   And, you know, with the exception of Ford, all of our advertisers are people who are
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:02.040]   saying, you know, there's a new way of doing things.
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:08.480]   Why go to the drug store and pay, you know, $8 a blade when you get it for $2 a blade
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:09.480]   from Harry's.
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:10.480]   And these are great blades.
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:12.600]   They bought the factory in Germany that makes them.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:16.000]   High quality, high performance German blades are crafted by shaving experts.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.640]   The flex hinge contours to your face.
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.760]   They got the aloe lubricating strip.
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.360]   Gives you a nice finish.
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.200]   It's a great shave factory direct.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:29.280]   So half the price of the leading brands, they ship right to your doorstep.
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:32.600]   Over a million guys have made the switch to Harry's.
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:33.760]   It's a wonderful website.
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:38.240]   Go visit because they have really started to expand their product range.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:39.920]   They have an iOS app.
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:42.560]   See, they don't mind 30% Apple.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:48.720]   They're thrilled that you can in four taps, you can set up your Harry's account and start
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.880]   getting those blades and get one of the great Harry kits.
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:51.880]   I use the Winston.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:53.560]   I'm a, I'm a Winston guy.
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:56.080]   A lot of people like Steve Gibson likes to Truman.
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:59.880]   He likes the kind of more plastic handle because it's grippy.
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:03.080]   They've got a nice new grippy finish, by the way.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.000]   When you get the kit, it's very affordable.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.440]   $15 for the Truman kit.
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:09.480]   You get a razor handle, three blades.
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:12.000]   You get your choice of shave cream or foaming shave gel.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.480]   And it's not a sample trial size, it's full size and it's wonderful.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:19.520]   And then you're set up, you subscribe.
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:24.320]   By the way, they now have a really nice facelotion that I use.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.760]   I've been walking in and of course I'm not going to walk in with that fireball in the
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:33.720]   sky beating down on you without putting on some SPF 15 there on my face.
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:34.720]   It's non-greasy.
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:35.720]   It's lightweight.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:36.720]   Hydrates protects.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:39.480]   It all comes right to your door.
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:41.520]   This is, remember the milk man?
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:43.040]   That was so great.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:47.880]   The milk man came and they gave you and they brought you milk and you would have milk.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:50.040]   This is like the milk man for razor blades.
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:52.640]   They come to your door.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:57.200]   The only thing missing is the horse drawn carriage and the little clink of bottles as they put
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:58.400]   them on your doorstep.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:01.800]   Harry's trying out harries.com/macbreak and back.
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.760]   In fact, what we're going to do is we're going to give you $5 off your first purchase.
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:12.280]   $5 off your first purchase when you go to harries.com/macbreak.
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:13.480]   The old is new again.
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:14.960]   The milk man is back only this time.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.960]   He's bringing you razors and shave cream.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:18.960]   Harry's.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.400]   I made that up.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:23.200]   I don't know if they're going to like that or not at the Harry's factory.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.800]   Did he just call us milk men?
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:27.800]   Milk people.
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:31.280]   I missed the milk man.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.400]   Any of you guys old enough to remember milk men?
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:35.760]   I've seen it on TV like when they bring their glass.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.320]   I've seen it on TV.
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:38.320]   They bring like glass bottles.
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.120]   I remember when they still had milk.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:44.000]   We were a white suit with a black bow tight like the good humor guy and a little special
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   hat.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.280]   Our culture was differently.
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:49.600]   We went to Perrette's and we got milk in plastic bags and you put those plastic bags into
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.600]   a plastic holder.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:55.400]   And that my friend is white Canada will never be number one.
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:57.920]   Belgium Canada.
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:04.400]   I mainly know that that career from I guess the modern worship.
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:08.840]   I've been running about technology since you were nothing but a gleam in the razor delivery
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.880]   person's eye.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:15.680]   We had to carry our razors in our hand across soap over mountains barefoot.
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:16.680]   Up hill.
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:23.280]   I just couldn't help but think about all the 1970s porn.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:25.080]   The milk bands.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:32.240]   You knew it was trouble for the milk man when they started selling things like milk shampoo.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:35.160]   That was when you knew they weren't making enough money in the milk trade.
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:37.280]   They had a branch out.
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:43.920]   If you want to see one of the best music videos of all time.
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:50.320]   Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra dressed as milkmen as the as Tommy Dorsey and his all milkman
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:51.320]   orchestra backing.
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.120]   I can't forget her name.
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:59.200]   But in the like a 1940s musical number called milk man keep those bottles quiet.
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.200]   Nancy Walker.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.200]   Go to Morgenstern's mom.
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:05.200]   Keep those bottles quiet.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:08.480]   I got a shot with the gun that great a riot.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.840]   That is a nasty walker.
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:14.520]   It's like a girl who works on a war production assembly line who can't sleep because the milk
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:16.520]   man keeps clinking the bottles.
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:21.360]   And so it's just these people these nicely dressed men in trombones and dressed as milk
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:22.360]   men like.
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:23.360]   Wow.
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:28.640]   There was a kind of nuttiness that I'd like us to tap back into that we should bring that
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:29.640]   back.
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:31.120]   We should.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:38.440]   It was from the show Broadway rhythm with George Murphy and you can get it.
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:42.080]   Get it on the sheet music for eight dollars.
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:46.560]   Look man keep those bottles quiet.
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.560]   All right.
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:53.240]   Apple is is trademarking the words night shift.
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.480]   For music or for technology.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.480]   I forgot how many companies they are now.
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:59.920]   Wasn't it a wasn't a TV show the night shift.
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:02.640]   Harry and you're thinking about the night court.
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:03.640]   That's an up thing.
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:04.640]   It was a movie.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:05.640]   Night shift is a movie.
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:06.640]   It was a fun.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:13.040]   Michael and Henry and rewind what it is Batman and the font Batman and the fonts together
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.040]   at last.
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:15.040]   Show title.
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:17.480]   It was a morgue right they worked in a morgue.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:18.480]   They were running the ring.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.760]   They were running a prostitution ring out of a morgue.
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:24.960]   What a t who pitched that idea and it was a seven year's league.
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:25.960]   Okay.
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:31.120]   We got the funds and we got this young kid named Keaton and they're going to be running
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.120]   a prostitution ring out of a morgue.
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:37.160]   The guy is not the guy from bosom buddies.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.160]   That's okay.
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.160]   He's still very funny.
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.160]   He's still funny.
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:46.880]   Anyway night shift which is that Apple thing that makes everything orange because it's nighttime.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:50.040]   It shifts you towards the warmer part of the spectrum at night.
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:51.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:55.200]   App apparently is filed a trademark on it.
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.200]   A lot of stuff is profound.
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.640]   I'm going to anytime you come up with a branding name your first job is.
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:21:59.640]   You're going to trade.
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:00.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:01.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.480]   And they may or may not get it.
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:06.120]   There's a period of comment.
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:10.320]   But if it catches on and you're the person who didn't file that trademark boy, you're
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.320]   in trouble.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.320]   Yeah.
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:13.320]   Yeah.
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:16.040]   And you got lawyers on retainer to do stuff like that.
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:22.480]   Snapchat a little worried because adults are now using it and they're afraid it's going
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:27.000]   to your parents are on Snapchat kids and that's going to scare people away.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.120]   I feel victimized by this because Leo and I are both on Snapchat and I feel like they're
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:32.120]   singling us out and trying to old shame us.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.720]   That's Michelle Obama's on Snapchat.
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:39.440]   According to the Wall Street Journal, 14% of US smartphone users aged 35 and above you
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:40.440]   Snapchat.
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:43.240]   That's up from 2% just three years ago.
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:44.240]   It's those lenses Leo.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:47.760]   If you can like if another app let you put flowers in your hair or burn your head off
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:50.360]   using it but you can't.
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:57.000]   Wall Street Journal's headline Snapchat teen fans wins as app catches on with their folks.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.720]   Look, I've got a dog face daughter.
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:00.720]   I've got a dog face daughter.
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:01.720]   Mom put that away.
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:03.360]   Oh, it's so true though.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.120]   Oh, MG my mom.
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.280]   My mom.
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:07.280]   So what do they do?
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:08.280]   They go to the next thing right there.
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:11.640]   They're not going to be where where mom and dad are.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.520]   Drive them back to Friendster.
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:17.240]   They might go back to actually writing letters and sending sending photos with seals with
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:19.880]   big wax seals on them.
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:26.520]   You know when I was a kid I had a little ceiling wax and a little a little signet ring
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:27.520]   with an L in it.
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:28.520]   I had a Chinese one.
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:31.040]   I used to get when you got a Chinese name.
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:34.040]   Oh yeah, you had the block or whatever they called it.
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:35.320]   Those are awesome.
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:36.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:39.920]   Apple patents a way to stop you from recording video at concerts.
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:40.920]   Who cares?
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:41.920]   I don't care.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:42.920]   It's just a patent.
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:43.920]   Just a patent.
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:48.720]   The only thing that I care about with that is that the control aspect of that is terrifying
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:51.400]   if it actually happened because it's not concerts.
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:52.400]   That's the problem.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.600]   It's political uprisings.
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:58.840]   All kinds of things where the government can turn it to turn up.
[01:23:58.840 --> 01:23:59.840]   Oh yeah.
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:00.840]   Is it a jammer?
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:01.840]   What is it?
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:04.920]   It's the ability to give out a signal that basically the iPhone and the operating system
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:07.560]   would basically be inside the signals.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:12.400]   It's sort of like how if you try to scan a $20 bill there is by law something in the
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:16.240]   code that says oh that's a $20 bill I'm not going to do anything with it.
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.760]   And so it's a similar sort of thing.
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:22.160]   There would be a custom light array that does some sort of puts out an invisible light that
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:26.520]   would be detected by the camera sensor that would say oh I've got the I've got the a
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:30.280]   rich person doesn't want their picture taken light on so therefore I'm not going to let
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:32.920]   this poor person take their picture.
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:39.720]   But it's just a patent and Apple patents like a good a cajillion things and God only knows
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:43.240]   how they could possibly sell this as a feature.
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:44.240]   Good news.
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.640]   You know how the times when you're really embarrassed when you post a picture from a
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:54.320]   concert then later on like the Rolling Stones emailing say gosh that was we really look
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.240]   bad that night we wish you hadn't taken it.
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:59.120]   You know how embarrassed and you had to apologize on.
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:03.640]   We've solved the problem for you and that the your camera that you own will not be able
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:08.320]   to take a picture under any circumstances that someone who has the money for this light array
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:10.080]   would not want to do.
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:13.320]   They patent a million things a lot of people are making too many too many column inches
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:17.120]   about too many think pieces about Apple run a muck.
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:21.120]   Well, I think that I think that that it would be frightening if it got used in the wrong
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.120]   way.
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:25.000]   I think that from concerts I would love to sit you know have people not be able to pick
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.360]   up their phone and take pictures because it's just annoying.
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:28.920]   I mean it has nothing to do with them.
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:34.000]   The content is just as a user as someone who wants to enjoy a concert having like 80
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.040]   phones taking bad pictures that they'll never look at again.
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.880]   Stop them texting in movie theaters.
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:40.880]   That's what you need that light to do.
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:41.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:45.880]   Here is a go ahead.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:50.080]   My idea is like when I win the Powerball lottery for half a billion dollars I'm going
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:51.080]   to have a move.
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:53.320]   I'm going to buy a movie theater that's going to be my losing business that I will just
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:54.320]   enjoy having.
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:58.320]   And one of the reasons why it's going to be a huge success though is that it's going
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.840]   to be Wednesday night is official.
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:06.600]   We don't care be animals text talk loudly because there are people who actually want
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:09.200]   to have a living room experience where they don't care.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:14.600]   But then Thursday night there is you have to gentlemen must be and everyone man or man
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:18.680]   or woman must be in some form of what they consider to be formal attire.
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:20.400]   No open toed shoes.
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:22.240]   There'll be no talking.
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:27.080]   There'll be people like in you there'll be ushers in uniform facing the crowd.
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:31.680]   And if we see anything out of line guess what the special like $5 a year pass card that
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:34.560]   you must have to actually buy ticket for Thursday night.
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:37.760]   We will revoke it and you will not be able to buy another ticket for Thursday night.
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:40.960]   I'll have one night for for people who enjoy being animals.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:44.720]   I don't mean that as an insult again it's fun to be whatever you want to be.
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:47.640]   Thursday night for people who want I want quiet.
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:51.760]   I want to be with people who are going to enjoy the movie and treat it with respect.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:53.240]   That's how you change the world.
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.240]   It's the purge.
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.240]   It's the purge.
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:27:03.000]   The evil has teamed up with Weezer and Trent Reznor to make an ambient soundtrack to celebrate
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.280]   the Juno mission that arrived in Jupiter.
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:09.920]   And I looked out and was reaching and just fascinating.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:10.920]   Is that me?
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:11.920]   What I saw.
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:13.920]   Making that noise?
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:15.080]   Here this is it.
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.480]   It's not like that.
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:18.760]   It's very head Brussels bros.
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:22.160]   There you go.
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:28.840]   After a five year journey from Earth, NASA's unmanned solar powered Juno satellite inserts
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:30.840]   itself into orbit.
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:31.840]   Okay.
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:38.880]   Now if you sync up Dark Side of the Moon to disframe, Apple Music presents.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:42.240]   The creations of harmony.
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:43.240]   Is this an album?
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:47.320]   Can you buy this?
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:49.280]   Hi I'm Jeff Goldblum.
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:51.080]   I remember really for the best day.
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:52.080]   Pretty early age.
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:57.520]   We went on some trip far away, you know, into the mountains where there weren't many lights.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:04.040]   And I went outside at night and I looked up at Scott Bolton and I never principal investigators
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.040]   of Juno.
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:09.040]   This is on Apple's Apple Music site.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:16.480]   And I looked out and was reaching and just fascinated with what I saw and wondered how
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:21.520]   it worked.
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:22.520]   It's five year mission.
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:23.520]   Jupiter is so interesting.
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:25.520]   It's too boldly gone.
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:26.520]   It's so formed.
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:27.520]   Jupiter was the first planet.
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:28.520]   We're no probe.
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:29.520]   And so we're gone before.
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:33.240]   So we want to go back and try to understand how the planets were made.
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:36.560]   I mean, we're the stuff that made us come from.
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:39.480]   Jupiter kind of represents that first step.
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:42.880]   We can just remind people that it's not the one with the rings.
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:46.360]   We feel as though our work has not been for nothing.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:47.560]   But it is a gas giant.
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:48.560]   Am I wrong?
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:52.880]   It's really trying to understand nature and we're part of nature.
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:53.880]   I don't want to sing.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:59.000]   I was told things in strict confidence.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:06.680]   I don't want to lose access to more NASA press briefings.
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:08.360]   I think that's not Jupiter.
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:09.600]   But I might be wrong.
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:13.880]   Whether it be for themselves or for others.
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:19.480]   I remember looking at us as a wife's son of a girl.
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:21.080]   Here's Corinne Bailey Ray.
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:23.160]   She is a musician.
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:28.960]   She is uniquely equipped to dramatize this amazing mission.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:33.080]   She starts trying to describe a certain emotion.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:35.280]   Oh, Juno.
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:38.440]   Oh, Juno.
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:39.840]   Infinite space and how about you?
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:40.840]   The planet.
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:43.240]   You know, your own life and the life of you.
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:45.160]   It's pretty, but are we learning anything?
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:46.160]   That's a succulent.
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:47.160]   That is not.
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:48.920]   We're not learning anything, but is it...
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:50.400]   That's a monkey.
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:51.400]   That's a baby.
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:52.400]   Oh my God.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.400]   It's on Saturday.
[01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:54.400]   Where is spaceship Earth?
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:55.400]   Where is spaceship Earth?
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:56.400]   That's...
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:57.400]   Quinn...
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:58.400]   The musician.
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.400]   I've always been created by looking at space.
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:01.400]   Just...
[01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:02.400]   Understand that I'm a part of it.
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:03.400]   I'm a part of space.
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:04.400]   We're all a part of space.
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:06.400]   Making music was my own personal thing.
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:09.160]   It was like my diary.
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:10.800]   And there is a rover.
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:11.800]   The innovation comes from...
[01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:12.800]   Not a Juno rover.
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.800]   Analytical and creative thought.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:16.440]   Neither one can really make progress.
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:18.720]   Unless you've got both.
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:19.880]   Everybody's got to mix these.
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:21.400]   Were they selling these rovers now?
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.400]   We're in a funny forest.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:27.400]   Galileo was this great scientist who certainly changed our culture forever.
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:31.400]   Well, I have to leave Apple Music in order to make the purchase of that rover so I don't
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.400]   have to...
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:33.400]   Thirty percent of the...
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:36.400]   I mean, you couldn't do Juno.
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:40.400]   You couldn't even think of the idea of going and doing a mission unless you had both halves
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:41.400]   of that.
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:42.400]   Okay.
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:46.400]   I say so many of the best musicians I know have both of those things.
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:47.400]   Absolutely.
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.400]   They can trip out.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.400]   I mean, whimsical and romantic and lost.
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:51.400]   But they all...
[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:52.400]   Chants the rapper.
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:57.400]   I'm really technical and really nerdy and really clever and organized and, you know,
[01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:58.400]   music is repetition.
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:00.400]   You know, music is maths.
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:03.400]   And there's so many patterns in music.
[01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:07.400]   And if you would explore the theory of music, you end up pure maths.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:11.400]   Anything can be put in equation form and it's just...
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:12.400]   Alright, I've got enough.
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:14.400]   This is...
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:15.400]   This is...
[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:16.400]   We stop here.
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:18.400]   A live recipe is so much better than that.
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:19.400]   I know.
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.400]   I don't understand it, really.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:22.400]   I don't know.
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.400]   I don't know.
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:24.400]   I don't know.
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:25.400]   It's just...
[01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:26.400]   I don't know.
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.400]   It's been a lot of money.
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:29.400]   It's not my jam.
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.400]   How much money do you think they spent on that?
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.400]   You're a video production expert, Alex Lizzie.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.400]   I didn't see the whole thing, but I...
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:37.400]   A lot of money.
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:39.400]   That's half-million to million dollars.
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:40.400]   I mean, that's...
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:43.400]   You know, that's probably what it would take to plan it and build it.
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:44.400]   At least that's what we charge.
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:45.400]   It might be more.
[01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:46.400]   [laughter]
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:48.400]   You could have gotten a deal.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.400]   Go to the Pixel corner next time.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:54.400]   The problem is that with any of those things, it's hard to tell until you know what the creative
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:58.400]   cycle was, but if you look at each one of those locations, it's a shoot.
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:03.400]   It's a steady cam operator and a jib and lighting and people.
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:07.400]   I mean, every one of those shoots is $25,000 or $30,000 and that kind of thing.
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:10.400]   I mean, that's the interviews for the ones that are bigger.
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.400]   It could be more than that.
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:15.400]   Alex, I got 800 bucks.
[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:18.400]   How much can we make fun of that video for that budget?
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:19.400]   [laughter]
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:20.400]   You could do a lot.
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:21.400]   You just play it and talk over it.
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:23.400]   This is kind of like, "Did you do a honey badger version?"
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:24.400]   And, you know...
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:26.400]   [laughter]
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:33.400]   I think it would just be, we cut and paste that entire video, then we smash cut to like a
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:38.400]   kid, 11th grader, and a science class giving his oral report, and then the teacher just
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:42.400]   likely saying, "You didn't do any of the reading, did you, son?"
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:43.400]   [laughter]
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.400]   You just said, "Is it me?"
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:46.400]   It's supposed to be.
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:50.400]   I think it's this attempt to take something that is not music-based and then make it music-based
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:55.400]   because it's in the music platform, you know, which is, that's the part that's the
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:56.400]   the oddest part.
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:33:00.400]   I love the idea of producing really high quality videos about NASA.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.400]   I pretty much can...
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:07.400]   I would approve all of that forever, you know, because this is my favorite thing.
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:13.400]   But I think that it's the forced piece of tying it together with music because it's a little
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:14.400]   more complicated.
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:15.400]   Spaceship Earth.
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:16.400]   It's just not my jam, I'll just say.
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:23.400]   Apple has released four new applications for people using iOS 10 beta with animated emojis,
[01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:26.400]   including this one, "I can't wait to get Classic Mac."
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:29.400]   That was in the developer's seed.
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:31.400]   They've just made it an independent download now.
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:34.400]   But you have to be using iOS 10 to use it?
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:36.400]   Yeah, so these are examples of the sticker packs.
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:39.800]   One of the things they announced is that as part of the iMessage apps, if you don't know
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:43.600]   how to code but you're an artist, you can make stickers and you can make them either
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:48.400]   in a painting application for static stickers or you can make them an Apple's motion for
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:49.400]   animated stickers.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:50.400]   Oh.
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:54.400]   And then you just drag them into Xcode and you basically upload them and they're available
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.400]   on the App Store.
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:56.400]   No coding needed.
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:59.400]   So I'm hoping, you know, fingers crossed, we're going to see amazing...
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:04.400]   I can't wait to see what, like, Icon factory or Louis Manteo or Sebastian de Weit, or all
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:05.400]   these people do.
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:07.600]   Most of these are repurposed from the watch, right?
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:08.600]   These are the animated...
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:11.640]   Yeah, they made the watch ones available for cross compatibility's sake.
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:13.760]   But I love the new Classic Mac ones.
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:17.840]   I don't know if the hello actually spells out hello, but these are animated, right?
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:18.840]   Have you played with them?
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:21.760]   No, yeah, I think those so far have been just static stickers.
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:25.760]   But what's cool is that you can send one or you can drag one up and stick it on top of
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:28.120]   another of an existing bubble.
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:32.880]   And one of the really cool demos they did at WWDC is that messages can be collaborative.
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:38.240]   So a developer can say that each message is an individual unique property unto itself,
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:40.520]   or they can say that they can share an ID.
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:44.360]   So then, for example, you can have stickers and the demo they showed was an ice cream cone
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:46.800]   that then maybe me and Andy could take turns adding different...
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:47.800]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:48.800]   ...sens a flavored ice cream too.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:49.800]   That's cool.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:54.160]   Or you and Alex can have a dinner order thing going back and forth for the office saying,
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:57.520]   "I'm adding chicken to this, I'm adding steak to this, I'm adding pizza to this."
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:59.880]   And then in the end, it's all bundled up and that's your order.
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:03.800]   So there's a really cool collaborative opportunity in there.
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:07.640]   And I have to admit that I thought all of this was completely silly until my kids started
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:09.040]   playing with it and they have gone...
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:10.040]   It's fire.
[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:11.040]   It's fire.
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:12.040]   It's fire.
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:13.040]   The whole...
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.720]   Because they have their little pen so they're drawing pictures and saying them to each other.
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:18.720]   And then that little thing that you kind of scribble in and then it disappears and appears
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:20.240]   over in the other one.
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:23.400]   And I mean, it's just insane.
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:25.240]   So I was wrong.
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:31.080]   One of the classic lessons of my years as a technology journalist is that just because
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:35.440]   I think something is silly, that doesn't mean I'm done thinking about this.
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:36.440]   It means you...
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:41.520]   I was just watching it when I can happily use this much of the keynote on these stupid
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:42.520]   little things that...
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:43.520]   I mean, I enjoy my...
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:45.520]   Well, look, I can understand...
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:47.520]   I guess the clause in the house.
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:49.360]   Because of that announcement.
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:55.200]   Because it shows, again, it's natural for large companies and name any...not just after
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:56.720]   Apple, name any large companies.
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:02.440]   You have to have a company like Snapchat that does willing to do in a most positive way,
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:05.760]   just heroically, gloriously stupid things.
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:10.160]   Just for no other reason than somebody at that company thinks it's a cool idea.
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:14.600]   And then it takes off like wildfire and that points the way to Google and Apple and to
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:17.960]   Facebook say, "Okay, we would not have come up with this our own self.
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:18.960]   We would not...
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:23.400]   Never necessarily have devoted 10 minutes of a keynote to stickers, but people love
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:26.040]   the stickers and so we have to give them what they want."
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:27.040]   People are using this.
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:32.040]   One of the big aha moments we had earlier in the year is when the Kmoji app came out
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:35.240]   and most of the existing people we had were like, "Oh, this is really dumb.
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.240]   We're just going to ignore it."
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:39.480]   And then my boss Kevin, credit to him, said, "No, no, no, this is amazing.
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:40.480]   Cover it."
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:44.200]   And it was incredibly popular and we've since gone and hired Micah Sargent, formerly of
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:47.840]   Newsy, to just sort of do what we're calling "I'm More Pop" because there's a whole bunch
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:50.640]   of people for whom this is the most important stuff on the platform.
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:53.880]   And just because it's not stuff that we would traditionally think of is important, we're
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:58.400]   just wrong and not wrong maybe, but we have our taste.
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:02.360]   But there's millions, if not hundreds of millions of people with very different tastes and it's
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:04.160]   our job to sort of serve all of them.
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:08.400]   And I mess with Remains, the most popular app on iOS and when they just made three times
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:11.320]   the slide as the emoji, Craig joked about that on the talk show.
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:14.720]   That was the biggest pop of the night because people want to communicate.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:17.640]   We're intrinsically lonely and we want to talk to other people and if we can make that
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:21.400]   fun and we can de-stress it, stickers are less stressful than having to write to somebody
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:24.720]   because you can be late and you could say, "Oh honey, I'm sorry, I'm late" and you'll
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:28.760]   get in trouble where you could send a banana peel slipping emoji and we'll be like, "Ha,
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:29.760]   hurry up."
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:31.240]   And it's just all these things are really valuable to us.
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:32.880]   And it does get a lot of fun.
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:37.320]   Someone sent me a picture of a picture of the fireworks and said "Happy 4th of July" and
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:39.920]   I found, I have like Giffy I think or something.
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:40.920]   Yes, Giffy.
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:41.920]   Yeah, Giff.
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:46.640]   And I posted, I posted, you know, Leonard de Caprio with the little Martini with the little
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:50.240]   stuff going behind them and it was a lot more fun than just saying Happy 4th of July.
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:51.240]   I love them.
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:53.560]   Troy's and my Apple's late to the game on this.
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:57.760]   Facebook Messenger's been doing it for a while, Telegram, a lot of other apps but it's
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:58.800]   nice, yeah, it's fun.
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:01.880]   When you own the platform, you're only ever one announcement away from taking back market
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:02.880]   share.
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:04.480]   That's right, that's true.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:07.120]   New month means, new videos of the Apple campus.
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:08.120]   It's coming along.
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:14.400]   Let's get up in the drone and see how the campus is coming.
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:15.800]   It needs Game of Thrones music, Leo.
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:19.240]   It's smart bum.
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:22.920]   It's really looking like it's like a building.
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:24.920]   There's the R&D facility.
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:25.920]   It's on.
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:30.240]   It must be terrible to be at the campus but not in that building.
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:31.240]   So close, right?
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:32.240]   Yeah.
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:33.240]   Because yes, it's just on the road.
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:34.240]   Are you in the donut?
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:35.240]   Are you in the donut?
[01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:36.240]   No, I'm across.
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:39.880]   It's like being in the office with the OEOB at the White House.
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:41.640]   I work at the White House in the White House.
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:42.640]   Look at that.
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:46.680]   It's a huge 2000 square foot fitness center just for employees.
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:47.680]   Wow.
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:49.240]   J-Blondock is building it by hand.
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:51.920]   It's like a working car.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:52.920]   An hourly of Lego.
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:53.920]   Yes.
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:56.480]   It's a reason why you can't get a single gray Lego block.
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:58.400]   It's all being used for that structure.
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:04.680]   I wonder if he's like now making plans that I've got to find a way that at night to land
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:08.560]   some of these drones inside the building so that when they top it off and seal it up,
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:09.560]   I can still make a tour inside.
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:12.520]   I can still make flights of the hallway to find out what's going on as they're going
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:14.000]   as they build out these offices.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.760]   Solar panels on the parking structure, 95% complete.
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.200]   Lots of solar panels.
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:19.200]   Look at those.
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:20.200]   Look at those.
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:22.200]   These are really interesting buildings.
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:24.360]   They could turn the music down.
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:25.840]   I can do with that.
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:33.200]   11,000 vehicle parking, solar panels, 16 megawatts of power on a sunny day.
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:37.200]   How close does that get to the entire use of the building, I guess?
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:38.200]   Question.
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:39.200]   I said that point in line.
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:41.520]   Didn't they say their goal is to make a completely self-sufficient?
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:44.120]   I don't know whether that meant they're going to be buying credits from elsewhere, but I
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:48.320]   think that one of the long-term goal was to make sure that Apple is putting more power
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:51.560]   into the grid than they're taking back from it.
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:55.080]   Fuel cells will be used as well for additional 4 megawatts.
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:57.640]   Ooh, just like that Bond movie.
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:03.280]   3,000 glass panels will be used.
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:04.280]   Yeah.
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:08.480]   What do we say that those costs, they were some $150,000 each, something like that.
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:10.480]   No, that can't be right.
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:12.360]   It's not entirely expensive.
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:14.880]   But also look at those awnings.
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:20.800]   I was talking casually to an architect about curved buildings like this, and he said that
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:26.800]   it's hard to build these things without really good modeling because if you get the math
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:31.520]   wrong, the sun hits it at the wrong angle at the wrong time of the year, and suddenly
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:37.560]   someone who is across the campus, things are literally catching on fire because they put
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:38.960]   something paper in the window.
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:45.320]   I talked to somebody who is actually on site doing some work there as a construction person
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:52.160]   who says they've been having horrific problems with heat expansion, unplanned heat expansion
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:53.160]   issues.
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:56.000]   That's glass, so you have to do something without heat.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000]   A lot of these buildings, again, from that same conversation, it's actually planned so
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.600]   that it can gather heat, but then put that heat to good use elsewhere.
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:09.880]   So a lot of this is, it sounded like he was talking about designing a circuit board where
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:12.360]   a lot of it was just managing what you're going to do with the heat that this thing is
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:16.800]   going to generate, and a lot of the stuff like installing literally heat sinks throughout
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:20.560]   a building is one of the solutions of this.
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:24.000]   But there's so many great questions you would like to ask.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.240]   Apple secrecy internal is also very good.
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:32.360]   So what is there to make sure that people who are not supposed to know about certain projects
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:34.720]   don't cross talk or this?
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:37.280]   What are we looking at here?
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:38.680]   Minecraft Leo.
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:39.840]   It looks like mine.
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:41.760]   So I guess this is phone installation.
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:47.080]   Yeah, installation phone covering the tunnel to the underground parking facility.
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:48.080]   Yeah.
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:50.400]   It says tunnels will be covered with dirt and foam.
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:51.400]   That's amazing.
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:53.400]   That's it.
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:55.840]   There's a lot of natural cooling that's happening there.
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:59.920]   If you keep that coolness inside and prevent heat from the sun from getting down there,
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:00.920]   you save a lot of money.
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:06.060]   A lot of the power is not just power generation, but saving power by thinking of this as a
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:12.400]   hermetically sealed unit, almost like a biodome that this is a functioning organism that's
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:17.360]   going to be breathing in and breathing out and it's kind of sweat and it's going to be
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:19.240]   generating heat and need to cool down.
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:24.480]   And how do you actually move all that energy and not waste it?
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:27.400]   So that is from Matthew Roberts.
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:28.400]   There's another.
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:34.640]   I guess two guys now, I'm surprised he's not kind of like some sort of traffic jam as
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:36.440]   groans over the apple.
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:38.760]   I was surprised at one of these videos.
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:45.280]   This is an end with like suddenly this expanding net appears from a dot somewhere from a van.
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:46.280]   Or an 209.
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:49.760]   This is a 209 comes out.
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:55.760]   Anyway, at this point, we're talking early next year, although I'm still wondering if
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:43:00.160]   they they hurried along on the theater.
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:03.400]   And I'm still wondering if maybe we won't see the first apple event in the theater this
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:04.400]   year.
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:05.400]   I wouldn't.
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:06.400]   I don't know.
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:07.600]   It still looks pretty messy.
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:12.040]   It's possible to it's it's possible to have it.
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:15.200]   They have to get an occupancy permit if they're going to be putting more than X number of people
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:18.680]   inside a structure, they can't just simply decide that, okay, we think this is okay.
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:20.360]   They have to have people sign off on that.
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:27.000]   However, it's possible to get sort of I'm about to talk about my above main level understanding,
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.720]   but it would be possible for them to get get it up to a certain standard that allows
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:35.600]   them to host and get a permit for a one time event inside there.
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:40.720]   The question is, would they want to bring people into a building that is unfinished?
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:47.160]   So but I do believe that they're really accelerating the research lab and the and the auditorium
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:51.400]   because there's there's there's a lot of early bang that's going to be generated from both
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:52.400]   those places.
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:55.680]   Well, I'm sure all of you will get invited to the first event there and it'll be a very
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:59.320]   exciting thing and it'll be just me on the outside pressing my nose to that curved glass
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:00.320]   going.
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:01.320]   Oh, wow.
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:02.320]   I wish I could get in.
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:03.320]   Did you guys.
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:04.320]   I wonder.
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:08.320]   I wonder where that where is on the pay grade of apple employees, the squeegee team.
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:12.680]   It's like a nose prince again, again with the nose.
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:16.360]   It's going to be there's going to be a there's going to be a squeegee team of like 10 people.
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:17.360]   That's all they do.
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:23.040]   They just keep going and circles because it's all connected and curved.
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:28.080]   You could just hold the squeegee out and be on like some sort of pulley and just go all
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:30.080]   the way around.
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:37.160]   I'll also be like two times weekly passive aggressive memos from maintenance saying we
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:43.320]   have explained to all you hires that suction cup darts are not to be used inside office
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:44.320]   buildings.
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:49.080]   It's fun to you that we have to have people out there removing the darts when you are
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:51.080]   done with your play time.
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:52.080]   It does.
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:56.680]   It is remember the 10th anniversary of the iPhone announcement is January, right?
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:58.680]   And they release is June.
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:03.840]   So it is kind of that would be a momentous occasion to kind of have at the iPhone 10.
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:09.080]   Also, a lot of stuff is going to be finished finished there in early 2017.
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:14.880]   So I have no idea, but I would be really surprised if they didn't take advantage of that and
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:20.000]   saying we were having a huge 10th anniversary blowout.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.240]   All the all the hummus and and grass water that you can bring.
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:28.160]   We'll take a break and get your picks gentlemen in just a moment.
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:31.960]   Our show today brought to you by the ring video doorbell.
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:35.440]   I really shouldn't even say the ring video doorbell now because they have a number of
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:41.880]   products in the ring family giving you in fact the ring of security bundle or the pro
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:43.520]   bundle.
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:45.240]   We've talked before about the ring video doorbell.
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:46.720]   I love our ring video doorbell.
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:52.400]   I know when people come and go, I can say to my dog, I don't have to do this anymore,
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:57.000]   but I could have said to my daughter, I see you came home late and who was that you brought
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.720]   with you at three in the morning because I have video of it's about motion detector
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:03.800]   and it's high def video.
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:09.200]   When the doorbell rings, I can answer it not even from home, but from here from anywhere
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:11.320]   around the world because of the internet.
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:16.120]   They've got apps for the iPhone and Android devices and they have a Mac app too now, which
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:17.720]   is really nice.
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:22.720]   You could actually get on your Mac and see all the motion that's been going on with
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:24.480]   your ring video doorbell.
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:31.520]   Now they have the ring video doorbell pro, 1080 PhD video, night vision.
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:35.440]   Because it is hard, it's designed for hardwired doorbell replacement.
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:39.720]   They don't use a battery on this, so it's a lot smaller.
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:40.920]   That's nice.
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:42.880]   That's the ring video doorbell pro.
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:49.280]   The kit, the ring of security kit comes with the wireless weatherproof HD stick up cam.
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.880]   So you've got your doorbell looking at the front door, but maybe you got the stick up
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:53.440]   cam around back.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:56.920]   You can also hear and speak to visitors with two-way talk using that.
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:00.280]   And with the optional cloud video recording, you can easily capture and share a video with
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:06.880]   family and friends or law enforcement should the need arise.
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:11.480]   Then they get with the kit, you get the chime, which plugs in any standard power outlet to
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:15.080]   know when your doorbell is ringing.
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:21.800]   I never hear my regular chime, so having a second chime around back is very handy.
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:29.920]   The ring of security bundle or the pro bundle, $50 off, just go to ring rng.com/macbreak.
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:38.280]   There are the kits, ring.com/macbreak50 dollars off, just because you're listening.
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:41.000]   Monitoring of your whole home now, thanks to ring.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.520]   They've really got a great family of products.
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:45.800]   I love our ring video doorbell.
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:49.200]   I really couldn't live without it now.
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:51.680]   And I think with these new products, they've really got a great offering.
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:58.520]   Ring.com/macbreak to save $50 off your new ring kit.
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:02.160]   And I'm ladies and gentlemen, for our picks of the week.
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:04.440]   Alex, Lindsay, I always end with you this time.
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:06.120]   Let's start with you.
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:09.360]   So I have an odd one.
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:17.040]   It was actually based on watching my wife actually use my wife loves calligraphy and got a big
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:21.120]   iPad and she really wanted to put something on it that did calligraphy.
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:23.160]   And this calligraphy handbook, she just loves.
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:25.800]   And so I thought I'd make it the pick for the week.
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:28.720]   It is a, you can get it on, you know, for the iPad.
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:32.520]   And basically what it does is it really gives you a way to, you know, it works really well
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.960]   with the pen or pencil.
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:42.040]   And you know, it gives you a real guide on exactly how to, you know, write these and a
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:44.360]   lot of instruction on how to put it together.
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:49.360]   And there's a couple of products all made by this one fellow who, looking by the name,
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:52.520]   my guess is, is that he's from Vietnam.
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:54.200]   Nian Tan Hanhu.
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:49:00.240]   But I think that he's got a couple different ones on this, but this is the one that she's
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:02.720]   spending most of her time on.
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:04.240]   And she just really enjoyed it.
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:09.760]   I mean, she just spent, my wife has not been a big fan of, or a big convert to the iPad
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:12.440]   until she started really playing with this and a pencil.
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:16.240]   So there's a lot of tools there that really, you know, let you kind of play with that and
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:21.640]   you know, kind of learn how to, you know, how to do that and work with angles and so
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:22.640]   on and so forth.
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:25.120]   Good idea for the use of the pencil and the pro.
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:26.280]   That's really cool.
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:29.200]   And I think, yeah, I think that more than anything else, I think these are the kind of
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:33.880]   apps you just really get sometimes when you look at an app like, wow, people could learn,
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:35.400]   you can really learn how to do anything.
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:38.400]   On the iPad.
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:43.720]   So when is well, well, well built, you know, so anyway, it's pretty, pretty nifty.
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:44.720]   Very cool.
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:46.480]   Renee Richie, pick of the week.
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:49.840]   So I had the good fortune of going to the accessibility meetup at WWDC.
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:54.640]   And one of the developers I met there makes the SL app, the American Sign Language app
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:56.200]   for the iPhone.
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:50:00.560]   Now it's not an app meant to teach people who need sign language, sign language.
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:03.200]   It's an app meant to teach other people sign language.
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:08.360]   It's like an introduction and it has like basic vocabulary, but it's really meant for
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:12.960]   people who have hearing but are curious or interested or just want to learn more about
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:18.280]   American sign language to sort of get that introduction and learn that basic vocabulary
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:22.360]   and sort of open up that world so they can better understand it.
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:23.360]   I downloaded it.
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:26.720]   I showed it to you, but my busy updating, my phone is taking forever.
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:31.960]   But you can download it and you can get started with it.
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:32.960]   It's really approachable.
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:36.760]   They've really taken great pains to make it, you know, forgive me for things but accessible
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:40.760]   to people who don't need it for accessibility, if that makes any sense.
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:43.040]   But it's, I've always been fascinated about this.
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:46.440]   I've always looked at people who are doing sign language and you go to conferences sometimes
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:49.480]   and they have somebody who's doing sign language on the side.
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:53.680]   That was especially prevalent before you could do real time subtitles.
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.520]   And it still used a lot with live speakers at venues.
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:51:01.800]   And it's just, it's incredibly fascinating and this, it just, it gives you an appreciation
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:04.360]   for it, but it also gives you a little bit of understanding of it.
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:06.560]   And I think it's something that all of us could use more of.
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:08.560]   What a great idea.
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:09.560]   Yeah, it's tremendous.
[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:11.120]   Oh, I love this.
[01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:13.000]   I've always wanted to learn ASL.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.000]   Same.
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:19.400]   And there's a lot of evidence, by the way, that kids who learn ASL hearing or not, their
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:21.040]   brain develops in a unique way.
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:24.720]   It's a language and it's very valuable.
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:25.720]   Wow, that's great.
[01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:26.720]   It's a way learning to code.
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:29.880]   It opens you up to many new ways of thinking, which is amazing.
[01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:35.480]   The other cool thing about ASL is that it's the one truly international language.
[01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:37.680]   And it's a true language.
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:38.680]   It's not.
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:39.680]   Right, exactly.
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:41.680]   It's not letter spelling.
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:44.480]   It's a full expressive language of its own.
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:46.080]   Wow, this is really cool.
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:47.080]   Thank you.
[01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:48.080]   Really cool.
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:49.880]   I got two apps I got to download.
[01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:51.920]   Andy, what can you do for me?
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:53.640]   I can give you a free app to download.
[01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:54.640]   Okay.
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:56.960]   Just today, this is fresh off the wire.
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:03.520]   BB at 11.6 just got released with piles and piles of features that you would have to be
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:07.200]   a professional developer to truly understand and explain.
[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:08.200]   Love you.
[01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:10.200]   You've heard us talk about BB at it over and over again.
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:14.440]   It's just for even if you're not a coder, if you're just a writer or if you just need
[01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:19.480]   to bash text, it is the consummate tool for editing, editing text.
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:24.360]   One of the highlights though for people like me is that they've decided that for a long
[01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:28.960]   time, bare bones has had a free product called text Wrangler, which is sort of a simplified
[01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:32.200]   text editor and then the commercial BB edit.
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:36.280]   What they've done, they've made a substantial change where now if you download BB at it
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:39.600]   at 11.6, you will get the full version of BB edit.
[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:42.320]   It'll be fully operational for 30 days.
[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:49.280]   After 30 days, it will still function, but some of the totally diesel heavy duty apps,
[01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:54.080]   excuse me, heavy duty features that would be like for web development and stuff like
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:58.280]   that, they're grayed out and said, no, this is a demo feature.
[01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:02.720]   And if you and the that app, that version of the app will keep running forever, keep opening
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:08.240]   all your files forever, it's not like limited in opening, saving and editing files.
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:13.280]   But if at any point you decide you want to pay 40 bucks for a license, if you're never
[01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:17.680]   using that app before, then that same copy will just then be unlocked and all those things
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:20.960]   that were gray are going to going to be lit up again.
[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:25.480]   And there's less money for if you're if you're a previous customer of BB at 11, the upgrade
[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:26.440]   is free.
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:31.160]   If you have, then the upgrades can be less expensive depending on what version you have.
[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:36.920]   But that's a really neat way of not necessarily making something demo where but saying, if
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:42.880]   we're not going to make our app stop working after 30 days, we're just going to take away
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:47.280]   the features for which we most we deserve money for all of this.
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:50.680]   But here are the features that you can use to make lots of money with this app.
[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:52.920]   And we're just going to hope that you're going to give us where you're going to agree
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:54.840]   that these extra features are worth money.
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:57.680]   That's really great.
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:02.520]   So are they discontinuing text Wrangler or is just if you download the demo, you can use
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:04.040]   this forever.
[01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:05.360]   Text Wrangler is still available.
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:07.960]   You can still download it off of the site.
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:12.080]   It is natural to wonder what the future of text Wrangler will be.
[01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:15.240]   But I can say that the BB at 11.6 is live.
[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:19.160]   I just went to the site and I was just able to download text Wrangler as well.
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:25.240]   And I've been using the betas and I don't.
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:29.200]   If you have the demo version of BB at it, I think you'll be happy with that and you
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:31.120]   don't necessarily need text Wrangler.
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:35.600]   He used to, Rich Segal, who's been on the show, used to do it that way, I seem to remember.
[01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:37.120]   And then he introduced text Wrangler.
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:39.600]   He's gone back and forth on the idea of a free editor.
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:43.240]   Yeah, well, that's what happens when you have a small company that's run by just two
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:44.240]   or three people.
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:47.600]   You can have a lot of, instead of something being the result of six months of meetings
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:53.480]   than three months of consultants doing AB testing, it's more like people leaning back
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:57.040]   over whiskey and thinking, what would we like to do?
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:58.360]   What makes sense for us?
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:02.560]   How do we achieve outreach to new customers in the best way?
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:07.320]   And so they will try this and if it doesn't work out, they'll try something else.
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:12.120]   But it's always done with a lot of thought and a lot of belief.
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:17.400]   These are the people who birthed this app and have been raising it and cultivating it for
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:18.640]   years and years and years.
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:24.040]   So it's not an app that gets bought by Morton Firecall and then it becomes something else
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:25.040]   and powerly.
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:27.120]   No, and I don't think it ever will and I like that.
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:30.040]   I think this is Rich's life journey.
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:31.640]   He uses it every day.
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:33.880]   It's a really amazing product.
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:36.920]   It's actually, for some people, a reason to get a Mac.
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:37.920]   It's that good.
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:44.480]   It's an example of just, in my opinion, he has a very close friend.
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:52.680]   I have to say that, but realize that he became a friend after I was on the Mailsmith, a late
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:54.480]   BBN Bear Bones product.
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:59.360]   I was on the alpha and the beta list for that and we became friends after me complaining
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:02.360]   about Mailsmith and saying it should work this way, not that way that we want to go
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:04.040]   out for lunch and friendship.
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:07.800]   So you killed Mailsmiths, you son of a...
[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:09.720]   I didn't kill Mailsmith.
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:12.800]   I just simply said, Mailsmith, walk towards the light.
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:15.120]   You all are welcome.
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:16.800]   I don't know why.
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:23.800]   Apple ships a very credible email program with OS 10 and there probably isn't really
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:30.080]   a reason for anything else, but I nevertheless continue to download and try and look for
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:32.080]   a better email program.
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:33.080]   That's good.
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:34.080]   And I loved Mailsmiths.
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:35.960]   I thought it was very good.
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:42.120]   I currently use Mailmate, which is kind of an old-fashioned feeling power tool.
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:43.120]   Does it work like you Dora?
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:44.120]   It doesn't work like you Dora Leo.
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:45.120]   We can't use it.
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:49.640]   You know, I was going to say if you miss Eudora, you will feel right at home with Mailmate.
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:50.640]   I'll never...
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:51.640]   Thunderbird or Buzz.
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:56.200]   All you have to do is look at the Mailmate website to realize, "Oh yeah."
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:01.480]   But what does is it handles iMap really well and that's kind of key to me.
[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:07.960]   And the other key that absolutely has to have, which Apple's Mail does, is support for
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:17.120]   a PGP, email encryption, or I use GNU Privacy Guard, and most Mac people do.
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:18.840]   And it does support it quite well.
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:21.720]   It's a really nice email client.
[01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:25.680]   I have to say that I've been liking the direction that Mail.app has been taking.
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:26.680]   It's good.
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:30.760]   I don't think it ever stank, but it looked like for a couple of years it looked like
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:33.320]   an unloved piece of software.
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:38.880]   Like the people at Apple who really wanted it to excel had moved on to other things or
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:40.400]   moved on to other companies.
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:43.760]   And it was sort of looking for a new sponsor, so to speak.
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:48.120]   But every new iteration that's come out has had a nice little tweak, a nice little bit
[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:49.120]   of simplicity.
[01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:51.000]   It's a lot more stable than it used to be.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.840]   It works with Gmail now, which was really the reason I started looking at other email
[01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:55.840]   programs.
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:58.240]   You can't talk to smart people on Mail now.
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:02.200]   That in itself is laudable because every...
[01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:06.760]   The fact that you yourself can mention that iMap support has done well on a certain app.
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:14.360]   iMap is so crazy with all the different dialects that every person who creates a new mail system
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:18.880]   based on iMap decides that, "You know what, but I'm going to be the one who finally fixes
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:19.880]   iMap for good.
[01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:21.960]   And it's going to be standard iMac.
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:22.960]   I'm Apple.
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:28.240]   It'll just be better except for the mail maps that break when they try to interface with
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:30.760]   this and the people who can't log in.
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:35.720]   And so the fact that they got it working reliably with the Gmail, which is its own quirk with
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:38.480]   a capital K, it's not a really standard iMap.
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:40.840]   That's why it's so weird.
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:43.400]   So that shows the amount of work that goes into it.
[01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:48.360]   I'm actually kind of keen to see what happens to it the next two or three years because
[01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:51.680]   they also seem to be learning a lot from the iPad.
[01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:55.480]   There are a lot of things in the new version of Mac OS where you can really see that they
[01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:56.480]   looked at...
[01:58:56.480 --> 01:59:00.080]   There are a lot of people at Apple who are now using iPads, I think as their primary computing
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:01.240]   device.
[01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:07.560]   And when they're forced to go back to their office and their cubbies and use their Macs,
[01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:11.560]   like, "Gee, I really wish I could do picture in picture like a can on my iPad."
[01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:14.880]   Or, "I really wish that mail worked the way that I could on my iPad."
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:17.080]   I'm seeing a lot of cool stuff that I really like.
[01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:23.440]   As long as I'm mentioning the GPG tools for Macintosh just came out with its first stable
[01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:28.040]   release for El Capitan just in time for Sierra.
[01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:29.280]   It takes them a little while, but you know what?
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:31.280]   It's free and it's a great tool.
[01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:38.560]   And if you do want to have encrypted email, this is the standard way to do it.
[01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:42.480]   They have voiceover support now, which is nice.
[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:50.240]   Download the GPG suite from gpgtools.org and it came out yesterday on the 4th of July
[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:54.400]   because it's all about freedom.
[01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:55.400]   So there.
[01:59:55.400 --> 01:59:56.880]   And Apple Pie.
[01:59:56.880 --> 01:59:59.560]   And Apple Pie.
[01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:03.040]   Ladies and gentlemen, we've concluded another great episode of Mac Break Weekly.
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:05.720]   And I thank you all for being here.
[02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:11.360]   Alex Lindsey, the Pixel Core Follow 'em on the Twitter @AlexLindsay with an A. A- S- A- Y.
[02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:13.240]   What did Alex Lind say?
[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:15.000]   That's how I remember it.
[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:16.480]   There you go.
[02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:17.480]   Thank you for being here.
[02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:19.240]   And playing the Lind and then I'll just say a lot of things.
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:20.240]   Yeah.
[02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:21.240]   Anything you want to plug?
[02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:22.240]   You got coming up or?
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:25.880]   There's nothing that I'm doing that I can plug.
[02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:31.360]   That's a plug in love itself, isn't it?
[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:34.520]   In a way, that's the most impressive plug at all.
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:35.520]   Yeah.
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:38.040]   I plug it, but I can't.
[02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:40.680]   I'll be off for a couple weeks working on some stuff.
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:41.680]   Okay, good.
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:42.680]   Anyway, but I have.
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:43.680]   And we'll see in a few weeks.
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:44.680]   That's going to be on Jupiter.
[02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:45.680]   No big deal.
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:46.680]   Yeah.
[02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:47.680]   Yeah, you know.
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:48.680]   Can't talk about that.
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:49.680]   Yeah.
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:50.680]   Hey, somebody's got to do the stream.
[02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:51.680]   Yeah.
[02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:55.520]   From Montreal, as always at imore.com, it's the great Renee Richie.
[02:00:55.520 --> 02:00:56.520]   Love having you on the show.
[02:00:56.520 --> 02:00:57.880]   Thank you for being here.
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:00:59.280]   Thank you so much.
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:01.400]   Anything you want to plug?
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:04.800]   Yeah, it should be out either tomorrow or the next day, but we had a really good interview
[02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:10.080]   with Linda Dong, who worked on the Apple Pencil and Lee and Apollitano, who worked on Siri
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:12.560]   for CarPlay and Apple TV on debug.
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:14.160]   So that'll be in the next episode.
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:15.160]   Great.
[02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:16.640]   Yeah, they're both brilliant, brilliant people.
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:17.640]   Great.
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:22.960]   Debug is one of the many podcasts from the iMore gang, but I must listen, always.
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:29.680]   If you go to imore.com and go to the hamburger menu and click podcasts, you'll find it.
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:33.680]   It's right there with the hamburgers.
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:38.400]   Andy Inaco writes for the Chicago Sun times and joins us every week.
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:45.280]   He also does Inaco's Almanac and Material, other podcasts on other networks.
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:48.480]   And anything you want to plug, sir?
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:50.400]   Nothing particular.
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:55.400]   Nothing particular.
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:56.400]   Great.
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:59.560]   He's only on Mars and says Jupiter.
[02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:06.440]   I'll only say that I bought this really cool, like, electric, infrared typewriter.
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:08.040]   That's about the fact you could kill a man.
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:10.040]   I'm about to kill myself if I drop this one.
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:11.040]   What do you do with that?
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:12.880]   Pad over Bluetooth?
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:19.480]   I have a specific project that I've bought this for, but I have to take it to the world's
[02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:25.040]   famous Cambridge typewriter in Arlington, Massachusetts, and have it looked at because
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:27.800]   there are a couple of things that are kind of wrong with it.
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:31.640]   Isn't that nice that you still have a typewriter store repair shop?
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:34.680]   Oh, that shop is legendary.
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:41.400]   It's not just one of the few places that repairs typewriters, but this shop just repairs everything.
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:47.800]   And he has a really great typewriter blog that, of course, is written on typewriters that have
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:50.240]   been brought into the shop.
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:53.840]   And he'll just like every time there's like an interesting typewriter comes in for repair,
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:55.120]   he'll like write about it.
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:03:01.680]   And he's taken stuff that's been like dragged from the bottom of a lake and used in a crime
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:07.640]   investigation and got it working back into pristine, beautiful condition.
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:08.920]   Look at this.
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:13.640]   So I'm looking for he's repaired one of my typewriters before.
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:17.960]   And this is because this is going to be like an actual production piece of hardware for
[02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:21.160]   again, a project that I can't talk about yet.
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:23.360]   But hey, I do have something I can't talk about.
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:24.360]   All right.
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:26.000]   Yeah, you found it.
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:30.080]   Yeah, this one actually this one has to actually work and has to be able to keep up with my
[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:31.080]   typing.
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:36.600]   So I'm also the cord is kind of it's kind of lazy kind of fire.
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:37.600]   Yeah.
[02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:38.600]   Yeah.
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:42.800]   Like I saw the plug connectors in the back that looked like somebody had putted them
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:43.800]   in.
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:45.920]   I don't think it's a little worrisome.
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:47.520]   Look at that Russian keyboard.
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:48.520]   Wow.
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:50.720]   It's so he repairs all of them.
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:52.920]   As a matter of fact, I bought this model on his advice.
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:55.960]   Hey, I have a relationship with I have a guy.
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:04:03.120]   I know a guy for typewriters and like this is the Smith Corona, Electra 210, these things
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:09.720]   that are again, they're just made like they're made out of steel and iron hearts.
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:12.440]   So there there's nothing you can't fix with this.
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:18.440]   I have fond memory of my last typewriter, which was a very fancy typewriter.
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:22.760]   It was like, oh, I wish I could remember it wasn't electric, my last manual typewriter.
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:27.160]   But I remember it was like, this is like the king of typewriters.
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:28.160]   Yeah.
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:32.120]   I mean, I like again, I have a manual typewriter that I bought at a flea market because it's
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:37.080]   like actually like a 1942 like Smith Corona, like super portable.
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:38.080]   Yeah.
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:41.880]   But the thing is it's for me actually writing on it's a little bit twee.
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:46.880]   It's like I have to focus on slowing down, whereas on this keyboard, I had this is actually
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:51.920]   the I use to type when I was a little kid before our family got an Apple computer.
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:56.200]   This model typewriter is the one that I wrote like my first published story on.
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:57.200]   Oh, that's neat.
[02:04:57.200 --> 02:04:59.400]   No wonder so it has a little special with me.
[02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:02.440]   Yeah, mine was a was an Ermese.
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:08.000]   Ermese can't remember what model it was, but these were considered to be the like the
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.480]   king of the, you know, if you could get a great type.
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:13.880]   I wish I, yeah, right.
[02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:15.640]   It was not the same Ermese.
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:18.600]   These are her, these are Hermes.
[02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:22.200]   But I, I wish I could, I wonder what happened to that.
[02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:23.880]   God, I'd love to have that again.
[02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:26.640]   I'm sure my guy could set you up with one of those things.
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:27.640]   Really?
[02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:31.280]   Once, once or twice a year, the shop has, I think they call them type ins in which it's
[02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:35.000]   an open house and they just set up like dozens and dozens of typewriters like on the sidewalk
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:39.400]   and everywhere inviting people to have cake and punch and type and their types, their
[02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:43.280]   typing speed contest and it's, it's quite a festival, man.
[02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:44.280]   Wow.
[02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:45.280]   Tap, tap.
[02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:49.360]   I mean, we played with ones when I was a kid, but I think my first reports were still, I
[02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:51.360]   went from handwritten to my teacher.
[02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:53.840]   I remember my teacher asking, what typewriter did you use this for?
[02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:56.320]   I was like, it's called a dot matrix printer.
[02:05:56.320 --> 02:05:57.320]   Oh, no.
[02:05:57.320 --> 02:05:58.320]   Yeah.
[02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:00.560]   I went through college of the typewriter with a manual typewriter.
[02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:01.560]   Why?
[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:02.560]   That's the end of the show.
[02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:03.560]   We need to go.
[02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:12.240]   And I, my, my, a teacher thought that I was making an excuse for not finishing my, my essay
[02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:16.080]   assignment when I came up to him in class and said, I'm sorry.
[02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:19.440]   I just, I, I, it's finished, but my printer at home is broken.
[02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:20.440]   I have it on this floppy.
[02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:24.400]   I can print it for you when I get to the computer lab like this afternoon.
[02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:28.640]   And he said, Mr. Enocho, why don't I just, I have an Apple computer at home.
[02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:33.400]   Why don't I just take that disk and see what's on it?
[02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:34.400]   Not my name.
[02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:35.400]   It's going.
[02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:36.400]   Whoa.
[02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:41.320]   At the next day he was like, he was like very, very pleased with me for actually not having
[02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:44.720]   light about my homework, but also say, you know, that I was so excited.
[02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:47.680]   It's the first time I've actually accepted an assignment on a floppy disk.
[02:06:47.680 --> 02:06:50.120]   I wrote a book, Boston Globe about it.
[02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:51.120]   Funny.
[02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:52.120]   Nice.
[02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:53.120]   That's awesome.
[02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:55.000]   You know, you can get the vidders, Hermes.
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:58.680]   The problem is we don't have Cambridge typewriter out here.
[02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:02.040]   You can get next time, next time you come to New England, let's do a road trip.
[02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:03.040]   My mind.
[02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:06.520]   Also, that's near, it's on the red line.
[02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:08.960]   It's like near Summerville.
[02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:11.440]   There's, there's a barcode barbecue near there.
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:12.440]   There's stuff to do.
[02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:13.440]   And I think good.
[02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:14.920]   I might just come out.
[02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:18.560]   I think you would even like, if you had a video recorder, you would record something
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:20.360]   with this person because it's.
[02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:21.360]   It sounds wonderful.
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:22.360]   Yeah, it is.
[02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:24.400]   I have to go see my mom at some point.
[02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:28.400]   It might be a short road trip, but that's close enough that I'll stop.
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:29.400]   I'll be in Cranston.
[02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:30.400]   I'll come on over.
[02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:32.440]   We'll go to Cambridge typewriter.
[02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:34.480]   Might even pick up an Hermes.
[02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:36.640]   You can even, you can even come to my favorite diner with me.
[02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:39.360]   Oh, so deal sold.
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:44.320]   They're only about 150 bucks.
[02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:45.960]   It's kind of sad on that.
[02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:49.760]   I will say if anybody, if anybody is tempted after hearing this to go on eBay, I should
[02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:53.440]   tell you that there are two things that are guaranteed when you buy a typewriter like this
[02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:54.440]   on eBay.
[02:07:54.440 --> 02:07:59.440]   They'll be super, super cheap and that's good, but they're guaranteed to get broken during
[02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:00.440]   shipping.
[02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:01.880]   I don't mean that they'll be like in pieces.
[02:08:01.880 --> 02:08:06.600]   I mean that it'll be perfectly functional when the person packs it up very nicely.
[02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:10.320]   When you get it, a key will not work or a plate will not work.
[02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:14.040]   So that's why I would not have bought one on eBay had I not had a guy.
[02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:15.040]   No, Cambridge typewriter.
[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:16.040]   Yep.
[02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:17.040]   Yep.
[02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:18.800]   That's why I got not buying one.
[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:20.680]   There's this wish, you know, and do you, where do you get?
[02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:21.880]   Can you get the ribbons?
[02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:22.880]   Yep.
[02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:23.880]   Ribbons are easy to get.
[02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:25.880]   These are standard ribbons as matter of fact.
[02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:27.920]   Somebody still makes typewriter ribbons?
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:28.920]   Okay.
[02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:31.760]   It's just like cloth impregnated with soaked in soaked in.
[02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:36.320]   No, I understand the technology, but why bother?
[02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:39.040]   Because it's like there are people who still use these.
[02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:44.240]   It's no longer something that you can sell in bulk to every single corner drugstore,
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:49.040]   but they are things that if you keep manufacturing them and put them on Amazon, you know, people
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:52.080]   are going to seek you out because they're also they're going to go for them.
[02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:57.880]   You know what's sad is that, you know, if I got one of these, in my memory, it's persistent
[02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:01.480]   and you're like, "Oh, I'm a little bit more than a kid."
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:05.560]   And you're like, "Oh, I'm a little bit more than a kid."
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:06.560]   Yeah.
[02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:11.160]   So, you know, you're like, "Oh, I'm a little bit more than a kid."
[02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:13.920]   So, you're like, "Oh, I'm a little bit more than a kid."
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:16.520]   I'm like, "Oh, I'm a little bit more than a kid."
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:17.520]   Yeah.
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:19.520]   "Oh, I'm a little bit more than a kid."
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:22.320]   "Oh, I'm a little bit more than a kid."
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:25.240]   You're like, "Oh, I'm a little bit more than a kid."
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:28.880]   And I'll give you what looks like a brand new completely reconditioned model that you
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:31.560]   will then carry home, luckily as your character.
[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:32.560]   Wow.
[02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:36.800]   Well, and you still can't address envelopes worth a damn on a computer.
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:41.840]   Else, well, also, the thing that I actually used, like my manual typewriter for is that
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:45.560]   there are times where I want to write a letter like I've when I've read my congressman, when
[02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:49.280]   I read a letter of complaint to someone else, it's like nothing says that I'm not even
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:50.280]   cranked.
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:52.200]   No, no, no, no, okay, maybe that too.
[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:56.600]   It's the content that says cranked, I like to think.
[02:09:56.600 --> 02:09:59.000]   But it's like, okay, this was definitely not printed up.
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.680]   This is not something of a PDF that someone downloaded and now I'm the thousandth person
[02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:03.680]   to...
[02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:04.680]   No, that's true.
[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:06.240]   You hand entered it.
[02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:07.240]   It gets your attention.
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:08.240]   It gets your attention.
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:09.240]   To your typewriting machine.
[02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:11.520]   Also, people think that I'm 83 years old and I have nothing to do.
[02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:13.120]   Okay, that's the right letters to people.
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:17.320]   No, things says crank quite like a typewritten letter.
[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:18.320]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:19.320]   It's arrowhead.
[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:24.320]   Sorry.
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:26.040]   Thank you all for joining us.
[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:27.200]   We appreciate it.
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:33.120]   We do Mac break weekly every Tuesday 11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern time 1800 UTC.
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:37.720]   If you can't join us live on the stream and join us in the chat room or be in studio,
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:38.720]   we love it when you're in studio.
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:43.100]   I got some nice members of our studio audience today, all of whom look old enough to remember
[02:10:43.100 --> 02:10:44.400]   typewriters.
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:45.800]   Yep.
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:51.880]   If you can't do that, well, just to get your on demand audio or video, you could download
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:11:00.560]   that using your computing machine from twit.tv/mbwr wherever finer podcasts are aggregated for
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:03.400]   distribution via the internet.
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:04.800]   Thank you for being here.
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:06.320]   We'll see you next time.
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:07.320]   Another...
[02:11:07.320 --> 02:11:08.520]   Oh, no, that's not how I say it.
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:09.680]   I say, "Break time is over.
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:10.680]   Now get back to work.
[02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:11.680]   Break time is over.
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:12.680]   Over.
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:13.680]   It's break.
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:14.680]   It's over.
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:15.680]   It's over.
[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:16.680]   We'll be back."
[02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:16.680]   [music]
[02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:17.680]   [music]
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:20.260]   (upbeat music)
[02:11:20.260 --> 02:11:22.840]   (upbeat music)
