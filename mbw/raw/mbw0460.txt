[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.200]   Look who's back.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.960]   I don't know where he's been chasing rhinos probably in Rwanda,
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.840]   Alex Lindsey of the Pixelcorp, the founding father of Mac Break.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.080]   Good to have you back.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.720]   >> It's good to be back.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.880]   >> Missed you.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.080]   >> I missed being here.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.080]   >> What's funny is, is that when you're not on it and then you listen to it,
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.240]   you're like, I had something to say there.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.240]   >> I know.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.120]   >> Now I have something to say.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.640]   >> All right.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.400]   >> To the chagrin of some of our listeners, but.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.400]   >> No, no, we like to hear everything you have to say.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.520]   That's Renee Ritchie over on his right.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.280]   He is, of course, or left to you.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.120]   He is, of course, Mr. Imor.com.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.800]   Mr. Mobile Nations.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.760]   Great to see you @ReneeRitchie on the Twitter.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.800]   >> So happy to have Alex back.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.840]   Can't stop staring at him.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.400]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.480]   Looking over your shoulder.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.520]   Alex.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.040]   >> That's Andy Inaco.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.320]   He's the Gautins fisherman, Gautins of Gloucester.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.920]   You kind of in the yellow, you kind of could be in a slicka.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.640]   >> Okay, finals change my hat.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.480]   >> No, I like it.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.480]   I don't like it.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.040]   >> I was, as you were doing the introduction, I realized,
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.560]   oh geez, I didn't realize I've got a yellow hat and a yellow shirt.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.080]   I wonder if I could sneak off and switch my hat before I'm introduced.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.080]   >> He's the Gautins fisherman.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.840]   >> Maybe no one noticed, but so unnoticed now.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.160]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.360]   >> But I too am glad that Alex is back.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.640]   My head saw the schedule and said Alex is coming back.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.880]   My head said, but I best not tell my heart because it's so easily broken.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.880]   >> It is.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.080]   >> We'll let our heart discover it.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.520]   >> It truly will happen.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.800]   Thank you, Alex.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   So what?
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.040]   It's really, really good to be back.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.440]   >> Alex has broken up with us more time than John Mayer has broken up with Taylor Swift.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.440]   >> I've broken up.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.680]   >> No, you didn't break up.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.200]   >> No, of course not.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.360]   Nor did Taylor with Apple.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.320]   What a strange story.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.040]   I feel like there's so much more to this story than they're telling us.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.920]   Don't you?
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.680]   Taylor Swift on Sunday posted a blog post.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.680]   We talked a lot about it on this week in tech.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.640]   Two Apple love Taylor.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.880]   And like five minutes later, the post was to please it Apple.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.880]   I'm not gonna put my music on your new music service because you shouldn't be doing three
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.920]   months free and not pay anybody for the three months free, which was apparently, I guess,
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.920]   Apple's plan.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.040]   Others had protested Adele's label and Indi label in Britain had protested.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.160]   But when Taylor does it, man, those Swifties.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.400]   Within about, I don't know, a couple of hours, Eddie Q was on the phone to Taylor apparently.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.200]   He said he'd be talking to her.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:05.000]   And then later that night he tweeted, okay, okay, we'll pay.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.480]   Well now that story on recode says we'll pay Taylor Swift, but I presume he means we'll
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.480]   pay everybody.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.840]   >> It's fine that kept saying artists in the discussion as though artists were the, because
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.160]   these deals, it wasn't that Apple wasn't gonna pay us.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.760]   They'd come to deals with record labels saying that they wouldn't be paying for the first
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   three months.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.680]   And while the discussion was focused on artists, you've got to imagine they're not paying artists.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.200]   And in large person, they are paying record labels and the artists will get whatever their
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   deals state.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.520]   >> See, that's what pisses me off because really Taylor, you know better than that.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.080]   It's your freaking label.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.680]   >> Well, it does trickle down to the, I mean, you know, the not getting paid.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.560]   >> Yeah, but who made that deal?
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.000]   The labels, their label made that deal.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.400]   And this is not a minor offer from Apple.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.120]   We wanna make sure people get what the numbers- >> How much is that gonna be, do we know?
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.360]   >> Well, I can, if the, by my calculation, and I'm, you know, what I'm looking at is Apple
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.080]   said they're trying to hit 100 million.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.520]   Let's just say they do, they're gonna do a big push for that first three months.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.600]   And they actually get 100 million people and they actually don't pay $10 a month.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.520]   And they actually would have paid 70%.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.240]   That's like over $2 billion.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.560]   That's a big chunk of what they paid for beats.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.080]   >> Yeah, but not a million is ridiculously optimistic.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.520]   You think that's- >> Also, they're not paying full rate
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.280]   for the, like they're gonna play what they call streaming prices for, before you subscribe,
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.080]   when you subscribe, revenue share kicks in.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.160]   But the free listeners are gonna get what they call a streaming fee and nobody seems
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.160]   to know what that means.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.320]   But it could be in the tens, if not high tens, if not maybe triple.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.600]   >> Well, here's the deal.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:44.040]   We know that Spotify says they've paid 3 billion total over the entire life of Spotify to the
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.040]   labels.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.560]   >> Same Westergrin at Pandora, what did he say, $1 billion last year?
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:56.640]   Those are both, I mean, that's 75 million free streamers on Spotify.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.360]   That's 100 million streamers on Pandora.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.920]   So it's a billion.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.920]   Let's say it's a billion.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.120]   >> Well, and the thing is, is that now if the record companies are smart, they are gonna
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.920]   promote the heck out of it.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:15.240]   And this is why my conspiracy theory hat goes on, is that if the record, after all this
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.200]   PR, if the record companies are smart, they're gonna push everybody to Apple music.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:26.720]   Because there is no cost for the listener to jump in for three months, and they get money
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.720]   out of it.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.160]   >> Like this is the record companies right now can print money from this now.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.440]   >> So are you thinking that this was big a plan all along?
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.880]   >> No, no, no, no.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.760]   It's like the old saying, but the executive was responsible for New Coke asking, hey,
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.480]   is this just a PR campaign to promote Coke?
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.000]   And he said, we're not that smart.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.480]   We're not that stupid either.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:51.200]   I do believe that the speed at which this decision came in close to, at least close to
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.040]   Taylor Swift post, I think that that does underscore that this whole question about are
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.920]   we going to pay out money for the first three months of users?
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.920]   That inside of Apple, I believe that that was a very, very hotly argued topic, that it
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.200]   wasn't a decision that was made on universal consensus.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.360]   And that at the, I believe that at the end that decision was made, said, look, we gotta
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.960]   make this decision, let's just go this way and whatever happens happens.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.760]   I do think that even after the announcement was made, it could have tipped one way or
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.760]   another.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.840]   And I believe that Apple deciding that given that there were pros and cons of each way,
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.880]   there are advocates at the top for either direction.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.640]   They said that if we cave in right now, when we have this incredibly critical launch in
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.840]   less than a week from now, this will not be the discussion about whether or not we're
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.000]   screwing over independent artists, it will be a discussion about Apple music.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   And that's what I think happened.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.840]   Yeah, it's good for Apple music.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.440]   I mean, it's costly, but potentially costly.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.720]   Yeah, they've already spent a lot of money on beats.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.200]   They're already spending a lot of money down the path.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.680]   They can afford to do this.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.120]   And here's the thing is that if the music industry figures out that they can just cash
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.760]   in on this, and if the artist all push it and everyone pushes it, Apple could end up
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.640]   paying out more money in the first three months than Spotify paid its entire history.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.640]   And that is a PR bundle for Apple that is worth the money.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.640]   Probably is.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.080]   Yeah, 100 million people line up.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.080]   That's good.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.920]   They really are consistently trying to fight the idea that a free service is a business
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.160]   that any real business is going to get into.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.160]   It should be instead, though, that Spotify does pay out their artists even on behalf
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.920]   of people who are using the free layer.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:38.240]   The difference is that they're not getting, essentially, they get credit for ad revenue
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.480]   that is sold to these free listeners.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.880]   And that is added to the main pile of money that's coming in from per play clicks from
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.280]   the rest of the service.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.720]   So it's Apple was on thin ice here.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:55.160]   And another part of the problem was that, and this is probably unfair, but humanity is
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.160]   not fair.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:03.920]   When the most widely quoted figures about Apple is how many, how close to $200 billion in
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:09.440]   actual workable money that they have on hand, it's hard for them to, it becomes harder
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.440]   for them to explain.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.520]   Here's why we don't feel like paying out money for the three months worth of content that
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.760]   we're actually using.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.160]   That's, again, it's an emotional argument that people are making against Apple, but
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.440]   it can be an effective one and it might be one that Apple said, if we write a check, this
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.440]   goes away.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.360]   Just to add to what Andy was saying, I heard the same thing, that it was highly contentious,
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.400]   you know, at the top levels and that people were arguing about it, even up to the last
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.120]   minute when he was making his tweets.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.040]   And that, but it's also important to understand this shows us several things.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.600]   Apple music is incredibly important.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.840]   Apple is a company.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.840]   It's not just a product that they want to use to sell iPhones.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.840]   You can witness that by seeing the Android app is coming for it.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.120]   Apple music is a big deal and people care about it at the very highest level of Apple,
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.880]   which is probably why you get the senior vice president of iTunes, sort of internet services
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.080]   on Twitter at that late at night on a Sunday.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.880]   But also it's, it is a discussion.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.920]   It's not like evil people versus good people.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.920]   There are people who think that maybe if Apple throws their money at this, and Apple
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.640]   really does believe down to their core that they need three months, they were willing
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.120]   to sacrifice a lot of things to get this three month trial, but that if they just throw
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.880]   money at it, they might get a little government oversight the way they got it with e-books
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.360]   or the way they've, they're already being looked at by states attorneys general for music.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.040]   There's sometimes when Apple feels that money alone can't solve a problem, that whether
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.000]   you believe that, that the DOJ lawsuit over e-books was, was prompted or not, or whether
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.440]   you think that states attorneys general should already be looking at Apple music or not.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.680]   They have that fear in them now that just, that just money makes them a target for things.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.120]   So it's not always a cut and dry.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.000]   Just throw our money at it either.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   It's interesting.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.160]   Taylor obviously would make a great diplomat because even from the title of the posts on
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.280]   right through it, it's all about, I love you, Apple.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.520]   You're great, you're ingenious, you're innovators, you push the right boundaries.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.960]   It's just this one little thing.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.960]   So it was, I almost feel like she kind of knew she'd win this battle and she certainly
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.360]   knew that Apple would still be an important part of her music strategy.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.880]   She also says something very strange.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.920]   She says at the end, "We don't ask for free iPhones.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.120]   Please don't ask us to provide you with our music.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.840]   I'm pretty sure Taylor Smith Swift has never paid for an iPhone.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.640]   Then in fact, maybe she doesn't have to ask, but every artist in the industry gets free
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.640]   iPhones.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.640]   It's a great break."
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.680]   Well, I think the label sends a tour, then they charge them for a time.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.680]   Charge it back.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.600]   But the labels are the bad guys here.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.560]   I think this whole discussion really bypasses the real problem here, which is the record
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.080]   labels.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.960]   The only guy at Apple who feels bad about this at this point is the guy who spent eight
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.640]   months of his life negotiating this deal with the record labels, only to see it thrown
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.640]   out the window, the minute it goes.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.880]   You know, there was an accountant at Apple who was going, "We're really going to pay for
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.880]   all the iTunes stuff for three months, for free on this as well.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.880]   I've got a server I've got."
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:53.240]   I mean, don't you think Apple worked hard to get to the, they're paying 71.5% instead
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.880]   of 70% to the record labels?
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.880]   That was part of the deal.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.600]   And what we'd like to have this free for three months, don't you think that was a big
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.600]   negotiation they had with the labels?
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.640]   And Jimity, what is that?
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.040]   The lightning storm is right over top of my head right now.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.040]   I'm scared.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.040]   Oh my God, I'm getting that out.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.840]   I was about to jump out of the table.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.360]   Alex is in a turn to the flash right in front of us.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.560]   The lightning bolt, it was instantaneous to the sound, which means that it must be right
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.560]   here.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.560]   There's flash flood warning.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.560]   You start one Mississippi.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.120]   As long as the server doesn't get, there we go.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.120]   Here comes another one.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.080]   Are you in Pittsburgh?
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.080]   Where are you?
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.080]   I am.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.080]   I'm in Pittsburgh.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.080]   We had a lot of rain here unlike California.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.680]   Did you sacrifice to the Thunder God lately?
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.680]   I haven't on it.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.680]   I think I probably should have.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.680]   I think you might.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.680]   Oh yeah, it's a little.
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.680]   So people are saying Taylor Swift has her own label.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.080]   She has an imprint under a real label.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.080]   Right?
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.600]   I mean, you look at, but you look at this letter and it's, it's, well, the difficulty
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.800]   of any of us trying to discuss this is that we don't know exactly what's going on behind
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.800]   the scenes.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.720]   We don't know what the legal repercussions they have or any of the stuff that they signed
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.960]   is.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.600]   But the thing that occurred to me reading this is that there was no matter what was going
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.360]   on, there was absolutely no downside to Taylor Swift's or Taylor Swift's people posting this
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:13.520]   where either this would affect actual change in which Halo, how great, how great and respected
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.800]   Taylor Swift's word is, or nothing would happen in which she has seen us sticking up
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.960]   for independent musicians.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.720]   Either way, this is, it's good stuff for her to do.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.560]   And in terms of self interest, there's certainly going to be a larger self interest of a kind.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:32.520]   But listen to what you can't think that this was a problem that she needed to solve for
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.520]   herself.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.520]   I put it back.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.520]   No, and that she says that.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.360]   And you know, she's obviously doing fine.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.640]   Tom Conrad, who's the CTO at Pandora, had a series of eight tweets.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.640]   He's pretty angry.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.520]   Spotify, he starts Spotify, YouTube Pandora and all others pay artists for their free
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.040]   tears and trials.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.040]   It's the right thing to do.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.720]   Swift took her new album off Spotify, not because she's not paid, but because she feels
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.320]   their free service, quote, devalues music.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.280]   Swift never pulled from YouTube, which is the most popular free service.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.360]   And certainly devalues music if Spotify does.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.520]   This career was built in terrestrial radio play, which is a free service.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.600]   And people don't necessarily understand this.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.280]   I know you do, Alex.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.000]   Doesn't pay recording artists.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.440]   They only pay the publishing rights.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:24.280]   The ASCAP BMI fees go to the songwriter or whoever owns the copyright.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.840]   Apple isn't getting rid of its long free trial and is now going, but is now going to pay
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.840]   artists.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.200]   This simply puts it at parity with everyone else.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.400]   Reminder, Apple uses music to make billions off hardware.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.600]   It's nothing from this.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:42.040]   Swift's letter, and this is the important part, and Apple's response is mostly theater.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.520]   Nothing here to suggest that Apple treats artists more fairly than anyone else.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.520]   My point is this.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.840]   There's too much animus between artists and Silicon Valley.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.040]   We shouldn't herald this move as progress.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.040]   Its status quo.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.440]   And my point is the artists should embrace Silicon Valley and get rid of the labels because
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.080]   that's the predator here, not Apple.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:05.800]   Yeah, especially people at opposite ends of their careers.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.840]   If you're an established band, you can certainly make so much money off a touring that you
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.720]   can essentially turn your album business into a hobby where it has to, just like Apple,
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.360]   treats certain services as this is not where we're getting our revenue from.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.760]   This increases the value of our mainline businesses.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.720]   Also if you're starting off in this business and you're not used to making money anyway,
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:30.360]   why not give up 95% of the money being generated by your work?
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.520]   Why not take 88% of it?
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.520]   And do it that way?
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.880]   It's the people in the middle that might have a problem.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.200]   But the larger message that if anybody in this industry needs to take anything away,
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.440]   if artists need to take anything away, it's that you have to really move to find a way
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:50.600]   to build your business so that streaming makes a whole lot of sense to you.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.840]   It's just the direction that every single consumer is going.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:00.640]   The reason why everybody was "giving away stuff for free" on radio 50, 60 years ago
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.600]   is because this is the way the business works.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.320]   This is how you attract people to the money line.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.080]   And this is where people are discovering new music.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.000]   People aren't buying CDs, they're not buying digital downloads.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.920]   They are streaming and subscribing to streaming services.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.960]   And if you want that kind of attention, you have to basically change your entire business
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.840]   or invent your business so that streaming makes sense to you.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.840]   You don't have a choice about that.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.440]   It's like newspapers or magazines, they cannot pretend that there are no iPads and there's
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.440]   no web browsers up there.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.720]   You can do that, have fun for the next 2.8 months before you get bought by AOL.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.640]   And then there's freelance photographer Jason Sheldon who's a concert photographer.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.040]   He goes to concerts kind of on spec.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.680]   Publications will say, "Can you get some shots of that concert and maybe we'll buy them?"
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.760]   He says, "Taylor's agreement which photographers are required before they're allowed to shoot
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:54.480]   at her concerts basically say she owns the rights to everything you take, every picture
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:17:01.360]   you take and that you, you know, the copyright is hers and you cannot, you can, you know,
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.320]   if you're lucky enough to sell it to the original publication, requesting publication,
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:07.960]   that's fine but you cannot do anything else with it after that."
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.880]   And he feels like Taylor Swift is doing the same thing to photographers that she claimed
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.520]   Apple is doing to recording artists.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.520]   I don't know how that is.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.520]   Humans are funny.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.040]   Like one of the things I noticed is that everyone on Twitter, at least when I was following
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.800]   it, was saying that either the artist should suck it up or that Apple should pay and almost
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.160]   no one said, "Hey, why can't we start paying for the music immediately if we want to?
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.320]   Why can't we pay for this?"
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.320]   There you go.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.560]   Because nobody wants to pay for concerts anymore.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.040]   They always want someone else to pay for them.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.040]   It's a really good point.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.040]   Apple's a great target.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.320]   The recording artists are a great target.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:40.400]   It happens with apps, it happens with websites, it happens like we go through the podcast.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.000]   That's a very excellent point.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.040]   Can I just make a point?
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.600]   I do think that there's a lot of sense in what you say.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:51.960]   I also think there's a lot of sense in comparing it to you're going out to eat with three
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.960]   friends of yours.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.200]   One of these friends makes $1.8 billion a year.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.320]   The rest of you are doing okay.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.920]   He wants to stiff the waitress for a tip.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.480]   And he tells the rest of the tip, "Well, look, if you want to tip them 40% to make up
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.400]   for what I'm not going to kick in, why don't you go ahead and do that?"
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.360]   I understand all that.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:14.040]   And I think that this move from Apple's part is absolutely, they could not buy this.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.280]   The best way to put it for me is that this is a huge investment for Apple.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.800]   Paying off artists has so many returns to them that it should be a no-brainer.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.160]   But I also am continuously surprised.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.440]   You hear it every day, developers talking about how they can't make sustainable businesses
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.280]   on anybody's app store.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.600]   Amazon was toying with subscription app services as part of Prime.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.480]   You have this race to the bottom where you want these streaming services.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.960]   But I don't know if Apple pays the artist or not, if 100 million people sign up or not.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.160]   I still don't know if it's going to be sustainable.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.280]   I don't know if content blockers are going to hurt websites.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.240]   I don't know if podcasts are going to make enough.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.880]   All of this goes back to, as individuals, we don't want to pay for this stuff anymore.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.680]   But we still want it produced at a very high level.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.880]   And I think all of us are struggling to find those models.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.200]   But I think a lot of people are willing to pay their 10 bucks a month.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.720]   In fact, for me, the family edition is going to drop my cost in streaming.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.920]   So $14.99 for six people is going to be a lot less than I'm paying now.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.520]   If Spotify, which they said they will, does the same thing, would that change your tune
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.520]   or are you going to beat?
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.520]   No matter what?
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.680]   No, I'm leaving Spotify.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.760]   And the number one reason I'm leaving Spotify is because every time I turn on my phone,
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.720]   I have to go into settings and turn off social.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.800]   You know, so like I don't want to share with anyone what I'm playing because I don't want
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.160]   to commit help and I listen to Katy Perry or Taylor Swift or anything else.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.160]   I'm proud of that.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.160]   I like to.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.160]   I like to.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.160]   I like to say that you like it.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.560]   No, but I, but I, but I, I don't, I hate that.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.400]   I hate that I have to do that every single time.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.400]   I don't want to share that.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.240]   And so, and they will not leave it off.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.240]   They leave it off for six hours and it makes me so angry that I hate Spotify.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.840]   So, so like, like it's, it's, so I listen to it because it's a thing, but it, it is like
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.000]   this thing that I just wish they, I don't under, I do not understand why they do that.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.280]   You know, like I just don't understand why.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.560]   Because I use it or I can't turn it off and say I don't want to be, I don't want to
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.560]   be track.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.560]   Probably most people want it, but maybe not.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.480]   But the thing is, if it just switched off and then stayed off, we'd all be friends.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.000]   Why do you, you, you know, I have to look at mine.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.440]   You have to keep turning it off.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.040]   Yeah, it turns back on every six hours if you don't use it.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.040]   Wow.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.440]   And so the thing is, is that one little switch is why I'm leaving Spotify.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.320]   Is that, you know, it's just that this, this is annoying thing that I have to do.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:19.960]   Oh, I see you turn on a private session each time, but you can, you could turn off publish
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.240]   activity and then it will not share your activity.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.040]   It will not share it to Spotify.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.040]   It'll still share it to Spotify.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:31.880]   So you, but you could also unattach Facebook to Spotify, right?
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.880]   No, no, no, it won't.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.680]   Like if you do, if you turn off all the sharing, it won't put it on Facebook, but it will put
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.320]   it on anyone following you on Spotify.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.800]   Well, you could turn that off too.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   It says right here.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.800]   Okay.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.440]   Well, I haven't, at least on my mind, it looked like you needed to have, you needed to have
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.440]   that there.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.440]   So I could turn off.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.440]   Turn off.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.840]   There's two settings in the social.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:54.160]   There's a pub private session, which lasts until you're inactive for six hours, right?
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.080]   But then underneath it, publish activity and you turn that off.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.440]   That's the one where it saves my activity and what I listen to with my followers on
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.440]   Spotify.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.560]   If you turn that off, you won't be sharing that.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.040]   Because I just, I don't, I, I've never understood why it doesn't work.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.680]   And then you could turn off Facebook show activity.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.080]   Yeah, you could turn these off.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.080]   Alex, get in your settings.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.080]   Well, there you go.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.080]   You could turn them both off, but he still doesn't, he's still going to Apple music.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.080]   I guarantee you.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.080]   I guarantee you.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:21.960]   Mostly because I still understand, I, I, again, like for me, it would just, I would just be
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.280]   able to turn that all the way off and know that it's off.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.280]   That's all.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.840]   I just don't like, don't like your hand.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.840]   Go check your socials.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.840]   I'll check.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:29.840]   I'll check the social.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.840]   Oh, I know it won't go to the other ones.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:31.840]   It's just mostly the Spotify.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.840]   There's a set up for that too.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:33.840]   If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.840]   That may be the, they may, maybe they change it.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:35.840]   It might be the new Spotify.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.120]   Cause this is, I'm using the new Spotify.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.640]   Cause our podcasts are on there.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.200]   Oh, no, there's, there's buttons in here.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   I'll check it out.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:47.000]   So the, it's hard to check your own session as to whether you're being shared by yourself.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.280]   So it's, so the, so anyway, the, but I think that I, I do think that the Apple service
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.480]   is going to be, I mean, it's going to push Spotify to, to put in a lot more.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.320]   They'll do a family plan.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.320]   A lot more features.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.320]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.440]   The big problem that all these companies are going to have is if for some reason, Apple
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:08.880]   is as successful as their goal, it's going to be very hard to catch up.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.880]   Hey, here's the question.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.720]   Well, I just, Dallas says, does Apple music, last streaming of music that contains explicit
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.720]   lyrics?
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.720]   Of course it does.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.280]   But, but I think that if Apple gets to a hundred million, I don't see how, if they did, I'm
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.920]   not saying they will, it's probably, you know, but again, we have this odd situation now
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:32.000]   where Apple, and I agree with Renee, I think Apple could not without pressure from an external
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   source.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.840]   I think if they had just gone ahead and paid for it, there would have been all kinds of
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.840]   a,
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:38.840]   Cause the DOJ.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.960]   I think there would have been all kinds of issues, but seeing that public pressure and
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.960]   then saying, Oh, okay.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.960]   Okay.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.960]   Okay.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.120]   I think that that actually is something they very much needed, which is might be why they
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.120]   reacted so quickly.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.120]   Right.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:55.160]   The, but the, but I think that that, because because I think that that, this may turn out
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.680]   to be key, this three months that no one has to pay for it, that, that all the artists
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.840]   and all the record companies have a vested interest in getting money from people who
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:07.040]   aren't paying, you know, getting full price, full payment, you know, could be very expensive
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.040]   for Apple.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:13.920]   But at the same time, if they, if they actually get to even 20 million, 30 million, at that
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:18.160]   point it becomes very, very difficult for some of these other services to, to keep up.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.320]   I know that we think that, that we'd like to have it, but you're talking about once they
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:25.040]   get to a certain size, what they have is they now have all those efficiencies of being
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.520]   able to do exclusives and being able, and they have some of that anyway, but they can
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.520]   do lots of exclusives.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.440]   And what happens is the whole industry starts paying attention to who's the largest in the
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.440]   largest game.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:39.720]   And the industry will become very, very, you know, they'll, they'll basically start, you
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.360]   know, whenever those contracts expire with Spotify, if Apple gets bigger than Spotify,
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.640]   all those contracts with Spotify will take everything off the free version.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.640]   They won't do it yet.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.280]   But I think Apple is going to definitely influence the industry.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:56.960]   Already Google today launched a free music streaming service.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.320]   This is basically songs that which Google acquired.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.200]   It'll be ad supported.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.440]   Originally you had to be a member, you know, pay for Google all access to get these streams.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.160]   Now you can get them for free.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:12.120]   Out on Android today, it'll be out soon on iOS.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.400]   It is out also on the web.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:18.200]   And it's, see, I use Google Music and Spotify because Spotify doesn't let me put my own
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.320]   collection up there, which I like.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.680]   I want the Beatles.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.920]   So there's the advantage of Google.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.920]   All right.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.920]   Well, I think this is a very interesting landscape.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.640]   Renee, you said an interesting thing though, something I've said, but then others have
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.840]   disagreed with.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.680]   I think this is important for Apple.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:41.040]   Oh, no, it is absolutely, they consider this a huge priority as a company.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.520]   They really believe that music is an Apple's DNA and that they're not part of the current
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.520]   conversation.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.200]   Is it financially critical?
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.200]   No.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:53.280]   In fact, I think that if someone was looking at this purely financially, you could, Apple
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.040]   could be hugely successful without having a music product.
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:00.480]   But I think Apple is just so intrinsically tied to music that they consider it a point
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.120]   of pride maybe at an executive level that they want to be in music and they want to
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.120]   do it well.
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.840]   How much do they make on iTunes selling?
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.320]   I mean, is it a good business for Apple?
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.320]   For a long time they said we don't make anything.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:16.160]   Well, if you count the App Store now, I mean, the App Store has been on a continual rise
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.200]   and it's hard to, I don't know if they break out the numbers, but they were underpaying,
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.640]   they were trying to subsidize movies for a while.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.400]   They do a lot to sort of eat the costs for entertainment at times.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.560]   And I'm sure they've made good money on it over the years, but it's not their current
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.560]   growth trajectory.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.200]   I think the ecosystem is really important too.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:39.640]   I mean, I think, you know, a really, really strong song, you know, music subscription leads
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.040]   to a really, really strong video subscription.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.520]   So I think that it's part of a brick, you know, building blocks of stuff.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.800]   I think that as an ecosystem, it's important for Apple not to lose that.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.640]   It's also critical for millennials.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.200]   Apple needs to continue to grow in the under 25s.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.560]   It's culturally important.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.320]   I mean, that's part of the reason for beats.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:01.400]   Apple used to be the earbuds, earpods that everybody saw on the iPod that everybody wore.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.000]   And now it's the beats logo around your neck and to be culturally important.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   I think you need some of that aspect.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.840]   I think that part of it is making sure that you spend as much time inside the Apple ecosystem
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:14.720]   as possible, not just so that you're all the money's coming in from every single source,
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.240]   but to make sure that you're providing a consistent, seamless experience, no matter
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.040]   where this user wants to go or what they want to do.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:25.720]   Totally Ruth Renee that I think they also just think that they are a company that is
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.600]   intrinsic into the arts.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.640]   And so they want to be, they want to continue to be associated with music.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:36.000]   They want to, I'm sure, be more involved in live music than they are today because they
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.480]   feel as though that's very much part of their DNA.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:43.560]   An interesting difference though is that I feel a little bit sorry for companies like
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:48.320]   Spotify and Pandora because they have to make money off of their music service.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.840]   Not only that, but they have to make a lot of money off of their music service.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:55.160]   Whereas with Apple and Google, they're not running it as a hobby, they're not running
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:27:00.400]   it as a loss, but so long as it makes an okay profit, it fits in great with their large
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.840]   portfolio.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.840]   And that's a big, big stick to, at least a shake at Pandora and Spotify.
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.560]   Well, and I think also, I don't think Apple needs it to make money anytime soon.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.480]   I think that it could lose money for one time before Apple.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:18.200]   Yeah, I remember the App Store was they described it as being a little bit profitable, but not
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.800]   really a cash cow.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.640]   And then that changed pretty quickly.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.240]   Is Apple's chipset business profitable?
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.440]   I mean, they don't even look at it that way.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.640]   There's not a profit and loss of cost to the organization for them.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.640]   And this is part of the deal.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.640]   You know, I really would like to see Apple.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.080]   We're seeing this happen.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.040]   What's happening in the television business is very interesting.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:40.080]   Over the top stuff, the ability for content creators to sell directly to consumers bypassing
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.600]   the big cable companies.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:46.400]   Wouldn't it be an interesting analogy for Apple to do the same over the top music?
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:52.640]   Let's bypass these predatory labels who have historically ripped off artists and let,
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:57.560]   and I'm not saying Apple should become a label, eliminate the concept of a label and let Apple
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.480]   sell directly to consumers.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.480]   Artists sell directly to customers.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.520]   I happen to do that and do it so well.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.080]   And I think that Apple's going that direction where they're going to actually provide, you
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.560]   know, they're talking about artists large and small, being able to promote themselves.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:14.320]   And again, if that ecosystem gets really large, it makes it like the App Store.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.520]   I mean, now a lot of people say you can't make a living on App Store.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.200]   Well, there are definitely people making a living on App Store.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.480]   Apple should go to Taylor Swift and say, we forget your label.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.840]   We want to distribute your music.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.800]   All that money you want to, we'll just give it to you.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.520]   We'll give it directly to you.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.520]   I don't know.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.640]   I mean, I don't know if any artists would really want to sign up for that because think
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.520]   about, for instance, the difference between Apple.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.920]   Is the label too for them?
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.520]   No, I'm not defending labels.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.120]   I'm saying that this, again, this is your business.
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.240]   This is where you're going to be keeping a roof over your head and food and your kids'
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.400]   mouths from.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:52.000]   And you have person A who's saying, I have never, ever been in this business before.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.640]   And I've got a hundred different businesses.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:58.120]   I decided to make it a hundred and one, but trust me, we'll figure this out over the next
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.440]   two, three or four, five years.
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.680]   And by the time someone signs up for those in five years, we'll really get this.
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.680]   But we really want to practice on you and your career.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:11.080]   I think there'll be more people saying, why don't instead of signing with you, I hire
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:16.360]   a couple of consultants who have more experience in doing this business than Apple.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:23.280]   And I think, and as someone who I admittedly, I used to work for a label, Sony, and we used
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.080]   to work with alternative rock artists mostly.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:32.160]   And what I will say is that it's not that labels don't do anything, just in their defense.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.200]   They are artists or artists and labels are the business that makes them money.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.680]   I mean, because there are a handful of artists.
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:45.120]   There are definitely artists out there, Anthony DeFranco, Pompaloos, other people who understand
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.760]   their business model well enough to implement it and make money at it and make a living
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.760]   at it.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:54.240]   But the vast majority of artists, I don't think, are in that space.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.440]   And they get to a point and some of them are, Taylor Swift is probably a good example of
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.200]   someone who can be, who's very savvy in that area.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:06.080]   But there's a lot of things that refine the artists, refine that process, promote it.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.280]   There's a lot of work, there has been a lot of work to do the grassroots.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:15.840]   So it's not all artists will be able to be successful without some kind of support network
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.440]   that makes that possible.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:23.760]   But I do think that there are, Apple is going to open the door for the ones that can figure
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.880]   that out, that can build their own organic audience to be successful.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.400]   So it's, but it's a different, there's different classes of artists.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.200]   And I think some artists don't need the labels and I think some artists.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:40.720]   I think Apple, if they want this to succeed needs to, I think right now, the fate of Spotify,
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:45.920]   Pandora, and I guess Apple is held in the hands of the labels because the labels control
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:52.240]   the music and the, the, the services only exist as long as the labels allow them to.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.880]   The minute labels and there's really five big labels, the minute these labels say, forget
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.240]   it, they're out of business.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.720]   They're literally out of business.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.080]   Every one of us stops subscribing.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.040]   So what's, what's interesting though is that, you know, they're going to play to the labels
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:12.120]   for a while, but we should remember that, but between Iovine, Dre, and, and, and Trent
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:18.160]   Resner, what you have are actually three producers, you know, that, that can produce music.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.160]   Yeah, that's not a label.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.160]   I understand.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.160]   It's not a label, but I'm, what I'm saying is, is if Apple decided to do their own, you
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.280]   know, start doing their own stuff and managing their own process, they have three people
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.520]   in the company now that are some of the best in the world of doing that.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.840]   You know, they didn't come from just doing business deals.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.240]   I mean, these guys really understand the music industry and, and so to get back to your
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.800]   point, if, but I mean, they can definitely provide that opportunity, but Apple now has
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:46.400]   the capacity internally to, to do their own, you know, direct to, you know, direct to
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.400]   Apple music service.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:51.600]   I don't think these people, artists use the labels to do their business.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.440]   They have business managers to do their business.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.440]   Because if you didn't, you're, you're really giving your, you're letting the lion rule
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.160]   the roost here to mix a metaphor is terrible.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.160]   Well, some of them do.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.080]   I mean, some of them definitely as they get, as they get larger, they end up with managers,
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.520]   but a lot of times, I mean, these little, these little, these little, these are a lot
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:08.520]   of mistake.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.960]   And I think you can ask the chambers, brothers and a million other people, was that a good
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.760]   idea to let the label tell you what your deal was going to be?
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.760]   It's not.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.760]   It's not.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.160]   I'm reading the Beatles book.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:25.560]   They got the standard royalty was a penny per record on, on 85% of the revenue.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:31.600]   So when they released their first big hit, Love, Love Me Do, they made each 30 pounds
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.600]   for sales of 68,000 records.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.640]   And that was normal.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.640]   It still is normal.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:43.880]   In fact, one of the reasons Yoko, I mean, Michael Jackson owned the Beatles music was
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.640]   because they never had the copyright.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.560]   And immediately went the publishing rights and the copyrights immediately went to the
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.280]   publishing house.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.840]   So it's this is historically a horrible deal for artists.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.000]   In the old days, you needed it because who had the, who had the record studios?
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   The labels did.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.440]   Don't need, don't need to pay for $100,000 recording studio anymore.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.520]   You could do it on your Mac.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.520]   They did marketing.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.960]   Well, that made sense when you had radio stations.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.080]   I doubt a, I do, you used to do that.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.080]   Didn't you Alex?
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.080]   You were a music director.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.080]   I was the, I was market.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.080]   I was the music director.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.440]   You'd go to music director and, and, and a marketing.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.480]   And, and did marketing on the other side as well.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.480]   And so it was definitely, that was a lot of work there to get.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:22.040]   Yeah, but I think they still do that.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.040]   Oh yeah.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.040]   Okay.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.040]   They definitely do that.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.040]   Yeah, but, but, but, but it does shorten this.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.160]   Again, one large service.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:37.800]   I think that, that is, that has enough people in it that builds an ecosystem that of people
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.800]   who are buying.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:43.600]   And that's something that Apple can probably get pretty, pretty good at.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:48.280]   And provides, you know, a real opportunity for artists to, you know, to do very, very
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.280]   well.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.280]   On their own.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.400]   Like just being able to release, you know, get a, get a following through their videos,
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.400]   through postings, through.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:59.400]   There's an, there's an opportunity here for somebody to, you know, to, to, like a Jonathan
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.920]   Colton to say, Hey, I know how to do this.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:03.920]   Here's what you do.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:04.920]   You do this.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.920]   You do this.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.920]   You do this to new artists.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.680]   If I were a new artist, he's, I mean, really, if you were a new artist, would you sign with
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:09.680]   a label today?
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.840]   I think it just depends on the artist.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.880]   But I'd say, but 80 by 85% I'd say no.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.640]   If you're, and if you're a cartoonist, you don't want your strip to be an ascendant kit.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:19.640]   Same thing, right?
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:25.360]   You're going to take the Scott Kurtz model or the, or the Penny, Penny Arcade model.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:30.320]   So I just, I, maybe Apple's not the right company to do this, but I think if Apple really
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.080]   wanted to look out for artists, there's an opportunity here.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.080]   Let's go over.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.080]   Let's, let's go.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.920]   Whatever the equivalent is in music of over the top, let's do it.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.920]   App Store model.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.920]   Okay.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:47.520]   And it'll be, you know, I think we're definitely going to see some rags to riches, you know,
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:52.120]   kind of folks where you have, you know, just like the App Store, there's a lot of people
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.880]   that don't make money at it, but there are a handful of people that were programming
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:00.000]   away in their, in their, in Vietnam and suddenly have money coming in that they don't know
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   what to do with.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.440]   So, you know, so to quote a line from the movie, 1776, most people would rather fight
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:10.560]   to protect the, the chance that they will become rich than to face, to the reality that
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.560]   they are poor.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:14.880]   I mean, it's the, the great, I mean, the great thing about the way the content is created
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.920]   these days is that you feel as though it really, there are a lot of things you can't control,
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.960]   but it's step one of a hundred step process and anybody can get in line.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:28.640]   It's like the US Open where anybody in the country can compete to be the best golfer
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:34.120]   to be the winner of this prestigious, prestigious tournament because it is literally open to
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.080]   amateurs and professionals.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.320]   You're probably not going to make it, but there is that possibility.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:43.800]   And every time, every time I go onto YouTube and I see, oh, that's kind of a weird video
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.760]   like, oh, what, I wonder, I wonder why this person, oh, look, they've got 5.2 million
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.800]   viewers and each video gets 1.1 million views minimum.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.680]   It's like the, the, the internet is full of world famous people that almost nobody's ever
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.680]   heard of.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.280]   And that's, they're people are making very, very good livings directly creating content
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.760]   for the audience of that thing.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:07.480]   I spent, I spent two hours last night watching Ben Heck's solder things on a, on a big 50
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:10.920]   inch TV because I like to watch Ben Heck's solder things.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:11.920]   Absolutely.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:17.200]   And so, and so, and I'm, I'm absolutely thrilled if by watching this, I, I, in any way, allow
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.200]   him to continue to solder things on video for my, for my enjoyment.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.560]   It's okay that nobody else knows who he is.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:27.080]   It's okay that he can go into any red robin and simply be served a burger and fries without
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:31.560]   being bothered by anybody or being asked to sign an Arduino board.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:36.240]   It's, it's, it's a, it's a brand new world and people who are above the age of 40 might
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:40.800]   not intuitively understand that these, these possibilities are open to anybody.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:45.480]   And I think that you're, you're always going to have with all of these things this, this
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:50.080]   again, this different set of people like we've worked with a lot of YouTube stars.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:53.880]   And the one thing that we've learned to a person is that they are machines.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:58.280]   I mean, they, they, they understand exactly how they're getting that, that viewership.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.960]   And you know, I, we don't, I haven't worked with any of them that did it by accident.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:05.080]   And, you know, they, they, they, they tweet.
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.560]   They plan things.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.600]   They know exactly when all the stuff's going to come out and the timing, what time of
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.600]   day to release it in.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.600]   I'll fouch for that.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:16.600]   I mean, even I who produce a lot of content, a fairly robust business have never figured
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.040]   out how to do it on YouTube.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.040]   Ever.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.440]   And, and so a thousand views, that's it.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:26.400]   And, and, but there's a lot of people who, who are, you know, but there's other people
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.440]   who just want to do their thing.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.480]   They just want to make their content and they don't want to figure out how to promote it.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.400]   And that's where maybe not labels, but some kind of PR firm or other things can, can
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.400]   be very useful.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.400]   All right.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.400]   We're going to take a break.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.600]   Come back with more and lots more to talk about.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:44.760]   Thank you Taylor Swift for the last half hour.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.760]   We love you.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.160]   It's funny because we did this.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:52.120]   Also, we talked a lot about it on Twitter, but the Apple hadn't changed their tune as
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.560]   we went to press, so to speak.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:59.840]   And Tom Merritt managed to get in about 18 Taylor Swift puns that I didn't get.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.600]   Because apparently I'm just not.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.440]   Did you see the New York Times headline Leo?
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.440]   No.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.640]   If you're going to play, play, play, you better pay, pay, pay.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.520]   Yeah, that's what that's another one.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.000]   Oh, the, the great lady decided to come up backwards baseball cap.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.680]   It's not very pretty.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.200]   I'm better.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.200]   I best get, get up to date on the Taylor Swift.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:23.120]   Ooh, but first let's talk about documentaries.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:28.120]   Our brand new sponsors Sundance Doc Club.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.800]   I bet you every one of you loves documentaries.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.840]   I certainly do.
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:38.920]   I love the idea of looking into the lives of, of people and kind of seeing what's the same,
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.600]   what's different, getting inspired.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:46.080]   I want you to go to doc club.com/macbreak.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.760]   We've got a 30 day free trial.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.280]   This is a really wonderful service.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:57.600]   And by the way, I've put together a little collection of five of my favorite documents
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.640]   on Doc Club documentaries.
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.000]   Hoop Dreams, you guys know that one, of course.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.240]   And I was, as I was, you know, picking these, we were watching the Golden State Warriors
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.240]   win the NBA championship.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:15.240]   And it was fun to think about these high school students and follow them as they kind of attempt
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.360]   to live their hoop dreams.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.040]   I really enjoyed that.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:23.880]   If you like sushi, even if you don't like sushi, you've got to see "Giro Dreams of Sushi."
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:29.280]   This is a three, Michelin three star chef in his 80s whose sushi restaurant is in the
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.280]   subway station at Ginza.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.120]   It has about 10 seats.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:40.360]   And the super slow-mo of their, of the tasting menu as they go through course by course will
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.760]   make you very, very hungry.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.960]   I also picked some less known ones like this Bert Stern.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.160]   He's the guy who did.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.880]   He was the, they call him the original madman.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:55.720]   He was the guy who did the last shoot of Marilyn Monroe and they talk a lot about that.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.240]   But they also talk about some of the iconic advertising he did.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.000]   He brought vodka to America in the 50s.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.880]   In the 50s, nobody drank vodka.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.760]   Schmernoff wanted to introduce it.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:11.720]   He took some very famous photos in Egypt, in the desert that put vodka on the map.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:12.720]   Just fun to see.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.120]   Anyway, here's the deal.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:18.620]   If you go, if you like documentaries, and I know you will, you can go right now to Doc
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:24.360]   Club.com/MacBreak and have 30 days free to watch all the documentaries.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.360]   And there's so many good ones.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.560]   I'm just scratching the surface.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.600]   They also have some great pics from other people, Susan Sarandon does her pics.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:36.640]   Ira Glass of this American life does his pics Dan Savage does his pics.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.640]   There's heroes.
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.960]   I'm so glad you picked that movie because it's not only this guy who is like a master
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:46.600]   at sushi, but then they interview the rice merchant who is also like the greatest rice
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:51.560]   person in the world who tells the story about how other merchants want to buy the same kind
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.040]   of rice that hero buys.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:58.680]   And he says, you think that you have the skill to prepare this rice properly.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:03.200]   I will not sell you the best rice in the world because you will not prepare it correctly.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:08.360]   It's also a family drama because his son wants to take over, right?
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.880]   But hero is kind of a, it's really, this is, oh, and man, you will be so hot.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.880]   You will be hungry after you watch this.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.880]   It's amazing.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:17.800]   And it's not, you know what's interesting and one of the things I really loved about
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:22.040]   this, the sushi itself is extremely simple.
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:26.760]   And yet the precision which with which even they make the rice is so fascinating.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:32.160]   Yeah, they, again, they walk you through like the apprentices that you spent eight months
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.040]   folding it, folding the towels.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:39.120]   The customers, because we are not going to let you handle food until you can prove you
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.120]   can fold the towel.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.120]   And he spends seven months doing it wrong.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.120]   I'm so hungry.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:49.720]   Look, go to, look, you can watch this and hundreds of other great documentaries right
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:54.280]   now, docclub.com/macbreak.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:58.360]   We invite you to try it for 30 days, absolutely free and you're going to love it.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.840]   Oh, and I should mention you can play it on your computer.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.120]   You can play it on Roku.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.120]   You can Airplay it.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.960]   I mean, there's, it has Chromecast.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.880]   There's an app for all the PRIOS and Android and all that stuff too.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:15.040]   So, I'm going to do a quick club.com/macbreak.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:19.520]   Continuing on, there is other news besides Taylor Swift somewhere.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.520]   I believe it.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:26.040]   El Capitan, Priviu Tu.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.960]   Have you started playing with that, Mr. Renee Richie?
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:34.400]   I've gotten through installing iOS 9 beta 2 and I'm working on watch beta 2 and then
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.400]   I'm going to get to help.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:36.400]   Oh my God.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.800]   Yeah, you did a great FAQ on iOS 9.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:43.960]   Now remember, 8.4 is going to come out like soon like in a few, maybe in a week, right?
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.240]   So then we can all get the new music.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.240]   Yes.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.200]   Well, 8.4 have any other changes or is it just going to add Apple music?
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.360]   Oh, little things.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:55.800]   But I, the new music app and Apple music and all that entails is going to be the big feature.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:00.280]   And do we know how much iTunes is going to change on the desktop?
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.720]   Have we seen the new iTunes?
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.720]   I don't think so.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.560]   Isn't there a new one to go with this?
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.480]   Well, define the real deal.
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.240]   Well, anything, there was a pretty recent revamp just.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:19.240]   Yeah, 12 is new with Yosemite, but I was, I don't know, I'm wishful thinking.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.880]   I was hoping that might rewrite it.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:25.000]   When we see iTunes for iCloud, then we'll get a, we'll be able to get to the future of
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.560]   what iTunes and the desktop should be.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.120]   There are still a lot of questions, open questions about Apple music.
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.640]   Apple is not replacing, it looks like not replacing iTunes radio.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.440]   That's going to continue.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:38.920]   I think that's, if you don't, I forget exactly how it works, I only heard it once, but I think
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.360]   that's the tier for people who aren't in Apple music.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:42.360]   Free tier.
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.760]   Yeah, you basically get that as your alternative.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.560]   And you get the new Beats 1 radio station.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.560]   Yes.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:55.360]   The innovative 24/7 radio station featuring three disc jockeys in LA New York and London.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.400]   Los Angeles, New York and the UK.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:11.160]   I think the biggest problem with the whole radio concept is that X-M isn't very good.
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.160]   It's horrible.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.160]   This is the fundamental.
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:19.240]   So the thing is, is that the handful of DJs is not, I don't know.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:24.360]   It's, you know, if, if you are still paying, what is it, 15 bucks a month for Sirius or
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:29.480]   X-M? just try Spotify for five seconds.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.880]   The sound quality is better.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.160]   I guess you have to have enough bandwidth to listen.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:37.840]   But, and there's so many more stations and it duplicates everything you can get in Sirius
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:41.520]   and X-M plus thousands of other stations.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.720]   I think the Beats 1 thing will be sort of what Alex was talking about before though because
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:48.720]   those three DJs can't carry on 24/7 is going to be other stuff and they've spoken about
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.720]   programming already.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:55.440]   So it might be Apple actually dipping their toe into what producing at least radio shows
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.440]   is like.
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.440]   Maybe that's the beginning, huh?
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:00.440]   Of a new label.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:01.440]   Not a bad point entry.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:04.440]   So how about, and I'm sorry, we're going to go back a little bit because I still need
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.760]   to understand this.
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.200]   How about iTunes Match?
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.320]   That's not going away.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:13.680]   It's unclear to me exactly how that's going to work but your iTunes Match content is available
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.680]   to you.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:17.160]   If you have stuff in there that's not in the streaming platform.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.680]   So if I'm paying 10 bucks a month, I figure that includes iTunes.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.680]   iTunes Match.
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:25.160]   I don't want to say anything because I might be wrong and I don't think they've released
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.160]   everything.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.160]   It's not clear.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.160]   It's going to work.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.160]   Okay.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.160]   Here's what you get with your membership.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.840]   So if you don't pay, you get the Artist Feed Unconnect, Follow Artist Unconnect.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:36.840]   Connect is kind of ping.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.280]   Listen to Beats 1 radio station.
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:42.160]   Listen to Apple Music radio stations with limited skipping.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.160]   Pay for it.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.920]   You get unlimited, all of the above plus unlimited skipping.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.000]   Play and Save Connect content.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.920]   Play Connect content or radio songs.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:54.400]   Enjoy unlimited listening from the Apple Music Library, which is, we don't know, but presumably
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.960]   the same size as everybody else.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.920]   It's a subset of iTunes.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.240]   Yeah, including, not including artists who've opted out of this.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.240]   Like the Beatles.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.520]   You can buy the Beatles but you can't stream the Beatles unless you buy the Beatles.
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.480]   And I think if you buy the Beatles then you can stream the Beatles because it does say,
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.720]   add Apple Music Tonta to your library, save for offline listening.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.000]   What doesn't say though, does it?
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.680]   What happens to your?
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:20.400]   So I bought the Beatles on iTunes or I bought the Beatles and ripped it and it's in my iTunes.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.200]   Can I stream it?
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:25.320]   I believe, I don't believe if it's in your iTunes but if it's in iTunes Match, I believe
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.680]   that is co-mingled.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.200]   Do I still have to pay for Match?
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.720]   Until you, until we see specifics.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.720]   We don't know.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:35.080]   And some of the stuff could change because they don't have to, even if you hear rumor
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.320]   of it now, it might be different.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.480]   It's changing as we speak, changed on Sunday.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.200]   Does Apple Music work with iTunes Masks?
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.640]   Yes, Apple Music and iTunes Match are independent but complimentary.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:53.520]   Well, licensing rights make it very, I mean, it's a very ginger thing to work around
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.520]   licensing rights.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:59.560]   That's a very good point because they've made a deal for Match with the record labels.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:00.960]   Do they have a new deal?
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:04.480]   It looks like Match is going to continue but that's a little annoying if I'm paying 10
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.320]   bucks a month for music.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.280]   I don't know.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.280]   We'll see what happens.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:10.280]   What do you do?
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.080]   I mean, we're getting complaints on both sides.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.040]   Some people are terrified that if they don't want Apple Music, they're going to lose iTunes
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.040]   Match.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.040]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.640]   I really, all the songs I really want are already in Match, frankly.
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:24.160]   Except for the Taylor Swift-er-Vra.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:32.240]   I've been trying to understand if Apple is trying to produce one unified system of,
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:36.680]   one unified music product or whether it's best to simply approach this as they now have
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:42.040]   five different music products, many of which can be used independently of each other and
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.640]   some of which can be used to enhance each other.
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:49.280]   I think I'm going to have to lean towards the second one where you assume that you've
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:53.040]   got five different companies, each called Apple, each suing each other for having complimentary
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.880]   products and just pick and choose what you want.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:57.880]   Okay.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.920]   So unknown is the answer.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:02.520]   But all will become clear.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:03.520]   Soon.
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.520]   It should.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:10.320]   It's for this Magic 8-Ball, I just shook.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.320]   Let's talk about iOS 9.
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:14.340]   You wrote a great FAQ, Renee Ritchie at iMoor.com.
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:19.040]   The answer is to all of your questions about iOS 9.
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:24.360]   I thought it was going to be quickly, and then two days later, I was sorry.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.440]   And it is available, but you have to...is it a public beta now?
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.080]   No, it's still a developer beta.
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:32.000]   The public beta starts as part of the Apple C program in July.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   July.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.600]   Capital 10 public beta in July as well?
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:36.600]   Yes.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:37.600]   Okay.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:45.040]   And your recommendations based on your usage still put it on a non-production machine?
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.400]   I have the same all the time.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.440]   If it's beta software, stay away if you don't need it.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:50.440]   Some people...
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:54.440]   Maybe you want to test software, maybe you're just a curious person or someone who enjoys
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:55.440]   doing that.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.880]   But then you've got to take on that responsibility because you lose Apple care support.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.160]   The device becomes a developer device.
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.720]   You can't just walk into an Apple store and get an expect service for it.
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.320]   It's opting into a different class of usership.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.480]   So you should be fully aware of that.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.800]   And if iOS 8 works on your device, iOS 9 will?
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:12.800]   Yes.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:13.800]   That's easiest way to know.
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:16.240]   Not every feature, but iOS 9 writ large will.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:19.640]   And that means binary compatibility, which is the most important thing.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:25.360]   Not on the original iPad, not on the iPhone 4 or earlier.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:28.200]   It will work on the fifth generation iPod touch.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.440]   I'm glad to see iPad 3rd generation as part of that, though.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.800]   I'm curious to see if there's anything that doesn't work.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:39.600]   Like for instance, if that new app switching system doesn't work on the iPad 3 given its
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.120]   lack of application RAM.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:46.720]   We will get it as an update as usual, just as you will get 8 for as an update as usual.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:47.720]   So you'll...
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:50.360]   You know, don't need to press the update button.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.520]   It'll alert you.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:55.800]   And the big news there is that because of all the new technology Apple is deploying, they'll
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.320]   be able to make it a much smaller download.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.760]   So 1.3 gigabytes instead of 4.7.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:04.440]   So those poor folks who bought the 8 gigabyte iPhones will not be left out in the cold.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.720]   Or not just because for that reason.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.720]   All right.
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.400]   1.3 gigs compared to 4.5.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.360]   That's a big difference.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:16.040]   And it's free, of course.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.840]   Give me the tent poles, says Renee Ritchie.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:19.840]   Here's the tent poles.
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:23.600]   Siri, Siri, Apple Pay, Notes, Maps, News is interesting.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:29.720]   Big type, which is the new keyboard and multitasking.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:31.720]   By the way, it wasn't clear.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:33.520]   Is news replacing, news stand?
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:34.520]   Yes.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.520]   So news stand is a pseudo folder.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.280]   It's not really an app and there were a bunch of apps contained within it.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:39.280]   So when you...
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:43.440]   Now an iOS 9, that folder is gone and all those apps are left free to roam the homepage.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:47.160]   So you don't get the magic magazine covers anymore, but they're like regular apps.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.160]   I'd prefer that.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.400]   The bigger question is whether those apps are going to stay around or they're going to
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.560]   shovel their content into.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:54.760]   Like, is there going to be a New York Times newspaper app or are they going to shovel
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:55.760]   content into news?
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:00.400]   They'll probably do both for a while, but ultimately we'll have to see.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:03.520]   According to the Verge, correct this if it's not true.
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:08.240]   Apple will actually delete some apps before the updates just to make room.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.280]   So this is if you are incredibly...
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.280]   And apps aren't that big.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:16.280]   I mean, if you have a giant epic Unreal Engine first person shooter, maybe it's pretty big,
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:20.520]   but they will delete apps, install the update, and then re-download those apps for you.
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:21.520]   So it should be almost transparent.
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.080]   You won't know what's going on.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.720]   No, that's just part of their new map.
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:28.520]   They're doing a lot of stuff to juggle almost everything now because there's no real advances
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:29.520]   in a lot of areas.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.840]   A lot of it is just being smarter use of software.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:35.400]   And the new Siri features?
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.600]   A bunch of them.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.600]   Siri's interesting.
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:40.600]   It's got a new interface.
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:43.120]   It buzzes now like it does on the watch.
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:47.520]   It has access to photographs, for example, because they show me the pictures in Petaluma
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.000]   last summer.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   It's...
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.840]   Apple's trying to make it do the proactive stuff the way Google's doing, but the huge
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:57.640]   difference is they're not a cloud company, so they don't think everything should necessarily
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:58.640]   has to be on the cloud.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:04.120]   So their gamble is they can operate on the cloud stuff like for movies or Wikipedia or
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:07.560]   information that has to be on the internet, then bring that down to your device and mingle
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:11.480]   it with your data on the device instead of bringing your data up to the cloud and mingling
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:12.480]   it there.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:15.880]   And they're hoping that devices are either now or soon will be powerful enough that you
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:19.640]   won't lose much by not having massive amounts of cloud computing behind it, but you will
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:24.000]   gain from the knowledge that that data, regardless of whether you think anyone uses or abuses
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.400]   your data, you'll know that it's on your device, so nobody can use or abuse it.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.920]   That's the big win.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:32.040]   The other thing you lose by going that road is remember that Google has all this machine
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:36.320]   learning stuff behind it so that it will actually tag things for you that you never tag.
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:40.760]   You can simply say, "Show me shots of the wedding last winter," and even though you didn't
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:46.080]   tag anything with location or with wedding or anything like that, it just sees women
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:49.840]   and white, a woman in a white dress dancing, they're like, "Okay, must be a wedding picture,
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:50.840]   we'll tag it that way."
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:54.040]   Yeah, that's like Google Photos that does some of that too.
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:56.520]   I'm sorry, that's why.
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:01.360]   It's interesting how I love it when both Apple and Google create the same service because
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:02.360]   each is a...
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:03.360]   You see the difference.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:04.360]   You see the difference.
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:05.360]   You see the difference.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:07.000]   The personality of the company, where here's what you're giving up by...
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.920]   Here's what Apple said, "We would like to do it this way, but we don't...
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:13.600]   We're not the company that wants to do it that way, so here's the feature."
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:16.400]   That's what we think is important versus Google saying, "Here's what we think is important."
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.400]   So it's always really cool.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:21.000]   You've seen this new Facebook thing with the face recognition and all that.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   That is wild.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.200]   What do you...
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:30.880]   As always, I never, ever, ever think that anything...
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:34.800]   I don't think they're an evil company, but I think that whereas there's at least a level
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.800]   of trust with me and Google that if they are going to match faces or if they're going
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:42.160]   to do something incredibly clever, my first reaction is, "Oh, I wonder how...
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:43.760]   That will be useful to me."
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.880]   When Facebook says, "We've done something really clever."
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:49.920]   I'm like, "Oh God, what settings am I going to have to make sure I never changed?"
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.640]   Changed after this.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:56.840]   We actually, Lisa and I have been having fun because both of us have photos on our phones
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:00.360]   of each other, which I guess we've never shared to each other.
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:03.960]   So what we've been doing is sharing back and forth the pictures.
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:07.400]   These are the pictures I took of Lisa at a dinner.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:11.320]   What you do is it'll find them and then it'll share them over.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:14.400]   But you're right, that face recognition is a little bit...
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:18.960]   They're claiming something like 83% accuracy even if the face is obscured.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:22.480]   They knew that this picture was Lisa.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.960]   How did they know that?
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.680]   They know that babies are full grown adults on some services.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:30.480]   Yeah, Google is amazing that way.
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.680]   You can actually have a pick...
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:37.160]   I was having conversations with somebody, people who were building this and they showed
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:38.160]   me.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:42.800]   I'm a newborn infant from one of our developers, 10 minutes old and here she is six years
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:45.040]   later and the software is able to...
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.000]   The difference is that I think that...
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.160]   Now, the difference between Google and Facebook, Google does face matching.
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.480]   It doesn't do face recognition.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:54.440]   We'll simply collect all these pictures together.
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:59.240]   Facebook will not only tag it with a name, but it will also say, "Hi, I saw this picture
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.240]   in your feed.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.240]   Is that Gurne Blanston?
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.240]   Because I want...
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:06.720]   Is this location correct?
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.600]   Is Gurne Blanston in this place?
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:09.600]   That's creepy.
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.240]   The line between useful and creepy is very thin.
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.840]   There is a lot from person to person.
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:16.240]   So like Andy, I'm really happy that we have different conversations.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:19.400]   I've had long conversations with people at Google who think Facebook is really creepy.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:23.600]   It's sort of a weird thing to reconcile that they're both giant internet companies, but
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.840]   they have very different beliefs as well.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:31.280]   I like that we have options depending on our comfort level and feature needs.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:36.680]   So iOS 9, public beta in a couple of months, but don't rush off and get it because...
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:39.960]   Definitely not on any kind of a primary device.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:45.840]   That's for your second Mac or your second iPad that you're going to take away from your
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:49.240]   son because you gave it to him when you bought your new iPad last year, but now you want
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:52.960]   to test iOS 9 and you're going to take it away from it to do that for the beta.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:57.960]   Speaking of good articles on IMOR, I was very grateful, Renee, that you...
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:06.240]   I read the detailed takedown of Zara, which I barely understood on IMOR.
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:10.760]   And then I read your explanation of what the hell it really means to me.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:11.920]   And we had Nick Arnott do a detail.
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:14.280]   Nick did a great job, but it was...
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:18.960]   The problem with Zara is that it was four very different exploits that were lumped together
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:23.440]   and sort of presented in a way that people should panic about passwords and the safety
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.440]   of data.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:25.440]   Summarize.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:28.360]   By the way, I see you're playing Arkham City there on your Mac.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:32.560]   Arkham Asylum seemed like a good reference for the insanity that we were having.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:38.040]   I got Arkham Knight early because it was midnight Eastern last night and I was up very late.
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:42.960]   I'm kind of tired playing the Batman on my Xbox One.
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:47.960]   It's fun, except it keeps raining and that's so it looks like they keep it raining the
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:52.200]   whole time so that everything's shiny, so it looks cool, which is weird.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.240]   So why do we need to know about Zara?
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:59.040]   So Zara, the first thing to know is that it's four very different exploits and most of them
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.680]   don't apply to iOS.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:03.200]   A lot of stuff got conflated together in the reporting.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:05.240]   So some OS X and some iOS?
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:07.160]   Yeah, it's predominantly OS X.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:11.760]   So one of them, for example, was Web Sockets and there's a vulnerability in HTML5 that
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:14.840]   when you communicate over a Web Socket, it may not be secure.
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:18.560]   So the best practice is not to send sensitive or secure data that way.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:23.040]   However, because of things like sandboxing on OS X, developers have a need to be able
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:28.480]   to send something from an app to maybe a companion app so it can go to a Web site plugin.
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:32.080]   So they would use Web Sockets and because of this vulnerability, that data could then
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.080]   be sniffed.
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:36.640]   No one could go in and sort of look for your passwords, but they could pretend to be the
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:40.960]   communications channel, sort of do a man in the middle attack and collect your passwords
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:47.040]   as they were going through, which is similar to what happened with URL strings, URL schemes
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:49.760]   on iOS because of the way that it works.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:52.080]   There's no sort of policing over who can register it.
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:55.680]   So someone could pretend to be Facebook or pretend to be another app, get in on the
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:58:00.360]   URL string and then as you're sending sensitive information over unsecure channels, listen
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:01.720]   to that as well.
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:05.400]   And maybe the best practice would be not to send that stuff, but again, up until very
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:09.280]   recently with the deep links and backlinks, there was no real good way to send people
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:11.480]   around much less transmit data.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:16.160]   The only really concerning vulnerability here was in sandboxing where you could create
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:20.800]   something that would sort of pretend to be a child process of a sandboxed app and get
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:24.000]   included into the directory where that where it could safely look at the data.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.640]   And that's how they were able to scoop out contents of some libraries.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:30.880]   And that's something that Apple has to fix as soon as possible.
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:35.640]   The sort of other aspect of this was that they managed to get a couple test apps into
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:38.840]   the app store to sort of prove these vulnerabilities.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:42.160]   And some people panicked about that because the app store is supposed to be secure.
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:44.400]   But the app store can only ever detect things that have happened.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.520]   It's very hard to predict what people are going to do.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:51.000]   So Apple looked at what they did and now they've got screening processes in place to stop apps
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   from doing this.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.640]   And they've got to be able to do it in a way that apps sort of try to change code or off
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.080]   use gate code when they're going in.
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:59:00.280]   So once that's identified, they can put the prerequisite filters or processes in place
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:01.280]   to protect against that.
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.880]   So Apple hasn't fixed these issues.
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:08.840]   Is there something you recommend we do to protect ourselves at this point?
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:13.560]   Well they've mitigated it by making it very hard to get those apps specifically try to
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:14.960]   do this into the app store now.
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:17.800]   So there's much less chance of getting one of those apps.
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.400]   The best practice always, you know, I've listened to Steve Gibson for years to say this
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:23.160]   is don't take stuff from people you don't trust.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:25.840]   So if there's an app that looks too good to be too or looks fishy or you're just used
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:30.280]   to downloading stuff really nearly just remember that it is always a dangerous world out there.
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:34.680]   And if it's someone like, you know, one password or Facebook, absolutely download those apps.
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:38.600]   But if it's some developer you've never heard of and it wants access to something or something
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:42.560]   suddenly pops up that doesn't quite look like Facebook but it's supposed to be, then
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.960]   yeah, pay attention to that.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:50.880]   So Apple did some server side stuff, they've blocked these from the app stores for both
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.320]   iOS and OS 10.
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:57.480]   If you get apps from the app store and either platform you're fine, you're almost certainly
[00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:58.480]   okay.
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.000]   And then be careful about the rest of the stuff.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.080]   Like last pass I can't get from the app store because of the sandboxing the app store requires.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:08.040]   I don't think they've passed I think they passed the Mac app store with iOS.
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:12.420]   It was the URL schemes and basically the way it works right now is any developer can make
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.920]   any URL scheme they want.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.880]   So I don't know how they're going to they might eventually just have to police what
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.880]   URL schemes.
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:22.880]   URL schemes are really a risky thing to do and Apple's relied on those or the developers
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.560]   on iOS have relied on those a lot.
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:26.560]   They're great for links.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:29.000]   If you just want to link to a specific part of an application, they're fantastic.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.120]   If you want to use them to transmit data, then you've got to make you either are things
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:35.560]   you can do like the really smart developers follow a lot of best practices to make sure
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:38.400]   data gets transited as securely as possible.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.080]   But unfortunately, and this was I think the case with some of the Google exploits last
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.520]   week is that when developers on mass don't follow best practices, that data suddenly
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.520]   becomes exposed.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:52.120]   It's a really great blog post on the AgileBits site blog.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:55.480]   But the developers of OnePassword basically walked every walk you all the way through
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:00.360]   what this thread is especially considering that OnePassword was used as one of the examples
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:05.320]   of here's how vulnerable this can make at least Mac software.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:09.040]   It's not only the perspective of what this exploit can do, but also here's why developers
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.000]   write things the way they often write things.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.520]   And then finally saying that if you are concerned about this, go into OnePassword settings.
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:21.600]   One of the limitations of this hack is that if it's going to glom passwords that are being
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:26.960]   communicated between the OnePassword app and the browser, it has to launch that malicious
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.920]   app before OnePassword can launch its helper app to make that happen.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:34.480]   So if you just flip a switch and simply say just load that helper app right away as soon
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:38.880]   as you log in, as soon as you boot, it seems to mitigate the problem.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:42.480]   But it's a good read and it's probably your first point, apart from iMorphWors.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:46.000]   So your first point of access to learn about this, I think.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   And while I think that it's still in its experimental stage, I think biometrics are going to become
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.480]   very, very important as we continue to worry about our security.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.640]   You can only be so secure with typing in codes.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:04.480]   I mean, I think that thinking about how we use our fingerprints, facial recognition,
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:07.880]   those types of things I think are something that's going to become more and more important
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:12.080]   where I'd feel better if I said, OK, well, I can't get in unless I put my thumb on my
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:17.320]   phone or something like that, or some combination of those things.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:21.280]   You know, I was thinking about that the other day as I was reading about this, that it seems
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.760]   I haven't heard really anything from inside or outside Apple about whether or not the
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:30.760]   Apple's really making progress on this idea of putting biometrics into the computer itself,
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:36.160]   like putting a fingerprint reader on it, which when this was released with the first
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:40.200]   iPhone, everyone thought that, oh, well, obviously this is going to come to Macbook sometime
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.200]   soon.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.840]   I don't think that they're dropping the ball by not doing that.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:48.800]   But I kind of thought that as a signature thing that solves so many really cool problems,
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.360]   I'm curious to think about that discussion.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.440]   I'm more interested.
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.560]   I don't even need him to do that.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:58.480]   I'm fine with my phone being paired with my computer and then I just pick up my phone
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:02:59.480]   and do it.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.840]   You know, like, you'll watch as long as you're watching skin content.
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:02.940]   It's nice.
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:03.940]   It's nice.
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:06.740]   I've been going on a lot of Android stuff that I have where they have the operating system
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:09.620]   has trusted devices, but there are times when you really want.
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:14.580]   I don't even care if somebody has pocketed my phone and taken it with it or waited for
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:17.620]   me to go to the bathroom and realizing they got 50 minutes to do something fun with my
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:19.420]   phone.
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:24.780]   There's something very, very human and tactile and correct about this will not happen until
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:29.860]   I take this thumb here and place it right there because I have to explicitly say that
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:33.580]   here is who I'm going to prove who I am and now that's when that's when the money transfer
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:36.460]   happens and that's when the authorization to load this app happens.
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:37.460]   No, I agree.
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:40.220]   But what I'm saying is that it could be my phone paired with my computer and then I put
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:41.780]   my thumb on my phone.
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:44.620]   And then, you know, and the computer just, you know, just, you know, it doesn't have
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:50.740]   to the the the other to read the using doesn't need to be using using the phone as the as
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:52.820]   for sort of the authorization pad.
[01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:54.300]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:58.020]   I've one as I was thinking this through, I was thinking how much of this decision is
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:01.540]   we can't think of a way we can't think of a place to put the fingerprint reader that
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:03.700]   in our minds would not make this device ugly.
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.340]   I think it's all the trusted chain.
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:09.180]   I mean, they didn't they didn't release the touch ID API until it's been a year kind of
[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:10.340]   hard in the chain of trust.
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:12.060]   And I don't know what that train of trust.
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:14.700]   I'm sure someone at Apple does, but I don't know how that train of choice.
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:15.700]   Right.
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:17.620]   Chain of trust would work on on a West.
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:22.540]   It's like it's like they would have to have like another as almost if they'd have to have
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:28.300]   an arm ship inside the Mac itself, because that seems like that would be the simplest
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:32.460]   way to have that trusted zone, because they certainly can't have Intel build them a brand
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:33.460]   new chip with that.
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:36.060]   And I think Intel has one of the way they want to use it.
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:40.820]   I was trying to think as right the second I was trying to think I know that that Intel
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:45.580]   has some hardware like that, but I'm not but that's the sort of thing I have to actually
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:49.220]   start researching before to tie in things that I've read things I've been told with
[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:52.500]   no, is that something you actually remember or something that you just think you understand.
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:56.260]   And then how do you pass and like there's a variety of chips and max is not as uniform
[01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:58.180]   as the iOS platform and how do you pass that along?
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:00.540]   How do you make sure no one spoons the tokens that it's releasing?
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:01.540]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:03.820]   I'm glad I don't have to solve these problems.
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:04.820]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:07.660]   We only get to complain when they don't work correctly.
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:08.660]   Yes.
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:10.500]   That's an easier role, I think.
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.020]   A couple of quickies.
[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:20.580]   Apple pulls the last non retina iOS device, the original iPad mini that's gone.
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:21.580]   The original iPad mini.
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:22.580]   I don't have any other options.
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:23.580]   I don't know what it's going to look like.
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:24.580]   I'm not sure what it's going to look like.
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:25.580]   I'm not sure what it's going to look like.

[01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:04.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:05.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:06.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:07.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:08.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:09.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:10.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:11.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:12.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:13.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:14.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:15.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:16.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:17.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:18.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:19.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:20.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:21.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:22.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:23.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:24.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:25.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:26.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:27.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:28.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:29.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:30.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:31.580]   I'm not sure what it looks like.
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:32.580]   LegalZoom, this is something.
[01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:33.580]   Look at that.

[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:35.580]   Andy Inaco, why don't we start with you today?
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:40.580]   Mine is a kind of a nonspecific pick, but it's kind of an interesting one.
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:44.580]   We're finally getting, we're finally far enough away from the initial launch of the Apple
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:49.580]   Watch that you can now buy cheap ass watch bands in all kinds of different places.
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:50.580]   As a CABs.
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:51.580]   Yeah.
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:52.580]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:56.580]   Well, I actually call it cheap ass because this is it's hoco.
[01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:58.580]   And as you can see, it is a premium product.
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:04.140]   So right there on the box along with things that probably say soy sauce or do not get
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:06.580]   this tattooed on your butt because it probably means something.
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:09.580]   But they're Apple Watch compatible.
[01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:11.580]   They are Apple Watch compatible.
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:19.580]   They are just this is a $25 red leather buckle that click that clicks straight into the same
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:22.580]   thing.
[01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:25.580]   I don't know if this I don't see the MFI logo on this.
[01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:29.580]   They probably just sort of, you know, took some measurements and figured it out.
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:32.580]   We'll be seeing some MFI branded stuff later.
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:37.580]   Things that are using lugs that have actually been purchased from Apple.
[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:41.580]   But I mean, they slide on and off in exactly the same way.
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:48.580]   And I mean, this is a this is like $30 compared to 30 compared to how much money for an actual
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:49.580]   day.
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:52.580]   I'm guessing this is not rose gold, but it's gold toned.
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:54.580]   Anyway, it's I like these a lot.
[01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:59.860]   It certainly does sort of explain Apple's thinking a little or just at this point, justify Apple's
[01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:05.380]   thinking where they want to be the company selling the $500 steel link bracelet that
[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:10.300]   is has the 30 minute video on how they made each individual length.
[01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:14.940]   It link out of one solid block of an obtain and chip data, it's like by flake molecule
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:15.940]   by molecule.
[01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:20.900]   But if you want one for $75 that is not poorly made, it's just not as well made as that.
[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:21.900]   You're good.
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:27.380]   Cavia being that, of course, again, this is again, less than a $30 dollar leather leather
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:28.380]   band.
[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:33.460]   It's roughly the quality of what you would get for free with most watches that might cost
[01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:39.860]   about $150 or less, which is to say that if I were to wear this every single day, I bet
[01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:43.780]   it would start to look kind of baffed up in two months and I bet it would break off in
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:45.300]   about eight or nine months.
[01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:48.900]   But that's okay because again, it costs not a whole lot of money.
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:55.220]   The idea is that I will still have like my my floral last summer rubber plastic bracelet
[01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:58.820]   that is my daily wear sort of bracelet.
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:02.620]   But then on those days, those two or three or four days a month where I need to dress
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:06.020]   it up a little bit or maybe if I just want to color coordinate it with the rest of my
[01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:10.060]   outfit, I can just simply just, you know, just that easily just simply slide this off
[01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:13.660]   and in 10 seconds switch to a different, a different band.
[01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:17.900]   So I think these are all like really, really good things and definitely worth looking into.
[01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:21.340]   I am going to order one for my trip.
[01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:22.340]   Pretty good.
[01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:27.100]   The meddling bracelets, they're there are some that are not well made, but they're
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:32.260]   most most of them, if you spend more than $18 for them, they're not badly made.
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:36.540]   They're just not as well made as what is clearly what Apple makes something that could be sold
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:38.060]   as a $500 bracelet.
[01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:39.060]   Right.
[01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:43.480]   It's but it's not that doesn't mean that the one that you spend $75 or $80 for is cheap
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:47.460]   or looks like garbage or it falls apart or it rusts.
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:51.660]   It's just not a $500 bracelet.
[01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:56.540]   One thing to keep in mind is that if you do buy something stainless steel, realize that
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:22:00.940]   Apple is making damn sure that the stainless steel bracelets they sell are the exact same
[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:04.380]   color stainless steel as the actual watch itself.
[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:09.660]   So you might have a slight color or a difference between the body of your steel watch.
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:10.660]   I have, I'm a cheap skates.
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:14.280]   So I have the aluminum so that's not as big of a problem, but definitely something to
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.280]   think of.
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:19.240]   But again, for these little $20, $30 bands, you can have three or four and just pop them
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.240]   in.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:21.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:22.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:23.240]   Renee Richie, got a pick for us?
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:26.640]   Yeah, I'll just add to Andy's one quickly that all that stuff is really good.
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:30.480]   I would also just make sure that you get something where the metal is well coated because not
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:31.800]   all methods react well to each other.
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:34.680]   So if you're sticking stainless steel inside aluminum, just make sure it's well coated
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:35.680]   stainless steel.
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:36.680]   What would happen?
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:37.680]   Would you have a shock?
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:39.840]   You get reaction that kind of degrades the quality of the metal.
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:40.840]   Oh, that's not good.
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:43.820]   Yeah, you can get you actually get an electrical sort of communication between the two and it
[01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:45.380]   can discolor one or the other.
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:46.380]   So yeah.
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:48.860]   So most good, most good ones won't have a problem, but if you're getting the three
[01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:51.220]   cent one off the bargain, then you.
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:52.220]   Wow.
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:53.220]   That's good to know.
[01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:54.220]   What do you got for us Renee?
[01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:55.220]   I have a couple of ones.
[01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:58.580]   A one, the first one I'm stealing from Srinarty Caldwell, and I don't have my watch on me because
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:00.500]   it's upgrading, but it's called zone play.
[01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:04.060]   I have this love hate relationship with Sonos where I have their speakers everywhere, but
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:05.940]   they don't really support all the stuff that I use.
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:09.500]   Like they don't support airplay and there's no watch app yet.
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:13.040]   But an enterprising developer went and made an app called zone play.
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:16.560]   And because it's not a first party app, it can't do everything that the Sonos app does,
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:21.020]   but it does go on your watch and it does let you sort of skip backwards tracks, go forwards
[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:22.020]   in tracks.
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:25.960]   You can't rearrange anything, but once your stuff is set up on Sonos the way you want
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.920]   it, it just gives you quick access to like the volume and the skip order that you really
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:31.680]   want on your watch.
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:35.560]   So if you have Sonos and you've been dying for watch control, and again, I totally stole
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:36.600]   this from Srinarty Caldwell.
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:37.600]   So thank you, Ren.
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:40.160]   This is a great app to do it with.
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.440]   The other thing that I have is the typo keyboard for iPad.
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:47.840]   You might remember typo from the Blackberry lawsuits because you know, Blackberry was
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:51.880]   not happy about the keyboard they made for their iPhone, but they've got a really nice
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:53.440]   one for the iPad.
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:54.680]   It's super slim.
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:59.280]   It has a very, not exactly the way that the surface does it, but it has a kickstand at
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.280]   the back.
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:01.400]   So it's got a very good hinge.
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:05.680]   I think they say it's the same hinge that Apple uses so that you can adjust the height
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:09.760]   to whether you're typing or whether you're cooking or doing anything like that.
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:13.440]   And you can open it up and use it just like a laptop.
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:17.400]   So you have a full keyboard on the front and it's got nicely sized keys.
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.560]   They're not full size, but they're good for a net book.
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.720]   They have better travel than the new MacBook.
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:25.280]   So if you're a fan of longer travel, they're very clicky.
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.360]   They work very well.
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:31.440]   It pops right off if you just want to use your iPad like a tablet the way Apple intended.
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:34.320]   And it's got especially coming with iOS 9 Bluetooth keyboards.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:35.920]   They're going to get a big upgrade.
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:39.200]   So you're actually going to be able to see the shortcuts and you'll be able to do a command
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.800]   tab to change apps.
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:44.920]   So in preparation for that, if you're looking for a new keyboard, the typo is definitely
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:46.560]   worth a look.
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:47.880]   Nice.
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:49.880]   Is that the same?
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:52.640]   Is that the same company that did the typo keyboard?
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:53.640]   Yes.
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:54.640]   For the phone.
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:56.280]   Ryan, the Ryan Seacrest company.
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:57.280]   Yeah.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:00.080]   They got sued, of course, by BlackBerry and lost.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:01.080]   Yes.
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:02.280]   But they found other businesses.
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:04.080]   They should have made it like the palm keyboard.
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.080]   They wouldn't have had a problem.
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:06.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:08.560]   It's kind of a weird thing to sue and win for, but they did.
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.360]   That's a cool thing to do with keyboards too.
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:12.720]   I mean, BlackBerry is famously litigious for their keyboards.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:13.720]   Yeah.
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:20.040]   I'll tell you, if I get a iPad Pro comes out next fall, that would be a useful thing to
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:21.040]   have for it.
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.160]   That would turn it into a Surface Pro basically.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:27.480]   And a lot of people, I mean, right now there's a lot of discussion about using the iPad as
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:30.640]   a primary computer because of all the features coming in iOS 9.
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:34.680]   Like slide over and split view and picture in picture.
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:36.320]   And it's going to be more compelling for more people.
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:40.160]   And I think a keyboard really rounds that out for a lot of people.
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:43.800]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, what do you got for us?
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:48.120]   So my first pick is just to kind of look into the past of something that I picked or I think
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.120]   one of us picked.
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:51.120]   And we said, oh, it's really cool.
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.520]   And then just to reaffirm it, which is slack.
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:58.560]   So if you're a company that's using slack, so I said, oh, this is really cool.
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:59.560]   I think Renee.
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:02.880]   Were you the one that recommended it when it came out?
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:04.120]   Yeah, probably.
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:05.120]   Probably.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:07.520]   It has taken over my company.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:10.240]   I just just, you know, like no one wants to email anymore.
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:12.560]   Like people are like, oh, why are you emailing me?
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.560]   That's all we use now.
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:17.080]   That's why it's just like it is become like, I mean, just in case you're wondering how
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:19.880]   deep that goes, it's pretty intense.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:24.680]   So anyway, slack, if you're wondering if we still like it after we reviewed it.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.680]   Yes.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:26.680]   Yes.
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:27.680]   And I didn't use it until the very end.
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:31.000]   And I actually really started using it, still using text and everything else.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.160]   And everyone else was gone.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:35.920]   It was like this ghost town talking to me.
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:37.560]   And so I was like, OK, I'll try.
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:38.560]   But it's so confusing.
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:39.560]   I got all this stuff.
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:40.560]   And then suddenly I'm now gone.
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:42.640]   So anyway, it's really cool.
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:46.320]   No, but my recommendation today is one that I think will save a lot of people a lot of
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:47.320]   money.
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:48.320]   And I know it has for me.
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.040]   And that is the Staples app.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.560]   Now, you know, oh, man, man, that was easy.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:53.560]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.560]   The Staples app.
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:57.560]   So here is why.
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:58.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.160]   The Staples app is free.
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:04.080]   But more importantly, it has a feature in it that is very important if you ever have
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.040]   if you have a Staples nearby.
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:07.160]   So let me show you.
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:11.680]   So you see, if we look at this here, you see, you've got all these little, these little
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:12.680]   things here.
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:15.920]   And the thing that you're going to notice is you'll be really surprised to see that
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:18.720]   this is 1599.
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:23.960]   Now that may now that may be something that is a little bit kind of abrupt because you're
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:29.960]   used to seeing this be $82 in Staples show off.
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:30.960]   Okay.
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:33.960]   That's what's the weather going to be closer to the coast?
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:34.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:37.200]   Well, no, I don't have the green screen yet.
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:38.200]   That's coming.
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:39.200]   It's where you're going to be right back.
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.200]   Actually, they're a flea flicker.
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:41.960]   Or are they doing the nickel offense there?
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:43.800]   I love how casually you do that.
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:44.800]   Humble tech.
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:45.800]   Humble tech.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:46.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:47.800]   So yeah, yeah.
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:49.800]   So the thing is, is that what you're going to see here is you're going to have these
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:50.800]   records in the house.
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:51.800]   And this guy, that looks good.
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.800]   That's the best look at Telestrator I've ever.
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:55.680]   Ever seen forget the Staples thing.
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:57.040]   Took a lot of work.
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.040]   That is beautiful.
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.920]   Well, you know what's nice is you have like strokes.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:01.720]   It's like you've got a little texture.
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:05.360]   It's like Alex has opened up a vein and he's bleeding all over his screen.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:08.760]   It took a lot of work to tell about it.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:15.160]   Anyway, so anyway, what's important is that when you're shopping at Staples, what's important
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:16.320]   is for you to have that app.
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:20.480]   And then what you do with that with that app is that you load everything until you hit
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.760]   this magic button right here.
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:22.760]   See this little magic button?
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:24.160]   That one, okay, right there.
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:29.360]   This one right here, this one you add, you add the card.
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:33.920]   And so the big thing is, is that when you do that, then you walk up to the Staples cash
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:36.480]   year and say, I'd like to match your website.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.840]   And they have to.
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:43.160]   And so the thing is, is if you, it actually, I think is really great for Staples because
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:45.000]   it makes me actually want to go there.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000]   It's been in the past.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.560]   I've been like, oh, I'll never buy a cable or I'll never buy anything major because they're
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:52.320]   going to just drive me into the ground.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:55.880]   And now that I know that I can go to Staples and get it for the same price that I'd buy
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:29:00.120]   it on Amazon, it definitely makes it something that I actually go a lot more.
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:03.320]   Of course they're making a lower margin by five times.
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:07.760]   But, but I, you know, I save probably $50 or $60 every time I go to Staples.
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:08.920]   They're just Staples right down the street.
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:09.920]   That's why I say that.
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:12.520]   And I'm like constantly like, oh, I need another ethernet cable.
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:15.720]   So, and I need it today because, you know, that's the way I am.
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:16.720]   So anyway, that's Staples.
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:19.840]   That's a little, little thing that hopefully sells people.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:25.640]   And I'm installing that and I'm installing Zone Play and I just bought a watch band.
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:26.640]   This is going to-
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:32.080]   And only recommend, and only tell the company Slack if you want to be the last one and left
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:33.080]   out.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:34.080]   Actually, we like Slack.
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:36.720]   We use a HipChat internally, which is similar to Slack.
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:37.720]   But Slack's prettier.
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:41.680]   The only thing about Slack that was hilarious to me was at WWDC, there was this big meeting
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:44.600]   of all these groups that use Slack and everyone was praising it.
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:48.640]   But the consensus was the minute someone gets upset, you have to stop using Slack because
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:53.040]   the lack of emotion will escalate to arguments that are unnecessary all the time.
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:55.800]   So the new rule is that if you start getting upset with somebody, you have to switch to
[01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:59.000]   Skype or voice or hang out so that the humanity returns.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.200]   Yeah, no, I think that's true.
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:01.800]   Typing can really get you in trouble.
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:02.800]   Yes.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:03.800]   Yes.
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:06.400]   And I will vouch for that with my spouse.
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:10.040]   We can get a lot of trouble just by only texting each other or typing at each other.
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:15.080]   It's really a good idea to talk from time to time so you can see the face and all of
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:16.080]   that.
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:19.080]   Can I do a very self-serving pick?
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.080]   Always.
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:22.080]   The brand new Twitter website is here.
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:27.720]   We put it up about a week ago, but I just wanted to remind everybody to take a look.
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:32.000]   We've ironed out some of the bugs and we also are aware of some people and things they
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000]   don't like.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:38.040]   For instance, this display of the latest to help in how to's and news reviews only really
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:40.600]   shows a handful of shows at a time.
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:42.400]   We have so many more.
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:43.400]   We're going to work on that.
[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:48.960]   We're going to make this latest word be a link to a secret page that I'm going to tell
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:53.880]   you about right now, which is twit.tv/episodes.
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:56.120]   We created this filter but never gave you access to it.
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:31:01.480]   This is all the episodes chronologically going left to right and down the page.
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:06.200]   One of the reasons we made the front page so simple is because we're really working on
[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.440]   making it mobile first.
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:15.240]   So if you put too many of these tiles on the front page on a small device, it really is
[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:16.240]   kind of unwieldy.
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:20.960]   The other thing people wanted is more information in this little text here, Tech News today,
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:21.960]   1286.
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:26.560]   Again, the reason that's so simple is because we didn't want to just got the show name
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:27.560]   and number.
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:29.400]   We didn't want to overburden a mobile device.
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:33.360]   But if you hover your mouse over it, the tool tip does in fact have the full name of
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:34.360]   the show.
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:39.640]   So it is very easy to find out what the show is all about just by hovering your mouse over
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:42.160]   it and so to answer some people who wanted that.
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:45.160]   The other thing that has happened, we fixed the download button.
[01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:49.440]   People were complaining about the fact that it was a little difficult to download.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:55.440]   Now when you click download options, these are HTML links to the varieties of shows.
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:00.960]   There is a bug for Firefox and we're not really sure why this is in Chrome, Safari, Internet
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:02.160]   Explorer, Works Fine.
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:06.240]   In fact in Chrome, if you click the link, it will start to download and that's just exactly
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.600]   what you want.
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:13.320]   Safari, you might have to right click and say Save As.
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:17.920]   And in Firefox, unfortunately, you have to start the playing.
[01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:21.200]   And we're going to fix this as soon as we figure out why it's happening.
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:25.080]   Start the media playing and then right click on the playing media and say Save As and that
[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:26.840]   will give you the full thing.
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:29.680]   So if you haven't used our new website, take a look.
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:32.720]   I put a post on it and we've put it in the front page here.
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:33.960]   Welcome to the new website.
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:39.560]   Learn more that explains why the site is the way it is and how you can report bugs if
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.480]   you find them and so forth.
[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:42.480]   We think it's a lot better.
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:46.720]   It's certainly a lot more responsive than the old site, both in terms of popping up
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:53.000]   more quickly and in terms of being mobile responsive to the page that you're on.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.280]   There's live here.
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:56.400]   We are keeping live.twit.tv alive.
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:57.680]   I know some people are having trouble.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:03.720]   Somebody reported they work in the military and for some reason our new live page is blocked.
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:10.160]   So we're going to keep the old page running until we figure out what's going on and maybe
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:11.440]   forever.
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:13.040]   This is actually not on the site.
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:18.560]   This is this old live.twit.tv is just a standalone kind of one off site.
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:21.000]   So there's no reason why we can't keep that there.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.720]   But the top of the page should give you the information.
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:28.480]   We need live shows if you want to find a show in particular.
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:30.200]   Links to all the apps.
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:34.240]   We are going to be working on our own apps at some point.
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:38.640]   If you go to more you can learn more about our API and developer program.
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:41.480]   This site really is not just a site.
[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:43.800]   But most of it is like an iceberg.
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:46.440]   Nine tenths of it are invisible to you.
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.720]   The site itself is written in Node.js.
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:51.200]   It depends on Heroku as a Node app.
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:55.920]   But the Node app is actually getting all of its data from a Drupal backend.
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:59.160]   They call it Headless Drupal backend that provides an API.
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:01.400]   We're using the API but so can you.
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:06.920]   So if you want to make your own site you can just go and learn about our developer program
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:07.920]   and API.
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:10.760]   You can send us an email to api@twit.tv.
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:13.480]   We're starting to generate keys and we'll send keys out.
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:16.800]   We've got more than 50 people who have requested access to the API.
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:20.040]   It's a RESTful API using JSON.
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:24.240]   So if you're familiar with modern web technologies it should be very easy for you to do.
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:30.360]   Anything from write a one-liner that downloads every episode of security now ever to recreating
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:33.840]   this web page in black if that's what you want.
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:35.760]   You can do it any way you want.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:40.600]   Everything on the web page comes from the public API which is pretty sweet.
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:41.760]   So there you go.
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:42.760]   That's it.
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:43.760]   And we have a much better search by the way.
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:47.800]   We're using Apache Solar Search which is a really good search so you should be able to
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:49.720]   find anything you want very quickly.
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:53.360]   All you have to do and you've noticed it probably, Twit.tv thanks to the developers
[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:55.280]   of Fort Kitchen's who put that together.
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:56.960]   And Jason we've got to figure out a time to do a special.
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:02.840]   I guess when I come back we can do a special with the devs and our team and explain kind
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:04.000]   of the behind the scenes stuff.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.800]   I know a father Robert wants to do a coding 101 on the API and so forth.
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:14.800]   So we're looking forward to making this something that you can use more easily.
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:17.560]   And wait until you see it on your iPhone even.
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:18.840]   It works great.
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:20.320]   Hey, thanks everybody.
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:22.760]   Thank you to ReneeRitchie.com.
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:26.120]   Live nations at ReneeRitchie on the Twitter.
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:28.240]   Always a great, great thing to have you here.
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:29.400]   Thank you for being here.
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:30.400]   Thank you.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:31.400]   We appreciate it.
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:34.800]   Alex Lindsey as he travels about from time to time stops by.
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:36.160]   We're so glad that you're here.
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:37.160]   It was great to be here.
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:40.400]   Even if I made a fool myself over Spotify.
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:41.400]   Did you?
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:42.800]   I don't think you did.
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:43.800]   I missed that part.
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:44.800]   So here's the thing.
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:48.080]   I think that what happened is it used to be that it would still share and Spotify.
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:49.280]   And I just got into the habit of it.
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:51.240]   So the whole thing with Spotify is to you.
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:52.920]   They fixed it and you ignored them.
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.960]   And then I ignored them and complained about it online.
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:58.200]   You got a faster reaction to the Swift.
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:00.120]   You didn't make yourself look foolish.
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:04.280]   You would be making yourself look foolish if you were to give yourself a bright red
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:08.440]   grocho mustache and I and and and and and eyebrows.
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:10.080]   Oh, that he wouldn't.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:11.400]   How would you do such a thing?
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:13.120]   You couldn't do that.
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:14.120]   That's not possible.
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:16.680]   I would go like this and I'd go.
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:17.680]   Zoom in.
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:18.680]   Oh my God.
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:19.680]   What is he doing?
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:20.680]   He's desirable.
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:21.680]   I know.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:24.920]   I can't cut away from this.
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:27.120]   This is too good.
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.120]   Sorry.
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:30.120]   That was fun.
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:32.840]   That was a little shepherd fairy moment there.
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:34.000]   That was amazing.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000]   Very talented.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000]   You think you know video then.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000]   He's a street artist.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000]   He's a street artist.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.680]   Nothing like a good feedback loop.
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:44.360]   And that's what that was.
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:45.360]   That was cool.
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:46.360]   Yeah.
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:47.360]   I like that.
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:48.360]   See, I can do it.
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:49.360]   See, I can do it.
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:54.320]   See, see, see with Leo, though, I can, you know, I, of course now, you know, we can,
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:59.960]   you know, we can, you know, I don't know how I show Leo and then show what you're doing.
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:00.960]   That's the problem.
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:01.960]   Oh, right.
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:02.960]   You can't see that.
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:03.960]   There you go.
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:04.960]   It's crazy.
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:05.960]   That's good.
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:06.960]   It's getting weird.
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:07.960]   See, that loop.
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:08.960]   It's getting weirder.
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:09.960]   Yeah.
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:10.960]   It's getting weird.
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:11.960]   I really like this.
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:13.960]   This is a really great attack.
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:14.960]   It's a whole baby.
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:15.960]   We're machine image learning loop.
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:18.200]   I think I'm over left.
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:24.560]   That is the Gortons of Gloucester, Fisherman, AKA Andy Enoco in bright yellow today so you
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:26.480]   could not mistake him.
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:28.120]   I'm not the Gortons Fisherman.
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:32.800]   I am that guy at the airport who signs you went to your Hertz card shows you that your
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:33.800]   one sir.
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:37.320]   Here's the keys which you haven't washed before I get back.
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:38.320]   Thank you Andy.
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:42.760]   Gort puked in the back but we think we scraped most of it out or we could put you in a mid
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:46.660]   size.
[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:49.320]   Never rent to rock people.
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:51.760]   Oh, Taylor.
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:55.760]   Tay-Tent.
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:58.760]   That's it for this edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:01.680]   If you can be here live, that's always fun.
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:07.440]   We start around about 11 a.m. Pacific to be a Eastern time 1800 UTC on Tuesdays.
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:12.120]   If you can't, go on to random versions available at the site, twitter.tv/mvw wherever you get
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:13.280]   your podcasts.
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:15.920]   We also love it if you come in studio and we have a great studio audience today.
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:17.280]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:20.840]   Just email tickets@ twitter.tv and we'll try to put a comfy chair out for you.
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:24.760]   But we only have about five of those so the rest of you get that chair, the black one.
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:27.800]   So it's aren't nice.
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:28.800]   I guess that's it.
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:29.800]   Break time is over.
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:30.800]   Back to work.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:32.280]   I did I do that wrong?
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:35.920]   After 10 years you think I get it right.
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:36.920]   Break time.
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:40.160]   Get back to work because break time is over.
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:41.040]   What he said.
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:44.380]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:47.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:50.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:52.380]   you
