[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.720]   Unfortunately, we have a great panel.
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.920]   Andy Inako joins us.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.640]   Renee Richie's got the day up, but don't worry.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.320]   Jim Dow, Rimble, and Aaron Hillagast are here
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.440]   from Big Nerd Ranch.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.000]   We'll talk about the latest Apple news,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.840]   what's happening with the car,
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.920]   what's happening with the MacBook Pro.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.200]   It's all ahead.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.400]   Apple's in the news.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.080]   Mac Break Weekly's got it next.

[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.320]   This is Detroit.

[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.120]   and talk about the latest news from Apple Renee Richie.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.560]   A sudden scratch today due to a groin injury.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.960]   So no, I thought I shouldn't say that.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.760]   That's probably not what he would like me to say.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.760]   That's Jim Dallrimple howling away.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.360]   Hey, Jim, great to see you.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.360]   How are you doing, Jim?
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.840]   From the loop loop insight.com.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.760]   Great to see the beard and a haircut.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.240]   Look at that.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.680]   Looking sharp.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.800]   That's a good looking haircut.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.120]   I like it.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.160]   I like it.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.760]   If you didn't have the beard, I'd think you were in the military.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.280]   Actually, I could do that.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.040]   I'd want to be in special forces, though.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.520]   But I could have a training.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.120]   You look like a special forces kind of guy.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.200]   Also, is it the cowboy, Aaron Hilligas from bignerdrench.com.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.640]   Great to see you, Aaron.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.640]   Great to see you, Leo.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.760]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.160]   And last time you were on, you didn't have the hat.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.840]   So I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.040]   Yeah, bad branding.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.680]   I got a slap on the wrist from the marking people.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.480]   So I have the hat now permanently actually a compliment.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.920]   You can't go anywhere without the hat.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.040]   No.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.560]   It seemed like a good idea 20 years ago when you started the company.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.720]   I would have picked something smaller
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.080]   by we're doing it again, some sort of a beret or a yamaka.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.080]   Fez, I picked Fez.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.840]   Fez, Fez.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.760]   Something fabulous.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.600]   Something easy to travel with.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.280]   It rolls up everything.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.320]   Also with us, Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.200]   Hello.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.720]   Great to see you again.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.760]   Always good to see you guys.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.480]   Always good to see special guests.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.440]   Always good to see Jim.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.280]   Always good to see you.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.120]   Unbranded cap.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.800]   Unbranded cap today.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.840]   And that's because Andy is testing an unbranded phone
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.360]   if he can't tell anybody about.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.680]   No, well, this is the-- it's mostly because I should actually
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.560]   write up what the ladder of respectability is as you get older,
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.200]   how you have to adjust your wardrobe.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.720]   Now, I believe that I've transitioned into the age
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.680]   where I can still wear a baseball cap,
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.360]   but it has to be like unlogoed or a really expensive designer
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.800]   logo.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.120]   If it really is just my late night with the David Letterman
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.120]   cap from 1987, I look like I've been shopping out
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.880]   of the other side of people's sofas.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.080]   Did you see the article about Letterman he has to?
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.240]   That's great.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.600]   Nice.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.800]   You look like the next iteration of the doctor.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.760]   That is good.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.160]   That is-- I like that.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.440]   And I have-- this is actually the--
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.240]   what do they call this?
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.360]   I can't remember the name of it.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.840]   You were the first to test it.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.240]   And they even made it a namal pin to hold the--
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.200]   To Chippo, I think.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.440]   Chippo, something like that.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.760]   They call it something French.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.280]   Yes.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.160]   Look at that.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.480]   I actually like this look.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.520]   I'm going to stick with it.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.920]   With a tie in the jacket, you look
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.000]   like from a distance before people can identify the logo,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.920]   you might be a visiting dignitary.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.680]   Like if a cop saw you parking illegally,
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.280]   they wouldn't rush to ticket you.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.200]   They would wonder, was that some sort of diplomatic logo?
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.840]   Will I get in trouble for ticketing this guy?
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.000]   Is he from Chad?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.560]   Where is he from?
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.000]   It looks like-- so now we've got the cap, the chappo, the beard,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   and the hat on the show today.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.160]   It's like a morning zoo for you.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.320]   Tim Cook, Vice President Cook.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.520]   I think there was a confusion.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.080]   And Hillary Clinton picked Tim Can,
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.400]   but apparently Tim Cook was on the list of-- what is it?
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.040]   40?
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.120]   Vice Presidential candidates?
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.680]   I hope Sia wasn't on that list.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.280]   I don't think-- yeah.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.360]   I think that explains why he would not have accepted.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.960]   Do you want to spend all your day hanging out
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.840]   with incredibly gifted creative types like Sia,
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.440]   or do you want to spend the day hanging out with politicians?
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.600]   Ooh.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.160]   You know, I once served on a committee
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.320]   for the city of Petaluma, the tech committee, briefly.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.240]   And it was so-- and this is--
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.960]   I'm glad government should not move fast.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.120]   I think we've realized there's a benefit to government
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.280]   being highly deliberative, maybe even gridlocked,
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.640]   because of fast moving government's scary.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.240]   But this was-- I couldn't take it.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.880]   I mean, I really understand why.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.440]   You know, it's a certain type of person
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.560]   that you have to be pretty dedicated to public service
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.280]   to sit in those long meetings.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.360]   And then you have to listen to people who
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.760]   don't know what they're talking about.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.200]   Oh, I much rather do this.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.880]   I like talking to people who know what they're talking about.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.200]   I'm going to get my leave.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.840]   No, no, no, Jim, stay.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.840]   You're the one.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.400]   You're the one I'm talking about.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.760]   I guess this list is just-- this is probably a PR stunt
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.640]   more than anything else.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.720]   There's a Bill and Melinda Gates around it.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.720]   I don't think a couple can serve as vice president.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.720]   And how embarrassing if they picked one and not the other?
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.640]   So both were on the list.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.280]   That was one of those things probably intended
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.840]   to be leaked that everybody's happy.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.760]   Oh, yeah, I was considered.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:44.360]   Cook is big into AR these days in an interview published
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.080]   on Thursday.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.320]   And in fact, this has lent some credence
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.520]   to the idea that maybe the iPhone 8 is particularly
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.320]   all about AR.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.920]   And he talked to BuzzFeed News and said,
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.960]   the company is bullish on AR.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.160]   There's no substitute for human contact, Cook said.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.080]   And so you want the technology to encourage that.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.000]   Is it too soon to think-- start talking about the iPhone 8
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.960]   and too soon to think about whether that might
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.440]   have an AR component?
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.240]   I think AR is going to be huge.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.880]   So at Big Nerd Ranch, we've already
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.360]   done a couple of proofs of concepts for a museum.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.960]   And the effect has been great.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.080]   It can really augment learning.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.880]   And we're all about the learning.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.560]   And I think it's very exciting that with AR,
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.000]   you take your phone out into the world
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.760]   instead of with VR, where you lock yourself in a dark closet
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.880]   and play with your vibe.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.440]   It's neat to go out and see the kids with the Pokemon Go
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.800]   running around the neighborhood.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.000]   I think it is a life-affirming technology.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.240]   But it depends on what conversion of AR
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.160]   you want to support.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.720]   Pokemon Go is definitely what the technology can handle right
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.600]   now.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.240]   What we imagine is having an augmented reality where I don't
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:12.400]   have to walk around like this in any way, shape or form.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.920]   Because if you think it's distracting having
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.640]   a Google Glass on you, imagine having
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.040]   to look at someone who is kind of doing this all the time
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.680]   as they're walking around.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.320]   I really think that AR and VR, it really
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.800]   is almost on the same sort of transient line as self-driving
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.720]   cars, autonomous vehicles, where you can get a really good demo
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.240]   together.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.160]   You can get a lot of really obvious ways in which
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.320]   would be cool, but then actually translating it
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.960]   to something you can actually make and sell
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.720]   and that people actually want to use.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.920]   That's the 5% of the problem that's
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.480]   going to take you 300% of your resources to solve.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.400]   Do you think some of this comes to the fact
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.720]   that they've built now a phone that has basically
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.120]   super computing capabilities?
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:00.400]   And yet, it's just mostly playing Pokemon Go or sending
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.080]   messages.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.080]   I think that--
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.400]   We did a lot of crazy things when technology first came.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.880]   I mean, having Mac paint or things like that
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.560]   where you draw little things and you look what that's
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.280]   turned into.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.080]   Is the AR Apple's 21st century fat bits?
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.200]   Well, I think like Aaron said, when
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.960]   you look at AR and the things that are possible--
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.080]   maybe not right now, but look ahead
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.320]   and see what could be possible.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.680]   That's going to be a pretty exciting thing.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.280]   And it's in the real world.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.600]   I mean, virtual reality, you lock yourself
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.120]   in a virtual world and you're basically by yourself.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:56.000]   I think AR is most certainly the future.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.520]   AR is about a whole lot more than gaming.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.440]   I mean, I guess so could VR be.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.440]   But AR really is about user as a new user interface.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.720]   And I think it makes sense for Apple to think about it.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.880]   BuzzFeed lists a bunch of moves over the last few years
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.360]   by Apple.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.440]   In 2013, they bought PrimeSense.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.040]   That was the Israeli company that
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.440]   did the Microsoft Connect.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.120]   In May 2015, it bought a German augmented reality firm,
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.520]   Metayo, a few months later, Face Shift.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.800]   That's the company that did the real-time motion capture
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.800]   and used in Star Wars.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.120]   This year, VR scientist Yuri Petrov
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.480]   was a poached from Oculus.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.640]   Magic Leaps, Zayuli.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.040]   Magic Leaps, the most interesting AR,
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.240]   an independent AR play right now, although Google
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.320]   has a fairly large stake in it.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.560]   Doug Bowman, the director of the Center for Human
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.200]   Computer Interaction at Virginia Tech,
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:58.840]   he was on the Virginia Tech Cube of VR research space.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.040]   And then, of course, there are lots of patents,
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.280]   although I think I've never really trusted patents
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.480]   as a way of seeing where Apple might be going.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.720]   They just patent everything, as does everybody,
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.240]   if they're small.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.040]   But I think you have a really interesting point
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.560]   about the idea that Apple needs to do things
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.000]   that will take advantage of the supercomputer.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.720]   I mean, I have my iPhone 4, right?
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.920]   What is that little thing?
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.720]   This has just been declared obsolete.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.960]   But it had a retina display.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.520]   It had a front-facing camera.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.200]   It had a great little CPU.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.160]   As long as we're not doing supercomputer-type stuff,
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.680]   this is pretty much sufficient for the task.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.920]   And so, Apple, to get back into growth mode,
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.360]   really needs to find ways where it can play to its strengths.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.520]   And AR is a natural thing to pursue.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.400]   - Yeah, I think the question, though, is how long
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.520]   would it take Apple to develop AR to the point where
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.840]   it is one of those big selling points?
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.880]   We all know that Apple will not release something
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.120]   until they can actually do something with it.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.360]   And they've skipped technologies altogether.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.960]   So, I think that's a big question now.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.960]   Where are they?
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.960]   And how long will it be?
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.040]   - In fact, Apple, rarely if ever,
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.600]   is the first to market with a new technology, right?
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.400]   So-- - Rarely ever.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.880]   - And the only really strong AR player right now
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.680]   with a product in the marketplace is Microsoft.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.480]   And it's HoloLens, which is $3,000
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.240]   is the development version.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.520]   - Well, not quite.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:39.520]   Remember that Google has AR translation of any sign
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.120]   that you're looking at any language that you're sitting in front of.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.800]   When people think about AR, they think too much about
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.400]   how we're gonna put Pokemon on the street
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.280]   where you can actually see them.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.120]   Gaming at these really, really amazing
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.200]   reality twisting experiences.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.600]   What people really want is an AR where I'm,
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.760]   how many times when you try to navigate a city,
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.680]   do you, of course, you stopped,
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.880]   hopefully not in the middle of the street,
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.240]   you take out the phone to verify,
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.440]   here's where I am on the map,
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.640]   and here's the direction I'm thinking I'm facing.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.840]   What you really want is to, at that point,
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.320]   hold up your phone and move it around until you see
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.560]   a big arrow pointing not just at a building,
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.800]   but at a street between two buildings
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.760]   and disappearing between two buildings saying,
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.360]   this way, more on, this is where you wanna go.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:31.240]   Similarly, you want an AR app that can take you down,
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.120]   when you're walking, when you're just shopping for food,
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.200]   and you've told it, you've told it,
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.680]   what your meal plan, let's say, is for the next week,
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.000]   or if it's Google, it already kind of knows
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.480]   the sort of stuff you're interested in.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.480]   And once again, instead of lifting up your phone
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.520]   and checking a pricing list,
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.680]   you simply hold it up and it will just simply,
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.800]   as you move it, it's just putting little halos
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.560]   around things that you actually need.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.280]   And also pointing out that while you normally
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.520]   get this kind of bread, but if you look at this bread,
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.160]   which I put it out green, marching arrow,
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.680]   circle around, this one has the same nutritional value,
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.720]   but it's actually 20 cents a little cheaper than this.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.680]   So that's the sort of stuff that will really get people
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.600]   to start using these things and start,
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.200]   stop thinking of it as a way of just putting something weird
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.320]   on your face to see gnomes that aren't there.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.680]   The difficulty though for Apple is that they'll have
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.640]   to put up a big infrastructure in order to make that happen.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.480]   They can't just simply march on the stage,
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.120]   praise about this incredible piece of hardware they put in
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.680]   that makes the augmented reality possible.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.680]   However fast it refreshes the frame rate,
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.360]   they're gonna need a network that can feed the phone,
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.000]   all kinds of information that's gonna feed upon information
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.960]   that the user contributes.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.600]   And finally, I think that AR,
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.440]   it's Apple has to wait for,
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.040]   it has to allow developers to show Apple
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.160]   where the awesome is in augmented reality.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.880]   So they can't do this thing where we're going to,
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.480]   we've added AR features to Apple Maps,
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.000]   we're not gonna open the APIs for a couple of years,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.040]   then when we do, we'll let you do,
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.600]   we have two use cases that we will let you do an AR presence
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.920]   inside the mapping app.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.000]   They need to have a sort of Wild West thing
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   where without compromising the safety or security
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.160]   of the device or the user, be able to say,
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.360]   "Look, we're gonna let you have access to a 3D sense
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.440]   "of awareness of where this phone is,
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.200]   "and we're gonna give you APIs that will let you overlay
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.200]   "into live video and basically feedback
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.600]   "into 3D data that we're giving you
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.000]   "from these two different cameras that we've got
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.080]   "in the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus,
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.000]   "please build something for us,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   "and then if it's really awesome,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.560]   "we will put out our own product
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.400]   "and put you out of business.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.680]   "If it's super awesome, we'll hire you."
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.200]   >> Aaron, what did your developer,
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.720]   what did developers think of this?
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.840]   Did they see this as an opportunity?
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.000]   >> So it's important to remember that a lot of the development
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.360]   that happens is not actually for consumers.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.280]   So what we'll be looking for is opportunities for the enterprise.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.040]   So if you'll remember when you were clawing your way up
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.640]   the org chart at the McDonald's, right,
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.080]   as you started at the cat register
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.840]   and then you're ready to become a fry cook.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.280]   >> And I did claw too, man.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.680]   I had to just knock out the competition.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.840]   >> Well, it'd be nice to be able to give you a set of goggles
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.960]   and say, "Here is the fry guide
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.600]   "to augmentability training in the real world,"
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.160]   without having you go off into a room by yourself,
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.120]   which is sort of how the VR people see it should be,
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.600]   as you should be taken away and locked in a closet.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.040]   >> It's not much better, frankly, in VR.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.000]   I mean, VR certainly as it stands now,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.320]   we have very rudimentary ways of interacting
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.320]   with the VR space, you know, these little controllers and things.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.120]   And it's true a company like McDonald's.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.160]   In fact, I would say, I would imagine any company these days
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.560]   that hires a lot of people, especially younger people
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.800]   who are not trained, has an extensive training program,
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.200]   even then 40 years ago,
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.720]   you'd go down in the break room and watch videos
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:58.000]   with a hamburger and Ronald showing you how to flip a burger.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.320]   And there were lots of training manuals,
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.680]   of course, nicely coded to keep the grease off.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.640]   So there was training as a big issue for these companies.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.160]   Yeah, AR, as opposed to VR, might be a much better,
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.120]   might be a really good fit for it.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.320]   >> I was thinking a little bit about
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.680]   when we used to have a turntable,
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.160]   you'd make a whole thing of listening to your music,
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.480]   like you'd put the record on and you would sit
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.480]   and you would listen to it.
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.520]   And you wouldn't do other stuff.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.720]   And then the Walkman came along and it became music
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.160]   was just something you put in your ears
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.000]   while you were doing other things.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.240]   And I wonder in some sense, that idea of VR
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.640]   is more like the first one, where you're like,
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.200]   okay, now I'm gonna play this game
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.800]   and it's gonna be immersive.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.720]   Or, and then AR is a little more like,
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.760]   well, this is just going to be an addition to my life.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.440]   I don't have to stop everything.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.800]   And I can see attractive features about both.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.640]   I know gamers must be frustrated about casual gaming,
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.840]   the lot of the gaming dollars are going into games
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.960]   that are not as immersive.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.640]   And maybe VR is a return to this,
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.960]   but AR I think more like Walkman.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:03.440]   >> So Aaron, how long do you see AR coming to consumers
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.820]   after it goes to enterprise?
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:11.160]   >> I think consumers are gonna drive a lot of it.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.160]   As we've seen, the gamers are always pushing
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.560]   the technology pretty hard.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.360]   Board thinking organizations will start
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.440]   doing AR, they're already doing it.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.720]   As I said, we have done proof of concepts for museums.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.640]   And they're very excited about this idea
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.680]   being able to annotate the exhibits in new ways.
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.160]   So I think that pretty quickly,
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.720]   I actually think consumers will lead it
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.280]   in a very easy way.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.800]   >> With gaming probably, right.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.360]   >> When the enterprise comes,
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.120]   that's when we'll get really fascinating SDKs,
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.720]   where developers will be able to very easily annotate reality.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.760]   >> I also see, I can see.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.600]   >> What are you using?
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.680]   >> We're looking at years though.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.520]   >> Yeah, years.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.720]   >> Years, yeah.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.320]   >> Well, first of all, we need hardware, right?
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.680]   I mean, even Microsoft's HoloLens is primitive,
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.360]   partly because you have to wear the entire computer
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.720]   on your head, so battery life's an issue, powers an issue.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.720]   And you need heaps of both to really make this functional.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.320]   And nobody wants to wear a tether,
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.920]   although that's how VR works in most cases right now.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.920]   >> Well, would Apple, so this is the question
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.320]   Robert Scobel posted a couple of days ago on Facebook.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.680]   I have heard from a reliable source, the next phone,
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.480]   the iPhone will be a clear piece of glass
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.880]   with a control panel at the bottom.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.000]   And that's for AR purposes.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.600]   You'll be looking through the phone and things.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.000]   I don't know how credible that is,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.600]   but do you anticipate hardware from Apple?
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.800]   And if you do, would it be separate from the iPhone?
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.840]   Would they be looking at something else,
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.720]   a headset or something else?
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.880]   >> I think it'd be more like the watch
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.560]   where it complimented the phone.
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.040]   >> Yeah, sidecar.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:45.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.200]   >> Jim, what do you hear?
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.640]   Have you heard anything about the iPhone 8
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.600]   that's credible at all?
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.080]   >> Nothing that's credible to you.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:53.920]   >> I mean, early, right?
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:58.920]   >> Yeah, I mean, it's amazing that I think the day of
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.680]   or the day after the iPhone 7 was announced,
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.560]   we already had iPhone 8 things coming.
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.880]   >> I know, I know.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.600]   >> A lot of bloggers, you just need constant material.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.320]   (laughing)
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.880]   Although, I mean, obviously, somewhere in a Johnny Ive lab,
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.680]   there are prototypes farther than that, probably.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.440]   I mean, we're only a year off.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.480]   >> Yeah, they're even farther ahead than that.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.920]   >> What is the cycle for a new,
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.280]   like if you did a redesign,
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.240]   how long did ahead of that, did they start three years?
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.600]   >> Sure, I mean, they have prototypes
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.920]   of different things.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:45.400]   And I mean, they have to wait until technology is available
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.080]   to do the things that they want to do.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.680]   And then they start by removing headphone jacks.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.960]   And that could be something that they're looking at
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.000]   for a phone that's two years away.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.720]   We need some space here to do this.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.680]   By that time, batteries will be smaller
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:08.040]   and we can transition and put this new technology
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.840]   in maybe for augmented reality
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.960]   or to be able to connect to a separate device
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.400]   for augmented reality.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.960]   So the plans are always moving forward
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.800]   to what's coming up in a couple of years, Erma.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.240]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.920]   >> Really, you don't necessarily have to even have extra hardware
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.920]   in order to do AR.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.520]   Again, I really do think that the sweet spot
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.720]   is really these sort of experiences right here.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.080]   >> You got a camera, you got a screen, that's all you need.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.920]   >> Exactly, and all you need to do is have a CPU,
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.120]   that's in a GPU, they're fast enough that it can absolutely
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.360]   keep up with the motion of the camera
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.080]   and the motion of your hand and keep updating things.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.640]   'Cause again, it's gonna be, it's even hard to get people
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.800]   to spend $100 for like a Samsung gear VR
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.800]   or even like a $80 the new cloth, Google cloth board.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.760]   Let's say it's a new one.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.600]   >> Well, that's because they're afraid
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.760]   it'll burn their house down.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.160]   (laughing)
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.120]   >> Is it a sensible--
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.000]   >> I think you think of the crumpled.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.760]   >> Are we putting too much pressure on Apple
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.080]   by saying, oh, the 10th anniversary iPhone,
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.400]   this better be really innovative?
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.360]   It's hard to innovate these days, Apple,
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.560]   and everybody else is showing that.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.040]   >> And I think they don't think Apple cares.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.520]   >> You don't think Apple cares, go ahead Jim.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.120]   >> No, I don't think that they care about that.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.720]   >> In other words, we make a lot of noise
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.400]   and they're completely capable of saying,
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.200]   oh, just ignore that.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.800]   >> I think they've done that for years.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.480]   They release things when they're ready.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:40.000]   They don't, you know, bow to pressure,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.080]   wear to open stores, what kind of products to release.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.720]   You know, they just, they release things
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.480]   when they feel that they're ready.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.000]   >> I wonder how Apple does that.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Is there, 'cause ideally you would insulate your engineers
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.840]   and in fact, in general employees
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.680]   from this constant background.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.480]   And Apple, of all the companies,
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.280]   Apple faces the most,
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.600]   'cause people really love Apple
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.440]   and they really all feel like stakeholders.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.600]   Gil Emilia said this, he said,
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.360]   "I thought I was running a company.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.320]   I had no idea I was running a cult."
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.600]   And, but that's good.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.720]   That's one of the things we like about Apple.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.120]   >> I think one of the challenges there
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.400]   is for everyone to think like a stakeholder,
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.960]   but not think like a shareholder.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.280]   So I remember actually when Next was bought by Steve
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.960]   and I was there, Steve got up and made a big presentation
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.400]   about don't watch the stock price,
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.320]   that you shouldn't evaluate how the company's doing based
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.480]   on how what your price to earnings ratio is.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.320]   >> Right.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.760]   Do you think Apple says don't read the blogs,
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.840]   don't read the reviews?
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.520]   >> I think they say don't take it seriously.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.040]   >> That you know more about what's going on
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.320]   in this company than they do.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.000]   >> It's a balance, 'cause you do wanna,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   you wanna know what people think.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.840]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.480]   >> It's any, any entertainer, any performer knows
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.160]   that on the one hand they wanna read reviews
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.440]   to get feedback, but on the other hand,
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.840]   they reviews can devastate you.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.840]   And a number of famous actors never read reviews
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.920]   and then many more do.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:07.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.000]   >> Apple's on the same phone.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.320]   >> I think there's an analog between,
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.040]   you also hear about some actors
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.760]   do not wanna watch the dailies.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.600]   >> Right.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.320]   >> And some are, they're the first people,
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.920]   like when they're dailies to be seen,
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.720]   there are some directors who absolutely think
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.160]   that previews with the audiences
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.880]   that they hand in scorecards are the absolute bane
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.200]   of their existence, whereas others count on them.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.760]   It depends on really, on your personality as a creator.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:37.120]   I don't think either side is necessarily right or wrong.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.840]   Apple has the ability, cushioned by their great success,
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.920]   to simply say that we know what we're doing,
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.600]   we can make exactly the devices that we wanna make,
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.200]   and we're not gonna do anything foolish
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.360]   that's gonna be just something that three of us think
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.520]   is a good idea.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.360]   It's gonna be something that we think has real legs
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.920]   and has a real role to play in the future.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.160]   Other companies like Google, they're perfectly happy to say,
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.760]   we're gonna send out something that is not quite there yet,
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.760]   but it'll shows you what we're thinking
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.760]   and you can give us feedback either deliberately
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.880]   by actually sending us feedback,
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.080]   or by simply first of the fact that we've wired up
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.160]   these apps to tell us what buttons they're hitting first,
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.640]   what features are you using, what features are you not using.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.680]   So that, they're both approaches can get you
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:25.080]   to a really great product at a really, really reliable clip.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.040]   I think that if there's one disadvantage,
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.720]   it's that you can see the movement,
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.480]   you can see the forward movement in a Google product
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.400]   faster than you can see the forward movement
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.320]   in an Apple product.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:43.320]   Apple product is like the weeping angels in Doctor Who
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.880]   where it's only when you close your eyes and you open them
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.960]   and then suddenly they've moved.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.600]   It's not where you see a general, a gracious
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.320]   and little transition where they're adding this,
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.240]   they're really creating this, they're playing with this.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.400]   They tried that, that didn't work,
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.000]   but now that when the good features from that piece of software
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.840]   has now appeared in the next thing.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.480]   So it's just a question of style.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.400]   Every creator has their own style in their own fingerprint
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.840]   and Apple's is to, we're gonna suffer in our freezing garret
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.560]   close the door behind us and you'll have the novel
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.400]   when we have a new novel.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.640]   >> We'll contrast them to Samsung,
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.720]   and we've talked about this before,
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.560]   where Apple really has a voice and a strong voice
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.560]   and Samsung is quite the opposite.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.160]   They say, "Well, we'll just throw every,
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.440]   "we'll give you every size phone,
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.520]   "do we figure out which one you like?"
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.440]   The best, both sides have an argument.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.440]   I was gonna quote the, as it turns out, apocryphal,
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.040]   Henry Ford, quote, "If I'd asked people what they wanted,
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.360]   "they would have said faster horses."
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.400]   There's a great article from a few years ago
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.640]   in the Harvard Business Review in which it said,
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.080]   even though Henry Ford probably never said that,
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:50.080]   he certainly did not listen to what customers wanted,
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.120]   which was an asset early on because he could create
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:58.120]   the assembly line and make basically the same model T
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.520]   for many years and get the benefit of having made
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.160]   that kind of inflexible assembly line.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.360]   He had quite famously said,
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.000]   "The model T comes in any color you want
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.240]   "as long as it's black."
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:12.840]   But here's the interesting statistic from this article,
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.400]   I love this article.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.560]   In 1921, Ford sold about two thirds of all the cars
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:18.800]   built in the US.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:23.680]   But as tastes change, Ford was unable to or unwilling to
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.520]   or culturally unable to listen to what its customers wanted.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.120]   And five years later, that share had gone from two thirds
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:34.120]   to one third and a year after that, 15%.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:39.040]   So it isn't, there's no right answer.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.280]   And in the business case study, business study is,
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.760]   sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.840]   It's worked for Apple.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.480]   Apple has a strong voice and knows what it wants.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.160]   And yet at the same time, well in fact,
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.240]   let's take a break, but when we come back,
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:59.160]   I wanna talk about Walt Mossberg's damning of Siri,
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.760]   why does Siri seem so dumb?
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:04.040]   And Apple's perhaps response by hiring a new director
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.960]   of artificial intelligence.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.600]   And of course, the strong rumors that Apple is no longer
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.280]   to do the thing that was strongly rumored
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.280]   that it was gonna do.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.280]   Or maybe they're not gonna do it as much as they're gonna do
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.360]   of what they thought they were gonna do.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.720]   But nobody ever said they were gonna do,
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.160]   but we thought they were gonna do.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.400]   We'll talk about that in just a moment.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.440]   Hey, it's great to have you guys.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.560]   Andy and Akko is here and we love having him.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.960]   Renee Ritchie called away, I'm speculating,
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.120]   given that we're close to the end of the month,
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.040]   called away for a briefing from somebody,
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.800]   and he was getting on a plane, I believe.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.080]   - Okay, it could be like a watch band.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.080]   - I know, for Renee, he could be flying to Toronto
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.520]   to get the latest Hermes watch band.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.680]   We don't know.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.040]   But we have, it took not one, but two people
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:49.680]   to fill the fabulous shoes of Renee Ritchie.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.520]   One, of course, the great Jim Dowerable
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.800]   from loopinsight.com.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.680]   Always great to have you.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.280]   Stay tuned, later on, Jim, I'm sure we'll recommend
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.960]   some heavy metal listening for you.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.680]   (laughing)
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.720]   He tells us he's, not Sabbath, what were you listening to?
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.560]   - Iron Maiden.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.760]   - Iron Maiden to get in the mood.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.120]   Yep.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.360]   I don't know why I confuse those two.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.600]   Also with this, from Big Nerd Ranch,
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.200]   are you in Atlanta right now, Aaron?
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.200]   - I am in Atlanta.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.040]   - Yep.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.040]   If you wanna learn how to write software,
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.200]   not just for iOS, but for Android.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.520]   - We have the new web book, hold on.
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.720]   - Oh, the web, and big Swift courses.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.520]   - We, let me get this out of this one.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.760]   - Web development, there it is.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:29.760]   Front end web development.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.640]   - On end web development, this is our new book
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.280]   on JavaScript and CSS and some HTML5 tricks.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.880]   - I really love these books, by the way.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.920]   I have a whole bookshelf full of Big Nerd Ranch books,
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.000]   thanks to you. - Oh, it's good to hear.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   - Yeah.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.520]   And maybe when we come back to,
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.800]   we could talk a little bit more about Swift.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.120]   With 3.0 came out and more and more
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.160]   I'm hearing from developers that this is the language
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.840]   they've been looking for, not even just for Apple.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.400]   I'm curious about its cross platform potential,
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.120]   but we'll get to that in a moment.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.120]   Right now we're talking about Squarespace,
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.280]   speaking of front end web development.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.960]   Now you could get Aaron's book
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.560]   and become a JavaScript guru
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.280]   and you could still use Squarespace, by the way,
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.760]   because they have a great developer platform.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.280]   But also you don't have to be,
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.640]   and that's the beauty of it.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.760]   In fact, Squarespace, I love the advantage
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:14.760]   of Squarespace.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.520]   The advantage it gives you is,
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.600]   you get to use state of the art,
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.680]   the latest engineering, the latest design
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.440]   to make your website without being a guru
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.840]   and JavaScript and CSS and HTML and all of that.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.720]   And frankly, this makes a lot of sense.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:39.280]   Why hire for hundreds of thousands of dollars,
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.320]   engineers and designers to do this,
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.200]   when Squarespace already has the best engineers,
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.000]   the best designers doing templates,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.840]   you can start with and customize
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.600]   and get the best of both worlds.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.080]   There are dozens of templates to choose from.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.440]   Every single template features really strong e-commerce.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.720]   You can get grid style landing pages,
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.640]   which are, you know, this is the nice thing,
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.840]   as fashion changes, they do every month on the web.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.240]   Squarespace does new templates
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.200]   and you can change with a click of a mouse to that new look.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.720]   The infinite scroll, that's very big,
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.880]   you see it on the verge and all the Vox websites
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.080]   and Bloomberg just started doing that.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.440]   Related posts at the bottom,
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.640]   encouraging visitors to explore more.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.040]   This is on your side, you could actually do a magazine
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.440]   'cause they got author profile fields
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.320]   and integrated search field at the top.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.920]   Let's read it, get results quickly on any page.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.080]   It will look like it's been designed by a professional
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.160]   but because it has been, but you get plenty, hundreds,
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.040]   literally hundreds of settings if you want.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.000]   You can customize fonts,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.320]   colors, page configurations,
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.720]   they have hundreds of web fonts.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.480]   Regardless of your skill level,
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.720]   every Squarespace site looks unique.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.720]   And if you wanna go a step farther,
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.640]   you can use the developer platform or,
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.520]   and when I found this, this really made me happy.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.080]   There are Squarespace designers,
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.920]   developers and setup experts you can hire.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.920]   They have a whole directory of them.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.320]   That's what Lisa did for Artisanalagency.com,
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.360]   when she said when we started our new ad agency
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.200]   and boy, we got, it was very affordable
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.880]   and kind of, maybe sad about all the,
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.320]   all the amount of money we've spent over the years
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.440]   on web design for our pages.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.000]   Every design mobile responsive.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.720]   So there's no separate mobile site.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.320]   Your site looks good no matter what site screen.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.320]   That's the way to do it nowadays
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.560]   'cause your visitors come from all over.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.080]   And when it's time, as I mentioned,
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.240]   to set up an online storefront,
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.960]   it has never been easier to sell online.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:30.840]   In fact, it's the only website host.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.640]   It's hosting in software that gives you stores
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.720]   that look exactly like the rest of your,
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.240]   it's not like something hanging off your page
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.440]   as part of your site.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.640]   They also sell domain names.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.160]   Now, if you have an idea,
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.240]   you've got a domain name,
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.080]   but you're not really ready to start developing it.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.920]   200 top level domains.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.880]   You know, .com.net.org, all of those,
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.760]   but many, many, many, many, many more.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.360]   You buy them directly from Squarespace domains
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.400]   and you're gonna get a spam free beautiful parking page.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.520]   That's just gonna be there
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.800]   until you're ready to start building.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.960]   Squarespace members who have built or contributed
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.520]   to three or more active Squarespace websites
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.400]   have access to Squarespace Circle.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.040]   That membership includes advanced guides, optimized support
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.800]   and longer trial periods for new projects,
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.480]   which is awesome six months.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.040]   I love Squarespace.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.040]   It's where Leo Villas, my website.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:26.000]   Lisa, as I said, we do business on Squarespace.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:26.840]   Our blog is there.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.680]   It's really great.

[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.680]   That way they know you heard about it on MAC break weekly.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.800]   Squarespace.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.440]   Oh, and you'll, oh, by the way, you'll get 10% off.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:51.440]   Squarespace, a beautiful web awaits at squarespace.com.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:58.160]   Why does Siri seem so dumb with Google really putting
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.960]   the push on with its new Pixel phone
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.880]   and the Google Assistant?
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.320]   A lot of attention, of course, Amazon with its Echo.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.680]   Google's doing an Echo clone called the Hub.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.560]   Even Microsoft with Cortana.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:15.760]   It's really the battle of the virtual assistants.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.760]   And I think everybody would agree that Apple is,
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.240]   maybe not, let me ask, is Apple behind?
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.560]   Walt seems to think so.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:26.880]   In usability, I would say so.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:31.000]   You have Alexa, which works really great
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.440]   because, kind of like what I was saying before,
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.520]   Amazon was so desperate/eager to get support
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:39.440]   for the Amazon Echo.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.480]   They simply said, the buffet is open.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.160]   Every developer wants to create an action for this.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.240]   Here's an API, just go ahead and do it,
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.160]   so long as you don't expect to actually get money for it
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:50.200]   'cause we don't have a store available,
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.760]   but go ahead and do it.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:56.760]   The Assistant is great because it's still not released yet.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.040]   It's not in final release yet, but it's the one where
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:04.000]   you don't have to form the entire action
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.080]   in your head first, which is what you have to do
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.560]   with previous generation assistance,
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.760]   including Siri where you have to kind of say,
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.080]   schedule an appointment for tomorrow at 2.30 PM
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.400]   with so-and-so.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.080]   Most of these things can do things like that
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.800]   where schedule appointment tomorrow, great with who,
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.960]   with Bob, what time, that's it, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.400]   Assistant can do things like, I find me a place
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.120]   to eat near Coolidge Corner,
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.960]   and then, well, what kind of place you want to eat at?
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.400]   I don't know, anything that's not American.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.320]   It's okay, what's your price range?
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.720]   Well, that's nice, but can you get there by tea?
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.600]   You have this open conversation.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.320]   I don't think that Siri is not as smart necessarily
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:46.080]   as Cortana and these rest of these services.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.640]   It's just that Apple hasn't really put
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:52.360]   these new sort of personalities,
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.920]   these new sorts of depths, front and center,
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.680]   the way that these other groups have.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.960]   Also, I do think that they're kind of limiting Siri
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:35:59.800]   a little bit.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.440]   I was disappointed that it came to the desktop,
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.560]   but I can't talk to Siri via keyboard.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.240]   I have to use the microphone at all times
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.720]   when there are times where I just simply want to schedule
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.080]   something or find something just by typing,
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:15.680]   or I'm on a train, I don't want to have a conversation.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:20.680]   I don't, okay, but not a Mexican place,
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:25.680]   because I remember I had Mexican last week
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.680]   and it made my tummy kind of rumbly in the messy way.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.840]   Oh, no, no, I can't eat onions after 3p.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.640]   You want to have those conversations out loud.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.280]   Siri is still just by voice,
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.920]   whereas Cortana and the Assistant,
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.840]   these Microsoft and Google seem to be finding ways
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.280]   to put that Assistant in other places and other contexts.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.960]   So I don't think it's necessarily dumber,
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.480]   but I don't think that it's been showing consumer facing
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.120]   evolution as fast as these other services have.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:57.000]   >> One of the problems Siri has,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.120]   I think there's two main problems.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:03.120]   By the way, I saw John Gruber refer to Walt Mossberg's article
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.760]   and I thought John might defend Siri.
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:05.900]   In fact, he agrees.
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.800]   Two problems.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.720]   One is that Siri doesn't work all the time.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.800]   A lot of times, a surprisingly large amount of times,
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.520]   I get Siri saying, "I'm sorry, I can't help you.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.960]   "I don't know what's going on, I don't get it."
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.220]   And then he also says,
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:20.960]   Gruber says, "The big problem Apple faces with Siri,
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.720]   "and I agree with this, is that when people encounter
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.040]   "these problems, whether it's not connecting
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.640]   "or just not understanding,
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.960]   "they stop trying.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.480]   "It feels like you're wasting your time
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.360]   "and it makes you feel silly or even foolish for having tried."
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:38.280]   I have actually raised my voice more than once
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.440]   and called Siri bad names more than once.
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.440]   Siri even has a response when you do that,
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.040]   which tells me a lot of other people are doing it.
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.880]   >> At least a lot of the about expectations
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.520]   is that people think Siri is artificially intelligent
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.080]   and it's going to be able to answer any question you have.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.280]   And if Apple had set expectations a little lower,
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.320]   then we wouldn't be so suddenly disappointed
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.360]   when it didn't do everything we dreamed it would.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.600]   >> Although it seems to me Siri
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.440]   when it was first created before Apple bought it,
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.160]   did more than it even today does.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:12.320]   The creators of Siri went on to start something called VIV
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.960]   and they've just sold it to Samsung.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.480]   So we, I guess, have to add Samsung
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.640]   with that list of companies that want to play
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:20.600]   in this field.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:25.600]   Apple has hired from CMU Ross Salakudanov,
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.000]   who is apparently very well known
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.160]   as science professor director.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.720]   He will be director at Apple
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.960]   of artificial intelligence research
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.960]   and charged according to Buzzfeed with building a team
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.120]   over the next few months.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.200]   He's going to remain in his post at CMU,
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.300]   which is a little strange.
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:52.240]   Salakudanov tweeted that he was excited about his new job,
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:56.840]   which is unusual and posted a job listing
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.320]   saying join my new team.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.440]   So this isn't rumor.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.920]   This is confirmed, pretty confirmed stuff.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.040]   And it makes sense Apple,
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.960]   I'm glad to see Apple pushing harder on this.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.920]   It seems to me this is the next big thing.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.680]   Well, maybe AR is, maybe VR is.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.440]   We have a lot of next big things,
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.720]   but I think if you were to pick,
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.320]   and certainly this was Google's contention
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.320]   at their event, Sundar Pichai said,
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.640]   this is the fourth revolution of computing.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.760]   First it was personal computing,
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.720]   then it was the internet,
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.840]   then it was mobile computing.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.280]   Now it's going to be adding machine learning
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.200]   to everything that we do.
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.800]   I think I'd have to agree with him on that.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.680]   And Apple, is it, is part of Apple's problem?
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.920]   I wonder, Jim, what you think about this,
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.880]   the fact that it's decided to become the privacy company.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.080]   Is that inherently limit what it can do with Siri?
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.520]   Well, I think the problem with Siri,
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.800]   I agreed with Walt as well,
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.680]   and I often disagree with Walt on his stuff.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.520]   But with Siri, I agreed with him.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.640]   And sometimes you ask Siri
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:09.080]   what seems like a very logical, simple question.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:14.400]   And it comes up with the most bizarre answers.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.560]   And what does that lead you to do?
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.800]   It leads you to just stop asking the questions.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.480]   Because like you said,
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.120]   when you swear it's Siri,
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.480]   Siri comes back with an answer.
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.680]   Well, if you can answer that,
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:27.280]   why do you answer my original question?
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.120]   (laughing)
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.120]   You know, I mean,
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:33.040]   so that's over time,
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.160]   what it's led me to do is to just stop.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:42.160]   And so I set a timer with Siri, mostly on my watch.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.200]   So when I wanna burn my dinner,
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.160]   I can effectively burn my dinner with a timer.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:52.680]   I play music with Siri,
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:55.040]   often on my phone and my watch, when I'm driving,
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:59.240]   I'll often just press Siri and say, you know,
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.560]   play Metallica.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:04.480]   And it'll shuffle Metallica songs until I tell it to stop.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:08.200]   So that part of Siri seems to work fine.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:13.680]   Asking Siri for sports scores
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:17.600]   or the upcoming schedule for the Boston Bruins,
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.400]   which is the best hockey team ever.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.280]   (laughing)
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:27.280]   You get results that it could be the Boston Bruins.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:32.440]   It could be something completely unrelated to sports.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.560]   It could be anything you just don't know.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.920]   And it depends on how you ask the question.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.320]   And we all ask questions differently.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:46.040]   So it just let me,
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.720]   and I'll tell you,
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:51.520]   what I started doing when I would ask Siri a question
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:55.200]   and it would come up with these bizarre answers,
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:00.200]   I would then go to Google and ask Google the same question.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.960]   And more often than not, Google would have the answer.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.960]   - Yeah, that's gonna be a little depressing
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.000]   for Apple users, I find.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   - So what I started doing for a lot of it,
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.320]   instead of wasting my time in asking Siri,
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.120]   I'd just type it into Google.
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:21.440]   You know, I don't think about asking Google
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.600]   the same way that I think about asking Siri.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.320]   - Well, it's a extra step
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.080]   'cause you have to open the Google app and--
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:32.080]   - Right, so I would try and ask Siri
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:35.680]   and I would try and rephrase it.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.720]   And by that time, I could have had the answer
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.520]   just typing it into Google.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.000]   You know, if I just go to the Google webpage
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.280]   and type it in on my iPhone, I have the answer.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:50.040]   So, you know, creating appointments.
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.720]   And you know, Apple said in that article to Walt
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:56.400]   that they were working on ways for Siri
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.920]   to help you manage things on your phone.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.320]   So create tasks and do all of this kind of stuff.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.640]   Well, I tried that in the past, maybe it's improved since,
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.760]   but that's one of the things that I stopped doing.
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.840]   Like, you know, set up an appointment for tomorrow
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:15.560]   at 11 a.m. for Mac break weekly.
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:19.600]   And then it would start asking me all these questions
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.760]   that I already answered, that I already told it,
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:22.840]   that I wanted to do.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:23.680]   - It's just--
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:28.120]   I just, you give up on that, I'll just go to the calendar app
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.480]   and type it in myself.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:33.560]   Because, so, you know, while Apple says that it's working,
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.320]   that's where its focus is on that stuff.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.240]   Well, that didn't even work out so well for me.
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.080]   So--
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:43.440]   - Well, they can get, look, there's room to get better.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.280]   And I think--
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:49.280]   - But I think the problem is there's room to get better,
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:53.080]   but they've already lost a lot of the--
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.200]   - The people that would use it.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:58.760]   So they can come out in a month and say,
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:02.200]   we fixed all of the problems, everything is done,
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:07.200]   and this is the best AI that has ever been made.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.280]   This is it.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.960]   I'll probably still just set a timer and play music from it,
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:18.600]   because, you know, the ability for it to answer
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.880]   simple questions, my simple questions, anyway.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.560]   - Was it a mistake to put it in Sierra?
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.520]   Is it too early to--
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.000]   - I'll be honest, I don't use it in Sierra,
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   because, again, if I go to Siri,
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.720]   and I wanna play a song or a band,
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:42.560]   it takes three times as long to play a song or a band
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:46.520]   in iTunes, and it does just for me to open up iTunes
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:47.520]   and press play.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.560]   - So because--
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.120]   - And now from a developer's point of view,
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:55.240]   you know, when Amazon shipped Alexa or the Echo,
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.160]   there was an API almost immediately,
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.600]   and when Google shipped the Google Assistant,
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.240]   there was an API immediately,
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.240]   and just now Apple is finally getting around
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.640]   to creating the Siri kit that's gonna allow developers
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.840]   to extend the capabilities of it.
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:10.480]   So once again, they were willing to do it eventually
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.120]   when someone had twisted their arms to that point.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:17.120]   - And also, I would point out that while it's gonna be harder
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.560]   to do a Google Now style product for Apple,
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:22.200]   because of its unwillingness to gather data,
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:26.560]   really, it would take a huge step if it just understood
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.880]   better what you're saying,
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.720]   and responded to it more appropriately.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.040]   You don't have to, I don't have to invade your privacy
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.680]   to know how to schedule an appointment for you, Jim.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:39.080]   I just need to understand and parse that sentence better.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:42.520]   - Well, yeah, but if you ask, you're right,
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.720]   but if you ask a question to Siri
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.560]   and change a couple of words from the way that I ask it,
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.160]   you could get a totally different answer.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.080]   - Right.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:51.920]   - In which case-- - That's true
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.800]   of all the assistance, isn't it?
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:57.840]   - Well, again, I've tried with Google
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.240]   in asking the exact same question.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.440]   - That's better at it.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.760]   - And it purses the information a bit better.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.800]   Now, will Siri get better?
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:09.080]   I have no doubt that it'll get better,
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:13.360]   but the problem is Apple puts this out there and says,
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.280]   here it is, it's going to work,
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.640]   it's going to help you do all of these things,
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:23.440]   but when it doesn't,
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.920]   it's one of those things that could become very useful
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.400]   or could become a novelty.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.720]   - And I'll tell you what,
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:32.920]   there is a threat to Apple in falling behind this,
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.200]   and I'll give you an example with the Amazon Echo.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.280]   Amazon now has a unlimited music service
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:40.240]   that you can pay for that's less than Apple Music
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.960]   has roughly the same cuts
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:44.840]   and integrates with the Echo beautifully.
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.640]   So now, in fact, I paid for it
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.680]   as a prime member, it was 79 bucks for a year,
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.320]   which is what is that?
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.200]   A little bit more than,
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.120]   it's like $6.30 a month,
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.440]   that's considerably less.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:58.480]   - Plus you get movies, plus you get books,
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.480]   plus you get-- - Well, you get them,
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:00.720]   no, no, no, no, 'cause you have to pay
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.480]   for the music edition of 79 bucks, okay?
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:06.760]   So I'm already prime, 79 bucks, actually 99 now.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:10.920]   And then I'm now also paying another 79 a year,
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:14.240]   but for this, basically the same offering as Spotify
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.120]   and Apple Music,
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.360]   I don't know, there may be differences,
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.160]   it's brand new, I haven't plumbed it yet.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.360]   And certainly Spotify still is kind of the king
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:27.360]   in terms of playlists and kind of intelligence and social,
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:31.040]   but there's a huge selling point on the Amazon music,
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.080]   which is it works with my Echo,
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:36.040]   and it starts to work with Sonos,
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.600]   which is now being beta tested,
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.840]   will be out early next year in general.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:43.760]   More and more, that's looking like a solution for me.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:46.120]   Now I know Jim music is your life.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:48.760]   Is that the kind of thing that sells you
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:50.400]   on a product like the Echo,
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.280]   if you could have all that music?
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.080]   Of course you own everything, so you don't really care.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.760]   - I own most of my music, yeah.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:03.080]   - But I think what sells me on these types of products
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:09.400]   is the simplicity of being able to use it.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.760]   If I have to keep going back and saying,
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:18.760]   no, what time is this on?
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.360]   - I know, it's very frustrating.
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.200]   - And that's when you're square.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.200]   - It's useless to me.
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.040]   - Yeah, that's when you say.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.880]   - And that's when you get a response.
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:27.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:31.440]   - I will say Siri works in a lot of situations
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.200]   and it works differently for a lot of people.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:37.160]   And it's not that it doesn't recognize my voice,
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.320]   it does because it gives you feedback
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.440]   and it can choose you that it understands the question
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:45.360]   or it understands the language of the question.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:47.800]   It doesn't understand how necessarily
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:50.760]   to parse those answers.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:54.320]   And when you look at an assistant of any type,
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:57.440]   whether it's in your home or on your phone or on your watch,
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:01.120]   you want it to, the first time,
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:03.640]   just be able to give you an answer,
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.120]   not take you to a website,
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:08.480]   here's the information that I found.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.400]   You want it to tell you.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.040]   And in Walt's example,
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:16.440]   it didn't understand who the presidential candidates were.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:20.520]   As some kind of intelligence
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.320]   that's an assistant that's on your phone,
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:26.960]   you would expect it to know things like that.
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:29.440]   I expect it to know for me,
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:34.260]   sports scores are upcoming NHL schedules.
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:38.080]   Yeah, I don't want it to take me to a website
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.840]   to show me what the schedule is.
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.720]   I can just type that into Google.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.240]   I want it to be able to come back and tell me.
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.840]   And when it can't, that's a problem.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:49.360]   So music is definitely a big thing for me,
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:53.720]   but the biggest thing is how these systems,
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.320]   how simple they are to use.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:59.640]   I understand there's an errand can probably speak to this,
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:03.880]   how much is going on in the background to make this simple.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:07.000]   But as a consumer, that's what I expect.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.400]   I just expect it to work.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.480]   And when it doesn't, I move on.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:13.080]   Aaron, is this a hard computer science problem?
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.360]   Oh, it's a very hard computer science problem.
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.800]   Whenever you deal with humans and their ideas,
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.840]   it's always complicated.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:19.840]   When you open it up and say,
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.920]   let's talk about anything you want at all,
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.240]   right, becomes absurd.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.600]   Yeah, the more constrained the vocabulary,
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:25.880]   one of the reasons the echo does well
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:27.840]   is because it's more constrained,
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:29.600]   the easier it is to be accurate.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:32.640]   It's when, although we're starting to see early reviews
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.840]   now of the Pixel,
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.880]   Google's Pixel ships on Thursday
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.240]   and a number of reviewers are now publishing the reviews
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.920]   as of today.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:45.080]   And almost to a person, they say,
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:48.840]   the recognition, the speech recognition was superb.
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.680]   This is where Google does have an advantage
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.120]   because they've been collecting voice samples
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:55.760]   through a variety of services, including Google Voice.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:59.360]   And remember they were, for a while, you could get free--
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.320]   Google 411.
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.800]   411 and all of that.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:04.400]   As it turned out, they killed it and they said,
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.680]   we got enough samples now.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:06.680]   Thanks.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:07.520]   (laughs)
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.520]   So they've really benefited from that.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.400]   And apparently their speech recognition
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:15.960]   with the new Google Assistant is uncannily good.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.160]   That's a big step too.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:20.360]   Just you get some validation when at least
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.280]   the Assistant understands what you asked.
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:28.400]   They've really paid attention to the finer points too.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:32.720]   Just to, how should Siri or the Google Assistant say,
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:33.960]   okay.
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.560]   It depends on-- with the Google Assistant,
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.400]   it understands that it could be saying,
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.280]   okay, for a number of different reasons.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:43.280]   It could be saying, okay, meaning that I understand
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.480]   your last request, now we're gonna sit down
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.880]   and we're gonna get the data we need
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.760]   in order to comply with that request.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.280]   There's okay, meaning that, okay, I understand
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.640]   that you don't wanna do this anymore,
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:55.200]   so I won't bother you again with this.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:59.800]   I do find that I kind of like talking to the fake person
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:03.560]   inside Google more than I like talking to the fake person
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:06.360]   inside Apple.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.360]   - Yeah.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:12.360]   Aaron from a technical standpoint is what we're asking
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:17.180]   or what I'm asking from Siri.
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:19.800]   Not reasonable?
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.880]   - No, it's totally reasonable.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.960]   It just takes time and Apple shipped this
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.520]   as if it was a done product.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.800]   And it would have been great to let it sneak out
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:32.360]   like Google 411 and Google Voice
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:34.400]   and gather the data they needed to know
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.920]   what 99% of the questions were going to be.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:41.120]   And I think then they could have done a system
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:44.800]   that took care of those 99% of the cases really well.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.040]   And it would have been nice to see that,
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:48.040]   but you know how Apple is, they wanna ship something
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:50.240]   that's complete and tell you that it's world changing
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.400]   and flawless.
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:55.040]   And in a lot of these machine learning problem spaces,
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.960]   it just doesn't work very well.
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:57.800]   - Yeah.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.480]   - How important is data?
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.520]   How important is the data that Google's collected
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.720]   with things like Google 411?
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:04.880]   - It's all about data.
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:07.880]   So Google is, they gather a whole lot of data
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:10.800]   and they run it against a bunch of statistical models
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.040]   and neural networks.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:15.440]   And so if you ask Google, it's all about the data.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:19.280]   And then they just throw a whole lot of computing power at it
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.320]   to get something useful out of that data.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.760]   And they're very, very good at it.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:24.880]   And they're very dedicated to that idea
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.080]   central to what they do.
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:28.840]   - The other thing Google's doing is contextual searching.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:33.120]   So it's understanding, it seems as if it's almost understanding
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:37.440]   what you're talking about and can do a follow up.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.680]   And they're really touting that as another feature.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.560]   And that's something Siri does not understand.
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:44.800]   It doesn't have any memory of what you've been talking about.
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.520]   - Hey, can I put in a quick plug here?
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:47.360]   - Yes.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:50.400]   - If you wanna develop skills for the Echo,
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:53.880]   Big Nerd Ranch and Amazon developed a series of four videos
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:54.760]   on how to do that.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:56.440]   And you can go to our website and find that.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:54:00.600]   Or if you go to Amazon, it's developer.amazon.com.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.080]   You can find those videos as well.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:04.280]   And we'll walk you through how to do that.
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:08.840]   - I was very impressed by, the Echo was open very early on
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:10.640]   and Amazon supports it.
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:14.160]   It will even, as a hobby as you can create skills
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:15.560]   and run them on this.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:17.640]   What is the name of that server that they offer?
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:18.480]   I can't remember.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:19.320]   - Lambda.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:20.160]   - Lambda.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:22.920]   And so, and what language is it Python?
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.240]   Do you have to use Go?
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.320]   What do you--
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.960]   - We actually do it using Node.js.
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:27.800]   So we have it.
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:28.640]   - Really?
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:29.480]   - People write it in JavaScript.
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:30.320]   - JavaScript.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:31.960]   - You know, everybody knows some JavaScript.
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:32.960]   - Yeah.
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:35.240]   And, but it's a little bit structured.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:36.520]   And it's a little for the user.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.160]   The end user is a little frustrating
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.280]   because you have to enable a skill.
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:43.400]   And then you have to know this specific skill trigger
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:44.680]   to get the skill running.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:46.680]   And then you can interact with it in a more natural way.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.600]   And that's given that there are hundreds,
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.000]   maybe thousands of skills now.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.040]   That's really not a great solution.
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:53.800]   Amazon says it's gonna change that.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:56.600]   That's gonna be the key for Siri.
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:57.720]   It's gonna be the key for Google.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.360]   It's gonna be the key for everybody.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:00.880]   Is this ability to,
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.840]   A, an SDK, a way for developers to use it.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.440]   And thank goodness Apple's done that.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:09.880]   But also the ability to integrate with other apps.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:13.960]   All three companies, I think, want to be able,
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:17.920]   like when you say, let's make a reservation for a dinner
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:21.040]   to be able to integrate with say OpenTable.
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:21.880]   And do that.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.680]   It's funny Siri was able to do that before Apple bought it.
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:27.360]   And me Apple immediately took that out.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:30.040]   And I don't think they've put it back yet.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.440]   - Yeah, it's frustrating.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:34.200]   - It's a difference in philosophy.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.960]   Let's not forget that one of the reasons why
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:40.480]   Palm 8, the Newton message patch lunch was that
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:42.880]   instead of spending $1,000 for a dev kit
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.520]   and then proving to Apple that you had a decent
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.440]   Newton app to support their device.
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:50.440]   Palm just that when they shift the Palm pilot,
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:51.360]   here is a CD-ROM.
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.240]   It contains a complete development kit
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.400]   with an open source compiler.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:57.560]   By all means, please write apps for our platform.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:00.280]   It's, there's a lot of variables to the calculus.
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:02.440]   I think, I really think that one of the big hurdles
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:05.760]   that Apple is going to have to get over
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:08.840]   is the fact that they haven't spent a long time
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:12.440]   collecting data, not only on a specific user,
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:13.880]   but on all users.
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:17.160]   And all users, users that may be like me
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:21.120]   because the real sophistication starts with,
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.200]   I wanna play, where's a good place to eat near here?
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:27.440]   And for the assistant to know that he probably doesn't want
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.480]   an all vegetarian, all broccoli restaurant,
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:31.000]   I'm gonna find places that I think
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.400]   that he's gonna be interested in.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:34.360]   And then the next level sophistication is,
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:36.960]   if I say, what's the weather going to be like tomorrow?
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:40.040]   Do I meet, based on my traffic habits,
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.800]   what I'm likely to be doing on a Wednesday,
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:44.000]   do I mean, is it gonna be nice enough
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.040]   that I can take a bike ride?
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.960]   Does it mean that the weather is going to affect traffic
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:50.760]   when I try to drive an hour to get someplace?
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.520]   Does it mean that is the weather going to affect
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:56.880]   my ability to leave on a plane that I'm scheduled to take tomorrow?
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:58.480]   And that's the sort of stuff you only get
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:02.600]   when you've been spending a decade listening and watching
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:04.480]   to what your user is doing.
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:08.440]   That's when you stop becoming a gadget
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.840]   for setting a kitchen timer
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:11.720]   and finding out what the current temperature is
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:14.160]   and turns into a point of access
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:16.720]   to every single digital thing that you have,
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:19.760]   a device that you would never wanna do without for a single day.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:25.760]   Let's talk about cars, Mark German, big scoop.
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:30.360]   How Apple scaled back its interesting choice of terms,
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:36.160]   Titanic planned to take on Detroit.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:40.040]   First of all, Apple never announced they were taking on Detroit.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:44.040]   That was something people determined.
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:47.680]   Although, I remember, you know, when this first came out
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:49.600]   saying is, "How are we sure they're doing this
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:53.560]   and it seemed like Renee, for instance, Renee Richie said,
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:55.880]   "Oh no, they've hired a thousand people.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.400]   We know they're doing something."
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:01.840]   But maybe more challenging than anybody imagined.
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:06.920]   According to German, Apple has scaled back its automotive ambition,
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:09.480]   leading to hundreds of job cuts.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:14.920]   The team of a thousand people has already lost hundreds of members.
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:19.440]   And for now, no longer does Apple wanna build its own car.
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:21.640]   According to people familiar with the project.
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:26.480]   And I guess, according to German,
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:29.160]   the decision is gonna be next year
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:33.000]   whether to even move forward in this.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.240]   That must be a little bit dispiriting for the people
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.560]   who are working on that project.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:41.280]   Because working on a project that gets canceled,
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:44.240]   that's not news, that comes with the business.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:47.720]   But for, given that for a couple of years,
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:49.720]   a lot of these people were so excited about
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:52.160]   whatever it is that Apple told them under NDA
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:54.480]   that they left really great jobs
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.040]   with really great companies.
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:58.080]   Because it really intrigued them
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:01.280]   as to not just professional opportunities,
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.240]   but this company will give me a chance
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:04.840]   to build something that's been in my mind
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:08.280]   for the past five years that Ford will never let me do.
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:10.880]   And it's not just that building a car,
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:13.560]   if that was their original plan, isn't coming to fruition.
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:17.920]   It means that for two years, you were off the map
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.080]   for your professional community.
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.840]   And maybe even after you're a let go from this project,
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:24.880]   you're still not allowed to tell people,
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.040]   here's what I was working on,
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:28.600]   here's how my skillset expanded and improved.
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:29.800]   Here's what I learned.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:33.880]   One way to keep the troops motivated
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:36.800]   is when you do let your people go, by the way,
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:40.480]   I'm gonna pay your way to this conference
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:41.960]   that you go to every year.
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:43.760]   And you are perfectly willing to,
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:45.840]   well, if you wanna present a paper on the work
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:47.440]   you've been doing with Apple,
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.120]   we'll have to vet it before you say it,
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:51.360]   but we're proud of the work that you're doing.
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:53.920]   We don't know if we're gonna commercialize it,
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.000]   but we want the world to know this work
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.240]   that you've been doing for us.
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:59.520]   So I'm just saying that it must be a little bit
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.600]   dispiriting to find yourself,
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.280]   making one last trip to the company Apple Store
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.000]   with your employee discount,
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.440]   knowing that, well, that was two years in which I could
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.320]   have been going from a real estate license,
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:14.160]   and by now it would have my real estate license.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.880]   - German writes, by the end,
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.920]   Apple started this plan in 2014.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.040]   By the end of 2015, according to his sources,
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:24.320]   the project was blighted by internal strife managers
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.560]   battled about the project's direction.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.560]   It was an incredible failure of leadership,
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.000]   one of the people said.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.800]   In early 2016, Project Head Steve Zadeski,
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.080]   he was a former motor company engineer
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.640]   and early iPod designer, Left Titan.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.680]   He's still at Apple, he just left that project.
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:44.560]   He gave the project to Dan Ricchio,
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.520]   who was the guy already responsible for engineering,
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.600]   iPhone, iPad, and Mac refreshes.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:56.520]   Bob Mansfield, who had kind of been on a hiatus,
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.380]   returned to lead the team in April,
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:02.480]   about a month later,
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.960]   German's got good sources, right?
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.720]   So I feel like he's writing this.
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:07.760]   - He's got a pretty good truck record.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.120]   - He's not hedging this year.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.760]   About a month later, that would be in May,
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.800]   Mansfield took the stage in an auditorium packed
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.320]   with hundreds of Titan employees
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.480]   to announce the strategy shift.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.720]   According to people who attended the meeting,
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.640]   Mansfield explained he'd examined the project,
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.800]   determined Apple should move from building an outright
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:28.480]   competitive Tesla to an underlying self-driving platform
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:32.480]   in the following month's engineers started leaving.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.000]   And of course, we mentioned this when we reported
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.760]   that story that one of the things Elon's always said,
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.720]   Elon Musk always said, "A Tesla is you need to have
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.240]   "the hardware and the software.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.880]   "You can't develop them independently."
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.440]   But maybe Apple saw an opportunity
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.800]   with some other companies like BMW or Mercedes
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.760]   to do the software,
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.920]   as well the car company still made the cars.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.920]   More than 120 software engineers working on a car
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.600]   operating system and testing procedures were cut.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.160]   Several hundred hardware engineers working on car chassis,
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.880]   suspension, and undercarriage is also left.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.120]   And in September, the Times reported Apple
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.040]   cut dozens of employees from Titan.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.680]   John Wright, a veteran Apple manager
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:12.400]   who led the software teams has left the project.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.360]   Dan Dodge, you may remember him,
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:18.760]   he was the creator of QNX, QNX, took a larger role.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:22.760]   So they're still working according to a german
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:25.320]   on the remaining engineers anyway,
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.800]   on autonomous programs, vision sensors,
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.560]   and simulators for testing the platform
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.120]   in real world environments.
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:33.800]   And of course, they have regulatory specialists
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.360]   because you've got to get regulatory approval.
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.040]   - All right, can I say how disappointing this is for me?
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:41.880]   - Why?
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.400]   - I mean, it's so cool when a company
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:46.800]   that has tens of billions of dollars sitting in the bank
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.720]   goes and does something audacious,
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.400]   like building a new car company.
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.440]   And I was really looking forward to seeing what they would do.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:57.280]   And I hope that they are taking their tens of billions
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.040]   and solving death or something like that.
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.680]   But it's just a point of seeing that they're now
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.840]   just doing another, I don't know,
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.200]   more of that car entertainment system,
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.000]   but not a full car by any stretch of that.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.880]   - Well, even if they never got to a car,
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.520]   the research that they had done,
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.720]   and things like fingerprint sensor in a car,
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.240]   and autonomy and stuff,
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.680]   we'd be great to get that out to the rest of the world.
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:21.640]   I mean, a lot of good work's been done here.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.520]   And maybe even if they wanted to pursue that,
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:27.160]   there would be some play for them in patents and licensing.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:31.520]   I'm not sure exactly what happens going forward.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.200]   - I think you too.
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:36.000]   What would be interesting if part of what Apple
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.800]   turns out to be doing in 10 years
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:40.120]   is not just designing and shipping wonderful products,
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.800]   but also we're developing core technologies
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.120]   resting on our comfortable featherbed of $200 billion
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.320]   in which we can do whatever we want.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.880]   And then so when someone who is better prepared
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:54.200]   to build an autonomous car wants to get started,
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.680]   they'll find that Apple has already done 45%
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.080]   of the work for them, just licensed the technology
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.920]   and then build this thing that they couldn't figure out
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:02.760]   how to build on their own.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.520]   That'd be an interesting direction for the company.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.120]   - Jim, you were gonna say something?
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:13.120]   - Well, it's interesting that we know that Apple
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.200]   was doing something.
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:18.720]   And I don't think that this is over yet.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:21.880]   You know, to Aaron's point,
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:26.000]   they have a company like Apple with billions of dollars
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.800]   to spend on research.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:34.200]   They were going at this huge problem all at once.
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:40.440]   And maybe this is the point where Bob Mansfield,
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:44.800]   who I trust with all of the products
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.520]   that he's been in charge of at Apple over the years,
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:51.000]   maybe they just decided to focus
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.440]   on getting one part of this done at a time.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.720]   I don't think this is something that Apple's gonna come out
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.040]   with in the next year.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:00.640]   I don't think it ever was.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:03.400]   We're looking at years of work ahead of them
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.480]   in order to make this work.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:10.120]   And while they were building the iPhone
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.040]   and the iPad at Apple, they were releasing,
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.760]   what was that, a Sony Ericsson phone
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:20.760]   that they worked on with Sony to make that work in iTunes.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.000]   - Motorola Rocker.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   - Yeah, Rocker, yeah.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.600]   - All the Rocker, yeah.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:31.680]   So they could be working with car companies
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:35.400]   to integrate some of their software
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:40.200]   while at the same time working on a vehicle of their own.
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:44.960]   I really, I would be surprised if this was the total end
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.420]   of everything.
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:49.800]   I think that they did need some focus though
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:54.800]   because there was a lot of rumors of strife
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:59.320]   within the teams in which direction they should go.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:04.320]   So I would hope that they would get something
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:07.920]   really good in software and the sensors.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:12.920]   I mean, like Aaron's, it's difficult to take a project
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:17.320]   like this and say, okay, we have the software,
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:21.080]   but you need the sensors and you need all of these things
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:25.120]   that work with the software in order to make it work properly.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:29.600]   And Elon knows that better than anybody
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:32.000]   and even they're having a lot of problems.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   So I really think that Apple's trying to focus
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:43.040]   and when Apple focuses, that's when they do their best work.
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:48.040]   When they're scattered and they're trying to solve
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:52.400]   too many problems all at once, you end up with Apple music.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.680]   - I agree, I didn't stick to your knitting.
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:58.280]   It wouldn't be as big a deal if everything was working
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.120]   wonderfully in the Apple universe, but it's not.
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.320]   And Aaron, you shouldn't be sad
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.560]   because that's the nature of moonshots, right?
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:10.480]   I mean, at least be happy that Apple's willing
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:13.440]   to take some of that money and do something crazy
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:17.200]   like this for a few years, but the nature of moonshots
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.320]   is most of them fail, right?
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:23.720]   And I think Apple's to be praised if they are cutting
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:27.080]   the cord on this one to at least being decisive about it.
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.080]   The worst thing would be to let this
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.560]   to dribble on for decades and never do anything.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:35.160]   - Also think about all the, probably four times
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:38.240]   as fantastic projects, Apple's working on that,
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.400]   they've managed to maintain security on
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.520]   'cause they have not hired a thousand people.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:45.840]   They have not pulled some very high profile people
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:46.960]   out of office, right?
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:51.960]   So if there's a sentient self-aware mechanical octopus
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.440]   that can make a really good cheese omelet
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.440]   for you automatically, it's probably
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:59.120]   in some subterranean Apple kitchen right now.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.600]   And that's the sort of thing that will cause people
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.160]   to never say Apple can't innovate or Apple is not.
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.320]   Apple is only focusing on deciding
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:10.920]   what the corner radius is going to be of the next phone
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.000]   instead of coming up with something
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.400]   that really blows our minds.
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:18.040]   - Evan Stone, who's our local Swift developer,
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.680]   I see has stopped by the studio.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.840]   I'm sure he's dying for me to ask you about Swift.
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:24.040]   We'll do that in a little bit, Aaron.
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.880]   We're also, I do wanna talk about Apple moving,
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.520]   more Apple music stories 'cause Jim's down rumbles here,
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.520]   we gotta talk about Apple music.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:34.080]   And a whole lot more still to come.
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:38.320]   Our show today brought to you by audible.com.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:42.680]   A great source for your favorite audio books.
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.400]   I'm an audible fanatic.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:46.920]   I know Andy and Akko also is,
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:49.560]   how would you like Ron Swanson to be reading
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.520]   your next audible book to you?
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.200]   Andy says he's got a great pick.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:57.520]   Tom Sawyer read by Nick Offerman.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:00.340]   That sounds amazing.
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:02.720]   This is a--
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.560]   - I'm sorry, it's never occurred to me in the past 10 years
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.200]   to read Tom Sawyer.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.120]   All I had to do was see Tom Sawyer's narrated
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.880]   by Nick Offerman's and my finger autonomously
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.280]   was clicking the buy it now button
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:15.800]   before I could even complete the thought.
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:17.240]   I definitely wanna hear that.
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.800]   - I love Nick Offerman and I bet this is awesome.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:23.320]   This is actually a series audible's been doing of classics
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:27.640]   read by well-known Hollywood names.
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.480]   And it's--
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:29.320]   - Full of guile.
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:30.460]   Very deep.
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:34.320]   For she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments.
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:36.400]   Like many other simple-hearted souls,
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:39.480]   it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:43.160]   with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:47.000]   And she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.960]   as marvels of low cunning.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.800]   Considered to be many by many
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.080]   to be the best American novel of all time.
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.080]   I'm not sure I'd agree with that,
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.800]   but certainly a great one.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:56.960]   Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.600]   Now you can get this for free.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:03.120]   Or pick another book from their huge selection
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:07.040]   of not just novels, but nonfiction,
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:11.640]   science fiction, periodicals, performances, plays,
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.520]   even college courses, they have the great courses.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:17.360]   If there were no other reason to get audible,
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:20.840]   like if we're just that you could subscribe
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:24.000]   and get the great courses, that would be enough for me.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.320]   I love these college courses from the best professors.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:32.320]   I mean, you just really can grow your brain, entertain.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:37.480]   If you're traveling, I wouldn't dare.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.400]   Oh look, a new American satire.
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:43.040]   What is it, Bob Honey, who just do stuff?
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:44.800]   Do stuff?
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.160]   We're narrated by Sean Penn.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.600]   Oh yeah, I saw his interview with,
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:52.120]   who was it with Colbert about this or somebody?
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:52.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.600]   Anyway, here's the deal.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.640]   Go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.120]   You'll be signing up when you do that.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:10:59.960]   You'll be signing up.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.960]   Don't be scared for the gold account.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:02.920]   That's really the best,
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.680]   because the subscription gets you a book a month
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.920]   or credit a month at the best price.
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:10.160]   And it's really nice to get a new book every month.
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:15.160]   I've been doing that for, well, since 2016 years.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:19.440]   So I have a really nice library now of audible titles.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.000]   It's a wonderful thing to do.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.400]   You don't pay anything for the first month.
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.440]   You also get the Daily Digest of the Wall Street Journal
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.680]   of the New York Times as part of your subscription.
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:28.440]   Cancel in the first 30 days, you'll pay nothing.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.000]   The book you go that you choose right now
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.480]   will be yours to keep forever.
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:35.280]   For in the gym, on the commute,
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.200]   walk in the dog, doing the dishes.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.680]   If you have an Amazon Echo, audible's so great,
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.280]   you just tell the Echo read to me
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:44.960]   and it'll read you exactly where you left off
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:48.720]   on your current book, which is fantastic.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:51.400]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:57.480]   Audible.com/MacBreak, your first book is yours right now,
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.960]   for free.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:06.360]   This was a little disheartening.
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.640]   Apple moves $9 billion worth of iTunes
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:12.000]   intellectual property to Ireland.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.440]   Despite the complaints people are making about Apple's
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.440]   tax strategy, which we should hasten to point out
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.360]   is not illegal, but the way they do it
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:25.720]   is they move intellectual property to Ireland
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:27.440]   and they are not stopping.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:31.960]   Actually, those $9 billion in assets
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.160]   were in Luxembourg.
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:37.400]   It doesn't really matter,
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.000]   although I imagine it's for tax reasons.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   What can you say?
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.240]   So, Jim, are you still unhappy with Apple music?
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:52.560]   A lot of things about Apple music are getting a lot better.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:59.240]   You know, I do enjoy, I listen to the Hard Rock Channel
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:01.720]   in Apple music quite a bit.
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:03.520]   It's like radio kind of?
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:07.640]   It's kind of like radio, but it's more,
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.440]   it's not just an algorithm.
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:14.440]   So, you know, Apple spends time curating the station
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:19.120]   with songs, but it is very random
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.000]   in the type of things that it can come up with.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.080]   So, in Hard Rock Radio, for instance,
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:27.360]   you could hear an old black Sabbath song
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.880]   and the next song could be a brand new song
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.560]   that just came out this week.
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.640]   So, you get a nice mix.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:39.040]   And they're doing a good job in the A-list.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.400]   The A-list is a cross genre,
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:45.840]   so you get A-list blues, which is, or A-list Hard Rock.
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.840]   I listen to both of those.
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:52.840]   And that is a list that Apple editors came up with.
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:14:00.680]   And it's the best songs that are wrote right now.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:03.840]   So, if you wanna know what songs are,
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.200]   Apple things are the best right now,
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:09.320]   go to the A-list and you'll hear them.
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.280]   There's 20 or 30 songs in these lists
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:15.160]   and they're constantly being updated.
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.000]   It's a great thing.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.040]   I do really enjoy those types of things.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.880]   I'm still, personally, I'm having some issues
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.680]   still with iTunes Batch.
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.760]   - Really?
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.920]   - Yeah, well, here's-- - It hasn't deleted
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.040]   more music, I hope.
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.080]   - No, no, no, nothing like that.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:38.240]   I really enjoy, when you go to Apple Music
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:39.680]   and you press on a band,
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:42.160]   if you scroll to the bottom of an album,
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:45.400]   it'll come up and say, "Here are some more bands
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:46.560]   that you may enjoy.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:49.400]   Here are some more albums and songs from this current band."
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:50.960]   I really enjoy that.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:54.840]   But I own so much music that when Apple Music
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:58.840]   doesn't actually recognize all of the songs
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:00.520]   on the albums that I have,
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:03.520]   in which case that feature doesn't show up.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:08.840]   And that affects things like play counts,
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:14.040]   the history Apple in iOS doesn't show you the history anymore.
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:16.640]   Apple Music will only show you play counts
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:20.280]   for songs that it knows you have in your library.
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:22.680]   So that doesn't work right anymore.
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:25.400]   So there are some things with iTunes Batch
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:29.760]   that I hope that they'll get fixed over the next little while.
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:34.520]   But they are doing a really good job
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.280]   of the playlists that they have,
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:42.000]   the radio like Hard Rock and Blue's radio.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.600]   I think that the songs that they're picking
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:47.600]   are a lot better than what they used to be.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:52.160]   The algorithmic things is, it's good.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.520]   Like if you pick a song and say,
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:56.000]   "Start a Station" from this song,
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:00.600]   the algorithmic choices will span,
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:05.440]   decades of music,
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:10.680]   which is one way that you can look at doing music.
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.320]   So if you pick Sweet Child of Mine and say,
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:14.680]   "Start a Station," you could get some old Black Sabbath,
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:16.840]   you could get some new stuff,
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:19.360]   you could get things from the 80s and 90s
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:24.360]   where that song was popular.
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:28.120]   In comparison, if you do Pandora
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:30.600]   and you choose Sweet Child of Mine,
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:35.160]   it will stay within a few years of that song.
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.320]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:39.160]   - And try and give you songs.
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:42.280]   It may think that Sweet Child of Mine is hair metal.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:45.800]   So it'll give you more hair metal songs
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:49.760]   and just rock you out to that stuff,
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:52.840]   which in some circumstances is exactly what you want.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:56.440]   So Apple and Pandora just took different approaches
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:01.440]   to the algorithmic song choices.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.000]   - It's pretty clear now that music,
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.720]   subscription services,
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.240]   the selection has become commoditized.
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:10.560]   They're all roughly the same.
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.800]   I mean, I suppose Apple has Beatles and something,
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.440]   but I mean, they're roughly the same,
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.880]   that the real distinguishing factor,
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.840]   and Jimmy Iaveen identified this right away.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.440]   He said curated lists, I think,
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.000]   have discovered weekly on Spotify,
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.720]   which is really there's no parallel,
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.480]   maybe A-list on Apple music is similar.
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:31.960]   And then the ability to create generated radio stations,
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:34.400]   these are the things that are gonna distinguish
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.080]   one service from another, right?
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.560]   The quality that you get from that,
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.640]   the satisfaction you get.
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.160]   - Right, right.
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:45.640]   I mean, you know, when you look at the discover list
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:50.640]   from Spotify or thumbprint radio from Pandora,
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:57.080]   those and, you know, Apple now has my favorites
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.040]   and new music.
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.320]   So these are based on,
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:04.360]   all of these are based on songs that you previously love.
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:05.200]   - Right, right.
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:06.920]   - Some of the other stuff you might like.
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:09.680]   - Right, songs that you've previously listened to.
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:14.600]   And, you know, there are things in all three of those
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:18.120]   that I just don't get, you know, for instance this week
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:23.000]   on Apple's, what is it, the new music list,
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.280]   Apple's new music list, I got some electronica
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.880]   and I got, you know, some pop songs,
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:33.520]   which makes no sense with my Metallica and Aussie library
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:34.880]   that I would like the song.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:37.880]   - If you thumb down that or skipped that,
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.480]   would it then maybe get smarter about that?
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:43.400]   - Well, it does seem to, but one thing,
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:46.400]   and again, this is something that I don't like
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:50.120]   about Apple music, you can thumbs down an album,
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:53.400]   like in the new album, here are some new albums
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:57.960]   that you may like, I had one that was rap
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.760]   and, you know, I respect the music
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:04.520]   and the talent of those people, but, you know,
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:08.480]   as a music over myself, it's not the type of music
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:09.760]   I won in my library.
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:14.360]   So I would thumbs down or dislike that album
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:16.800]   and it would stay there and it stays there
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.280]   for a week or more.
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.640]   I don't know why Apple, if I thumbs down
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:24.960]   or dislike that album, why can't it just take it away?
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.480]   And then it's not there anymore.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.240]   - Well, you don't use that as a signal.
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.720]   - Yeah, you should know, that's a signal now.
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:31.560]   - Yeah.
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:32.400]   - I mean, it's a fine line.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.240]   Maybe you just didn't like that album,
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:37.680]   but you do like rap or, you maybe like old school hip hop
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:39.200]   and you don't like new or whatever.
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.760]   But it should learn over time what you like
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:42.840]   and don't like, I would think.
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:45.840]   - Right, and, you know, last night I went to see a concert
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:48.680]   in San Jose, I went to see the Pentatonix,
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:50.160]   which is an acapella group.
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.000]   - Yeah.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.320]   - That really screwed you up.
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.680]   (laughing)
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:56.240]   Don't put that in your, you're gonna get
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:58.520]   a very different collection all of us.
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:03.520]   - So, you know, I love music from a lot of different genres.
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:08.440]   You know, I have a big classical music collection.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.960]   I, you know, I love it all.
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:15.160]   But in Apple Music and in Pandora and Spotify,
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:19.080]   there are certain things that I prioritize over others.
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:22.040]   And most of that is gonna be for driving or for working
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:24.040]   or when I go for my walk, you know,
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:27.960]   I want some hard rocks, some ACDCs, some, you know,
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.360]   Metallica, things like that.
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.720]   That's mostly what I have.
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:35.440]   And when those things learn from what I love
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:38.840]   and can distinguish my dislikes,
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.640]   then I think it's working great.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:45.120]   Apple is doing a much better job of that recently.
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:46.120]   There's still problems.
[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:48.880]   And, you know, I assume that they're working on them.
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:52.120]   I hope that they get the iTunes match things worked out.
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:54.840]   - One of the challenges is not only, you know,
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.160]   is it hard to figure out what somebody,
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:59.640]   what to recommend based on what somebody's listening to,
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:01.360]   but there are different kinds of listeners.
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:03.360]   You're a very serious music listener,
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:06.360]   musician yourself with very strong tastes.
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.920]   I would guess that, you know, while wanting to please
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:11.160]   that group, that's a small group compared to the mass
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:13.480]   of people who are more like me, who just say,
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:15.440]   you know, give me a playlist of stuff that is good
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:17.080]   and I like it.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:19.880]   I don't really know what I want.
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:22.880]   And they have to, it has to work for them too.
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:25.080]   And the reason I've been thinking more about this is
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:28.000]   because of this Amazon, new Amazon music system,
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.240]   which doesn't have any of that information
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:32.360]   'cause I'm a new subscriber
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:35.640]   and Amazon hasn't really been doing this for very long.
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.200]   And I notice, you know, it's a different,
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.400]   I'm getting different stuff back.
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:41.600]   Amazon said when they created this
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:45.760]   that the number one Amazon Echo command was,
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:47.320]   I want to listen to some music,
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:49.720]   not a playlist, not a particular band,
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:52.800]   it just play me some music.
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:55.400]   And when I read that, I started asking for that.
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.840]   And it's clearly basing its play,
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:59.840]   it says, here's something you might like.
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.920]   And then this morning, Bruce Springsteen Radio,
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:04.640]   clearly basing that on something I'd listened to in the past.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.720]   And then it did a fairly decent job
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:09.440]   with some eclectic stuff, but mostly, you know,
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:12.240]   very mainstream hits, not just from Springsteen,
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:13.320]   but related bands.
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:16.200]   It was a lot like what you'd get from Pandora.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.040]   I didn't listen to it.
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:19.720]   That's the other thing, Pandora, it generates over time.
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:21.400]   And I'm not sure, I didn't listen to it long enough
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.080]   to actually see it 'cause as it starts to stretch,
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.680]   for instance, Pandora almost always throws
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.320]   a Beatles song in there eventually.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:31.720]   It just, it's just a matter of listening long enough.
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:32.560]   (laughing)
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:34.360]   And you will get a Beatles song.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.760]   So it's, and of course, the other thing
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:39.480]   that a lot of these systems have trouble
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:40.520]   with is classical music.
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:44.160]   I like to listen to various genres of classical music
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:47.440]   and that they, almost, I've never had,
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.200]   I've never said play me some music
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:52.520]   or listen to Discover Weekly and gotten any classical music.
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.080]   And yet I listen to a lot of classical music
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:54.920]   and those services.
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:57.360]   So they're clearly ignoring that completely.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:01.000]   - I think a lot of it is how you actually interact
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.760]   with the service and with particular songs.
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:08.760]   So I am very, I will like and dislike songs as I hear them.
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:17.280]   - Pandora. - And you have to actively curate it.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.160]   - Yeah, yeah. - Right.
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:23.160]   So these services are looking to you as a listener
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:26.560]   to help them create better music for you.
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:31.560]   And I'm very staunch supporter of going through
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:38.120]   and liking songs and I do it all the time
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:40.380]   no matter what service I'm using.
[01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:45.240]   So, and that gives me in my, for instance,
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:47.320]   in my favorites list, which is something
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:49.440]   that comes out in Apple Music every week.
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:52.120]   I think it's updated on Wednesdays.
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:56.080]   My favorites list includes some black Sabbath.
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:58.440]   It includes Beatles.
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:02.680]   It includes stuff like the weight from the band.
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:05.880]   It includes all of "Cat Stevens".
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:09.440]   My list is so good as a playlist.
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.320]   I can be rolling down the street
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:13.680]   and listening to "Cat Stevens" and the next song
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:16.080]   is from "The Talicut" and the next song is from "The Beatles"
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:19.120]   and then "Aussie" and it's just this great list.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.040]   - Does it do that though?
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:21.640]   Does Apple is smart enough to say,
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:24.480]   "Oh, wow, I'm gonna make a list like that."
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:26.840]   - Yes, yeah, it does. - That's pretty impressive.
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:29.040]   - Yeah, they have two lists that came out
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.280]   maybe a month or so ago.
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:34.760]   One is called "The New Music Playlist"
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:38.200]   which is based on songs that you have,
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:39.920]   these are all new songs,
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.840]   but it's based on your listening habits.
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.760]   - Boy, that's great. - So, things that you love.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:46.760]   If you love a whole bunch of metal,
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:49.480]   it's gonna give you a whole bunch of new metal.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:51.480]   If you like pop, it'll give you a bunch of new pop.
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.960]   - But it's not gonna mix some "Cat Stevens" in there.
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:57.640]   - No, but then they have another one, another playlist.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:58.920]   That's just for new music,
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:03.200]   but then it has another playlist called "Your Favorites"
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:07.440]   and it will recommend songs that are your favorite songs
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:10.240]   or bands that you have loved.
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:15.240]   So mine is like old hard rock, classic rock type stuff.
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:17.480]   There's a lot of that in there
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.640]   and they nail that playlist every week.
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:20.640]   - Oh, that's cool.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:21.640]   - It is really good.
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:22.480]   I just go through it. - It's to me,
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:23.560]   that's what I'm looking for.
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:25.400]   - Right, and I just press play.
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:29.120]   And there are 30 songs in that list.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.800]   And I just press play and it just goes through these songs
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:33.320]   and I love every one of them.
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:35.760]   So when I'm out in a walk,
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:39.280]   I have every song one after another
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.640]   that's just really, really good.
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:43.720]   - That's what makes these music services sticky.
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:45.560]   Otherwise, they're completely commoditized.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:47.640]   But when you have an experience like that,
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:50.040]   you're gonna stick with that service a lot longer.
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:52.320]   - I agree. - Yeah, that's a big deal.
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:54.000]   Now Reverb Mike and her chatmen saying,
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.880]   oh, I would never let a machine make a list.
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:57.160]   I make my own list.
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:58.400]   - You can do it.
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.920]   - But make, you know, you always do that with any service.
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:03.480]   I think the real key of any of these services
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:05.560]   is that it's a lot of work to make your own playlist
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:06.880]   and most people aren't gonna do that.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:10.200]   And the days of me making a mix tape
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:12.920]   are long, long gone.
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:14.400]   Are long gone.
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.000]   - No, he does do it. - Oh, but you missed it, don't you?
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000]   - I loved doing it.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.760]   I mean, I read that was one of, that's exactly right.
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:20.760]   And you can do it.
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:23.840]   I have done that with Spotify, I've made a playlist.
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:25.760]   Andy, you made a great playlist years ago
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:28.520]   when Spotify first came to the United States
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:30.320]   of the one song playlist,
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.600]   which I still listen to all this time.
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:35.960]   - Well, I mean, I'm totally with Jim here.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:38.960]   I mean, there's times where I want to explore,
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.920]   there are times where I want to try things
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:41.960]   I've never tried before.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:45.000]   But a lot of us, I think more of us than
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.120]   Apple or anybody else would suspect,
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.880]   we have at least these two playlists
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:50.480]   that we've been curating.
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:53.560]   Since we've had a hard drive based player.
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.960]   And even those started with,
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:58.720]   again, the awesome mix tape that we used to have in our cars.
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:02.840]   And by now, two playlists,
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:05.600]   they're the constitute most of my listening
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:08.760]   and it's peppy music and it's peaceful music
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.440]   was the two names of playlists.
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:13.360]   And a feature that would get my heart immediately
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:14.640]   is if I could just simply say,
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:15.880]   okay, here's the peppy playlist.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:18.240]   It has 312 songs in it.
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:20.000]   And they say, okay, Apple music,
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.840]   please up this to 350 and find 38 songs
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:27.440]   based on this playlist that you think fit
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.600]   with the sort of person who likes this music
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:33.720]   and label them clearly so that they don't get mixed in
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:34.800]   with everything else I have.
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:37.880]   But let me guide you with this experience.
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:39.920]   I've heard the ones that keep passing the test
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:41.440]   year after year after year.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:44.160]   This is one of the reasons why I have so much respect
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:46.160]   for the people who the team,
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.680]   they're working on Apple music or any other music service
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:53.280]   because no two people enjoy and explore music the same way.
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:54.920]   And then even if you have figured out
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:56.680]   how this person listens to music,
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:59.120]   figuring out what they're gonna like next.
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:02.680]   There's no way to get someone to wet their pants more
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:04.040]   than simply saying, hey,
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.720]   but recommend me an album.
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:07.080]   Like, oh my God.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.960]   I have a big enough problem where I'm doing a review
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:15.680]   of Plex and I wish I were not worried about,
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:18.040]   if I screenshot this right now,
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:20.240]   what conclusions are people going to draw
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:21.440]   about my music taste?
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:24.240]   I need to make sure it's aimed at a cool album
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:26.480]   with another cool playlist in the back of it.
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:28.240]   That's how deep the problem is.
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.800]   If you wanna get, if you want me to wet my pants,
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:34.600]   you put in a acoustic cover of a song
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:36.000]   I haven't heard before.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.200]   Give me Richard Thompson doing Britney Spears,
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:43.120]   hit me baby one more time and I acoustic.
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:46.120]   And then pants wet.
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:49.000]   This is the ad for the all new Apple Music Apple.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.800]   Clearly, and then pants wet.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.400]   And then pants wet please.
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:56.280]   Clearly, Apple understands that it needs
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:57.200]   to win people over.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:59.920]   This is what the new ad that just came out
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:03.400]   is pitching people on with Apple Music today.
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:07.280]   So there's an iPhone, you're launching the library.
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:09.760]   All your music, oh that's interesting.
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:11.760]   Your music as opposed to our music.
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.340]   (upbeat music)
[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:20.400]   And then the music you love now, this is their,
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:23.640]   so this is this they got from Beats, their selection
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:27.520]   of your favorite genres, which I think is way too,
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:29.640]   of course, too useful.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:31.620]   Music you'll love next, there you go.
[01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:36.360]   By the way, that's huge for the music industry, isn't it?
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:40.320]   The music industry is interested in getting you
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:43.240]   to hear new and hear and ultimately buy new music.
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:45.280]   That's catalogs important.
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:48.720]   But if this is gonna replace radio,
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:50.680]   it needs to be discovery tool as well.
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:55.280]   They're pushing the new music here and here first.
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:30:00.560]   Find your favorite station, live or on demand.
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:01.480]   There's Zane.
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:05.480]   Still pushing Beats 1, which shows
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:07.840]   the best artists and DJs.
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:08.760]   How important is that?
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:10.680]   That's something that's unique to Apple Music
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:13.400]   is this live radio component.
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:17.000]   It's not important to me, not to me either.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.840]   I never listen to Beats 1.
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.840]   No, but it's 'cause it never plays music I want.
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:22.000]   It's very close to the actors.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.280]   Exactly, yeah.
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:25.680]   But that's the whole point of Apple Music.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:28.080]   They have to make sure that they wanna make sure
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:31.440]   that you never leave the Apple logo for anything.
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:33.000]   So they have to make a music service
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.480]   that's going to be a good music player and organizer
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:38.360]   and playlist maker for the music that you own.
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:41.160]   A really good music store for the stuff you wanna buy.
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:43.960]   A really good Spotify type thing for subscription service.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:45.680]   A really good Pandora type service
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:47.440]   for I'm just gonna give you a starting point
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.080]   and keep playing stuff that I want.
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:53.160]   And then even for people who are using a satellite radio
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.880]   where I don't really have any sort of attachment,
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:59.600]   emotional or monetary to any one style or artist,
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.160]   I just like to have some music playing
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:04.000]   while I cook or while I clean or while I fix this car.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.240]   So they couldn't have rolled out just one part of this.
[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:09.320]   They really had to have a solution for everybody
[01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:13.080]   if they wanna make sure that they're not only get the people
[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:15.280]   for their first free trial, but they keep them
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:16.560]   after the free trial.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:19.320]   Convince them that they don't have to go to the iTunes store
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:21.800]   to the App Store to download any other music app
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:24.600]   because hey, our own music app comes pre-installed
[01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:27.560]   and it has everything you could ever want a music player to do.
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:30.560]   Once people choose, how often is there an opportunity
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:32.000]   to steal them away?
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.480]   I mean, once people say I'm a Spotify person,
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.960]   is there an opportunity at some point for Apple
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:41.960]   or Amazon or Google to steal them away?
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:42.800]   Or is that it?
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:43.640]   Is it done?
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:47.000]   - I don't think it starts to catch on fire
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.280]   in people's pockets.
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:49.880]   That's an opportunity.
[01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:51.200]   - Well, think about toothpaste.
[01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:55.640]   If you decide, if you say I'm a cold gate guy,
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:56.480]   that's it.
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:58.040]   There's not gonna be an opportunity.
[01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:00.400]   Like you're right, unless there's a rat in your toothpaste,
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.680]   there's no opportunity to steal you away.
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:04.800]   That's done your rest of your life, right?
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:06.000]   Brands know this, by the way.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000]   That's why they try to get you young.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.120]   Is there still an opportunity?
[01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:13.120]   - I have to accuse myself from this discussion.
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:13.960]   - Why is that?
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:16.120]   - I is a big nerd ranch client.
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:17.120]   We love them.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:18.520]   - I love Spotify.
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:19.600]   Yeah.
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:20.760]   - I have a whole bunch of friends.
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:22.160]   They have a whole bunch of playlists
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:24.240]   and I let them curate for me.
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:27.600]   - I'll tell you what happened to me that put me in play.
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:28.440]   - Oh.
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:33.400]   - I am in play because I was buying Spotify through Apple
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:36.000]   and paying 30% more.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.560]   And I said, this is ridiculous.
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:39.960]   Why am I doing this?
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:42.680]   You know, paying 11 bucks or whatever it was
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:45.480]   instead of, you know, I'm paying three bucks more a month.
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:49.800]   So I canceled it 'cause the only way you can fix that,
[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:52.120]   by the way, is to cancel it on iTunes,
[01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:54.440]   wait till it expires.
[01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:56.280]   Now you're on the free tier,
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:58.560]   then go to Spotify on the web and subscribe.
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.160]   Haven't done that part yet.
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:02.520]   So I'm in play all of a sudden.
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.560]   And then the Amazon Echo came and I thought,
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:05.480]   you know, the new Amazon,
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.960]   he's like, well, let's try that.
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:09.720]   But it was such a deal I bought a year's worth.
[01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:11.200]   So maybe I'm not in play.
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:12.040]   - Yeah.
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:13.880]   - Maybe Spotify lost me.
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:15.880]   - It's weird.
[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:18.360]   Like it's such a, again, complicated calculus.
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:19.960]   Just last week, a friend of mine on Twitter
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:21.520]   was asking me about what the trends,
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:26.000]   what it was like to put all your music on Amazon music
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.600]   because he had the exact same experience that I did
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:31.360]   after I released "Folom Love with the Amazon Echo."
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:36.360]   After Amazon, I realized that for $25 a year,
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:38.000]   Amazon would give me something like,
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.320]   something like a quarter of a million attracts of storage.
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:44.640]   And after about a day and a half of just uploading,
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:46.760]   uploading, just dragging something into the music app
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:48.440]   and uploading, uploading, uploading,
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:51.440]   suddenly Echo could play any album I wanted
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:53.600]   from anywhere in the house just by my barking up,
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.160]   what I'm sort of in the mood for right now.
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:56.720]   And that doesn't mean that I've switched over
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:58.280]   to Amazon music.
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:02.040]   I'm still using Plex as my main store,
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:04.120]   main local storage.
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:08.680]   I'm still using Google music as my subscription music service.
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:11.480]   But the fact that I bought this box
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:13.400]   that does cool things when I talk at it,
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:15.280]   made me buy $25 service.
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.720]   Actually, I was just, I was just,
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:19.920]   you wanna talk about how complicated things have gotten.
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:22.160]   This is how I buy most of my music these days.
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:23.000]   - What?
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:23.840]   That's a CD.
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:25.040]   Are you crazy?
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:27.560]   - Okay, but this is, this is, no, even better.
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.000]   This is a used CD.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.520]   - Ah, smart man.
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:32.040]   - Three or four dollars.
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:35.640]   It's also, I refer to it as an installation disc.
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:40.200]   This is a CD, a CD ROM that contains the installation files
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:44.160]   for this album so that I can get it in a lossless,
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:47.240]   unencrypted, on DRM format that I then put this
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:49.800]   into storage 'cause that's where I put it into the server.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:53.600]   And I did it because unfortunately, Google music
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.560]   and these other music services got me interested
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:57.240]   in listening to whole albums now.
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:59.880]   So now I like to buy whole albums, number one.
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:01.680]   But number two, now I don't really wanna,
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:03.280]   I can't buy as much music as I want
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:06.840]   if I'm gonna be spending $12, $13, $14 for the whole thing.
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:09.720]   So I've worked rather by secondhand
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:12.400]   and now I'm buying it in a form where they've already,
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.280]   the artists have already taken their cut,
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:16.440]   they've already gotten their profit from it.
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:19.120]   And the kicker is, why am I suddenly re-buying
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:20.680]   a whole bunch of talking, there's another one
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:22.600]   like on my doorstep right now.
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:24.640]   Why am I buying more talking headz albums
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:27.200]   because documentary now did a parody
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.920]   of the stop making sense movie documentary.
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:31.880]   - The big suit movie, yeah.
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:34.920]   - And it reminded me that I only have two talking heads
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:38.160]   albums in my library and I'm finally replacing stuff
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:42.000]   that I owned on cassette when I was in college and stuff.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.120]   - For those of you listening and not watching,
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:46.800]   that is true stories by talking heads, he's holding up.
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:49.880]   - True stories by talking, I also have these stop making
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:51.800]   sense album, the one with the--
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:54.360]   - You know, I bought that movie because the movie's fascinating
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:57.760]   because I didn't realize it 'til I read David Byrne's book.
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:00.440]   It starts with an empty stage.
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:01.280]   - Yeah.
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:03.880]   - And then he comes out and then they slowly add
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:06.520]   through the show all the pieces of the band.
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:09.480]   It's really, I'd seen him before and I don't know why
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:11.840]   I didn't notice that before, but once I read that
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:15.360]   in the book and he talks in the book about why he did that,
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:18.200]   what he, you know, what was, and then you really appreciate it.
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:22.080]   And by the end he's in a suit that's 18 sizes too big
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:23.840]   for reasons no one understands.
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:25.200]   (laughing)
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:27.440]   - He's a great one. - He went to RISD.
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:29.960]   He went to RISD, that's all he needed to know.
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:32.200]   As performance art decided to become a musician
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:33.460]   as a commentary artist. - I'm stupid to
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:34.360]   yeah.
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:35.840]   Highly recommend that movie.
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:40.560]   So okay, well you recused yourself on the music thing,
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:44.200]   so I won't ask you what you use Aaron Heligas
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:47.320]   of Big Nerd Ranch, we'll just, we'll just,
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:48.160]   well no.
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:50.560]   - I love, you know what, I love Spotify and I'm,
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:53.520]   you know what I'm missing is the Discovery Weekly playlist,
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.440]   that's what I'm missing most of all.
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:59.320]   So it's always gonna be, you know,
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.440]   it's always gonna be about those,
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:03.840]   the serendipity of discovering great new music
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:06.440]   and the playlists I can ask for, 'cause I,
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.280]   in fact when I get the Pixel phone,
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:10.200]   I'll probably end up using Google Music more,
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:11.840]   Apple Music on the iPhone, right?
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:14.440]   I mean it seems like even the platform has--
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:15.880]   - You can use Apple Music on the iPhone,
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:18.120]   you can use Apple Music on Android of course.
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:19.680]   - You can use it on anything and you can use Google Music
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:20.520]   on anything. - Right.
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:23.640]   - And you can use Amazon Music on anything by the way.
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:25.760]   Although it works so nice, the platform seems
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:27.040]   to determine a little bit, you know,
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:29.200]   the reason you use Apple Music is 'cause Siri knows
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:30.040]   Apple Music, right?
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:31.880]   It speaks to Apple Music.
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:34.400]   The reason you might use Google Music,
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:35.800]   actually I don't think that on the Pixel
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:37.480]   it's gonna matter that much, I think the Pixel
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:39.680]   will be agnostic.
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:42.160]   - It shouldn't, but that is a big deal.
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:45.080]   Like the one problem that I was having
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:47.840]   in acquiring media was, I cut the,
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:51.280]   I did my cable cut early in the summer
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:55.160]   and I decided that rather than reinstate certain channels,
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:57.760]   'cause there are a couple of shows that I like,
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:59.360]   like the new season of Gold Rush,
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:01.640]   the new season of Project Runway.
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:04.240]   And I've decided that, okay, I'm just gonna buy the season
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:05.560]   'cause it'll still come up way ahead
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:09.160]   even if I'm paying $30 to own the season in HD.
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:11.480]   But then there comes a question of what format
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:15.040]   am I gonna buy it in to make sure that I can play it
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:17.440]   on Apple TV, I can play it on the Android TV,
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:20.360]   on the Roku, on my phone, on my tablet.
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:23.160]   And I finally, I'm not terribly happy
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:26.560]   that I'm buying stuff from Google Play Music,
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:28.040]   excuse me, the Google Play Store.
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:30.000]   But the only reason why I'm doing that really
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.920]   is because the YouTube app will play all that
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:35.520]   DRM content and that's the one thing that
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:38.000]   if you are going to tell your customers that
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.000]   with, it costs $5, it supports 8K at 60 frames per second
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.600]   and it comes with 10 free years of HBO,
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:49.080]   you just don't want them to know that there is no YouTube app
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.200]   for it because they're not gonna buy it,
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:52.040]   there's no YouTube app.
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:54.960]   That's the one constant across every single platform.
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:57.640]   And that's the only reason now why I have given
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:00.840]   the Play Store now $60 of my money for these two seasons
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:03.120]   because I need the app, I need to be able
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:04.400]   to play it on different platforms.
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:06.720]   If I were 100% committed to Apple,
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:08.680]   I would feel exactly the opposite way.
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:10.080]   I would say, well, I'm gonna obviously buy stuff
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:12.320]   from iTunes because it'll sync automatically
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:13.400]   to everything I have.
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:16.520]   Unlike the YouTube app, I can actually copy it
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:19.640]   onto the local file, local device storage,
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:22.680]   we're asked with YouTube, I can only ever stream it.
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:24.560]   It's gonna be more and more complicated
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:26.880]   until there's a great flood, a great cataclysm
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:29.160]   and there's only one survivor at which point
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:30.880]   they will charge 30% for everything.
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:33.640]   - You can't win though, Andy, because I got a 4K TV,
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:38.280]   a UHD TV, and so I bought good fellows and iTunes,
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:43.280]   but of course, the Apple TV doesn't play back in UHD or 4K.
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:48.240]   So I just rebotted on Voodoo, and that's the problem
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:51.160]   is something's gonna come along, it's just not,
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:53.440]   digital issues.
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:56.600]   I think you're smart to buy CDs, and I like the U's
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:58.440]   'cause everybody's getting rid of their CDs,
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:39:59.880]   so you probably get anything you want,
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:01.200]   U's, that's brilliant.
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:04.800]   - Right, I've never been able to not find the CD I wanted
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:07.160]   for no more than $4.
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:09.160]   And I do the same thing with movies.
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:14.160]   The last movies, I don't know what word it is
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:18.880]   that I can use that will make this completely legal.
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:22.080]   But I feel as though I have the right to transcode this.
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:24.840]   - You bought it, you can transcode it, buddy.
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:25.920]   - I can transcode it, right.
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:28.200]   So now if there's something that I want to keep
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:30.440]   for my library, I can't buy four copies of it.
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.320]   I really can't spend a, there are very few movies
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:34.920]   I'm willing to spend $100 for just to have one copy
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:37.160]   that I can watch on the screen that I'm looking at,
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:38.880]   so I will buy it on Blu-ray,
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:41.760]   and then I will use an app that I've paid money for
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:44.720]   to convert it to an MP4, and then I'll put it on the server
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:46.680]   that will let me play it wherever I want.
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:49.920]   And if I could spend $5 to get that,
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:53.080]   just to give it right to the studios to get that power,
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:53.920]   I would do it.
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:58.400]   If I could pay twice as much for an unlocked digital download,
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:00.040]   I would give you twice as much money
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:01.880]   for an unlocked digital download.
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:04.400]   I would want to give these people my money,
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:06.320]   but if you're not gonna take it,
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:08.840]   and you're not gonna give me a solution that I can use,
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:11.840]   I'm gonna pay money for,
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:13.480]   I'm gonna make sure that I've paid you for this
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:14.520]   in some way, shape, or form,
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:16.560]   but then I've got to get a solution that works for me.
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:17.920]   - That's fair, I don't,
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:19.920]   I mean, I suppose it's technically illegal,
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:22.720]   but there's nobody in the world that would complain
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:25.320]   about you making digital backup copies
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:26.640]   of your physical media.
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:31.000]   - They've been arguing about that back and forth.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.040]   That is one, for instance,
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:35.840]   a lot of this comes down to maintaining legacy stuff.
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:40.120]   For instance, when cable companies wanted to switch
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:41.760]   to digital transport,
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:47.240]   I think it was the FCC had to broker a deal with them
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:50.480]   where they said that because not everybody can afford
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:54.520]   DVR features, because not everybody can afford cable TV,
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:57.320]   you have to still have some sort of provision
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:01.560]   so that people can time shift programming
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:03.080]   without having to pay extra money for it,
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:04.960]   because the Sony case basically said
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:06.440]   it's basically a fundamental right,
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:08.440]   if I want to record it at one time
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.720]   and then watch it another time, that's my prerogative,
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:12.800]   if I want to record it and then keep it forever,
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:13.680]   that's my prerogative,
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:15.200]   as long as I keep control of the copy.
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:17.520]   That's why there are these mystery ports
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:21.600]   on the back of a lot of digital tuner boxes and DVRs
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:24.840]   that you don't know it, but you can plug in a USB 3 cable,
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:26.800]   or you can plug in a network cable
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:30.600]   or a firewire cable,
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:32.400]   and be able to watch this stuff
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:35.400]   without necessarily having to subscribe to a DVR plan
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:39.280]   or without necessarily having to buy or rent a set-top box
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:40.440]   in order to make it happen.
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:43.240]   So that's why there are arguments to that effect
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:45.360]   that said that all you're doing are hopping it
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.720]   from one format to another,
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:48.400]   which is a right that you seem to have
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:50.560]   when you are ripping a CD,
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:53.920]   but there's been more expensive arguments
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:56.400]   about the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:58.440]   protecting the copyright holder's rights
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:01.880]   to not have their copy protected stuff copied
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:03.360]   than the right of the consumer
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:07.520]   to be able to convert their VHS cassettes
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:09.600]   to DVD or streaming.
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:14.880]   - Ah, let's see, it is October, what is this?
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:18.520]   17th?
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:19.520]   - 18th. - 18th.
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:22.200]   We're getting to the end of the month.
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:23.720]   Jim, is Apple gonna do an event?
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:25.000]   Have you received an invitation?
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.320]   What's going on?
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:27.200]   - There's still time.
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:29.160]   It's not the 31st yet.
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:31.560]   I'm not dressed up in my Halloween costume.
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:36.560]   - Well, I am, but what is your best guess is to win?
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:40.440]   I presume we all agree Apple's got to have an event this month.
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:45.440]   - Well, that's the thought anyway,
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:49.760]   is that they're gonna do something this month,
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:51.920]   whether that's an event or...
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:53.200]   - Wouldn't be iPads, right?
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:56.200]   That's moved now to the spring, the iPad updates.
[01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:02.000]   - Yeah, I don't think it would be iPads myself.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.720]   - Yeah, so we're looking,
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:07.240]   what I'm really looking for is a new MacBook.
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:08.480]   My daughter, oh, I feel so bad.
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:10.240]   My daughter's in Mexico,
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:14.200]   called me last night, her MacBook Pro was stolen.
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:15.400]   So...
[01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:18.600]   - And I said, "Honey, you can't buy a new MacBook Pro right now.
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:20.560]   You must not."
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:23.640]   But she needs one, she's in college, she's in school.
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:25.940]   So what I did, don't hate me.
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:29.440]   Don't hate the player, hate the game.
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:31.800]   I said, "Go down and buy a Chromebook,"
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:35.040]   which she did for $179.
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:36.280]   It's doing everything she wants.
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:39.280]   She's frankly happy it's got a Spanish language keyboard on it.
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:41.840]   And I said, "And then when you come home,
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:44.160]   "and the new MacBooks are out, we'll get you a new MacBook."
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:45.280]   But we're in that period now
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:49.400]   where you don't wanna buy a MacBook or any Mac, right?
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:52.720]   - Well, I would agree with that right now, yeah.
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:56.520]   I mean, I think we, in September,
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:59.040]   I think we all agreed that,
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:02.200]   you know, Macs were coming sometime
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:03.880]   before the end of the year.
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:08.880]   It would make sense that they would have to have them out
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:13.240]   before the Black Friday shopping.
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:14.080]   - Okay.
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:15.960]   - That's from November.
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:17.920]   - That's November.
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:20.400]   But typically they announce something
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:24.280]   and then it takes a week or two to get it into stores.
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:28.520]   So time keeps on slipping.
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:31.760]   Time's slipping, but there is still time.
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:33.840]   - So my mother needed a new iMac.
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:36.360]   And I said, "Oh, a new one's about to come out.
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:37.480]   "Just wait, wait, wait."
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:39.480]   And that was a year and a half ago.
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:40.800]   (laughing)
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:42.120]   - Do you like that?
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:43.400]   My mother.
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:44.240]   She's suffering.
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:47.680]   - I gotta stop messing with your mother, man.
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:48.760]   That's not cool.
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:51.280]   I mentioned that my iMac died while I was on vacation,
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:54.960]   my 2012 iMac, but I don't know if I've given you the update.
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:56.560]   It turns out there was a recall.
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:59.000]   It was one of those with the three terabyte fusion drives.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.240]   There was a recall.
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:02.800]   We brought it to the Mac store.
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:05.840]   They replaced it overnight and no charge.
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:06.680]   - Wow.
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:09.280]   - Four year old iMac, but they had a recall.
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:10.240]   It was a bad hard drive.
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:15.240]   So we have now an iMac sitting on a table waiting for a home.
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:19.720]   New Mac book pros still coming this month
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:22.920]   according to nine to five Mac.
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:26.600]   Actually, they're quoting Maco Takara,
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:32.320]   which I would guess is a Japanese Mac magazine.
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:33.800]   I don't know.
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:35.640]   They cite a reliable Chinese supplier,
[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:38.000]   Apple plans to announce the new Mac book pro this week
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.120]   as well as ship it to retailers.
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:42.520]   This would be the one with USB-C.
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:45.080]   They say it will not have a MagSafe.
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:47.600]   That's one of the things we've been wondering
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:50.440]   is if the USB-C would be the charging port
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:54.240]   as it is on the Mac book or if they'd still have a MagSafe.
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:56.640]   Also, of course, rumored that the MacBook Air
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:59.720]   would be gone Thunderbolt three on the USB-C port
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:01.640]   would make a lot of sense.
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:03.680]   I still want to see an SD card reader in there.
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:05.160]   I hate carrying card readers with me.
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:08.560]   That's one of the reasons I like having a MacBook Pro,
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:09.960]   but I know my vote doesn't count.
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:10.800]   So.
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:14.000]   - Open your heart, Leo, and let the dongle in.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.200]   (laughing)
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:17.320]   The dongle has a lovely plan for your life.
[01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:21.240]   - As well, I'm all dongled up now with the iPhone 7.
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:25.040]   Also an OLED touch bar, OLED touch bar with a new Mac
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:26.840]   which sounds nice as well as the new design.
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:28.240]   Anyway, I hope they do this soon.
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:31.760]   I'll just watch for your tweet, Jim.
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:32.600]   - All right.
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:33.520]   (laughing)
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:34.640]   - I'm waiting for the tweet.
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:37.480]   That you got the invite.
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:39.640]   So let's, before we take a break,
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:41.320]   I want to give Aaron a chance
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:43.600]   'cause Evan came in just for this to get an update
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:47.200]   on the state of Swift, Swift three, we liking it?
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:49.680]   - Oh yeah, Swift three is great for everyone
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:51.680]   except people who write Swift books.
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:53.000]   (laughing)
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.920]   Is it that different?
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:56.880]   - No, it's not fundamentally different.
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:59.720]   It's very much the same, but they tidied up a lot of things.
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:03.120]   So the community submitted over 100,
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:05.720]   proposed how we could make Swift better.
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:07.680]   About 70 of those were modified
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:09.480]   and eventually adopted into the language.
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:10.320]   - That's a lot.
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:12.480]   - So a lot of the dirty corners are tidied up.
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:15.160]   And then Apple went back and changed a lot of the APIs
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:18.360]   to be consistent and clear and less verbose
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:20.880]   just for less typing.
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:22.560]   And so really it is a good thing.
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:26.800]   It's just frustrating to me that I have these two fine books.
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:28.440]   - Yeah. (laughing)
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:31.240]   - And everyone is now saying,
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:33.000]   the code doesn't actually compile anymore.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.240]   - Oh no, is it that different?
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:35.080]   Really?
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:36.840]   It's not downward or backward compatible?
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:39.360]   - Like they changed the APIs on array, for example.
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:42.960]   So some very fundamental things are just different.
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:45.160]   So we will have new versions of the books out
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:48.440]   about the new, in time for the new year is our goal.
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:50.880]   - There you go.
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:52.280]   Well, I look forward to that.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:53.520]   And more and more people, you know,
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:55.560]   I was talking to Evan who is an iOS developer
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:57.040]   who loves Swift.
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:48:59.760]   My general sense about Swift is that
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:01.840]   the people who are switching over to it really like it.
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:06.800]   The new iOS 10 has that great Swift playground
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:09.000]   on it on the iPad.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.200]   - Yeah, Swift is a really nice language.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:13.360]   They stole a lot of ideas from other languages
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:14.600]   that were really neat.
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:16.240]   They didn't go too far out on a limb
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:18.360]   and trying to solve all the concurrency problems
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:21.000]   that something like Elixir is trying to solve.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.320]   And now they've open sourced it.
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:24.640]   So you're starting to see Swift on the server.
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:27.480]   Like IBM has their Katura project.
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:28.640]   - That's really a cool one.
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:29.480]   - Yeah. - It's called like Goats.
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:31.760]   - Yeah. - And it's using Swift instead.
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:32.720]   I think it's pretty slick.
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:35.280]   It's an exciting time to be a Swift developer.
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:36.120]   - Yeah.
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:40.200]   The Swift sandbox is at swiftlang.ng.blumac.
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:45.200]   It's IBM's kind of, it's version three, by the way,
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:49.040]   IBM's online Swift.
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:52.240]   Is it, it's not a REPL.
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:54.240]   It's more like an IDE, right?
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:56.080]   - Yeah, but if you have an iPad,
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:58.920]   you'll just wanna use Swift playgrounds on the iPad.
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:00.840]   That's a nice way to get started.
[01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:02.840]   But honestly, if your code is gonna wanna keyboard
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:05.000]   and everything, you might as well just get Xcode.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.560]   - Yeah, Xcode 8.
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:08.240]   - And our book. - And the book.
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:09.320]   - They should be a bundle.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:11.520]   Oh, Xcode's free. - Xcode's free.
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:12.360]   (laughing)
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:13.200]   You can think of it as a bundle.
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:15.200]   - How is it on cross platform?
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:18.680]   Are you seeing adoption on other non-Mac platforms?
[01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:21.280]   - Yeah, I think we're going to,
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:23.720]   you don't see a lot of things that have been deployed yet
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:26.480]   on Linux or-- - It's very competitive
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:27.800]   language-wise out there.
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:29.680]   You've got all these new languages.
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:34.680]   Google has Go, the folks at Mozilla now have Rust.
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:35.960]   - Rust? - Yeah.
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:38.680]   - It's really nice, Elixir is very nifty.
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:40.400]   There's a lot going on in the languages,
[01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:42.120]   especially on the server right now.
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:44.320]   - Yeah, it's very interesting.
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:45.160]   - Yeah.
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:47.360]   - Elixir is Erlang based, right?
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:49.680]   - That's right, it uses the same virtual machine
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:52.080]   that Erlang uses, but it's a friend of your syntax.
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:53.640]   It's a little more like Ruby.
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:56.240]   - Ah, I'll have to take a look at that.
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:57.560]   And that's fully cross platform,
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:50:58.680]   or is that Mac Focaster?
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:01.160]   - Yes, Elixir, it's a totally cross platform.
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:04.040]   - You know me, I never write anything,
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:06.240]   but I collect languages. (laughs)
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:07.400]   - This is one more pre-election.
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:09.880]   It's a pretty little-- - I'm always interested
[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:11.080]   in a new language.
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:13.720]   All right, let's take a break when we come back.
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:16.680]   Your picks of the week, folks, get 'em ready.
[01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:20.120]   From heavy metal to cowboy hats.
[01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:22.000]   But first, I wanna tell you, people are asking,
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.920]   where'd you get that spiffy tie?
[01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:26.560]   You know, I got it at Trunk Club.
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:28.040]   It's one of my Trunk Club purchases.
[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:29.200]   I love Trunk Club.
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:33.720]   No, most geeks are not shoppers.
[01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:35.720]   Well, I take it back, clothes shoppers.
[01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:38.520]   We all love going to the geek store,
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:41.680]   whether it's the hardware store or fries or apple or wherever.
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:45.640]   But shopping for clothes, maybe not such a great thing.
[01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:48.640]   And yet, you gotta, there's times
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:50.960]   when you need to dress nice, dress for the job you want.
[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:52.880]   Now, Jim Dower and Blurry has the job he wants,
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:56.760]   so Jim, you don't have to pay any attention to this ad.
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:58.920]   But for those of us who, you know, I like,
[01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:00.280]   and I got a job I already,
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:02.160]   I don't need to get a job anymore,
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:04.840]   but I like to get a little nanny once in a while.
[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:08.840]   Fall weather means not just pumpkin spice,
[01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:11.520]   but new clothes and layers.
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:14.240]   Maybe upgrade those sweaters, those hoodies.
[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:15.880]   Maybe a bomber jacket, a henley,
[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:18.280]   a stretch denim in your future.
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:21.440]   Before you find yourself trapped
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:24.400]   with your significant other in a store
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:28.520]   where you have to try things on Trunk Club.
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:30.080]   Trunk Club, you just type in your magic,
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:31.960]   go to trunkclub.com.
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:33.200]   Slash Mac break.
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:34.320]   You just type in your measurements,
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:36.840]   share your style and spending's preferences.
[01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:38.400]   Then they're gonna give you a stylist.
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:42.960]   Yes, a realized human who is better than your girlfriend
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:47.480]   will help you pick clothes that fit you.
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:51.400]   They will suggest items appropriate to the weather and to,
[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:53.680]   and I love my stylist.
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:57.000]   Leia just got, I mean, she's great.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.880]   From boots to ties to pants to jackets
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:03.920]   to shawl cardigans to flannel shirts.
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:07.280]   They'll select items for your trunk from over 80 top brands.
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:12.560]   You can preview it before you get it via email.
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:16.240]   Make edits say, I like that, don't like that, don't want this.
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:18.040]   Then your trunk arrives on your door.
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:20.120]   No, by the way, you've paid nothing at this point.
[01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:23.160]   Nothing, zero zip, not a zilch.
[01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:24.880]   You have five days to try on the clothes.
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:27.440]   Keep what you like, put the rest back in the trunk,
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:30.560]   send it back then and only then do you pay
[01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:32.840]   and you only pay for the stuff you keep.
[01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:36.240]   Never for shipping, never for the stuff you send back.
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:37.920]   And by the way, I should tell you trunk club
[01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:39.200]   is backed by Nordstrom.
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:41.200]   So you're getting great customer service,
[01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:43.520]   great quality, all the major brands.
[01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:46.040]   They even have trunk club club houses
[01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:48.160]   in major metros like Dallas, New York,
[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:51.360]   LA, Chicago, Charleston, Washington, DC.
[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:53.960]   So your, and your stylist is based in one of those.
[01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:57.040]   You can actually go to your trunk club,
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:00.080]   meet with your stylist and they have tailors too.
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:03.200]   So for me, this is good because I can go in there
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:06.680]   and they actually, I think what they also have
[01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:09.400]   itinerant people so you can go and get measured
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:11.240]   and get custom stuff too.
[01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:15.520]   Premium clothes, expert advice, no work, no cost to you.
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:18.720]   Here's, Leah just sent me, she knows I like bow ties.
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:21.360]   Look at she sent me, it's a mustache bow tie.
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:22.760]   I can't wait to wear that.
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:25.320]   And beautiful stuff, these are some of the things
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:26.800]   I kept for my most recent trunk.
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:29.400]   This is a beautiful soft knit polo shirt.
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:32.040]   I just love this.
[01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:34.080]   It's so much easier than going to the store.
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:36.360]   Premium clothes, expert advice, no work.
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:38.400]   trunkclub.com/macbreak
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:40.360]   and the best part is it's not a subscription.
[01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:41.880]   I wanna emphasize this.
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:45.320]   You pay nothing, your stylist will send you an email
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:47.480]   when the new season and the new stuff arrives.
[01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:49.560]   Leah just sent me an email and says,
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:50.760]   do you want me to do a trunk for you?
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:52.600]   And you say no, no problem.
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:55.640]   You say yes, you don't spend a penny
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:57.160]   except for the stuff you keep.
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:01.240]   trunkclub.com/macbreak
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:03.680]   for men or for women we should emphasize.
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:06.520]   And no, you can't get this fine chippo at the trunk club.
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:10.680]   They don't offer, they don't offer twit-shapos yet.
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:12.520]   But I'm wearing a trunk club sweater.
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:16.920]   Beautiful, I love this sweater, trunk club bow tie.
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:19.200]   I love my trunk club.
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:23.200]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:26.080]   Let's start with you, Aaron Hill, I guess.
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:27.520]   What do you got for us?
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:29.800]   - So you know, iMessage now has all these stickers
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:31.600]   and animated gifts built in.
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:32.440]   - Oh man.
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:33.280]   - For the new--
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:34.520]   - I mocked it, by the way,
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:37.560]   when they spend an hour talking about it, the keynote.
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:39.760]   And now I can't stop using it.
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:41.520]   - But the new hipster thing to do
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:43.520]   is to make your own animated gifts.
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:44.360]   - What?
[01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:45.720]   - It's a handy tool for this.
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:47.040]   If you have a little slice of video
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:49.120]   and you wanna make it get into an animated gift
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:51.680]   so that you can share it with your friends over messaging.
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:53.080]   - Yes.
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:54.080]   - Gift Rocket.
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:54.920]   - Gift Rocket.
[01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:57.000]   - When you bounce gift rocket if you're one of those people.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.280]   But I am a gift rocket.
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:00.600]   - I go back and forth to drive people crazy.
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:03.960]   - It's free in their beta, so it's giftrocket.com.
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:04.800]   - Oh.
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:07.080]   - It's super easy, you just drag your video onto the stop
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:09.360]   and it turns it into an animated gift.
[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:10.880]   - Oh, that's great.
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:13.040]   - People are very surprised when they see
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:14.800]   a personalized animated gift up here.
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:17.640]   - And it's made in a beautiful castle in Paris.
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:18.640]   - Yes.
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:21.200]   - By Michelle, or Michael, and Benjamin.
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:23.480]   - Good, I'm downloading it right now.
[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:24.320]   That's cool.
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:28.640]   G-I-F-R-O-C-K-E-T.com, giftrocket.com.
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:30.400]   Great pick.
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:31.520]   Coolio.
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:33.080]   Love the free.
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:34.200]   I'm gonna put the gift rocket,
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:36.000]   can I just put the icon on my desktop
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.560]   and then I'm ready to--
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:40.000]   - And then you're set at any moment to create a new animation.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.760]   - At any moment I can giftify.
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:43.080]   Thank you, Aaron.
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:44.680]   And by the way, let me put in a plug
[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:46.800]   for big nerd ranch.com.
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:50.400]   Onsite training, training at your site,
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:53.000]   books, anything you could imagine,
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.880]   but just go to big nerd ranch.com
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:57.040]   and you can see all the stuff there.
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:56:59.720]   - And we develop apps and websites for people.
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:00.560]   - Nice.
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:01.840]   You do it all.
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:02.920]   - We do.
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:05.640]   - I have been a fan and I keep saying,
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:08.680]   I know Alex Lindsey's gone and taken a class with you.
[01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:12.840]   I'm, this is the vacation of my dreams.
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:14.720]   - You guys make that happen.
[01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:17.720]   - I know, I keep going to Europe and crap.
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:19.920]   Go to Big Nerd Ranch.
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:21.520]   It's the vacation of my dreams
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:23.000]   or let the nerds come to you.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.080]   - I even screwed up Hello World, so
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:29.440]   you have to talk to me.
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:30.280]   - What?
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:31.120]   - I can save you.
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:32.440]   - So I could take a,
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:34.480]   a Swift course would be fun.
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:35.320]   - Yeah.
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:37.000]   - I know you have these great boot camp,
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:37.840]   which I think are great.
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:39.560]   And you do those not just in Atlanta,
[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:41.160]   but you also do them in California.
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:42.720]   So I don't have to go that far.
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:45.320]   Also back end web, UX design,
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:48.040]   front end web, iOS, Android.
[01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:49.480]   Oh, this is nice.
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:50.760]   And we can do it at corporate style.
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:51.720]   If you have a bunch of friends,
[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:53.160]   you want to get together and do a class,
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:55.720]   we'll send an instructor out to you.
[01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:58.520]   - Accelerated Coco, that's for me.
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:00.280]   - Desktop Coco, we're still doing it.
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:01.800]   - Why not?
[01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:02.720]   Right?
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:04.160]   - I think there's a lot of opportunity
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:05.720]   for new desktop Mac apps.
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:08.760]   I don't think of that as a dead platform at all.
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:11.320]   - Ruby on Rails, Python, advanced Python.
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:12.960]   I love Python.
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:14.640]   I don't know why I keep collecting languages
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:16.600]   when the greatest language ever has already been written,
[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:18.200]   but why not?
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:20.160]   Front end web courses.
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:21.000]   - If I'm going to do this,
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.520]   I want to start an advanced class.
[01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:26.720]   (laughing)
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:27.920]   - Just rename it advanced.
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:30.160]   (laughing)
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:33.720]   - Is this like the gym where like they mislabel
[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:35.560]   all the weights to be 50 pounds heavier
[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:36.400]   than they actually are,
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:38.880]   just to make you feel really good but you're so wrong?
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:39.720]   - That's exactly right.
[01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:42.080]   - I, hello world, fool is strong.
[01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:46.640]   - Hi, I'm here to take objective APL
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:48.400]   for defense programmers.
[01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:51.600]   And yes, the intro to Python is right over there.
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:53.680]   Just follow the kids in their backpacks.
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:55.000]   (laughing)
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.960]   - How's your tab key today?
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:58:59.120]   Jim Dow, oh by the way, I should ask you Aaron.
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:00.320]   Tabs are spaces.
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:02.960]   - Oh, I'm a spaces guy.
[01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:04.880]   - Mm.
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:06.920]   (laughing)
[01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:08.080]   - No, I am too.
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:09.760]   'Cause spaces renders the same everywhere.
[01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:10.600]   Tabs you don't know what you're--
[01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:11.440]   - That's exactly right.
[01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:13.080]   And who knows what someone has their tabs sent.
[01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:13.920]   - Right.
[01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:14.760]   - They'll make my code look crazy.
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:16.120]   - Crazy code.
[01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:18.720]   - You can have like eight spaces in a tab.
[01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:19.560]   - Yeah, what?
[01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:20.400]   - That's insane.
[01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:22.600]   - All that indentation.
[01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:23.720]   Jim, you're picking the week.
[01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:25.040]   - I'm a group of high-asky.
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:25.960]   (laughing)
[01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:29.200]   - I think that first four bits are just good enough.
[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:31.600]   - It should be emoji tabs.
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:32.920]   I want four emoji.
[01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:35.160]   What do you got for us, Jim?
[01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:38.920]   - All right, so I always do music,
[01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:41.600]   hard rock, metal, rock type stuff.
[01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:46.600]   So the past couple of times I've been on,
[01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:50.640]   I've done some really hard,
[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:52.240]   bluesy rock type things.
[01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:54.560]   People seem to enjoy those.
[01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:56.880]   So I'm gonna do the same one,
[01:59:56.880 --> 02:00:00.120]   but a little bit different.
[02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:02.520]   So this week's pick is Zach Wild.
[02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:07.760]   Zach was the guitar player for Aussie Osborne
[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:10.240]   for many, many years, a lot of years.
[02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:14.920]   He did, I don't know how many albums he did
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:16.760]   with him, a lot of albums.
[02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:21.040]   But Zach, well, people may look and say,
[02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:22.960]   Aussie's, you know, that's too hard.
[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:24.640]   I don't wanna listen to that.
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:27.280]   Zach has acoustic albums.
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:29.000]   He has blues albums.
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:34.000]   Zach did a few different bands on his own.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.880]   Black Label Society.
[02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:38.000]   - This is the hard rock stuff.
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.440]   I should probably not play this,
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:42.120]   but this is his YouTube channel.
[02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:42.960]   - Yeah.
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:43.800]   - Yeah.
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:46.320]   - He's got a lot of great, great stuff
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:49.200]   from acoustic all the way up to metal.
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:51.440]   So if you're looking for something
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:54.200]   that you can listen to all the time
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:56.160]   with an incredible guitarist,
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:58.560]   and I love his voice too, he's got a great voice,
[02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:02.520]   he does ballads on piano, he does,
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:06.040]   he's got three acoustic albums
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:11.040]   that are just basically acoustic and him, you know?
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:13.920]   And it's great stuff, really great stuff.
[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:16.720]   And for, if there's any guitar players out there,
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:19.160]   Zach plays a lot in A minor pentatonic,
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:22.680]   which you know, is the blues scale.
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:27.680]   So a lot of his stuff is, you know, just really bluesy.
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:32.160]   Some of it is hard bluesy, some of it is soft.
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:35.080]   It's just, it's great, really great stuff.
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:36.560]   - Good video stuff on YouTube,
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:39.280]   and I love the idea, he's got the lick of the weak.
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:40.360]   I guess he stopped doing that,
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:41.600]   it would've been fun to keep doing that,
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:42.840]   it's different, like.
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:46.400]   - Well, you know, Zach said at one point,
[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:51.080]   if you're trying to learn how to play some of my songs
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:53.560]   and you can't figure them out, you're trying to hurt.
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:55.880]   (laughing)
[02:01:55.880 --> 02:01:57.720]   - It's not that complicated.
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:01.640]   - Now, that's the reason to be fair,
[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:04.480]   Zach is one of the best guitarist in the world.
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:06.680]   - Yeah, of course.
[02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:09.160]   - Yeah, it's just self-deprecating.
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:13.240]   - Well, you know, some of his rhythm stuff is very easy.
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:14.080]   - Yeah.
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:16.400]   - And it's great to learn how to play that type of stuff.
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:21.400]   So I just, I love his guitar playing,
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:23.120]   I love his songwriting.
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:29.160]   You know, "Spoken the Wheel" is a song that he did years ago.
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:32.680]   That is just great, but--
[02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:33.920]   - I love it.
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:36.880]   - I love the blues feel of it, that's really awesome.
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:38.400]   - Yeah. - That's really awesome.
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:41.000]   - He's too, and I, you know, I've met Zach
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:44.240]   on many occasions, hung out with him.
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:48.160]   He's a great guy too, besides being one of the best guitar
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:49.080]   players in the world.
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:53.520]   - Z-A-K-K, or I should say Z-A-K-K in honor of your
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:57.600]   Canadian heritage, W-Y-L-D-E.
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:02:58.440]   - Yeah.
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:02:59.800]   - .com.
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:00.800]   Thank you, Jim.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:05.040]   - And now Andy Inako, in his bag.
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:06.600]   - Hey.
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:08.000]   - He's gone, yeah, hey. - Yeah, hey.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.280]   - I felt like I needed to like sort of up my hat game,
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:13.480]   just showing up just a baseball cap
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:15.800]   without even any festoonery on it.
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:16.640]   - What's the button?
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:17.640]   It looks like an option.
[02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:18.960]   - Next year.
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:20.760]   This is my Lil Cthulhu pin.
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:22.520]   - I thought it was Cthulhu here, yeah.
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:23.360]   - Yeah, all right.
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:28.360]   - Given to me by Sarah Dyer and Evan Dorkin
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:30.240]   at the New York Comic Con last week,
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:32.920]   they have cool stuff.
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:35.200]   My pick this week is one of my favorite apps
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:38.960]   and one of my most frequently launched apps on my Mac.
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:41.880]   It's Aurora HDR 2017 for Mac.
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:44.160]   I've been using the previous version of this photo editing
[02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:45.600]   app for a long time.
[02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:46.960]   Obviously this is the new version of it
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:48.520]   that's made it even better.
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:51.880]   When people are familiar with what HDR is,
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:54.160]   they tend to think about it though as,
[02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:56.040]   oh, well, that's the thing where I put the camera
[02:03:56.040 --> 02:03:59.200]   on the tripod and it takes several pictures
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:01.840]   with different exposures and then it melds them all together.
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:03.320]   Yeah, but I'm not taking landscapes.
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:05.080]   I'm not doing this.
[02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:05.920]   Don't think of it like that.
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:07.720]   Think of it as a,
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:10.120]   if you have to rename the icon,
[02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:13.920]   make photo better now, please.app.
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:15.840]   That's what this app does
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:19.840]   because HDR apps will work on single images.
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:21.880]   And if you've been looking at the,
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:26.000]   if you've been admiring demo pictures from the iPhone 7 Plus
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.840]   and all you have is an iPhone 6 Plus
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:30.800]   and you don't feel the need to upgrade right now,
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:32.600]   but you really want that better pictures.
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:34.280]   This little, this app,
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:35.840]   if you just take any picture that you've taken
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:38.320]   with any camera, dump it in there,
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:41.000]   it will basically do a HDR process on it
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:44.280]   because there's so much color and light information
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:45.880]   in this picture that you haven't seen.
[02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:48.160]   Keep it on that doggy picture for a sec.
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:49.920]   This is a picture of my friend's dog.
[02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:51.600]   I took that photo.
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:52.440]   Oh, God.
[02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:54.280]   It's a little Bernice Mountain dog,
[02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:55.520]   such an adorable dog.
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:56.960]   He's just a puppy.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:58.320]   Look at the size of his paws.
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:04:59.160]   Yeah, they're huge.
[02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:01.040]   He's just growing into the paws.
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:02.400]   So if you, I'm sorry,
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:03.960]   I didn't give you the original of this,
[02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:07.640]   but I shot this with my Nexus 5X that I bought.
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:11.560]   I paid $320 for mid-range phone.
[02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:14.520]   And the original of this, it's really, really dark.
[02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:16.680]   You could see the white and the color in his markings,
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:17.760]   but that's about it.
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:20.120]   You just dump it into Aurora HDR.
[02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:22.080]   It will essentially, let's do,
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:23.360]   let's take the brightness down,
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:24.840]   let's take the brightness way up,
[02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:27.840]   and then let's combine the three versions of these.
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:29.880]   It's a lot more complicated than that behind the scenes.
[02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:31.880]   But as far as you know, all it did was,
[02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:36.040]   let's find as much natural tone as we can find in this image.
[02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:38.280]   And then there are sliders that simply let you
[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:40.960]   keep adjusting things to your liking.
[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:42.400]   So even if you want to,
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:44.240]   if you think that I want there to be more blacks
[02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:45.840]   or I want this to be brighter,
[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:47.760]   it works a little bit to those sliders.
[02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:50.400]   They work a lot more like the photo,
[02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:52.160]   the built-in iOS photos editor,
[02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:54.080]   where if you increase the brightness
[02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:56.000]   or increase the exposure,
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.400]   the software knows that you don't mean
[02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:00.360]   I want all the blacks to be gray
[02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:02.880]   and I want all the light colors to be totally washed out.
[02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:04.200]   So it knows you mean,
[02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:05.880]   I just want this to be a little bit brighter,
[02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:08.040]   but still look natural.
[02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:11.880]   And then as you, with many of these apps,
[02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:13.080]   and that's another app,
[02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:15.120]   that's another one that people kept saying,
[02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:17.880]   oh my God, you got to pre-release like iPhone 7 Plus,
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:19.840]   like a month ahead, I said, no, again,
[02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:22.120]   this was taken with my Nexus 5X,
[02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:24.840]   the $320 mid-range phone.
[02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:29.520]   And the original of this looks nothing like that.
[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:33.560]   It is kind of grayish and it's kind of overcast.
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:38.560]   And it was an Aurora HDR that allowed me to fine-tune this way.
[02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:43.240]   I did put it into Lightroom on iOS
[02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:45.120]   to screw around with a little bit more,
[02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:48.600]   but substantially, this was just five minutes
[02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:52.000]   of letting Aurora HDR do its thing
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:53.480]   and then making adjustments
[02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:55.840]   to make it look the way I wanted to do.
[02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:58.160]   For instance, the first pass the app did,
[02:06:58.160 --> 02:07:00.560]   it's made the sky way more dramatic,
[02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:03.680]   but I didn't really see that there were so many different layers
[02:07:03.680 --> 02:07:06.800]   of clouds until I started pushing sliders around it.
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:08.960]   Okay, now I can make that pop a little bit more.
[02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:11.840]   Now I want the greens to be a little bit more green.
[02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:13.360]   There's some blues in the foreground
[02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:15.560]   that are kind of look like just a bad color.
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:17.320]   I just wanted to change that color.
[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:23.160]   Really, everybody tends to think that the profession,
[02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:25.520]   if you want to elevate your game, so to speak,
[02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:28.640]   you start to learn Photoshop and that's how that's the app you need
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:32.320]   in order to take a good image and make it into a great image.
[02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:35.160]   But really, this app and others like it,
[02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:36.440]   but this is my favorite one.
[02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:42.120]   It can take a JPEG from a very, very simple camera
[02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:46.400]   and just make it look exactly like what your eye thought it was
[02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:48.240]   when you were standing there looking at it.
[02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:50.120]   And if you start off with a great picture
[02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:54.520]   from the iPhone 7 Plus, it will make it even better.
[02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:57.560]   And once again, you don't have to, it will of course work.
[02:07:57.560 --> 02:08:00.040]   If you're going to shoot with,
[02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:02.000]   I take pictures sometimes, of course,
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:05.760]   with my expensive Olympus camera and I use actual,
[02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:07.680]   it's on a tripod, I do actual bracketing,
[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:12.200]   I do formal HDR and there the results are absolutely spectacular.
[02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:16.480]   But once again, if you even just give it a JPEG from your iPhone,
[02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:20.080]   even better, give it a raw file, a DNG file from your phone,
[02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:22.240]   it can work wonders with it.
[02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:24.280]   You'll be amazed at what it can do.
[02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:26.400]   It's like having a friend who knows Photoshop
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:29.200]   and will do everything for free
[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:31.600]   without even asking for a beer or anything.
[02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:32.640]   Absolutely wonderful.
[02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:34.480]   And these results I'm showing you, by the way,
[02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:37.200]   it wasn't like me working for an hour and masking
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:41.000]   and doing all kinds of slick tricks.
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:42.720]   It really was, I'm just going to stare at this
[02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:45.560]   for about five minutes and just push sliders around,
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:47.600]   starting at the top of the list, going to the bottom of the list
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:51.320]   until it matches what I imagine this photo should look like.
[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:54.520]   So it really has fired up my creativity
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:56.480]   because there's nothing more disappointing
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:08:59.320]   than when you dump your photos and,
[02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:02.400]   oh, I really thought the leaves were a lot more intense
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:04.960]   and, oh, I really thought the sky was a lot bluer
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:08.000]   and, oh, gee, I really thought that there weren't
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.440]   such deep shadows on my girlfriend's face.
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:14.080]   But then Aurora says, oh, you're right, hang on,
[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:15.040]   let me fix that for you.
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:16.400]   And it's done in five minutes.
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:19.280]   This is from the Mac Fun folks.
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:21.040]   Yeah, it makes the PHU.
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:23.000]   And it actually, I don't know how much
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.400]   Trey was involved in this, but it's kind of Trey Radcliffe,
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:28.520]   so Aurora, and I believe he was heavily involved.
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:29.400]   And of course Trey Radcliffe.
[02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:32.120]   Yeah, and when you buy it, you also get a whole bunch of videos
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:33.800]   hosted by Trey showing you how to use the app.
[02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:35.680]   And also just showing how to do photography.
[02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:37.280]   I love Mac Fun.
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:39.000]   They are really, they're like that band
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:42.880]   where no matter what album they put out, no matter how weird
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:46.120]   it seems like, oh, it's all shopping carts
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:48.800]   and dropping melons into shopping carts
[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:50.480]   instead of musical instruments.
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:51.120]   You know what?
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:52.480]   I like your other stuff so much.
[02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:55.560]   I'm going to buy this anyway, because I'm sure it's going to be good.
[02:09:55.560 --> 02:09:57.080]   It's like Zac Wilde for photos.
[02:09:57.080 --> 02:09:58.880]   Even an acoustic, man.
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:02.000]   So my pick of the week is really more for IT professionals,
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.240]   people who run large Mac shops.
[02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:06.920]   And it's oddly enough from Disney.
[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:09.760]   Disney has open sourced a lot of the software it uses.
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:13.640]   Remember Disney also owns Lucas, ILM.
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:18.840]   And they have some really-- if you go to it's disney.github.io.
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:21.480]   And if you go take a look at some of the projects on here,
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:23.160]   there's a huge amount.
[02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:25.680]   For instance, Monkey, M-U-N-K-I, which
[02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:29.320]   is a way for OS 10 administrators to manage software
[02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:32.040]   installs over the network on client machines.
[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:35.680]   They also have for, if you're an IT pro reposado, which
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:40.160]   lets you duplicate Mac OS 10 Software Update service
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:44.080]   on your own servers using Python.
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:46.520]   Anyway, just some really great stuff.
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:47.640]   And it's all open source.
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:49.920]   It's all free.
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:55.560]   And I bet you, if you're a graphics designer, or if you're a Mac
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:58.560]   shop, what's interesting is how much of it is for the Mac.
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:02.120]   You can tell Disney's animators and others use Mac
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:04.400]   attaches quite a bit.
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:05.400]   So just check it out.
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:06.160]   It's all free.
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:09.880]   Disney.github.io.
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:11.200]   And of course, when you get there, you'll
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:14.240]   see a little come on to get a job at Disney.
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:18.280]   So maybe it's more there than meets the eye.
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:19.240]   We're done.
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:22.760]   Oh, I wanted to ask you one thing, Jim Dalrymple.
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:25.800]   I noticed on your website, loopinsight.com.
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:28.800]   You're mentioning today the new inductees
[02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:31.840]   into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:33.960]   Just curious your take on Bob Dylan
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:37.360]   winning the Nobel Prize for literature.
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:41.520]   You know, I really don't know what to think about that.
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:45.000]   I mean, Dylan, people have said that Dylan's a poet.
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:46.360]   And he's all with us.
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:50.560]   But everybody must get stoned.
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:55.040]   I know some of this stuff wasn't deep, deep.
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:56.080]   I don't know.
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:58.200]   I mean, I like Leonard.
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:01.640]   People have even said that Dylan is a plagiarist
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:05.400]   with some of his lyrics if you look back and some of that.
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:05.800]   I don't know.
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:06.400]   It's good.
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:07.800]   I respect Dylan.
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:10.280]   I love Dylan as a musician.
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:15.520]   But when you look at literature,
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:18.760]   should Dylan be there, even some Dylan people, even a lot
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:21.320]   of Dylan people, we're really surprised.
[02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:22.400]   He won that.
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:22.960]   I think even though--
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:24.160]   So Bob is kind of wondering.
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:27.600]   He didn't mention it at his concert that night in Las Vegas.
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:28.800]   He probably still doesn't know.
[02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:31.240]   And has not responded to their invitation
[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:33.760]   to come to the awards ceremony in December.
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:36.640]   He's not returning their calls.
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:38.600]   Oh, well, when you're Bob Dylan, you can do that.
[02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:40.120]   I don't know what they're talking about, man.
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:41.680]   But I loved Leonard Cohen's line.
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:43.000]   It was the best line of all.
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.280]   He says, you know, you don't give Mount Everest an award
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:48.280]   for being the top highest mountain.
[02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:50.760]   You don't need to.
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:53.080]   So while he's saying Dylan deserves it,
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:55.480]   it's kind of like, well, does he need it?
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:12:56.240]   No.
[02:12:56.240 --> 02:12:57.680]   No.
[02:12:57.680 --> 02:12:58.960]   It's great to have you on, Jim.
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:01.480]   Thank you, lipinsight.com for more.
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:02.240]   Thanks, Jim.
[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:05.840]   Read him daily at J. Dowrymple on the Twitter.
[02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:07.160]   Of course, Aaron Hill, I guess.
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:08.040]   We'd love having you on.
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:09.680]   And you're insight into the world
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:12.440]   of developing for MacBigNerdRanch.com.
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:14.080]   @Haren Hill, I guess, on Twitter.
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:16.920]   Great to see you in your hat.
[02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:19.240]   And Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun
[02:13:19.240 --> 02:13:23.480]   Times, one of my goodest friends and a guy who comes back
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:26.440]   here every week, despite the indignities I
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:28.040]   inflict upon him.
[02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:29.040]   Go ahead.
[02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:32.440]   No, again, I voluntarily changed into this hat.
[02:13:32.440 --> 02:13:33.160]   I need to get these.
[02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:33.640]   I suffer.
[02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:35.320]   I inflict upon myself.
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:38.440]   Go to cwob.com or read his writing at the Chicago Sun
[02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:38.880]   Times.

[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:17.440]   But now my friends, I'm sorry to say it's time to get back
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:18.320]   to work.
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:20.040]   Because break time is over.
