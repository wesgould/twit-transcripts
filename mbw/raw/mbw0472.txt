[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.440]   No, it was great
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.480]   We did a two and a half hour Twitter on Sunday with Renee and Ben Thompson of Stratecary and Ed bought of ZD net
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.840]   And I thought that was a fabulous two and a half hours
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.240]   We basically recapped the Apple event
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.920]   Analyzing and took about the same amount of time real time. Yeah, so if you if you're interested in kind of deep analysis
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.480]   Of what not so much like what the products are not like well. Do you want this or not?
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.040]   That's I think we'll do more of that today, but more
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.960]   Strategically because that's certainly Ben's forte
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.120]   What it all means and I just had a great time. So thank you
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.800]   Also here Serenity Caldwell from imore.com. Hello Serenity. Hello. Hello. I'm happy to be back finally
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   I feel like missing each other. Yeah, I know
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.800]   To the Apple event or did you stay in Boston? I went to Apple adjacent
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.560]   So I got to watch the Apple event from the Square offices and then I hung outside the Civic Center
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.360]   And actually did a podcast under the trees of the Civic Center with a with our dear friends from clockwise
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.440]   So, you know, it's funny because I watch the Apple event from the Square space offices
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.600]   There's a certain irony to that there's a tie in
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.060]   Too bad no portals no jumping between LA and New York from Square to Square space and
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.440]   Welcome once again Andy and I go you were on the Apple
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.080]   keynote stream
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.080]   from
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.000]   Outside the Stephen Colbert show you're going to episode two of the Colbert show
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Yep, I did make that judgment call and that's got to be the that's got to be the weirdest of us
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.720]   If I need to actually make a proof to anybody that I take my job seriously
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.320]   And I lost that credibility by saying no
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.240]   I want to see the TV show instead of going to the Apple event
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:14.040]   So while I stood I stood out there for like two for literally for like two hours and 20 minutes like this
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.720]   So that I can both watch the event streaming on this phone and also take part in
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:26.080]   In the twin life coverage of that so oh boy, and it was 90 90 degrees outside like a hundred there is folks
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.040]   In the audience looking like you're having a good time. That's a screen cap from the show itself. Oh god
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.600]   It was such a great show
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.840]   I've been like a half dozen Letterman shows and it is even it's even better for the audience the look Colbert show than Letterman show
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.160]   Really you loved it. I
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:50.680]   Was big grin on my face. It didn't go away applauding every place every chance I got the great thing is a Colbert like actually
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.240]   Tries to win when they're not actually doing the show like when they're setting things up he goes to the edge of the stage and keeps
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.000]   Entertaining the audience and the band because sometimes it's it's it's only the second show
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.520]   There were a couple of bits where like something went wrong
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.080]   So to redo things and they instead of having the the musical act like ready to go
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.640]   They had to then stop for like 20 minutes while they set up the bandstand
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.360]   So now the band is like walking through the audience playing their instruments like New Orleans jazz orchestra
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.120]   And it's like it took you're out of there like to like a little more than two hours
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.760]   Instead of like in and out like you weren't with Letterman, but it's like we have to go as a matter of fact
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.640]   The last the show is over the cameras are off Colbert has said goodbyes
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:37.120]   And now the band keeps playing and now they start marching up the aisles to sort of like lead a parade of people out of the theater
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.360]   And into the lobby where the band is waiting to say hello to you. It's like it's a good time
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.000]   There was no free samples of par and Paul and the Paul Malmo of everything like that during the old Sullivan show, but it was pretty good
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.760]   That he Tim Cooks can be on a night. So this would be another night to go if you wanted to keep up on what's going on in Apple
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.040]   Yeah, it's kind of a mystery. We really don't know
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.640]   Maybe I don't know maybe he'll have something to plug
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.440]   He might do you think he'll have enhanced some stuff? I bet he will absolutely no no he think yes access
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.840]   This is the this is the thing where I'm sorry. We'll we'll finish the introduction, but I just wanted to say it's it's like
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:17.880]   With other CEO. He's had this the third tech CEO. He has had as a guest on the show. That's amazing
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:24.480]   But now Tim Cook has the absolute perfect way to dodge any questions about anything that he does not want to answer
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.480]   He will just say so so
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.840]   There's been there's been a lot of complaints about so and so and Tim will say have you seen the new Apple pencil?
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.120]   Oh, it it works with the new iPad Pro here. You can keep that one if you want
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.640]   And that'll be the end of the question. Can we see the picture again because Patrick De LaHandy?
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.040]   thinks he spotted David Letterman in the audience next to you
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:50.520]   Is that did Letterman two seats to your right Andy? We weren't introduced however
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.240]   He was during the during the half hour 45 minutes. We were waiting before like the warm-up started
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.240]   He was actively reading a newspaper
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:04.640]   I hope he puts that away during the show because that's not a way to get the to get the host excited about it
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.400]   It's not Letterman. Oh, right?
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.600]   It's absolutely not letterman if it were to let her now has a huge like Santa Claus beard
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:20.240]   Anyway, welcome to all of you and there certainly is a lot to talk about I'm sorry. I missed the event last week
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.680]   It was kind of it's the first event I've missed since the iPod launch, but it's kind of a
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.720]   Part of the it's kind of an interesting experience to see what what's going on in the real world during an Apple event
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.360]   Because here I am on the streets of New York City and nobody seems to really care
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.360]   Nobody's you know, they're not glued to the phone. They're not watching it on the screen
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.440]   Even when we went to square space. I had to kind of talk them into turning on
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:48.760]   He says somebody said oh, I think the Apple events going on right now in the real world. It doesn't have white
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:54.520]   The attention that it does that's true, but neither does a presidential address anymore Leo. That's true
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.200]   The state of the union and see that either yeah, that's just New York
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.920]   However, we are obsessively fascinated by each and every detail
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:10.400]   I presume you're talked out about it because we did a Mac break weekly right afterwards, and I'm sure everybody had everything
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.960]   Well, none of you were on it. So no
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.560]   Here's your chain at nor was I here's your chance
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:24.400]   So I guess I should first canvas you what did you all order serenity? I
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:31.960]   Ordered I went six plus this time or six s plus this time which is was shocking even to me
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:38.920]   But I wanted to try that the big screen for a year. I went with the space gray 64 gigabyte thought about
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:45.240]   The rose gold which is really pink, but I don't really have anything that would match
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:50.880]   With I'm more of a fall colors type girl shoot. I was gonna offer a trade
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.360]   It's not wedding season after all. Yes. I don't know why I was so much for bridesmaid dress
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.440]   You look at the picture. It's pink, but I just believed Apple when they said no no it's rose gold
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.040]   It's rose gold the way the gold iPhone is champagne. I mean, it's just yes some marketing name
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.440]   Well, not they mean the gold the gold iPhone does have a sort of light gold color to it rose gold is very much
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:17.120]   I mean especially because we've seen rose gold on the Apple Watch edition
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.800]   Which truly looks like what I would call rose gold because it is rose gold
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.880]   It's made of gold with with copper in it with that's called rose gold
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.680]   Exactly with it with a nice reddish tint to it
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:34.080]   This is very much a pink iPhone, but we can't call it pink gold. So let's call it rose gold
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.560]   I bought it
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.360]   It's nice looking you know what actually
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:47.000]   Hilariously after the event two different men in my life texted me saying I want this phone really none of my female friends
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.400]   But all of it all of the dudes were like let's just say that pink lovers a ton of male
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.280]   Engineers are walking around Cupertino with this phone right now
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.020]   Yeah, I mean this is this is the item they everyone wanted I guess I can always put it in the case
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.580]   We're a head we're a head of the fashion curve man, right?
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.920]   So totally cool
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:10.680]   Okay, let's let's try to let's try to change the world
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:16.760]   I somebody told me that pink used to be a masculine color in the early 19th century or maybe even in the early 20th century
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.320]   Pink was not for girls. It was for boys
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.840]   It's for anyone who likes light red the same way they like light blue or light
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:29.000]   It's this at least looks it's not pink. It's not outrageously pink pink
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.360]   It reminds me of Easter honestly
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:45.200]   Good spring color. It's a spring color. It's a spring color. So you got the big one
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.000]   I did too. I thought because I got I thought the big one was too big last year and but I thought well I
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.640]   Guess after talking with you Renee
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:11:00.080]   I decided to get a bigger screen because you say that more and more apps are using the extra pixels and the battery life and
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.720]   The controls are now easier with I mean, there's just so many reasons and oh I asked although
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.720]   Is OIS in the success as well? No, no, I
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:13.240]   Am increasingly the opinion that for low-life photography OIS does and a phone make a big difference
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.600]   And they have a video now too and it looks like they showed some samples on the devices
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.040]   I don't think they didn't show them I was strange
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.440]   They didn't really emphasize low light at the event but they showed them and the deep trench isolation on
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.240]   At the demo area and the low light shots were fantastic
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:35.600]   But also those shots that had some light coming from the middle like inside people's bedrooms or or tents or campers and it captured both really really well
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   What did you get rid of?
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:46.360]   Got the I got the I went 64 set of 128 because I didn't go anywhere near 128 on my last phone and I got the iPhone 6 plus Rose Gold
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.200]   Okay, we're we're matchies twinsies
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.000]   Why don't you come over? We'll have a little you know pajama party in a pillow fight
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.240]   We can do our nails. I'm sorry. That's rude. Yeah, it's a little 1998
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:09.680]   I'm embarrassed. I bought pink. That's what it is. Even my wife said you bought the pink she bought it
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.880]   It's again. It's embrace it embrace it. I'm gonna embrace the pink. I got 128
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.720]   Partly because I want to just see how how expensive these could be
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:29.000]   Big after tax more than a thousand dollars for a phone
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.320]   The other reason I got it is I think I may be shooting more video and
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.400]   Stills with it. I might be using it more as a camera than ever before
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:44.120]   Yeah, I regret it now because I totally forgot about 4k when I did buy it. Yeah, I don't know
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:50.440]   I'm getting better at man and Apple's getting better everything from I thought I thought a library to asset thinning to on-demand
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.800]   Resources they're getting better intelligently
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:59.680]   64 gigs is enough for almost anybody 16's not why they still sell 16 is beyond me. I can tell you
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:06.480]   Yeah, why the enterprise my mom uses seven gigabytes on her iPhone
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.080]   Georgia's husband we checked yesterday uses nine gigabytes on his iPhone
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:15.120]   I was talking to a bunch of people even nerds like from an ant tech at the event and they all stream everything now
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.280]   There's almost nothing resident on their devices anymore. Yeah, so it's it's it's an issue for a huge amount of people
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:25.240]   But not for everybody. I've been saying that for years. You don't need as much as you used to this isn't an iPod for crying out
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.280]   I just wish they would change this queue and make it like an education skew like you with the emac
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.760]   So that if you are enterprise buyer or an education buyer
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.080]   There's a there's a big visible differentiator that lets you know that you might have a problem
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:42.800]   Yeah, the cynic in me says it so they can have a $650 starting price. Yeah, and high ASP's the
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.560]   Isp is king
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:48.360]   That's why they dropped the price of the 64 and the 128 because they make 16 slightly less comfortable
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.240]   And then the other ones slightly more affordable and you get a really nice ASP out of that
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.600]   Yeah, I mean, I think that Apple is in danger of looking like cheap skates
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:04.240]   But I think I I do think they could easily make the the base phone 32 gigs make a lot of people's lives so much
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:10.560]   More pleasant because it's not it's not that people need 32 gigs. It's not that people need 64 gigs
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.700]   It's that it's the problem when they suddenly have 16.8 gigabytes worth of stuff
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.400]   But when they when they take that next picture that says sorry
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.700]   We're not taking any more pictures
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:24.600]   You're totally out of space and if you could buy an extra three three gigs or if you could just put a memory card
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.640]   Into the thing to expand the stores that wouldn't be a big deal
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:32.900]   It would be such a boon for users if Apple said tell you what we can give you 32 gigs for
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.960]   200 bucks on contract. We're gonna give you 32 gigs
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.600]   the
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:46.160]   Price for the how much they charge for each additional bump in hundred bucks hundred bucks
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:52.160]   So 16 to 32 is a hundred 32 64 64 is a hundred 64 to 128 is a hundred
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.760]   Oh, they don't do a 32. That's right now
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.960]   So like there's a lot of technical details here like the there's different kinds of
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.800]   NAND flash that you can buy and the TLC NAND flash they use for the bigger phones is much cheaper
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.800]   Well, it's no it's cheaper. It's yeah
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.140]   It's it's two layer instead of multi layer multi layers what they use on the 16
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.120]   Right and because there's no additional slots
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.960]   It'd have to double density that to get to 32 which makes 32 quite a bit more expensive relatively speaking
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.520]   That so there's a whole bunch of but you mean it is it's handy's point
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.680]   It is it is hocus pocus. We're just company in the world
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:24.160]   They could do anything but they have to report these to Wall Street and if Wall Street sees the average sales price changing
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.660]   Especially going down that's a lot of pressure on Apple
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.880]   Looking at these images of course remember this is Apple and these are people using the iPhone 6S
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:40.600]   Who know exactly how to get the most out of it, but but but I can say I'm one of the things that really impressed me about
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.120]   These sample photos is that these aren't the usual
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:50.500]   Pretty human beings standing on the beach. I agree. They're more like you would actually take
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.320]   Well, no, no, not not just that
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:57.360]   But I mean if you if you painted the inside of my hat with silver nitrate and held it up to the Sun
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.400]   It would take it that would it would take a great picture of a pretty person at sunset on a beach
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:07.440]   They're showing you they're showing you pictures that of course are taken with real photographers who knew what they were doing
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:13.640]   Things were on tripos probably but there a lot of these are subjects that would be really really challenging like that scene inside the ice cave
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.840]   Yeah, that's almost impossible. It's not just a pretty picture
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:24.240]   But think about how it's got one huge positive source of light in the background even that isn't blown out
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:30.400]   But nonetheless you still have contours and texture in all the shadows in the foreground and color in the foreground
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.780]   That's what gets me excited about this new I'd love to know though. If this is HDR. I would almost
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:42.200]   It's automatic. It's automatic. It doesn't matter. That's and that's completely fair. Yeah, is everybody's doing it that way
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:47.120]   I think I think every demo photo should be turn the photo on to turn the camera on all
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.840]   Into auto. They see the user just aims it and presses a shutter button
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:57.320]   Whatever choice is the phone decides to make on its own is what goes so HDR is certainly fair game
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.320]   Yeah, it was only off in the past because it took so long to take a photo if you turned it on
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:05.160]   But now you have these massive processors that can just chew right through it. So they just turn it on by default
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.160]   Here's another one from Guelen China
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:14.240]   That is just boy, that's and as you as you point out the auto HDR and this is pretty phenomenal
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:19.660]   That would be a very difficult shot even with a DSLR. It's just it's just so it's just so wonderful
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:26.600]   How great almost and not all camera phones, but the best camera phones are and that's I'm sure that's just straight out of the camera without any
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.560]   Modification, but would hope you then yeah, but of course no that would be unfair
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.080]   And I don't think that Apple would do that but also when you think about well, how much better can I make it even?
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.000]   If I had it in Lightroom had it in Photoshop
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.200]   And you can always make it so much better as impressive as it is on the camera because it's capturing
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.960]   So much data that you might not be able to see in those shadows
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:51.280]   It's I'm the day is long past when I go through like my Flickr stream and I can
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.720]   Instinctively know which photos I took with the phone which photos I took with a 2000 with a
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:03.680]   $1,300 camera thousand dollar lens on it if I do hope that apples these are straight out of the phone with default settings
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.440]   I'm sure they are. I think they'd have to be or that's misrepresentation maybe or at worst
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.400]   I mean if they if they're gonna use tap to expose tap to focus that's that's fine
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:18.960]   It's not yeah, that's we're not talking about people who are again dumb again to photograph into Photoshop or using focus stacking or using exposure
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:24.080]   Exposure stacking later on it also answers the question is is 12 megapixels enough because of course
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:31.120]   That note five is a 16 megapixel camera. I think it's more than enough, but you know if you have any qualms
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.960]   The detail in these images. Yeah, it's good. I mean I think we have to sort of
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.240]   Start to retire the more megapixels is better as a myth myth
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.080]   Because if you're
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:51.640]   Seriously because now now image sensors are so good now if you have a if you have a camera with a 20 megapixel sensor versus a 12 megapixel sensor
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.800]   The 20 that takes photos that are not quite as good
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:02.320]   But now I can actually basically do later on a crop that takes the form of almost like having a zoom lens on my on my camera
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:09.920]   I would kind of rather be able to zoom in and recompose later on and fix whatever needs to be fixed rather than saying well
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.960]   Okay, which I just don't have enough data in that image to make a good picture
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.160]   But there just so many metrics now 12 megapixels
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.040]   It's I'm glad they bumped it up if they if they stuck with eight that would have been horrifying
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:26.160]   Unsailable. I I am a sucker to for you know than the HTC did its Zoe's
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.720]   back to the live images the cinema grams and so forth. I'm a sucker for
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.920]   Live photos. I can't wait to play with that. Tell me about this though
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:43.920]   Will I be able to put this live photo anywhere but on an Apple device? Can I can I I heard you could put it on Facebook?
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.920]   Is that the case?
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.920]   so I
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.520]   I'll let you in I'll let you in the extra all this stuff by the way
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:59.320]   Love the Apple music book. Thank you so much for writing that. Oh, thank you. We needed a flavor of love
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.400]   And I hope you'll be doing the same thing for the iPhone
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:09.440]   That's the hope yeah if we don't all fall apart fall asleep or apart for people who doesn't know don't know that
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:14.880]   Serenity Caldwell does really well all of I'm more now does really excellent how to
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:22.920]   Things on on Apple stuff and and I that's I've been found a niche a really good niche
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:28.560]   Thank you. Yeah, the deep deep dive into how this works and how to get the most out of it is so valuable
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:35.480]   Yeah, we tend to agree. Yeah, yeah, so live photos. Can I embed these anywhere or do I have to use a player?
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.400]   so
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.040]   Currently live photos. I believe are limited to iOS devices
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:48.200]   They'll even work on iOS devices is this right Renee before iOS 9 if you send them to other people and messages or
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:58.160]   Success devices but on iOS 9. Yeah, you just have to long press instead of force press to play them. Okay, but I have heard that Facebook
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:03.200]   Was gonna support this but these are not animated gifts. These are something else they're animated jay pegs
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.680]   They're animated there. They've got to be videos
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:13.080]   Yeah, they're jay go ahead Renee, you know more of the technical. Yeah, how does this work?
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.320]   I know I know it to preface what you're about to say
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.680]   Yeah, the way it works is a second and a half before you actually shoot the picture
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:24.480]   It's recording on each side a second half before and after so you get a three second
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.760]   And it's in its 30 frames a second, right? So you get 90 images
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:38.800]   From this still that you took then what happens? Yeah, so more like so just because some people are nervous about the fact that a camera
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:43.080]   It might be pre recording before you press the button digital cameras are hot like that sensor is alive
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:48.200]   Because that's how it's so quickly. Yeah, so it's just taking advantage of that
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.520]   But keeping a 1.5 second buffer instead of a millisecond buffer as you would a normal camera
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:58.040]   And then exactly what you said they don't want to call it a video because it's not defaulting down to 1080p or 4k resolution
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.520]   It's the full 12 megapixels and it's basically taking that stack of shots for 1.5
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:08.600]   1.5 seconds before 1.5 seconds after and then it's using an algorithm to go through and I don't know if it's a delta
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.000]   It but delta makes sense in this kind of situation only the changes
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.240]   Yeah, so it's compressing it as much as it can and
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.880]   The apparently is around two times the size of a normal photo
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.920]   Maybe a little bit more. That's fine. When you watch them back you sometimes see frames you sound like
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.760]   Because it's just trying to do a lot of work at once but not often I didn't see that often
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.760]   It's not like the animated
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:34.600]   Jiffs you get from Google for instance when Google finds a few pictures that were taken simultaneously and they're like
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:42.000]   This is fluid. Yeah, it's it's they call it animated again because they're stressing. It's not it's not a literally taken
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   There's an ago - right
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.240]   Yeah, they include the audio file as well. So it's I think it's just because some people will say well
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.760]   It's not technically video and then there'll be a whole new cycle out of it
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:57.640]   So they're being very clear that it's just recording these still images and adding audio to it. It's an animated jpeg
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:02.600]   Absolutely with audio which animated gifts or I really now
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.520]   Facebook says in the iOS app it'll be supported
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:13.840]   I you know I presume it's just gonna be iOS and Apple devices really sounds like they're making the format open and if anyone wants to
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.880]   Support it they can support it. I mean I don't think it's a big mystery how they're doing
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.520]   I loved Zoe's and this was the HTC thing for the with the start with the HTC one
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:27.480]   But because no one could see it. It just really didn't it didn't but this is I love this idea
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:33.000]   Like I even tell people when they get a new camera and they're shooting a lot of stills
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.040]   I said I say don't forget your camera does video don't shoot half an hour shoot six seconds every once in a while
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.680]   Because you would then make a slideshow with with video and it just works really well
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:50.640]   You don't you're not gonna be editing video. It's just part of the slideshow and I think this would really be spectacular
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.640]   I'm sorry Andy go ahead. No, I
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.920]   my
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.560]   I have heard people people have told me that it's headed to Facebook
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.320]   But that's just something that people have told me as opposed to something I verified
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:08.600]   I was I was that as I said all three of us were like holding back saying I hope I hope Andy has knows something for
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:12.880]   I hope Renee knows something for a fact. We're guessing. We're guessing a lot of guessing
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.440]   It's a nice feature
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.480]   It's but what I like the most about it is that it's the kind of feature
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.320]   I like where if you want to use it
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.480]   It's there if you don't want to use it it won't get in your way
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:28.160]   They're saying they're saying you may as well leave it on all the time just like a lot of people leave auto HDR on all the time
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.080]   I think that like like anything else the answer is gonna be six months from now
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.160]   Are people actually using and sharing these things or is it something that they're barely aware?
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.160]   It's an act it's an actual feature
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.160]   I
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:47.000]   For one hope it succeeds and so often you see this not just Apple, but it happened seems to happen a lot with Apple where they
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.840]   They do something and and and then they don't put enough wood in the to to simulate John Gruber
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.840]   They don't put enough wood into behind the arrow
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:01.880]   To to make it universal and then it just kind of gets kind of not gets not used and I love this idea
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:06.760]   That's just continues to be a bummer there are a lot of reasons why that didn't become an open standard and not all of them were within
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.760]   Apple's control, but that's the difference between
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:15.920]   Messages being something that everybody can throw themselves into without any question and it being a concern of okay
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:21.160]   But I hope that I can do something with this without having to buy Apple products for the rest of my life
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.760]   Which would be nice
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.840]   The one super nice thing about the live photos
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.640]   Two is that you can set them as the wallpaper and then on on your locks
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:32.320]   We you can just press it and that'll animate like you could see me stumbling out of a bar or something or or BB8
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.120]   Just do a couple seconds. I'm not gonna use it to pick take pictures of you stumbling out of bars
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.580]   No, that's fine, but I mean you can also send them to your watch and those become the new because that was to support
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.320]   Oh, I made it. Oh, okay. There's a good use for it
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.560]   So you have all so just like little you see the little flower open up
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:52.680]   You'll see your child smile or you'll see, you know, whatever you've shot and to forest all people who are gonna tell me oh Leo
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:57.960]   No, Kia invented this in 1812 1812 like we know we know
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.640]   But we're gonna we're gonna
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:07.280]   Still be excited because this is the mainstreaming of something and this is what Apple does better than anybody takes something existing in mainstream
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:13.080]   If you popularize it you kind of win but like to your nandies point digital touch is nice and I don't get
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.320]   Send sketches anymore. I mean I love them, but I just don't get no
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.680]   I don't do heartbeats anymore either. Yeah, so we'll have to see maybe if Apple makes it popular
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.520]   Then they deserve, you know
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:25.080]   All the accolades have come with it if it's just the latest in a long line of cute photos that nobody ends up using then we'll see
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.120]   Yeah, yeah
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.200]   I just kind of you might want to take a little break because I just got my new in-ear monitors and
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:36.760]   I want to replace I've been using sure kind of ready ready made in-ear monitors
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:42.280]   I want to replace these look at they look how they nicely they package these and for the price they are to you have to go to a
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:48.040]   Look at unscrews. You have to go to a audiologist to get molds made
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.520]   So that's I hope you're not offended, but that's the in-seated my ear looks like
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.040]   Before we go away though. Yes continue on I'm gonna put these in a
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:01.080]   Listen, I'm watching the I'm watching the keynote video right now listener on Facebook said that excuse me
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:09.520]   Said that Facebook integration was specifically mentioned during the event as happening next year. That was my impression - okay
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:15.520]   I'm sorry. I realize that I was I was watching I was watching the thing like this on a street corner
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:20.760]   So the way that my brain work the way that my brain works obvious, right? Oh obviously, yeah, but
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.760]   Though the way my brain works unless I remember specifically where I heard that I don't
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:31.920]   Good, so it is a fact and we know that now. We're so happy
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.440]   Oh
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.540]   I suddenly hear what you guys sound like you sound
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:46.520]   Terrible it's a whole different experience. Let me take this. We're gonna have to be more oblique in our insults now
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.640]   I feel like Bono can tell me in Andy a part
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.880]   Why you're on the left and you're on the right
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.160]   Good, I'm excited. I feel like the camera breakthrough
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.560]   You know we were mocking. I was mocking
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:06.720]   I don't think you were but I was mocking Apple for saying in its tagline about the new iPhone the only thing that's changed is everything
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.320]   Which I guess you're saying Renee is almost tongue-in-cheek and now that I think about it
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.960]   Maybe it is a little tongue-in-cheek. Yeah, cuz they get crap for that every year. They're all looks the same
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:20.480]   Nothing new about it. Yeah, except the building that there are a few cool new things
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.840]   Like this. I think the new camera is gonna be worthy
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.640]   Well, I'll also I was reading it
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:35.240]   Someone from I think Mashable had got to ride in Tim Cook's limo as for 20 minutes on his way to
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.360]   I'm sorry BuzzFeed. Thank you
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:46.040]   That's that's it or maybe just like maybe just like using uber you just decided
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.480]   Yeah, just just pulled up for 20 bucks for a show for his cap
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:56.240]   but one of the one of the interesting things that from from that little interview though was that
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:03.960]   Tim seemed to the the the writers seemed to said that he seemed to bristle a little bit at the suggestion that there are tick and
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:08.240]   Talk cycles and he wanted to say no every every single way when we make is most important
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:14.240]   We think we make for that year. So maybe it's time to start talking about new case design not new case design
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.320]   Do I need a new case by the way for this or can I use my old cases? Oh?
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.600]   I'm sorry. I don't know. I know what you're talking about you're talking about the depends on the
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:29.400]   Manu so every many every case has manufacturer tolerances apples are incredibly precise not all manufacturers having cuddly precise tolerances
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:33.040]   So the case can be slightly tighter than one you buy and slightly looser than the one that I buy
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.000]   So more or less they should fit
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.480]   But if you're buying a case that has incredibly low tolerance or is is tight in in the wrong direction then you might have problems
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.480]   here's some here's some of these
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   I can't wait
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.360]   To shoot these so the way you make these live video for those of you listening and how I apologize
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:57.480]   But you can go to the apple site apple.com/iphone to see these the way you make them animated you is you is it up?
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:02.640]   What is okay? What are the three levels again touch push and pop touch press and peak and pop?
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:08.360]   Sounds like a breakfast series and his unofficial hint kind of just shows you there's something here when he can pop on it
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.400]   iPhone 6 the new iPhone
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:18.120]   So I hint peak or pop this to get the animation just press this there's only one level for this. It's no in peak or pop
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.000]   This is awesome
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.800]   Are you getting audio to Jason? I don't know if you're getting audio off my Mac because I presume that beach picture of the dog has
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.280]   little ocean
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:34.040]   Yeah, I guess not I got me a couple of interesting things about this the fact that it's compatible with older
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.640]   phones by just doing a tap and hold
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.560]   makes you wonder
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.880]   How deep
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:48.480]   Developers are how successful developers are going to be in differentiating this this 3d touch from just simply tap and hold
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.560]   These are it's the sort of feature that you're gonna have to actually try and use to understand why it's gonna
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:31:00.960]   Why it has to differentiate from tap and hold but it's there any time you in you add to the vocabulary of a touch user interface
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:05.080]   You got a lot of work in front of you not only to educate users, but educate developers
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:10.840]   I think that we're gonna see a first generation of apps where there is no particular reason why this could not have been a tap and hold
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.280]   And it's gonna take a while for the flavors to really deepen on that one
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:18.560]   Yeah, they're gonna be really mean that if you look if you go through the 3d touch developer documentation
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.720]   They are really specific and how you can use it right now
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.840]   So you can use it for home screen options
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.720]   And that means you press on an icon on a home screen
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:31.240]   And it gives you up to four options that are two lines of text each and an optional icon and one of some of those can be static
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:35.600]   And some can be dynamic, but that's it. You don't get really nilly access and same in apps
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:40.680]   You can use the hint to preview content the peak to preview it in a view screen that you load into the app
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.520]   And then the pop to change apps. So it's all care the interactions are carefully
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:50.080]   Controlled right now by Apple and the interesting thing is that with tap and hold the problem with that is
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:55.080]   Just people never knew how long to tap and hold for and you would either take it off too early and not get it
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:01.080]   Or you'd waste time and it never felt like you were in complete control of the interaction and the idea here is you're just pressing
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:06.320]   So that it's an instant upon press gesture and they believe that's sort of a better user experience overall
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.000]   I know geek in our chat room wants to know if
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.120]   Because tap and hold does burst mode now, right?
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.480]   What will it will it still do burst mode?
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:19.480]   Yeah, it still does delete like if you still want to delete an icon from your home screen because that they want to make sure
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.600]   Nothing destructive happens. So you're holding that for a while
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.200]   So there all that stuff is still there and they've got for example, they built
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.400]   voiceover into
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:31.280]   3d touch for accessibility and they have a bunch of accessibility options for it too
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.800]   But they're very careful to say on older devices don't abandon them
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.760]   Make sure you have sort of some sort of yeah, they have to yeah
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:41.880]   And the nicest thing like especially like for me in serenity is like you can use this to do a rudimentary level of
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:46.680]   pressure sensitivity even in drawing apps and I think that's fantastic. Oh, then we need with your finger
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:54.000]   Yeah, I can't wait to see what third-party developers do with this because theoretically these APIs should be available for third parties
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.640]   This is the OIS in video
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.920]   That is pretty impressive. It's so it's so well done
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:07.600]   Wow, and so and so typical of how Apple approaches features. I think in general, but also specifically for photos
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:14.680]   They're all kinds of really cool features you find in other photo apps like focus stacking deep focus the ability to say sand still
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:18.080]   We will take a the camera takes a range of focal
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:24.080]   Focus stops and so it can either artificially create shallow focus or artificially create deep focus
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.800]   But that's something that you have to know the feature exists
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.840]   You have to know how to use that thing and then you have to follow directions in order to make it happen apples
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:36.720]   Apples take is usually can we find a way to just do things automatic automatic auto magically?
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.880]   So that we just just take the picture if you want that to be a motion picture
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:44.800]   It will be a motion photo if you want to if it blew better as an HDR
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:49.240]   There will automatically be an HDR just one button press that shutter button and we'll give you a picture
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.440]   They're putting a flash on the selfie side
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.440]   Oh
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:59.840]   Is that right with retina flash every site is your best side made a custom chip Leo that would light up the
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:03.560]   Screen three times brighter than normal. Oh, it's not a flash
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.320]   Self-flash you know what there is a camera, and I think it's this one
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:13.520]   Yes, it is the Moto X has a flash in the front right and everybody says oh, it's blinding
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:18.400]   Don't ever use it. No, but it takes good pictures does it? I have to try it
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:23.880]   Well, I had I did use it by accident the first time and it was disorienting until I saw oh wow
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:27.600]   That's actually a really good picture. I was a little I mean let me tell you how important this is
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.840]   I was at the I was at the one the sculpture galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.600]   And I want to get a selfie of myself with this sculpture
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:40.240]   I really like but it's in shadow with this just absolute crap and what I actually wound up doing was I had
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:46.240]   I had to I had of course a pocket full of phones, so I had the iPhone 6 s plus a
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.960]   little bit a stacked on top of the
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:56.600]   Samsung Galaxy note and then one was turned around so that I could just basically put one in flashlight mode behind it
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:02.280]   So I was just using that as a flashlight to illuminate my face to get some light on the subject so I can get that that picture
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.360]   So this is gonna change a lot of things also you love the idea people
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:11.760]   I think people are gonna take them gonna miss miss understand this as it will just simply light up the screen to make it happen
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:17.320]   No, it actually over drives the screen by quite a bit to actually turn it into not just an LED flash
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:21.940]   But sort of almost like a like a softbox almost like an illuminated panel like what I've got here
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:28.720]   Lighting me up. So that's really a lot of very smart stuff. We haven't seen how this is written so-called retina flashes
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.860]   To be fair, I think camera plus was doing this with the regular screen. Oh, they were a while
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.120]   Oh, yeah, well, they do a lot of smart
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.840]   I think they did the volume up is take a photo button first. They do a lot of that kind of stuff
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:41.480]   I don't want to steal anybody's you know, you know, you know, you know, you're on to something when your app gets banned by Apple
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:45.520]   Yeah, and they were there they got banned for the only temple is poor guys
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:51.960]   It was only to yeah those poor guys they sold 14 million copies and I don't want to steal anybody's pick of the week
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.680]   But they're giving it away free now after 14 million
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.840]   99 cent
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:00.120]   Sales and congratulations to Lisa bed. That's wonderful
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:05.400]   Anything else to say about the camera feels seems like there's an infinite amount to say about the camera
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:11.160]   They have the the slider exposure control, which I think is a very natural simple way
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:16.520]   To do a slide up and down with your finger to change the brightness is that that's new, isn't it?
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:22.760]   That's I think that was IOS okay. You'll have to correct me because I haven't used an iPhone in about six months
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:32.200]   Red enough there's the red flash and you have full manual controls if you want to get an app store app that supports the API is you still have full manual
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.800]   That's nice and that's one thing that I
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:40.240]   Actually never used but it's nice to know you have like camera plus does a really good job
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.240]   Yeah, I mentioned again if so I can stuff that
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:48.200]   Still wish you could you get a raw file out of it though. You can't yeah, yeah
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:55.320]   Well, maybe that that would just be a software update that wouldn't have I thought photo library supports raw
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:01.080]   So it's always you know, it's always on the list of wish wish yes potential, but nothing nothing yet sadly
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:07.160]   I think the thing that maybe slows it down is that Apple's doing so much computational photography that
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.760]   Maybe they don't want that you know, they're attitude is well
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.960]   There's a very small market for people who want the unmodified photo and frankly
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:21.560]   We're doing so much with what that sensor gets that you really shouldn't mess with it. Well, no, okay
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:25.080]   Camels it's
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:29.480]   Like I said, but some of my favorite features are the ones where if you don't know it exists
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.600]   It will not complicate your life in any way shape or form
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.320]   But if you are able to if this is relevant to your interests
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.360]   It's available to you and the ability to simply check a box and say yes
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:42.440]   I am willing to quadruple the size of every file that you write to this thing
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.600]   Please do give me a dng file because that stuff is important to me
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:51.640]   I'm if I'm if I'm taking pictures of it's I'm in the I'm seeing my my kid for the very first time I
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:54.680]   Kind of would like to have not just for me
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.960]   But for the person 10 years from now or the software 10 years from now
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.920]   I would like that software 10 years from now to be able to have as much data as possible
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:07.200]   Let's take a break. We're gonna continue talking about new Apple products. We're all excited
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.280]   I didn't ask you Andy what you ordered because I think you you're gonna delay till next year
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:18.040]   I'm I'm waiting. I actually I think I am at a decision point about whether or not I want to switch back to iOS
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:24.840]   Based largely on Apple Watch what I'm doing though is I'm waiting to see what Android M is like it looks great
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:28.240]   It has features that I'm really interested in I haven't installed the developer preview yet
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.320]   So I'm gonna try that out
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:33.440]   And I'm I'm sure Apple is gonna make enough that if I want to buy one in November
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:38.600]   I
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:43.880]   Always will be you know a little bit foot feet in various worlds. I'd even have a Windows phone but
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:48.760]   For the first time in a long time I'm thinking of making my daily driver an iPhone
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:55.240]   And we and I agree with Apple watch 2.0 and the iPhone. I mean it and then this camera
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:01.120]   I'm not sure that snap crackle and pop is really that gonna be the key for getting me over there
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.880]   But I I think that
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.120]   Judging from what those of you who've touched it have said give it half an hour. Yeah, exactly
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:13.680]   I think I think you you have convinced me I have less than I'm underwhelmed by the watch and the
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:17.920]   MacBook use of force touch but 3d touch looks like something maybe
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:22.680]   Once you do a force swipe to get right into the fast app switcher. You're like how did I live without this?
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:31.760]   Can't believe you just said those words. Yeah, once you do a force swipe to get into never mind the fast app switcher
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:36.200]   Tap swipe and pinch
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:45.760]   Busy he's all about the force swipe. I want to I want a Disney animation commercial for the new peak pop and touch
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.680]   I think there's characters in there somewhere. Oh definitely Renee Richie's here
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:56.160]   It's a very cool well from I'm more Andy and I go from the Chicago Sun times are show today brought to you by legal zoom

[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:34.720]   Just because they have a big building downtown and charge four hundred fifty dollars an hour
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:39.040]   When you need a lead do legal stuff the legal legal system is complicated

[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.600]   Is there anything underreported you guys think that we should talk about?
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.320]   in these new phones
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.320]   Yeah
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:16.040]   Yeah, touch ID has been improved. So you've so hopefully you won't have enough
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:21.440]   That goes the thing we have to keep retrying a few times. So that's just making it faster and more responsive
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:26.000]   I like that a lot processors faster, too, right? Yeah, they do that every year
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.280]   I never feel like the iPhone is slow or the iPad is slow, but
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:33.680]   So it's it's an amazing it's actually a pretty funny story
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.000]   You know like Steve Jobs was an interesting character and he would say I want the best sushi in the world
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.840]   And they would just go and find the best what I could and bring him to cafe Mac
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:44.640]   And at some point he says I want I want like I don't understand all these chips
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.440]   We're making our own chips
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:49.680]   I need the best chip guy in the world to tell me right once to get which ones to use and they bring it in and then all of a
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.000]   Sudden well now that we have them
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Why don't we start working on chips and unlike Qualcomm that has to have profit and loss on every chip that has to support both
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.440]   Windows phone protocols and Android protocol to us to do all this extra work Apple just gets to make
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:07.600]   It's crazy Silicon as they want that supports exactly the features that they want and instead of being a conservative company that goes
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:12.080]   Ah, the a7 is fine. We'll just we'll get it. We'll we'll save as much money as we can for the next two years
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:16.480]   They're like no run run faster run as fast as you can. There's room put on an extra CPU
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:21.760]   There's room put on an extra GPU just go go go and we're seeing the fruits of that with like the a9 and the a9x
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:26.240]   It's as a fan of as some anyone who likes chipsets. We'll love that they're doing this kind of stuff
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:31.920]   These are arm based so yes, they're starting the starting point is the same
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.760]   Design that everybody else is using well, no, so they used to license the design like the a4 and a5 or licensed designs
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:43.240]   I think the a6 to but with the a7 they're licensing the instruction set and doing their own designs now ah
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:50.680]   So the microcode is their own they just are compatible with the instruction set. Yeah, they do all the layouts
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:55.400]   It's it's actually pretty cool stuff when you when you look at the differences between what a clock on my produce or what?
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:44:01.560]   You know a Samsung my producing what Apple's producing Apple's making choices very specifically for their own hardware and feature needs
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:05.240]   Well, and we've mentioned that before because they know they don't for instance have to support flash
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:09.400]   They don't have they can take stuff out of the design that doesn't we'll never get used
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:14.520]   Yeah, and I mean theoretically they could take open GL out one day when metal is popular and they can stick in the motion chip
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:21.080]   And they can stick in the context voice chip so you can do hey, Siri. Sorry. You can do a hoi series without a power cable anymore
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.240]   Let's talk about hey, Siri because Siri
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.200]   Siri, uh, I you know
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.640]   For the sake of ruiners. We've got to live with this
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.560]   Hey, screw you can start training your own weapon on the iPhone 6s. You can train it for your own
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:38.120]   Well, that's my point and one of the reasons that we're very careful about not saying certain words
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:46.360]   Is because people complain. Hey, I was you know watching and uh, but now as of right now your phone has to be plugged in to do that with the new phones
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:50.840]   And I don't think yes, you know, I mean except for you guys at apple who are watching anybody else is
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:53.720]   Is getting this full-time listening?
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.640]   Uh
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.680]   First of all, let's flatten that whole thing about apples listening
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.560]   No
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.560]   Okay, and then um
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:07.080]   It's all on device if people are concerned the hoi series done on device
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:09.080]   It's never that that is not cloud source
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:13.560]   No, the thing now with voice recognition is you get better voice recognition on the cloud because it can account for way more
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:20.120]   Variety you can do basic voice processing on the local device and the keyword the trigger word is
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:25.960]   Totally internally on the phone. Yes on all of these devices including the echo and everything else next question
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.120]   uh
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:34.040]   I think hey syria is too short of phrase. It's too easy to trigger and you all saw this uh on the on the
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.360]   White House press conference
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:42.040]   Did you see that video? Oh, it was so funny. Do you have that lying around Jason? I don't have it
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:45.960]   But uh, i'm sure we can use the google done it by saying seriously in the wrong tone
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.040]   Oh, this was this was not even
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:54.760]   But you can if you listen to what happened you can kind of hear why syria got woke up and what she tried to answer
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.000]   which is uh
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   really
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.760]   White House press secretary got it. I think so. Let me
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.560]   Siri answers questions during the White House
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:09.160]   I know you're going to disagree with this analogy in a sense, but
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:13.400]   There's an expression in sports about a team backing into the playoffs
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:16.040]   because another team lost
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.040]   and
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:21.000]   With having to sustain a filibuster
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.240]   to avoid disapproval from congress is the president
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.920]   Upset that he couldn't get even one republican
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:31.480]   Perhaps to sign sure what you want me to change
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:33.800]   Okay
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.040]   So she says sorry. I'm not sure which
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:39.320]   What you wanted to change what you wanted to change
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.040]   He never said syria
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:47.320]   But he said stuff that was close enough and this is my problem and I had this problem when I had my phone plugged in and I left that
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:50.520]   Feature on it would wake up all the time you're watching tv
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:55.320]   You're having a conversation and syria like some idiot cousin would say i'm sorry what
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.360]   Uh
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:59.880]   So how are they going to make this better because this is not this is going to be a feature
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:01.960]   Everybody's going to turn off if they don't if they don't fix it
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:06.520]   So they can problem too though because now you have your watch that has it your tv that has it your phone that has it
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:09.080]   Multip if you have multiple be like you at least they both have your phones plugged in
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:14.520]   How does she identify which ones hers? It's just as it is an escalating previously undisclosed problem. Yeah
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:19.960]   Um, I wish they would you know on the moto xandie I use help me. I'll be one kenobe
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:26.440]   And that's enough syllables that it's not and it's an unlikely phrase that it's not I don't get triggered unless I actually
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:31.640]   Want it to be triggered. I wish you could do that you can't do that right? It's still going to be hay syria or slummo or whatever
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:35.720]   It's it's kind of yeah, unfortunately you can't set a a default phrase
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.840]   They need to be able to change that. I bet they fix that in 9.2
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:42.920]   I was I was trying I was trying to figure out when I was setting this up if because we sent up voice commands
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:48.360]   It will not let you go. My my trigger phrase for the when I tested last year's model was haymoto
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:53.320]   Uh, and it would not let you do short a three syllable thing as to know you need something longer than that
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:57.000]   I don't know whether it's for more accuracy or whether it's because they're trying to anticipate that problem
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.680]   I think I
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:02.680]   My experience has been that three syllables, especially three short syllables is too short
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:07.000]   Yeah, so it's it's like my help a little bit. It depends on how well it does that
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.120]   That's also something I hadn't had in cons I hadn't thought of until just now
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:13.720]   What if when you have your when you have apple tv? What if you have another device?
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:17.240]   Uh, if you have hay if you have hay slummo turned on all the time
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:22.120]   Does are this does does continuity allow the device to realize that? Okay, look
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:27.240]   I know that I'm in the room too, but I think he meant the phone that's actually in his hand and closest to his mouth
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:30.680]   So I'm not going to activate based on this trigger phase phrase
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:35.880]   I am tvious push button still you have to press the button to get to your other tv, which I'm thankful for yes
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.360]   That's how it should be I think but it could but it's possible
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:41.560]   You're probably going to have like your phone somewhere in the room like in your pocket
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:46.200]   I'm sure I'm sure they anticipated that but it's it's it just shows you how complicated this problem can be
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:49.480]   I've had that happen with android and the android wear watches
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:54.680]   um because they both use the default uh, okay google phrase and so
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:58.040]   um actually my watch wakes up on i'm listening in the card
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:01.560]   Body of books all the time and I just kind of want to disable that feature
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.440]   Uh, so this is this is
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:08.440]   How many people are going to be shouting out questions in the white house press room?
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:09.880]   Oh, I know
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:14.040]   And any sort of any sort of press conference anywhere just shout out a siri at
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.520]   At tom brady and just see what happens
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:22.280]   That was the old joke at cs two years ago where people would jump into a room full of nerves with google glass and you know
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:27.480]   Okay, gordity and not show me pictures of something disgusting and then everyone would suddenly get those popping up. Yeah
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.680]   What have they shoved what have they shouted out?
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:33.320]   Hey siri what's obama's next appointment?
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.680]   Ah, wouldn't that be funny?
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.080]   Pick up by the microphone. Wouldn't that be funny?
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:39.960]   Would would in bird sting be all over this if this was 30 years later
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:44.920]   So the hope is that the training first of all the people will use it will take because you don't have to do it
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:47.240]   But let's hope they do and then it will help
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:54.280]   Um, we shall see any other features we want to talk about before we move on
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:59.880]   Not necessarily a feature, but the iphone upgrade program is pretty interesting as uh
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:03.960]   As things go. So what's your sense? Is this a good deal?
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:11.560]   Yeah, you know what if you if you want to get an iphone every year and you don't want to be locked into a carrier two-year plan
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:15.240]   It's funny because you know, we don't have our subsidy two-year agreement anymore
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:21.640]   But many of the carriers are basically locking you into two-year plans anyway with things like atnt next where you still have to pay
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:26.280]   Two years worth of payments to get your phone even if you can upgrade after 12 months
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:30.120]   Uh, so apple is basically giving you a different way to be like, all right
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:34.760]   If you truly want to be separated from the carriers and have carrier choice
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:39.000]   And still be able to upgrade your phone every year here is an alternative for you
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.560]   And the fact that apple care plus is thrown in is in my opinion
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:47.960]   What makes it a must-have deal for anybody who wants to upgrade their phone every 12 months
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:53.800]   In other words, it'd be better deal for me because I do buy the new phone every 12 months
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:58.520]   And then just sell the old one or hand it down to be a better deal for me to do it the of the monthly payments
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   Yeah, it was plus of a hassle
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.960]   Yeah, but let's say i'm not worried about hassle financially. Is it better?
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:09.560]   Financially if you were if you were set on selling your iphone every single year
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:14.920]   Um, I think it winds up to either be about even or slightly worse
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:19.880]   But you also have to take into account that you're paying for apple care plus in the iphone upgrade program
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:27.400]   And that you know what um as somebody who did not pay for apple care plus on the iphone six and wrecked two iphone six screens
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:31.000]   And a matter of yeah, I don't know like I'm a very careful person
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.800]   I've never wrecked an iphone before and I wrecked two within
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.840]   I don't know three weeks of getting my iphone
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:43.080]   So it's it's definitely a nice program to have and uh
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:48.120]   And I do think it sort of makes the difference for people who are looking to upgrade
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:52.040]   Especially and then especially if you don't want to deal with the hassle of selling your phone
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.800]   Keeping it in pristine condition and selling it on ebay after 12 months
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:52:01.000]   This is a much better avenue. So they're not gonna a year from now when I take my iphone and it's kind of worn out
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.280]   They're not gonna say oh you wore it out. They're gonna say no. No, it's time for the new one
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:08.600]   Yes, so you it has to you have to keep it in a certain uh a certain condition
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:14.440]   It has to be free from dent or major breaks in the screen no bending your iphone
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:19.160]   Yeah, the power button has to work. Um, it can't have been submerged in water
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:24.840]   You know all of the all of the basic things. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, no no water submersion
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:28.040]   But uh, but yeah, they they expect normal wear and tear on it
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:32.360]   You don't have to keep it in a glass case and never use it except on special occasions
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:37.720]   And they say it's a two-year amortization, but after when the new phone comes out one year from now
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:43.640]   I just trade it in get the new one. Will there be a cost involved of any kind at that point?
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.840]   No, you're it's a switch. It's a strict swap out
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:53.480]   What does happen is that you sign up for a new 24 month contract at that point. It just continues to extend
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:53:00.200]   Exactly and if you don't if you if you'd rather just use this as a way to pay for an iphone over two years
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:02.440]   Because you don't have eight hundred dollars to drop
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:06.760]   On iphone day you can do that too after two years the phone is yours
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:11.560]   So if you choose not to upgrade then that's that's your phone to keep or resell at that point
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:16.360]   Let's talk about unlocked because as far as I could tell on apples page you had to buy
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.680]   the phone
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.000]   from one of the big four us carriers
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:26.760]   And in fact if you did the payment plan you had to activate with one of the big four us carriers
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:33.880]   That was a requirement. Is there a way today to get an unlocked iphone or you should we wait as we had do last year for a month or so
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:35.000]   And then they'll have
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.040]   Yeah, so actually technically the iphone upgrade programs iphone is an unlocked iphone
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:45.160]   It just requires that you activate service with one of the carriers before you leave the store
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:50.040]   Locked, but you have to sign up with a carrier correct exactly. Why is that?
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:58.600]   I assume it's to keep the carriers from getting too cranky and also to prevent iphones from mysteriously disappearing over the border
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:02.920]   You do have to have a us credit card to sign up for the upgrade program
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:09.560]   But I could very easily see people using this as a way to quickly stock up on a bunch of iphones with a phony us credit
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.720]   Or or stolen or a straight out of the country
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:17.240]   Exactly. Yeah, so I assume that signing up for carrier service is one way to sort of protect the investments
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:22.600]   Um in addition to that, I yeah, I think it's making sure that the carriers aren't cranky
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:25.480]   But yeah, you do the phone is technically unlocked in fact
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:30.920]   That's a big banner statement on there on the iphone upgrade programs page is it's an unlocked iphone
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:35.160]   But if I don't use that program, can I get an unlocked iphone if I buy it outright?
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:43.080]   You can so this is this is one of those weird things where it says, you know full price unlocked iphone on apple's online website
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:45.560]   And then when you go to select it, it shows t-mobile
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:49.160]   Right and and you kind of scratch your head and you're like but but I want it unlocked
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:57.240]   I don't want it with a carrier and that's because um the way I believe the way that the apple sim is pre-set up for specific carriers
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:04.440]   That you that t-mobile is the only carrier that won't lock the apple sim when you when you buy the phone
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:09.480]   Oh, it's this new sim thing where you the sim you decide and then this exactly but
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.280]   Because this is what I want to do. I bought the t-mobile one
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:16.600]   I'm gonna take that apple sim out. I'll put it in a glass case and preserve it for a posterity
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:20.040]   But I'm gonna put my t-mobile sim in there and it should just work right?
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:22.040]   I believe so
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:25.160]   And can I put a verizon sim in there and it will just work
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:27.800]   So that's I
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:31.160]   Yeah, you're Canadian your Canadian Renee. I know you have no idea
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:31.720]   But go ahead
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:34.120]   Well, no, I bought mine unlocked because outside the u.s
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.880]   It's not as much of an issue for people which is nice
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:40.200]   But verizon has always been a little bit peculiar because you might want to to drop back on evdo
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:44.360]   And I believe if you want the ability to drop back on evdo you still have to have your esm with you'd have to activate
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:49.560]   Yeah, but I have my last year's Verizon iPhone 6 with all the other carriers
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:50.200]   No problem
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:53.400]   Just putting their sims in because the sim slot is unlocked in the verizon
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:59.960]   So might be if you think you ever want to use it on on verizon with the older verizon network CDMA and evdo
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.960]   You might want to buy the verizon version
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:07.000]   Act you've recommended that for you. Yes, that really is the is the unlocked phone because it's gsm unlocked
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:10.600]   But it gives you those other capabilities correct
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:13.720]   So crazy confusing
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:18.680]   So I bought the uh t-mobile one is there's no carrier lock on that though, right?
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:23.640]   Correct the t-mobile one is technically an unlocked phone that you can use with any carrier
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:30.600]   It just unlike unlike the verizon phone, which is gsm unlocked but still requires activation of a verizon plan
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:37.400]   The t-mobile phone is unlocked gsm unlocked and also does not require activation of a plan
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:42.440]   It's just labeled as t-mobile, which I don't quite understand this will be in standardies book. Yes
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:47.880]   And don't tell don't tell anybody but i'm gonna put my google 5 sim in it
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:53.560]   She actually has a giant FAQ up online more today. Oh good. Thank you. I do as always
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:56.360]   How do you do your research?
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:01.320]   Um with the for the frequently asked questions. Yeah, it usually involves carefully and
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:08.280]   laboriously pouring over apples website and emailing emailing birdies for help. Thank you bernice
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:16.120]   Yeah, or birdies birdies birdies birdies birdies. Oh, I thought there was some woman named bernice that you email
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:23.240]   That would be handy. It would be handy if I had a condom. I'm sorry to anybody at apple named bernice for
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:27.880]   You've been out of you've been out of theory five as kennie's we don't mean that either
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:35.480]   All right, I think it's really was really interesting to watch the event and see them start with watch 2.0
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:41.080]   Briefly and then said now let's talk ipad. It was like did you did you your guys jobs go?
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:49.400]   Mind I thought yeah, I mean I I I I had hoped not not knowing how much information they're going to try to pack into
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:56.520]   One of the longest events they've ever held I thought that they're going to use this to show off more watch apps that help just make the case
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:58:04.200]   For here's why you want an apple watch apart from the fact that it's a cool watch really surprised that the biggest spotlight was a medical app
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:09.560]   Maybe not quite so surprising given that the next thing they're going to be showing off was
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:14.440]   A tablet that was going to be really really good for for medical purchases
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:17.000]   But it's
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:22.840]   They're not they're not showing this off to people who are questioning whether or not they're four hundred dollars is best spent on
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:25.400]   BMX bicycle or a new apple watch
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:31.080]   Oh, there was a BB-8 demo that could have been done that because all these events have a lot of demos that get
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.080]   They get pulled and moved around the last minute
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:36.200]   And I still maintain jeff Williams with a BB-8 with a sold a ton of watches
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:41.080]   Yeah, no kidding controlling the BB-8 with a watch. Yeah. Yeah, that would be cool
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:44.520]   Um, sorry back to the phone one more question
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:47.560]   Are all four of the phones?
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:49.480]   Well
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:51.480]   Are all the phones hard? We're the same
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:53.080]   Yes
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:57.480]   Maybe not in china, but but for most of the world they're all the same
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:02.600]   All the four colors. No, no, just like the same radios the same whoever whether you get the 18th
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.840]   Yeah, they've actually got uh, I think they said it on stage
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:08.120]   They've got like a 23 or 24 band phone now is the most bands in any phone
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:14.120]   So people who have been complaining about this band missing from t-mobile where that band missing from I think it was ntd.como in japan
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:16.760]   They they have made you very happy
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:21.480]   So there's a chat room saying we've been faster too. So many of the chat rooms saying the 18th phone might be different
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:23.880]   band 12, I think
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:26.040]   They sometimes sometimes carriers, sir
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:30.120]   I won't mention any names Verizon i've insisted on independence cues just just for them
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:32.680]   But that's mostly a reality of
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:39.160]   Partner relationships and not of techno apple would like to have one skew actually they'd like to have one skew worldwide if it were physically feasible
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:41.800]   Um
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:43.800]   Okay
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:47.800]   Now let's move on. Okay. We get we did the phones. I think we did phones
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:52.680]   I'm sorry if we left out your pet question go to i'm more.com and read serenity's FAQ
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:55.480]   Your pet question is almost certainly there
[00:59:55.480 --> 01:00:03.000]   So, uh, as I said, I was kind of surprised that they came out with the iPad it broke the tie between pichkaoski and groover
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:09.640]   Um patchkaoski said they would groover said I can't imagine them trying to get everything shoehorn everything to one event
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.760]   Is it do you think the case that there will not be of an event next month?
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.520]   No, what would they show? Yeah, they've announced everything
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.920]   Unless unless they unless they they're they're finishing car tests
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:26.680]   What what did they show enough over right? They're done. I was so I would have bet money against
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:32.440]   iPad pro today for exactly that reason there there was so much to unpack with the iPad pro
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.880]   I I thought they were gonna want to give it its own little volume of air to be
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.000]   They didn't even have time to do their traditional the stores are doing great
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.040]   We've just sold a lot of phones and all that they barely mentioned china three times. It's incredible. It's incredible
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:50.840]   We're so clearly they cut stuff out and they haven't done stores in a while. They have Tim coaxman coming out and saying everything's fine
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.080]   You know
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:56.840]   I think they're more this was a very focused event. They they had a lot to say
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:01.000]   Um, and I think they did they accomplished it pretty well
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.320]   There was no wandering jimmy iovina Drake talking about stuff
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:11.080]   And thank goodness it was just it was it was very well, but because they had to they moved along and they had to
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:17.080]   Um, they did not announce a new iPad air. Am I right? I did I miss that? No, no
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:22.840]   The iPad air is missing. We've got a new iPad mini 4. They're revving the mini as they need to right
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.800]   And it has an a nine in it now
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:31.160]   No, a it's basically a tiny iPad air too. It's got the same laminated screen the same high color gamut
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:35.480]   It has an a eight instead of an a 8x, but that's supposed to be because the 8x is huge
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:39.640]   And this is a small device with thermal thermal requirements, but otherwise it's identical
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:45.880]   So I I'm gonna say something here. Uh, you know, they have said sometimes in the analyst calls
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.880]   We just didn't know what the refresh site would be on that new category
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:54.600]   Uh, the iPad and they're saying the same thing about the app. I'm showing you an android watch, but
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:58.920]   Use your imagination. They're saying the same thing about the apple watch, which is
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.760]   We don't know what the and and now because iPad sales have tumbled
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:07.640]   I think they're saying, you know what? It's clear people don't upgrade every year. They don't need to upgrade every year
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.280]   There's no reason to upgrade every year. So we're not going to update every year
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.480]   And I'm think this is kind of a maybe a bell weather
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:17.960]   For what will happen to the watch that there probably won't be an update next spring for the apple watch
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:22.040]   Not a hardware update. Oh, I'm certain that apple would like to be
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:27.560]   Would like to be untethered from the expectation that they're going to be rolling out a new product every single year
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.560]   And if they don't do it, then there's something wrong
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:35.800]   Uh, just the same reason that's one of the many reasons why they stopped showing off at mac role. That's why just they just hated having to
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:40.040]   Every january they have to show something that shows that they're making progress on what's it?
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.240]   So that I think that's that in itself is the best reason for them to do that
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:47.160]   Um, we're don't know we don't know what is accounting for
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:51.800]   iPad sales. It's possible that no one knows how often people
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:55.160]   Want to refresh their ipads and it's possible that
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.560]   There's just nothing being released that people find interesting that maybe
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.640]   9.7 inches was
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:06.680]   I've said this before maybe that's just the size they came out with and everyone loved it because there was no ipad before
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:12.200]   But now that there are many choices in ipad including an ipad mini and including an iphone six plus
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.800]   Maybe that was not the size they wanted to begin with so we just don't know
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:22.680]   I mean, yeah, you're right. They don't want to be tied to it and I think that they don't need to update it or do they
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:26.600]   Are we disappointed there's no new air air three so what was I so the question is
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.200]   What would you machine?
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.080]   What would you put it?
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:35.400]   So like if you put the if you put the pen in is that take away from initial ipad pro sales if you just put the new processor in
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:38.600]   Is that a compelling upgrade? I think what upgrade would you want to see in it?
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:42.440]   Like apple is pretty good at saying we don't care about chipsets. We care about feature sets
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:47.400]   This is the feature we want how do we make this tablet support it and if the feature is not the pencil and the keyboard and
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:51.880]   Something else then there may be an a nine an a eight is fine for now and then next year
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:53.880]   They'll do something more interesting with it. Yeah
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.760]   Um
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.520]   iPad pro
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.520]   Fox. Yeah
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.920]   Happy face
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:07.960]   My only my only sadness about the ipad pro is that I don't have it in my hands right now
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:12.840]   Yes, they didn't say where you could order it, but they said it will be available in November, right?
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.520]   Yeah
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:16.520]   Mysterious mysterious times
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:24.840]   uh, no, I mean I I've been waiting for a professional level ipad with you know precious sensitivity
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:30.600]   Uh and and a stylus, you know a drawing implemented for a long time
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:39.400]   Probably since 2010 when when I first started writing about apple and about all of this and for them to finally take a step and say
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.840]   All right, you know what?
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:44.360]   We realize, you know the ipad is great and it's a fantastic tablet
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:48.840]   But we're going to add a little bit more and we're going to just go for the high end for the people who
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:51.560]   Actually are going to use it and are going to need it
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:58.360]   Uh, and people can say oh, it looks like the surface as much as they want. That's not necessarily a bad thing. You know what?
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:03.080]   Um, the surface is not a bad tablet. The surface is actually a pretty impressive tablet
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:09.480]   But for me, you know as a as a primarily mac user, uh, the surface is too much a computer for me
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:13.000]   I don't need something that runs uh multiple operating systems
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:17.160]   I want something fast something light, um and something that I can do professional level artwork on
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:24.200]   And for apple to come up with come out with a product that essentially fills this niche for apple users for people who are primarily
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.760]   Working in apple ecosystems
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:31.880]   Um that could potentially take on something like the centique or something like the surface
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:34.600]   as a replacement for a really
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.440]   excellent um
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:39.240]   From what I can tell almost lag free drawing
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:47.320]   Tablet that's that's going to be huge. Absolutely. Absolutely game. Chances are excited and you so you and rent rene are obviously
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.640]   This is this is what you've been waiting for all along
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:54.600]   Absolutely, um, we talked a lot about this rene with ben and and ed on twit on sunday
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:58.520]   And I point you to that if you want an obsessive conversation, but just to touch on it a little bit
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:05.560]   Um, it strikes me that this the it isn't the main reason it's not a surface pros because it's a touch first operating system
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:08.520]   Um, you're using an operating system unlike
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:13.960]   Windows 10 or windows 8 that is from the ground up exclusively 100
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:19.160]   There's no desktop. It's touch first and I think that can make a big difference
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:22.760]   And I also think that the difference between the ipad pro and the ipad
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:27.160]   Is similar to the difference between the ipon and the ipad people said oh the ipad is just a big ipon
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.240]   But when you got in your hands
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:33.000]   Size alone made a huge difference suddenly it's a different experience
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.480]   And my suspicion is not having touched it
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:43.720]   But you guys did that just the size alone will make the ipad pro a significantly different product like i'm ax leo
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:47.960]   Like going on i'm at it instead of a regular but like a garage band suddenly
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:51.320]   It's much more like a full-size mixer. Well, thank you show you more interface
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:54.440]   So it's not just right so the ipad mini is the ipad air interface scaled down
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:07:00.440]   This is not the ipad air interface scaled up developers can use a size class is to actually put up more stuff like more palettes more controls
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.880]   To rearrange the way things are presented and that lets you like if you looked at
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:09.720]   Mike even microsoft word and excel and i got a chance to try them and and procreate these these apps were fantastic
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:13.400]   They really took advantage of that screen even the keyboard is full size
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.200]   So while i don't like typing on glass
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:20.760]   Um, I think you'll be able to do quite a bit of typing a lot of people do type on glass
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.800]   And I think you could probably do a lot of times like a macbook keyboard
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:32.600]   It also it also lends more more color to the uh, iOS 9 feature that lets you use the key the glass keyboard surface as a trackpad kind of
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:37.480]   Yes, because if that's that's way too far to reach if you want to place a cursor someplace else
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:39.400]   I mean, it's it's it's yeah
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:43.480]   I'm I'm I'm no one on this panel is more excited than I am about the I am pro works
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.720]   it's
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:48.200]   Fine give me the u of access to the video switch and we don't
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:53.880]   But yeah, I mean
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:57.240]   Apple is it was such an interesting quandary where you have
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.960]   um the ipad the ipad air 2
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:03.160]   Has the only really?
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:10.680]   No, the only real library of productivity apps for multi touch. It's the only app library productivity apps
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:17.400]   But they have a device that's not really good for productivity whereas I mean microsoft windows, especially windows 10
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:20.840]   They have all kinds of they've got all kinds of productivity apps
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.720]   They are the again the the biggest operating system on the planet
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:28.280]   But they don't have any apps that actually take advantage of neat computers like this
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:34.040]   Uh, it just doesn't work out. So it's it's interesting that not that now we have the
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:39.560]   Cover the sort of the best of both worlds worlds with the ipad pro where now you have a large screen
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:46.840]   You have not just that but full and iOS 9 much better or even let me we just say competent support for hardware keyboards
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:49.240]   The ability to have two apps
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:54.600]   Visible side-by-side and this amazing multi touch app library for productivity
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:09:00.280]   It's it was it solves a problem that computers like this and the surface pro 3
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:06.280]   We should I should mention that Andy is holding up. Is that the chroma like no the the hb specter?
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:09.880]   It's okay. So it's a convertible that flips the string goes all the way around
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.600]   I've been using all kinds of different windows 10 machines
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.440]   Uh, and they're all again
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:17.880]   It's i've been so tempted because my my ipad
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:22.040]   Three is certainly nearing end of useful life
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.600]   And I've been looking well at some point I should replace it because I use a full-size ipad
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.160]   As a note for as a little bit of a notebook replacement
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:34.200]   But uh over the past summer I've been over the summer I'm thinking well if I'm gonna spend like 800
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:39.240]   Dollars for a new ipad the way that I would need to have it configured with 128 gigs of ram and stuff like that
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:45.000]   For five six seven eight hundred dollars. I can buy a windows 10 tablet that will run
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.400]   Comexology although not anymore because since they they gave up supporting multi touch
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:55.240]   apps on windows 10 ever since then but I'll be able to read to read my full-screen comic books
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:58.280]   I will be able to have uh real microsoft office
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.720]   I will be able to have real scrivener and be making into a real productivity thing
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.760]   And it will actually cost me as much or even less now
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:08.040]   This is so cool because it's not just
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:12.040]   Something that keeps up with the with the with windows 10 tablets
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:19.640]   It actually solves problems that these things cannot solve with the pencil and with the the fact that is so light and so thin
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:25.160]   I'm just so very excited about it. I mean it's it really does change the a lot of the math
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:30.440]   Not only for desktop computing across windows versus uh, iOS but even iOS versus mac
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:35.320]   There are a lot of people who are going to come into the apple store thinking that they they wanted to come up with us a thousand
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:40.120]   Dollar ipad air that are going to walk out instead with a thousand dollars worth of ipad pro
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:42.600]   Uh plus the new keyboard. I can't wait
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:45.240]   But I think it is it is a it is
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:50.680]   I hate to use the phrase, but it's a paradigm shift. It is more than just a bigger ipad
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:52.920]   It's uh, it's going to be a new way of you
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.720]   And it's and I think it's the first touch first os
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:59.960]   And I think this also now it's kind of there's a lot of
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:02.600]   It to you know, it depends on apple
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.400]   It depends on apple to support an app ecosystem
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:09.800]   A pro app ecosystem that gives people stuff they want to use more than just
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.600]   comixology or uh
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:16.760]   Fallout shelter it has to be it has to be some pro stuff and and we don't see it yet
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.440]   But I think they're going to do that
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:24.360]   Um, I think ben made it excellent ben tops and of stratecary made an excellent point in his column and last sunday
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.240]   that apple is moving from being
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.280]   uh, a
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:33.240]   A product company to a platform
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.800]   Company and that's a very different business
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:40.920]   And I don't know how well how well apple understands that so there's a there's a lot of
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:44.760]   You know caveats, but I think if this if this
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.000]   Develops as it could
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.760]   It says it could be a change in the way we compute we think of computing for a lot of
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.400]   A large category of applications
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:58.360]   I'd once again point people to that twit episode though because there's a really good discussion about creating value for software
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:01.480]   Like I love that procreate app and I want james kudder to make a ton of money
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:06.200]   And it's not clear that he can get a lot of those kinds of apps so twit had a great discussion on it
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.680]   I was I think we we uh, we really
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:14.920]   You know, I drill down into the the issues that are going to face this. I I think the pencil is phenomenal
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:19.000]   Uh, I said on twit. I it's a shame. They announced that crappy keyboard
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:24.360]   Because it just it just engendered comparisons to the surface unnecessary comparisons to the surface
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:29.160]   Um, but there are some people who will want a keyboard you can use you could use any bluetooth keyboard, right?
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.160]   I mean, yeah, and they may have a partner programming
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:35.160]   They announced the logitech keyboard that uses the same connector that the apple keyboard uses the same days
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:39.240]   They're not afraid of that being good. They're not going to make that pogo plug good. No, right? Very good
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:41.880]   Yeah, yeah
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:45.080]   You can't use the pencil with the older ipads because the new ipad has a special, um
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.000]   A double
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:55.400]   Right. Yeah, and and and sensors so that you need that sort of in the next generation. I'm gonna use it and i'm glad to say you are an artist
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:59.720]   Yes, so uh, you're really well equipped to answer this question
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:07.160]   When you watch the movie that they showed at the event or watch it on the apple site that pencil looks so responsive so low latency
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.880]   So functional is it was that movie hype or is it really that good?
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:16.200]   So I I was promptly sent a list of things that I had to test for by once for me to call
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:19.960]   Well to make sure that I did not miss a thing and I made sure to go down that list
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:23.720]   What did you want him to look at serenity?
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.880]   Oh gosh, hold on. Can I pull up the list?
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:32.200]   Um, I wanted I wanted him to look at how first of all how the pencil felt when it went across the screen
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.200]   Whether it felt like drawing on glass
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.480]   I wanted to see how good the tilt actually was palm recognition
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:43.320]   Whether when he pressed down there was actual clicking on the screen or whether it felt like a smooth
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:49.240]   Of course. Oh, I had a I had a ton um quick hash marks print versus cursive
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.720]   Uh, there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:55.240]   Uh, especially when it comes to digital writing on surfaces with pens
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:14:00.040]   That you don't really think about when you're just you know writing with a normal pen or a normal pencil
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:03.720]   But with a with a digital pen it becomes very very obvious
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:08.760]   And are you thinking from the context of an artist or from somebody doing handwriting taking notes both both?
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:15.080]   So the thing about I mean the big problem with a digital pen that I've found in my years of reviewing styluses
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:23.320]   Is when you're going to make quick movements, especially on current generation iPads and and on the original generation iPad is that lag is a huge
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:24.600]   Issue latency
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:29.960]   So when you make one hash mark, uh, and you go to make another very quick hash mark or you're running print and you
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.440]   You know write a t and then you try and write an h
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:35.000]   Um, if the lag is too much
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.280]   That will create sort of an offset between the time that you write the t and the time you just write the h
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:42.520]   So when you when you've gone on to the eye
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:46.680]   All of a sudden you find yourself very very
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:51.640]   Discombobulated in your writing process and that that turns into your writing writing slanted
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:54.840]   Or writing too close together or letters too far apart
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:59.800]   And so you basically have to completely relearn how to how to write and how to
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:06.120]   To sketch if you're doing hash marks or that kind of thing people can get around it, but at the same time
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:11.000]   Um, it's not it's one of those things that for a good digital artists tool
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.920]   You need to be able to make quick marks and quick lines without anything
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:19.720]   Us weird getting in the way so I heard the palm rejection is superb
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:24.120]   Yeah, I went down her list and I just some background I used wack on tablets for 10 years
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:29.480]   When I worked in design and I took two years of Chinese calligraphy in college when I was really glad to see calligraphy
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:34.520]   Chinese calligraphy on there because that is the most demanding kind of calligraphy a Chinese character
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:40.360]   It's extremely important if you're going to make it legible that you do that there's there's a flow to this
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:44.200]   This is not an abstruse art in China. It can't look uncanny
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:48.840]   It has to look like it was and so if it can do Chinese calligraphy
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:51.880]   That's remarkable and it looked like it could
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:56.120]   So the the palm rejection is superlative. It's just fantastic
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:59.160]   I just rested my hand on it for a while and drew and I had not a single problem
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.400]   Like they showed you you can put two fingers down to call it
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:05.400]   So it does touch and pencil at the same time, which is awesome. You can pull up the ruler drawn it
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:09.400]   I did very quick cross hatching for shadow. It kept up with me. I signed my name
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:13.400]   I did a bunch of cursive writing. They are doing a predictive algorithm at least it looks like it
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:14.920]   So when you're drawing
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.840]   You it's trying to see where you're going to go
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:20.360]   So it makes sure it never lags behind you and once in a while I caught it adjusting if I made
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:25.080]   Something like an odd turn or something, but it was so fast that if I hadn't been known to look for that
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:29.640]   It's just gonna have experience in using styluses. I wouldn't have even noticed it and I I could not race it
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:33.320]   I tried really hard. I'm sure it's not perfect and I only had limited time in the demo area
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:34.840]   And I'm sure it's in some occasions
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:38.120]   It won't do exactly what you want, but it is by far the best digital pen
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:42.120]   I've ever used on across all manufacturers. I'm so excited about that
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:43.880]   And I'm not an artist or a colleague
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:48.520]   And there's no layer in between like the problem with the wack-home centique layer is it's the wack-home layer and the galaxy notes
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.720]   I've used those quite a bit too is there's a layer in between you and the pixels
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:53.960]   And this really looks like you're drawing into the glass
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:57.480]   And it's not like it doesn't slide across the glass to srennity's point
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.400]   Some of them are just so slick and with paper you're used to the texture of the paper
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:04.840]   And of course this is glass, but they made a textured top on the pen
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:09.160]   So you get just enough drag and the pencil is just the right weight that you start to forget
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:11.960]   You're using a digital tool and that was the most impressive thing to me
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:17.800]   I think this could be a revolution for a number of different categories
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.760]   Artists certainly
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:23.160]   Not only that, but there's so many people who actually as
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:25.080]   As there
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:29.480]   Whenever I'm testing out like a windows 10 tablet or something like that something that has a stylist
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:34.440]   The first question I ask is is this a stylist for taking notes with or is this a stylist for drawing with?
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:40.760]   And most of them are just for taking notes with so that not only defines the difference between the ambition of the pencil
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:44.840]   But it also says that there are a lot of people who go into meetings and who want to hand draw on notes
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:48.120]   And so you think about all the different applications
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:55.160]   I mean all the different sorts of people for whom typing on a keyboard or tapping buttons is not the way to convey information
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.240]   That's coming to them or being told to them
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:03.000]   And I just we could talk for three hours about about everything that all the i'm just
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.840]   The thing that got me to saying that no, I definitely have a thousand dollars
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:11.000]   I'm going to spend on the second they be the split second they become available for pre-order
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:15.640]   And the the the sixth seventh or eighth item on the list was oh my god
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:19.960]   Avatar on air display and now when I travel with my 13 with my mac book
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:24.680]   I will of course have my iPad with me, but now that's going to be my second screen so I could be super productive
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:28.600]   I'll have a two screen setup wherever I go. It's such a long list
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:34.120]   It's not just making to vernay's point earlier on rest the ipad mini was just we took the ipad
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:41.000]   We made it smaller. This is taking the ipad and making it into an entirely different class of device
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:43.960]   Yeah
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:54.120]   Andy you are the most excited person on the panel about that pro I stand correct
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:19:02.120]   Now i'm very excited too. I can outside one category though. This may be a niche product, right?
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.840]   Well, it's entirely
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:08.680]   It's entirely a niche product. Um, but I think that's actually its strength
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:16.440]   Is that apple I think apple is realizing especially with the ipad that there are definitely there are people who want to replace their pc's
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:21.720]   Who don't have use for a full computer and need something a little bit smaller and more portable
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:24.760]   But if they really want the ipad to take off
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.880]   And not just do I mean it's doing very well for what it is
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:33.080]   But if they really want it to be a block buster seller, they need to find a category
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:39.400]   Um that where the tablets can where the tablet interface can really shine and where digital, you know
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:46.120]   Digital work can really really be top tier and having a bigger ipad again like like Andy says it
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:49.560]   It opens the door to so many different professions to build
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:56.920]   Single stream apps for that device where that device is no longer like a personal ipad where you just you take it and you watch Netflix
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.440]   And maybe you do some doodling
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:06.600]   But no people will go and buy an ipad pro specifically to replace their centique or people will go and buy an ipad pro because it becomes the perfect architecture
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.880]   Um
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:15.080]   Architecture building space for for someone who's working on blueprints or people will go and buy an ipad pro because they can build one
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:19.800]   Corporate app for it that will just completely change how they do business
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:23.320]   Um when I first got the ipad it was one of those things where
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:29.880]   Previous I was working at a shipping company at the time and we were you know trying to keep figure out what t-shirts
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:36.040]   We had in stock and we were going through and hand counting and pulling along a little cart that had a computer and manually typing
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:38.040]   All of that stuff into the computer
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:42.760]   And so when I I got an ipad in part because I just wanted to bring it to work
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:46.760]   And try doing in the doing in doing
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:50.680]   Inventory on a digital screen rather than pulling along my cart
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:54.440]   And at the time of course the touch screen isn't nearly as good as it was now
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.760]   Um and it was you know a little a little clunky
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:01.320]   But so much easier than trying to pull all of these pounds of poundages of hardware
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:07.720]   And I feel like that's the kind of that's the kind of big leap that we're going to see in businesses and in small proprietorships
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:10.360]   Where this is a this is a device that will absolutely
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:15.640]   Immeasurably change how people are currently working and doing business
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:17.880]   And this is where I have to give props to apple because
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.240]   They've probably invested I don't know a hundred million 200 million dollars on this
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:25.080]   I mean the rnd I'm sure was significant
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:30.520]   Without any idea of whether there's a market whether people will take to it
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.840]   Um, but they
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:37.720]   Fortunately because of their great cash positions the strength of the company and their vision
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:41.320]   They're able to do stuff like this that I think no other company
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:45.880]   Well, look at microsoft's a great example where they got the sense that we should do touch first
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:52.760]   But they couldn't bring themselves to do a pure touch first o s they had to put a desktop in it
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:55.400]   Um apple really is always
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:59.160]   This we're lucky we have a company like apple is willing to take a flyer
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:01.800]   They don't mistake their products for their businesses. That's one of their biggest strengths
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:03.960]   It's um
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:07.400]   We're we're lucky to have so many different companies pursuing so many different agendas
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:08.440]   Will I agree on that too?
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:09.240]   As of course
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:14.120]   As i'm fond of saying microsoft apple can do the things that a company that has
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:17.320]   Less than 10 desktop market share is free to do
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:20.920]   Uh microsoft is selling to 80 percent
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:24.280]   Uh more than 80 percent of the users out there so I
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:30.760]   All their failings in getting into mobile are absolutely true and they should be doing for that but
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:35.880]   They they were doing the things that they were able to do given the company the companies that they are
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:38.760]   I and also
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:43.800]   Apple continued the through theme of medical technology during the demo of the ipad pro
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:45.320]   It's like wow you're you're absolutely
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:50.520]   I'm sure you're going to show me like a comixology like full page high resolution. No, let's okay
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:53.320]   Let's talk about doctors diagnosing illnesses
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:57.320]   That's absolutely relevant to the people who are excited about the stylus
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:00.280]   It's they're not take I don't think they're taking much of a gamble
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:05.160]   I'm sure they've made this and they sold it this way because they know they can sell but loads of them
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:10.600]   Uh to to to to exist to a market that's really really waiting for it. Um, I just I think that it
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:15.160]   One they may know I don't know if I agree with you any these are very vertical markets
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:22.680]   Uh traditionally in a vertical market where you have a limited number of sales you charge a huge premium for the product to make up for the rnd
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:24.680]   And apple's not doing that
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:29.320]   But they they also have the arc market. I'm not I don't mean there's enough verticals to make it worth
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:33.480]   While I just I don't know I just I look at the the products that apple is made
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:35.880]   Let's put aside the ipad pro
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:42.840]   You look at the products that apple has made and I can't think of offhand because i'm only thinking about this for the last 10 seconds
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:47.160]   Now products that they have introduced for which there was no free to sesser
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:49.560]   Uh that it's always about
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:56.280]   What what markets are a lot of people making a lot of money and how can we introduce a product? That's not a me too product
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:05.320]   But moves that another step forward or solves problems that the existing people in the space aren't listening to and they aren't solving those problems for
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:13.400]   So when I see the ipad pro as new as it is my instinct is that i'm sure i don't i don't believe that that their personality is a company that says
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:18.600]   You know what we have never ever ever known has ever said that we want a
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:24.760]   cylindrical voice device that sits on a kitchen counter and gets voice commands and plays music
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:28.680]   Let's just build one and see if it sells. I don't they're not a company that likes to do that
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:33.400]   It's the closest thing though that they to in my mind that they've to that that they've done
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:41.480]   That I can think it's well one thing that's very signature for them is that this device could seriously cannibalize macbook air sales
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:47.400]   I mean again you walk into the store especially the people who are not you know 40 15 60 years old
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:50.200]   And are programmed to look for something that looks like a laptop
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:54.920]   They're looking I think that younger folks are programmed to look for something that runs mobile apps and the ipad is
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.680]   Definitely that
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:58.680]   If you again if you got a thousand bucks in your hand
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:03.720]   I mean if I if I were advising people and we we are all the position of advising our friends and our relatives
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:07.000]   And they say well, I got us about a thousand bucks. I was thinking about buying on macbook air
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.920]   I would so
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:14.440]   Put so much work into making sure that an ipad pro is not the right choice for them because
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:19.000]   I again, this is all side unseen. This is based on I haven't even had to hands on demo with it yet
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:25.080]   But it just looks like so much better a solution for an inexpensive apple desktop
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.800]   quality computer than
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:30.920]   But i'm sorry
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:34.520]   Spittle on the microphone. I think that I think that is even just by specs
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:41.480]   It seems to be on that same level as a macbook air so much so that a macbook air has to make a case for itself
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:46.840]   That it is more suitable for what this person wants to do with a keyboard and a screen than an ipad pro
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:52.280]   Maybe it was there was definitely a theme there where you could see that this thing had multiple tentacles and one was definitely productivity
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.920]   Because you have the keyboard and people who want to just have a tablet
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:26:01.000]   But once in a while use it like a hybrid and it had the pencil for people who are creative artists and designers and do media
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:07.000]   Layout and just want a more direct manipulation version of that like the the the demos that they were showing there
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.040]   Some of the apps like you saw you make leon you saw like a couple of the other
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:15.160]   I'm in the studio show me wow so fast like to be able to do that stuff that used to take hours to do
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:16.040]   You're doing it in minutes
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:22.120]   But also another one of those is for people who still no matter how easy a mac is to use or how easy windows is to use or anything
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:24.920]   They just feel alienated by traditional computers
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:29.880]   They just don't make sense to them and the ipad has and if they need more than an ipad air
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:32.200]   But not they don't want a computer experience
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:38.040]   This is there for them and my favorite thing of all of this is you have apple now with a range of products
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:39.560]   Yes, they all originally come from us 10
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:46.360]   But more recently you have the apple watch and the apple tv and the ipad and the iphone that all run the same foundation that you develop apps
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:49.800]   For in the same way that you basically have the same familiarity the same
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:57.160]   Interactive paradigms and they put interfaces on top of them that suit either the wrist or the living room the 10 foot living room
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:01.880]   Or the touch screen interface and now they're even letting the ipads sort of be its own thing as well
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:05.160]   And they've architected all their software and all their development stuff
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:08.040]   So that once you get in this stuff, it's just it's easy
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:15.080]   It's one easy step to do the next thing and they're doing that with extensibility and continuity and all these new features are all built on the same foundation
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.600]   And you
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:21.320]   Even if you haven't used it as long as you know one of those products you can pick it up and not only use it but develop for it
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:25.080]   I think that's going to be a tremendous advantage for apple moving forward. I hope so
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:30.200]   By the way, if you're worried about the Mac among other things
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:35.480]   I'm reading that john pashkasky article from a buzzfeed of his 20 minute car ride with
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:37.160]   Tim cook
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:43.000]   Cook was gonna was making his way to the new york city fifth avenue store apparently he makes these appearances unannounced
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.720]   Which must make security nuts
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:52.040]   But he says it's just too much if I if I say i'm coming then everybody you know really goes crazy and works hard
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.440]   I don't want them to do that. I just want them. I want to surprise him
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.760]   Uh, so he pops into the fifth avenue max door and causes
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:01.480]   Insane pandemonium
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:05.000]   pashkasky asks him a couple of questions as they head to the store
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:10.520]   Uh first of all, uh, is he is he worried that people will give up their max for the ipad pro
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:13.720]   And cook says I think there are some people who will never buy a computer
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:17.720]   I think that now we're at the point where the ipad does what some people want to do with their pcs
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:21.240]   But I think there are other people like myself. Thank you, Tim
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:23.720]   That will continue to buy a mac
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:26.280]   And that will continue to be part of the digital solution for us
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:29.640]   I see the mac being a key part of apple for a long
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:32.760]   For the long term and I see growth in the mac for the long term
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:38.280]   That actually is a question that that relieves me because I love the mac and I don't I don't want that to be replaced
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:44.440]   I love the diversity of the apple ecosystem at this point, but the but the mac is still my primary tool
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:49.720]   There was a great thing at the event a great moment at the event where Tim cook was walking down the hallway with one republic
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:51.240]   And no one had really seen him yet
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:53.480]   And he's like I wish I could we're in the apple tv section
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:59.880]   But I'm really can't wait to show you the ipad pro and one of the apple people next to him because they had apple people stationed everywhere with ipad pros
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:02.600]   Sort of tell you where to go said oh, you can use mine
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:05.960]   I started giving like a hands-on
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:09.640]   Two one republic and when people saw him they all you know glommed around him
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:13.720]   But for a couple moments there you were just standing there bathe the light of an ipad pro
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:20.360]   It's a great picture of him and one more public and now I have to say I feel like you really want the pencil
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:26.120]   The ipad pro is not important enough by itself you need the pencil
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:32.440]   I don't know about that. I think the screen the increased screen size is going to be big for a lot of different people
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:34.760]   Especially in music making yes
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:37.720]   Yeah, oh my gosh
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:40.680]   Control screen that would be amazing
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:43.640]   Yeah as a second screen it might be a really interesting product
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:48.280]   Yeah, I think I don't think necessarily need to have the pencil, but I think you're gonna want it
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:54.520]   No, I think almost everybody will buy one within the first six months. It's I'm not your artist. I wish I were I'm gonna
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:56.280]   I
[01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:59.160]   I'm gonna go buy drawing from the right side of the brain and practice
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:05.400]   Always always time to start. Yeah, here it is. I mean I didn't start I used to sketch a lot when I was a kid
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.880]   I kind of I kind of gave it up because I don't get it
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:10.520]   But when I had my ipad
[01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:15.080]   But my first big trip with the ipad I was in a lot of museums where no photography was allowed
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:19.560]   And I had the paper wrap so I just found myself just sitting there in the museum sketching what I was seeing
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:24.360]   And then we went to the old library at the trinity college in Dublin no photography
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:30.600]   There's why I sat there and I sold about 40 copies of paper because people were seeing me sketching with it say who an 18 different language
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:33.000]   Is about the application like
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.040]   53
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:42.200]   But yeah, I mean it's that's that's there's so many things that I have always loved about apple and I think I will always love about apple
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:49.480]   And it is how they really make these enabling devices where they take so much of the cruft out of the process of doing something creative
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:51.240]   And they just let you do this creative thing
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:56.840]   They I feel as though they build these devices to help you to enable whatever it is inside your brain to
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:31:00.520]   Come out in a creative fashion. I said that when I saw the first ipro
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:03.960]   iPad before I even used you know had one to use
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:08.520]   Uh that this is the computer steve jobs always wanted to make the computer that gets out of your way
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:12.120]   One tim cook said best exemplifies apples belief in the future of guessing
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.920]   And I think that that goes back to 1978
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:19.320]   Uh this that the technology caught up to the point where they could actually do that
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:26.680]   I I do believe that's uh, that's really what the ipad is all about and the pro is very interesting the other thing cook said which uh answers
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:28.680]   sort of
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:31.480]   A question i've had it's about the junk folder
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:38.680]   Um, and thank you john for asking that question. Why are there apps on ios that I can't delete even though I never use them
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:42.600]   Why do I have to have tips and stocks on my iphone
[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:47.800]   Cook says this is a more complex issue than it first appears. I think i'm going to call bs on this
[01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:51.480]   He says there are some apps that are linked to something else on the phone
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:59.560]   If they were to be removed they might cause issues elsewhere on the phone. That's probably true for safari. I doubt that's true for stocks
[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:05.720]   Well, so stocks actually yes stocks is integration into notification center stocks as integration
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:13.320]   Um into third party apps. Uh, there's there are a lot of underlying things where I told like when I read that i'm like, oh, yeah
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:19.320]   I guess that makes sense. No, you could delete stocks. Well, then we got serious what the stock price is what happens leo
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:23.480]   It goes and looks on the internet like all the other stuff siri doesn't know nothing about
[01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:27.800]   It's not like siri doesn't know i'm sorry. I can't help with that. But i'll do a web search
[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:30.440]   She's learned that phrase pretty darn well
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:34.360]   He also says uh, uh, there are other apps that aren't like that
[01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:38.520]   So over time I think with the ones that aren't like that we'll figure out a way for you to remove them
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:43.160]   It's not that we want to suck up your real estate. We're not motivated to do that. We want you to be happy
[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:45.640]   So I recognize there's some people that want to do this
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:50.600]   It's like one of the problems we had initially and it doesn't exist anymore because apple doesn't bundle a youtube app
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:56.520]   But previously you'd go into parental restrictions and you disable youtube so your your kid or someone couldn't use it
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:33:00.120]   And we had people including people who work for apple incorporated send us notes saying
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.760]   My youtube app has gone. Are you guys ever seen that before?
[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:06.600]   Have you looked under restrictions? They said I don't remember ever turning it off
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:10.440]   And people do that and if it's apple's model is not to put their apps on the app store
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:16.360]   The way google's is it's unclear like they are letting you hide and show icloud drive and that might be a sign of the future
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:17.640]   They do put the wait a minute
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:20.360]   They put iMovie pages numbers on the store
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:25.800]   And say when you first as part of the onboarding, you know, you get these for free you want to download them
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.880]   They could do that on big iphones
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:31.640]   They had salt yeah, but they're actually going the other way they're moving things like podcasts and now with
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:34.440]   The latest version of iOS find my iphone and find my friends
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:40.440]   Onto the device and I actually went and looked at the update history and when they moved podcasts and iBooks onto the iphone
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:42.600]   They get updated more frequently than they update
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:47.960]   In the store because apple's not like google they have no intermediation they can update anything they want any time they want
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:50.120]   So they can push out an iOS update tomorrow
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:53.640]   It it for them and knowing that everyone has a certain set of apps
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:55.480]   Let's them do a certain set of default actions
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:34:00.120]   You know if you don't have an apple watch having an apple watch app on your iOS device is just dumb
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:02.600]   Yeah, you could hide that the way you hide the iCloud drive
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:05.400]   Well, that's what we all do we make a junk folder
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:11.800]   I just don't it baffles me that apple is stubborn about so what I mean is that they're letting you hide the iCloud
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:15.240]   The icloud drive app now and hopefully they could let you hide more apps in the future
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:18.760]   To me this points to
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:22.680]   The years years long past need for apple to update springboard
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.800]   It's a really bare bones launcher. It's it's newton message pad launching really
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:33.160]   Touch 3d is the first significant thing. I think they've added to it since 1.0
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:38.680]   And if I could just simply have bring up here's here's in settings here is all the apps that I have
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:40.680]   Here are the ones that I want to show up
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:43.880]   Inside the launcher just like I the ability to on my watch
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:48.040]   Decide which apps do I want to have show up in the app and then watch launcher?
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:51.240]   That would be I wouldn't be as excited about the iPad pro
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:53.240]   But I'd be pretty excited about that one feature
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:57.080]   Let's take a break there's so much to talk about we could probably do a 10 hour show
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:01.800]   But we do have to wrap this up in about half an hour. So I'm gonna we're gonna take a break
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:03.880]   We'll come back. We've got more and
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:08.040]   I'm looking at the chat room if you've got ideas of things you want to hear about
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:13.800]   Let us know we've got a great team. There's nobody better Andy and Naka from the Chicago Sun times
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:18.760]   It's great to have you back in the in the saddle or whatever it is you're sitting on
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:22.760]   Glad to be doing a twitch show while sitting down. That's quite a close. You were impressive
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.840]   I must say in the line at Colbert
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:27.240]   Very impressive
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:29.240]   The most fun part was like
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:34.920]   People coming up to me in the line saying wow, you must really like that marquee you're taking such a long videos of it
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:36.440]   And then trying to find
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:42.760]   New the audio. Yeah, I'm actually doing a live television live show right now unbelievable showing the capy. What phone were you using?
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:46.360]   I was actually using the iPhone 6 plus and
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:48.680]   Um
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:50.680]   You were you must have had a battery
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:59.000]   Yep, it was it was plugged into an anchor battery. That was the only other thing cost me $93 in in data overages, but did it really?
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.360]   No, no
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:04.440]   I was surprised it was the the video looked really really good in both directions
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:05.720]   It was great
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:10.280]   What one of the reasons let me let me tell you a secret one of the reasons why I there are two reasons why I said yes to
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:12.760]   Of course, sure I can I can participate from the sidewalk
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:18.760]   Number one because I I knew it was going to be a lot of fun was part of my my mandate as a as a journalist and second
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:23.960]   Okay, it's Skype and its phone service in New York city. How long will this stream last?
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:27.240]   I just and it lasted for two and a half hours
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:31.880]   Hours, but there's free ice cream. I can't eat my free ice cream because i'm doing the show
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:37.080]   But we got to be in the line at Colbert at the same time and I loved that I thought that was fabulous
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:40.520]   Really and you were just using the apple earbuds what we're using for our microphone
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:43.160]   I was just using the stock apple earbuds great
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:48.120]   I again kudos to apple for making such a great product and kudos to I
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:53.960]   I never get I've been writing about technology for a quarter century now since I was since I was in high school
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:37:01.480]   And I never stopped getting excited about and there are moments where I'm thinking i'm actually participating in live HD videos
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:06.200]   Only because I have a phone in my pocket and I decided to tap a button
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:11.000]   I had something else and meanwhile they're like camera crews in the street because interviewing people
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.880]   Got the Colbert show because it's the second show like you pikers all you need is one of these
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:21.000]   Hey, I did a uh an interview with a local television reporter. She was out here for a
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.560]   a
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:26.200]   Pixar event and she wanted to do a piece for her
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:30.840]   It was you know charlotte or somewhere and I said where's your camera crew?
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:32.440]   She said i'm just gonna use the iphone
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:36.120]   She's actually usually the video looks better than the stuff we get from a camera crew. It's like
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:40.280]   Serenity caldwell is also here

[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:18.680]   Mac break weekly so I was kind of surprised in fact I got caught off guard up yesterday in the iOS today because usually apple doesn't release the new
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:23.560]   iOS until a couple of days before the new phones come out, but they're gonna do it a week early this year
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:28.200]   So tomorrow's week late. Yeah, they're doing the phones are late. Yeah, okay
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:31.000]   So tell me tell me tell me do
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.240]   Let's start with watch o s
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:39.480]   Uh, we've all seen the videos you can assume that we kind of know about the time machine zooming in and out and stuff like that
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:43.560]   What should we look for? What should we do? How is the upgrade gonna happen?
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:47.000]   I bet your serenity's been working on something
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.800]   I have um surprise surprise
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:57.640]   The the watch o s update the o s 2 update will happen very similarly to every other update that you've done so far on the apple watch
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:06.120]   Just going into the apple watch app and pressing I believe update from um from software updates sub menu
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:07.800]   So that'll be easy enough
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:13.400]   Uh the cool thing is if you don't have if you don't have an iphone like i because i keep my iphone on my son knowing i was getting the new one
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:15.400]   I'm out of luck right. I can't update the watch
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:20.920]   Yeah, well, uh, you can just your iphone and that watch are technically still paired together
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:23.720]   So henry updated yeah pretty much
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:27.080]   But he's in calorado
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:32.920]   Might be a little bit more difficult that way away. Oh wait. Oh wait. Yeah, so uh, so
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:38.760]   In terms of updating you do know your iphone, uh what i'm really looking forward to on the apple watch
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:47.960]   I'm looking down because it's on my wrist. Um, i'm really looking forward to localized apps apps that are not necessarily being run off of the iphone
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:52.600]   But have most of their package contents on the watch itself. It'll make watches a lot
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:57.880]   Make the watch uh os and and just the feel of apps go a lot faster
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:00.920]   Also apps will have access to the health sensors
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:07.560]   Um, the the accelerometer a lot of a lot of different sensors that they initially were barred access to and watch os 1
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:12.120]   Um, gosh, what else? Uh more a little bit more refined
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:19.640]   Sensors and settings for the activity feature, which is nice. You can view your weekly summary on the watch, which is pretty cool
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:27.480]   Uh, there there's a lot uh colored colored rings on the uh on the main screen for your activity rings
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:33.320]   There's just it's a lot of it's not like a big, you know banner update the way that ios 9 is
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:36.840]   But it just makes the watch feel faster and more full featured
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:39.960]   It's only five months later. It's not a full year like
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:42.200]   Right, oh it's amazing. Yeah
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:46.200]   Um, I feel I feel like it's gonna add two things that we're really I thought we're really lacking
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:51.240]   With the summer of wearing the watch one, which is as as ron said, uh local local apps
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:56.680]   So it doesn't there I I no longer even bother trying to launch apps to do useful things
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:02.200]   Uh on the watch because it means i'm gonna spend 10 seconds watch looking at spinning daisy then giving up and take it off my phone
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:05.080]   But also i'm looking forward to third party complications
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:10.680]   Because another thing that I think is lacking is that you really have to go into a launcher to make it do cool stuff
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:14.120]   Uh and the ability to not have not only have your apps
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:19.240]   Communicate something useful to you just when you glance at the screen because you've decided to you know
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:25.080]   Put your put the your your your house your home automation temperature gauge or whatever in the corner of the screen
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:30.280]   But also anytime I want to interact with fitness every time I want to act with that third party app
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:35.800]   Just tap on that and we'll launch that app and give you relevant information always been possible of course with built-in apps
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:41.080]   But uh, I I want the ability to simply tap on that corner of the screen and get an uber or tap on that corner
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:45.640]   Sorry, look at that corner of the screen and say okay my uber is now seven minutes away
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:47.960]   Uh or tap on another corner of the screen
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:54.360]   And find out that here is when the next train to boston is going to be leaving and how how soon should I need the should I leave the house
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:59.080]   Uh, so little things are gonna refime and so as I said this this continues to be a staged rollout
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:03.880]   And now I think that we officially have apple watch launched as soon as watch 2.0 comes out
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:07.240]   Will there be a uh robust
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:09.960]   choice of apps
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:14.840]   dedicated watch apps available immediately will they be where will they be they'll be in the app store on the phone
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:21.960]   The update should just happen. So basically the developer has to take the app extension that's running on the phone and move it over to run
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:24.280]   On the watch with the interface. It's always been running there
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:29.000]   The only question I have is how many have had time because they're busy updating for iOS and I and at the same time
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:34.120]   They're doing a lot of other stuff. Yeah. Yeah, so and all this there's a lot of new features that they can add to if they take the time
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:37.800]   And I know a lot of my James toms and I believe a studies updated already and a couple others have said that
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:43.480]   So there should be a good amount of native apps. They already opened the window for a submitting app. So can I um
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:48.920]   Can I will there be like a section that says hey new what you know dedicated watch apps
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:55.480]   They're really good. The app store editors are super smart and they're really good about putting together collections of things. Interesting. So look for that tomorrow
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:59.800]   Um, because what we're particularly interested in is standalone apps apps that are not
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:05.640]   Tied to the phone and one of the things we'll see immediately is apps that are tied to the phone like uber
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:12.760]   Uh, we'll launch if uber updates it will launch instantly instead of this long wait while it communicates with the phone and
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:16.120]   What's really cool is that they can access the url session stuff now
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:20.840]   So that if you if you don't have your iphone with you, but they're trying to contact a known web service
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:22.600]   They don't need the the phone anymore
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:27.640]   So if you're running and you go into starbucks and you have a messenger app that messenger app can still check with that web service
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:32.040]   As long as it knows that that wi-fi network exists. So it becomes a much more independent device as well
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:38.280]   Yeah, we're also going to find out if they're have if there have been problems with the watch simply maintaining connection to the phone
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:42.360]   Because remember that the watch still does still doesn't have gps still doesn't have its own
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:45.480]   Connection to the internet if you're outside of the house
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:50.680]   So we'll still have to get all that stuff from the phone. So if we're if it's possible that the
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:53.320]   existing off-site app
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:59.640]   Architecture was so bad that it was hiding a problem where the watch is not connecting to the phone as readily as it should
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:04.120]   If it's if that is a problem, it'll be solved pretty quickly, but it sounds we're moving forward
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:07.480]   iOS 9 will also arrive
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:10.600]   tomorrow and it'll be similar will it be a
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:13.480]   Multi gigabyte download and update
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:18.840]   1.3 gigabytes should I if I have a 16 gig iPhone should I erase stuff now?
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:22.680]   1.3 gigabytes and it'll intelligently start managing things
[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:26.120]   So for example, it can offload apps download the update then redownload the apps for you
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:29.400]   So it'll do that all transparently. We won't have that it's just cross leo
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:34.280]   Yeah, is there anything I should do to prepare my watch or my phone for these updates tomorrow
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:38.120]   Police stuff, you know, I mean a lot of people are saying take your backups now
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:42.280]   But you want to back up this as current as possible. So I always suggest take your backup right before you update
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:44.600]   You will in fact be given a chance to do that, right?
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:46.040]   I
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:51.160]   I mean if you're doing it through iTunes it typically asks you if you want to back up first iCloud runs every night when your device plugged in
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:54.760]   So I should have done a backup that night if you want to be app like if you did something major
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:57.880]   Between when you went to when you woke up and when you're updating
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:03.880]   It's always a good idea just to go into settings iCloud and hit the backup now button only cost a few minutes because it's a delta update
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:05.400]   So it's pretty fast
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:09.240]   But other than that, I usually just take this time to go through and delete stuff that I don't use anymore
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:14.280]   Not only is that safe space, but it gives me sort of like that spring cleaning feeling that I'm not going to have a bunch of crud
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:18.600]   Carrying with me to the new version you might want to do a clean install. Is there a way to do that?
[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:24.520]   I do that every year. I just tell it to set up as new set up as new and and this would be a time to do that you think
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:29.240]   It's a huge pain for people who have tons and tons like like if you've got a lot of games that you're continuously playing
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:34.280]   If you got a lot of health data or activity data that you want to preserve because that sort of stuff isn't synced
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:38.360]   Right. So if you if you have a huge amount of data you need to move with you don't even think about it
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:44.600]   But if you if you are using it as a light computer and you don't mind starting fresh every year with just the apps that you want to use then
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:47.720]   It's sort of liberating. Yeah, just just as a matter of course
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:52.200]   I think I've every single device you should do a full backup and clean install routinely
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:57.560]   Maybe not even maybe not necessarily once a year, but maybe at least once every couple of years
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:05.000]   Um, but I found the bet is the the iOS installs have been so good that I don't worry that much about it before I do it
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:09.800]   The only work the only caution that I would say is that if you are heading off on a trip
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:11.880]   Or if you are in the middle of a trip
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:17.320]   And if you feel as though being without a phone for a day would be would be catastrophic as opposed to inconvenient
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:20.920]   Then obviously don't install until you you're back to a stable situation
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:25.560]   Not because there's anything bad going on about the gm as far as I've used as far as I've seen but
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:31.400]   Accents can happen and it's you want to avoid those sort of mistakes where later on you say in retrospect
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:34.600]   It was pretty obvious that I should not have done that thing that I did
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:39.080]   If you if you're if your e-take at home is on a phone that he's working
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:42.280]   Don't mess with it. Don't wait for that phone keeps working
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:45.800]   This might be a good time to upgrade your iCloud storage plan. Yeah
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:51.960]   Well, check out plan so they especially if you haven't looked into it since the first time you signed up for it
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:55.560]   I signed up for pretty basic plan a few years ago because
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:50:02.840]   The prices were just so stupid that there was no reason for me to upgrade until I got sick and tired of getting warnings every single time
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:09.240]   I opened up my iPad and every single time I opened up my phone and realized that now I can get 200 gigabytes for just a few bucks a month
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:11.240]   so steply
[01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:15.000]   The biggest value of these large os releases is not just the
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:18.760]   OS release itself. It gives you sort of a mental
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:23.640]   Pushpin just just like they just like every time you set the clocks back
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:26.200]   That's a good time to remember to check the batteries and all your
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:31.160]   Uh smoke detectors and flashlights and make sure you've got your emergency stuff every time there's a brit
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:35.160]   There's a huge update like this. It's a good time to think about what is my backup strategy
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:38.760]   Do I need to increase my plan? Do I have a data plan that covers enough enough gigabytes?
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:44.520]   Uh is but all this all this sort of stuff give yourself a lot a lot of thought and think of it as though you're getting a brand new phone
[01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:46.520]   Because in some ways you are
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:49.000]   They don't have yearly plans anymore. Is that right?
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.480]   You have monthly
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:53.480]   This all monthly no no choice
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:56.440]   Why is that I wonder I would buy a yearly plan?
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:58.680]   You can pay for six for 12 months the same price
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:03.080]   Same price that's what I'm saying is like two months free if you buy a year something like that
[01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:06.920]   They don't do you're you're willing to shop around for different providers of iCloud backups
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:09.080]   Oh wait, no you can't you can't just answer the question
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:18.120]   What is a good amount of iCloud if you have 128 gig iPhone
[01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:20.760]   Does that mean you should buy 128?
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:23.560]   Well, you have to buy do whatever is it 200 gigs?
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:29.000]   You don't remember remember that uh, you don't when you do a backup, it doesn't image the entire phone
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.640]   It's backing up stuff that it can't get from elsewhere
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:35.400]   Um, so you don't necessarily need 128 gigs to do a complete backup
[01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:38.200]   Uh, I have 200 and that seems to be enough for me
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:44.360]   Uh, I you remember that you in case you want to use iCloud's dry iCloud drive as storage
[01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:48.680]   You want to have some extra overhead on top of that. Although use iCloud drive that much myself
[01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:51.240]   I can't follow a library can consume a lot. So that's I think the bigger
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:55.880]   Yeah, I have uh, I'm on a 200 gig plan and I still have the yearly plan because I have never
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:52:00.040]   Change that so I get a little bit of a deal. It's 45 bucks for 200 gigs
[01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:03.640]   I'm on 500 gigabytes and that doesn't exist in the new pricing. So I'm interested to see what I'll have
[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:09.240]   10 bucks a month for 500 gigs 20 bucks a month for a terabyte
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:12.520]   You can downgrade at any time
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:18.200]   Um, but if you I think if you change your plan at this point you'll lose the yearly deal
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:22.840]   See I I'm getting a bit of a deal because I bought this and it's 45 bucks a year as opposed to the
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:25.080]   $48 a year to be if I did it by the months
[01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:29.080]   Those old zero plans for sprint just now once you have me never like a yeah
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:34.760]   Okay, uh, but a bit of anything else to say about iOS nine
[01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:38.120]   What's the first thing I should do?
[01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:42.520]   Should I say hey serie nice to see you
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:44.520]   Yeah
[01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:50.280]   Hey serie show me photos of karaoke with andy from new york city. Will it do that? It does photo search now. Yep. Yay
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:54.360]   You have to you have to make andy into a face on your mac and you have to do a bunch of other stuff
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:58.520]   But it does if you have everything set up it doesn't do the face recognition by default you have to uh
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:02.840]   No, and it doesn't do it on the on iOS devices. It'll still does that on the mac
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:06.440]   Um, I'm thinking
[01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:12.440]   Because i'm doing i'm getting a new iphone. I should just I shouldn't restore I should for my old iphone
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:13.880]   I should start over
[01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:16.680]   Start from you can restore leo and if you have any trouble then you can start over
[01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:20.920]   I mean it just depends on how much time you want to put into restoring all your settings and every app and
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:26.600]   Anything else what uh your favorite new feature serenity called well
[01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:29.400]   uh proactive which is not really a
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:35.000]   Feature so much is an amalgamation of a bunch of different things the aforementioned series become more intelligent
[01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:42.680]   But more over when you scroll either to the right or if you pull down you get sort of the the old search area
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:46.920]   Which now has your most frequently texted people based on time of day
[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:53.000]   Your most frequently used apps based on time of day and also news and i've been using that a lot to kind of catch up on things
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:57.080]   And also as a quick shortcut for apps that I have used recently
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:54:01.080]   But don't necessarily want to go into the app switcher to pull that all up
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:07.560]   How about you rene favorite new feature leo I just wrote like 22 000 word time
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:09.960]   it's so i'm kind of i'm kind of burned out but uh
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:15.800]   I'll i'll never ask you again there is some I mean some i mean people are obviously going to love the content blockers
[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:21.720]   It's the safari view controller is fantastic the way that they've just taken extensibility and continuity like you can you can
[01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:24.680]   Say um, sir you remind me of this on mac break weekly
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:30.520]   Listen to twit listen to security now go to reminders press that reminder you'll be right back listening to mac break weekly
[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:37.400]   It's just so much really cool stuff in there by the way, I forgot to mention but the plans change on the 25th the iCloud plans
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:39.240]   So the prices are going to go down on the 25th
[01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:42.120]   So that may be your favorite new feature
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:46.200]   That that plan i'm paying 45 bucks a month for is going to go down to uh
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:49.240]   36 bucks
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:51.240]   I mean a year
[01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:56.120]   Uh, Andy any any uh anything you want to say look out for watch for for your new
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:02.280]   Watcher iOS um the oh really I just it's the boring one
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:04.680]   But really just split view and keyboard support
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:08.760]   Because that just makes the ipad so much more useful and so much relevant
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:16.440]   That's that has the the the the inability to switch between apps really quickly from the keyboard and the inability to have two apps on the screen at the same
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:21.880]   Time that is the reason why i've got scars up here from pounding my head on hotel desks
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:25.400]   Because that's what makes it so difficult to use the ipad as productivity
[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:30.680]   But once you have those things in place suddenly boy that 600 bucks you might have spent on an ipad
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:34.200]   Even last year is so much more valuable right now
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:39.880]   Yeah, but and and everything that renein reds it too and everybody should go to i'm more.com and read the article
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:42.360]   How to get ready for ios 9 and watch os
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:45.480]   Serenity just to push it right before the show
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:48.520]   This morning and there's lots of stuff
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:51.640]   Lots of good stuff everybody should read
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:55.080]   And of course 20,000 words from rene rich
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:57.880]   Coming tomorrow coming tomorrow
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:02.200]   Um, it's exciting. I you know, it's always exciting when you get a big ios
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:04.680]   Updater and and that i'm
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:08.840]   You know, I i'm pretty much on record is being disappointed with the apple watch its utility
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:11.640]   But i'm going to give it another shot because i think 2.0 does
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:15.080]   Significantly changes capabilities and we keep mentioning it Leo
[01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:20.920]   But it still stands to be sure everyone from the iphone 4s and the ipad 2 up as getting this update on the same day on every carrier
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:26.200]   In every region all at the same time. Yeah, and that's still that i still wish that everyone would follow that model as much as possible
[01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:30.200]   Question from one of our uh chatters if you do a backup of your iphone
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:35.320]   Uh, is the restore going to have everything including settings logins
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:37.400]   Photos
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:41.720]   Does that is that backup complete complete like your phone will be identical to the way it was
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:46.440]   Should be if you want like identical down to passwords being saved
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:50.760]   You have to do an encrypted backup on iTunes that's still the way to actually literally take a
[01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:55.480]   Almost like an image of that phone and put it there and you won't have to even enter your passwords again
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:58.760]   Uh everything else when you do a restore it might if for example
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:03.800]   Will ask you for your icloud password it might ask you for your gmail password again because they don't want a responsibility
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:07.880]   Storing that kind of information on the cloud. That's a really important point
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:15.720]   Uh, the encrypted backup is a very it's actually great because you are putting in that backup now all of your logins and stuff
[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:19.400]   Um, and so apple says we don't want to know that so
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:25.560]   Using encrypted password you set a password a backup. Do you set a password or is it just yes you do
[01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:29.800]   Yeah, and you can also with icloud keychain you can have a store a bunch of passwords
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:32.360]   But then you have to authorize it from another icloud keychain device
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:37.160]   So there it just it's if you want just a dead simple upgrade do an encrypted backup and then restore from that
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:43.800]   This is this is absolutely a privacy focus, which is great. Yeah, I mean as as as Tim is very very
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:47.400]   Uh, pleased to keep saying over and over again if you lose your password
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:50.840]   You're screwed nothing we can do about it. That's what you want. We don't know how your
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:53.960]   How your devices encrypted. Yeah, that's exactly what you want. Mm-hmm
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:59.560]   So there is still of course lots more to talk about including the fabulous performance from one republic
[01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:02.600]   Uh, but uh, no people want to know about the apple tv
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:06.680]   I think we're just out of time. We're gonna have to save that for next week, but the apple tv when is it come out next month, right?
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:11.160]   Yep, we have time mid-October. Yep. We don't have an official launch date quite yet
[01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:16.200]   So developers are getting their their kits their dev kits are getting shipped out next week
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:21.800]   I believe and I have been told one of our developers one of our iOS developers is already working on a twit app
[01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:24.840]   Where the new apple tv how great is that?
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:28.280]   I thrilled
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:32.440]   Thank you. We can be on television first class app citizen. I am thrilled
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:37.400]   Well, this was people always said why aren't you in the apple tv because apple didn't ask us you didn't have that choice
[01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:47.160]   Now we such such simple stuff just the ability to put content on that device without having an army of lawyers able to negotiate a deal with apple and convince them
[01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:53.400]   That you are important enough to have a space on apple tv. I'm amazed it took this many this many years for that to happen. Yeah
[01:58:53.400 --> 01:59:00.760]   Um, he's the lack of uh, web view gonna be I think it's gonna make it challenging for developers off
[01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:06.680]   It's their apple removed the headers from the files so that they're become essentially private apis and developers can access them
[01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:10.760]   So again like apple watch apple tv iOS. These are all exactly the same stk
[01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:15.560]   Essentially, but they greatly restricted what you can use on the apple television
[01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:17.240]   They did leave the old jason app
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:20.520]   So if you just want to make an app that the kind of style of that of which exists today
[01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:25.800]   You can do that pretty quickly, but I think they wanted to avoid the we'll just take our website put a packer
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:29.880]   Right like a thin layer around it and call that our app and go with it
[01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:34.920]   Well for that reason i'm very glad we have an api for the twit site and the developer who's working on the tv
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:39.160]   App understands that is using the api so you won't have web views
[01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:42.040]   You'll have a kind of native experience
[01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:44.280]   Uh, I can't wait
[01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:48.840]   All right get ready with your picks of the week ladies and gentlemen because we're going to do that in just a moment
[01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:51.480]   But first a word from wealth front
[01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:56.040]   If you've been watching the stock market go up and down. I guess it's it's up now
[01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:58.600]   You probably
[01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:02.760]   Is a little nerve-wracking. I mean look we all should be saving for our future retirement
[02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:10.520]   Uh, you know, maybe your family has a savings account for a vacation or a home your long-term investments are critical
[02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:15.080]   And try to remember that it's long-term you're in it for the long haul
[02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:19.240]   The question is how are you going to do that? Are you going to manage it? Are you going to rebalance?
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:25.160]   Are you going to have a little bit in international a little bit in bonds a little bit in equities and then the equities make money and you
[02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:27.720]   Put more in bond are you or you going to do all that or?
[02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:30.920]   Because that's a lot of work and you got to pay attention
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:37.960]   Or are you going to spend as much as 1 to 3% of what you have under management for somebody else to do it an advisor?
[02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:44.440]   I don't think you people the people who listen to these shows are the type of people let somebody else decide where your money goes and
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:49.960]   And that 1 to 3% is huge not to mention the hidden fees and the transactions at the same time
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:54.440]   We're all busy and what you don't want to do is kind of put your money in somewhere and just forget about it
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:56.440]   You need to kind of pay attention a little bit
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:01:00.760]   I have a great solution. It's kind of uh betwixt in between it's called wealth front
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:02.760]   You could start with as little as $500
[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:08.600]   And it's programmatic. They have software designed by some of the smartest people on wall street
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:11.080]   And it's doing stuff that is fantastic
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:14.920]   And the real key is besides the fact that it's hassle-free
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:18.840]   They only charge 0.25 percent per year
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:25.000]   So we're talking I mean 25 basis points and there are no commissions no hidden fees
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.440]   If you had $30,000 invested it'd be about five bucks a month
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:34.520]   And you get such great service including things that would be very hard to do by yourself
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:39.080]   Tax loss harvesting and direct indexing stuff that lowers your tax bill
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:42.040]   Increases your after tax returns
[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:47.080]   And it's all commission-free. It's brilliant. They reinvest your dividends for you
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:52.120]   Uh, whether your goal is long term for retirement a little shorter term
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:55.720]   They'll ask you some questions when you set up your account and they'll set it up for you
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:01:58.760]   You can have as many accounts as you want you can have a retirement account a joint account
[02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:01.880]   Uh, you know a boat fund or whatever vacation fund
[02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:09.800]   Is working so well that they have grown 20 times 20 times in the last two years now over 2.6 billion
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:11.880]   in client assets
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:15.720]   And I love it and I can't do it because SEC regulations
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:19.800]   Say that if you are a customer, you can't do an ad for them
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:23.080]   So I have to sit and watch but you don't
[02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:27.000]   Go there at least get you're a free personalized investment portfolio
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:34.120]   You'll answer some questions about your risk tolerance your time frame and they'll give you a portfolio match to your needs just customize
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:40.360]   Portfolio without any cost to you so you can really see you don't have to invest anything you really see what they would do and then
[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:45.000]   Uh start as little as $500 if you want to dip your toe in
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:48.840]   Just for twit listeners though if you sign up to invest wealth front will manage your first
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:53.640]   $15,000 without any fee for life
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:59.720]   So as low as that one quarter one percent a year is it's zero for the first $15,000

[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:32.120]   Andy, what's your pick of the week?
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:38.760]   I got I got a weird one. Uh, you know how you like you like interesting bags and now that we we're using iPads
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:41.080]   We're using mobile stuff. We don't necessarily need a laptop bag
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:47.080]   So this is this is currently my favorite bag of the world. It is a world war two surplus
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:52.840]   Swedish army gas mask bag. I was gonna say it's a gas mask bag
[02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:54.680]   It's a good
[02:04:54.680 --> 02:05:01.320]   I found out about gas mask bags after watching mythbusters where uh where adam savage walked us through all the things that is completely
[02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:06.520]   Screen accurate indiana jones costume and that's the first time after seeing indiana jones all my life
[02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:09.400]   Oh, that's an actual world war two surplus gas mask bag
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:13.320]   So I start googling for these things and saw this this caused a lot of
[02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:18.680]   The Swedish army must have like dumped a whole bunch of these like a few years ago because you can find them on ebay
[02:05:18.680 --> 02:05:22.920]   You can find them everywhere. I paid about 30 bucks for this and it's got this beautiful like leather
[02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:28.280]   Of course, it's distressed leather bottom. It's like canvas on the outside. Maybe i'll waterproof it later on
[02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:31.320]   It has an adjustable strap. It's super comfortable
[02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:35.640]   And it has it's it just it holds pretty much everything here's the outer pouch
[02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:38.280]   where i've got
[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:40.200]   container for cables
[02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:41.240]   and
[02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:43.240]   battery charger or phone
[02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:47.240]   On the inside part where you just pull up these leather tabs to get at them
[02:05:47.240 --> 02:05:51.400]   You get of course
[02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:54.600]   A full-sized ipad
[02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:56.280]   You got your
[02:05:56.280 --> 02:05:58.280]   Microsoft mobility keyboard
[02:05:58.280 --> 02:06:05.320]   You've got your of course your you don't want to leave home without your without your magic cap magic link uh communicator from
[02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:07.880]   uh 1990
[02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:09.880]   Wow
[02:06:09.880 --> 02:06:12.680]   Oh, I never leave without it because you know
[02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:16.280]   I'm actually great, but you know where's the phone jack apple, you know
[02:06:16.280 --> 02:06:19.320]   Okay, I guess I needed like sanatellics
[02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:24.840]   But the point being that it's not gonna it's not gonna hold like two days worth of city travel stuff
[02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:28.440]   But for you're out of the house for three or four hours or even for a full day
[02:06:28.440 --> 02:06:34.520]   Uh, it's it's just really really nice and it's really it's I just like how I just think it's a cool bag
[02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:39.720]   Uh and cost next to nothing like I said with shipping this cost me something like 40 bucks all told
[02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:43.560]   Uh, and that's just one I just I gave you a link to one place
[02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:47.080]   You can find it, but you can find them pretty much everywhere again. I went on ebay
[02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:50.440]   Uh, and I bought it from that's from uh a seller over there
[02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:53.160]   You can't army army surplus stores are you that kind of guy?
[02:06:53.160 --> 02:07:01.720]   I used to because unfortunately my fashion sense is I just want something that's really durable has lots of pockets and isn't very expensive
[02:07:01.720 --> 02:07:04.280]   That's
[02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:09.080]   And that's really exactly like my fashion sense as you can see has really progressed since they're now
[02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:13.960]   I've worked into you know brown instead of black and green when I was a teenager
[02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:19.480]   That's we we lived at the army surplus store and I would wear you know the sailor pants the bell bottom sailor pants with it
[02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:25.080]   You know, I still I'm just just two years ago. I should own next year next week. I should actually show them
[02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:30.920]   I think I still have them a pair of beautiful like leather gloves with like gauntleted down to there
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:35.320]   They're they're warm. They they're not like motorcycle gloves with like unnecessary padding
[02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:40.680]   And I just wore them year after year after year for like 12 years after getting an army surplus store
[02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:44.280]   And finally the fingertips just wore all the way through it one so much
[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:48.840]   And I'm just dying to find another pair exactly like them because if I find a store that has them
[02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:52.280]   I'm buying 10 and then never buying gloves again as long as I live
[02:07:52.280 --> 02:07:55.240]   nice
[02:07:55.240 --> 02:08:00.440]   Renee the only the the last recommendation just when you get it it is army surplus stuff
[02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:04.920]   So it's helps to have an outdoors if you have one of those if you live in a row
[02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:09.480]   Or send an outdoors could have put it outdoors. I had it outdoors in the sun for about 10 hours
[02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:11.560]   So I took it in at the end of the day
[02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:15.240]   Smelled great before then I was glad that I had an out little musty
[02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:18.520]   Smells like world war two you could you could smell the victory
[02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:21.960]   But it that way oh boy
[02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:23.560]   Musty
[02:08:23.560 --> 02:08:25.560]   Renee richy your pick of the week
[02:08:25.560 --> 02:08:29.800]   I have a pick but first I just want to give one more shout out to camera plus we sort of mentioned it in passing
[02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:31.640]   But it has gone it is not gone free
[02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:35.080]   But there is a new version that is free similar to pcalc and pcalc light
[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:38.760]   And if you don't want to pay up front for the full version and you really should because it's terrific
[02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:41.800]   I can't imagine there's anybody with an iPhone that doesn't have it
[02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:43.880]   Me but you know new people buy them every day
[02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:46.760]   So if you're if you're brand new and you're curious and you want to try it out
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:51.000]   You can get the free version and then you can add packs that will eventually bring you up to the full version
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.560]   If you don't just snap and buy the full version already
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:56.200]   It's terrific app manual controls filters editing
[02:08:56.760 --> 02:09:00.760]   Lisa Bettany is behind it and she is a phenomenal photographer
[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:03.800]   So it's if you have any interest in iPhone photography
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:05.800]   It's lovely so mostly Lisa
[02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:08.760]   Recently Lisa she's celebrating her first anniversary
[02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:12.360]   And she's on instagram now and her instagram feed is ridiculous
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:18.600]   Yeah, Lisa is a long time friend really love her jealousy induced so proud of her. I mean man
[02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:19.880]   She's made
[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:26.360]   Some good money on that. She has v4 video. She has several apps now. Yeah the video vie the video programs were good. Yeah
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:31.640]   Her company she's with has her her company that she co-founded has created a lot of great stuff
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:36.280]   That's the thing that makes they just clear right here as well. They did a they've done a number of really good things
[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:39.640]   She has several partners. Yeah, so real real designers. Yeah
[02:09:39.640 --> 02:09:47.480]   Super stuff the other news is launch center pro which was the originator of this launch actions on iOS and not apps
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:50.120]   They originally had a widget that was
[02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:57.640]   Available for iOS 8. I believe it was on launch day, but then after a while there was this retaliation against widgets that did things that apple
[02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:00.280]   Didn't want them to do in launch center pro as a casualty of that
[02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:06.440]   But now they've managed to bring all that back apples officially allowing launchers into widget space into the notification center
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:09.080]   Today view and they've updated they've included
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:13.800]   Support for just innumerable new apps having it in the
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:18.520]   In notification center means you don't have to go back to the home screen. I know a lot of people
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:22.120]   You know the iOS home screen is not that functional, but it's never meant to be it's not meant to be
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:26.120]   Like a place you stay it's meant to be a place that you travel to other places through
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:29.640]   And now we're getting all these wormholes where you don't even have to go to the home screen anymore
[02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:33.800]   And I love that like I love the force press to go places and I love this swipe down hit a button
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:36.200]   I'm there from no matter where else I am
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:37.480]   Uh, so
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:40.520]   If you were a fan of launch center, there's even more to love about it
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:43.560]   If you've never tried it, but you do find yourself with
[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:48.120]   Um a bunch of actions that you do often a bunch of people you contact off and a bunch of things
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:53.000]   You do a lot this lets you get to them in just a tap or two and it just saves so much time
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.160]   It's it's well worth a little bit of money
[02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:59.400]   Cool it's in the app store launch plus in contrast that oh
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:02.200]   Co the company that does it they do a lot of fabulous apps too
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:05.000]   contrast.co
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.960]   Yes, they're great. We love them
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:10.200]   contrast. Oh
[02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:13.480]   Yeah, perfect weather and other great stuff. Yep. Mm-hmm
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:16.360]   Serenity Caldwell, what's your pick of the week?
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:21.000]   All right, my pick of the week is something I actually picked up in San Francisco when I was out there
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:27.080]   Uh, there's this wonderful glasses company named jins that recently opened up a store in San Francisco
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:29.240]   Uh previous to this they were
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:35.960]   Uh, they are japanese only and they make really cute glasses and frames. Uh, you know, I don't normally wear glasses
[02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:38.040]   But I've been getting crazy headaches
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:41.720]   Um from my from my laptop and from my desktop recently
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:45.560]   And I talked to a doctor and they're like, oh, maybe you need, you know
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:48.440]   You need something to block light. Have you tried flux?
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:51.000]   Have you tried a couple of other things and I use flux
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:55.800]   But I hate the way that it looks with the the orange tinting and I'd completely forgotten about this
[02:11:55.800 --> 02:11:58.280]   And then on a trip to san francisco a friend of mine
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:03.000]   Uh, we were walking past the jin store and she likes going in and trying things on she's like, oh, well
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:06.120]   Have you seen their new crazy blue light glasses?
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:09.480]   And so they look like just normal glasses, but you notice if I tilt them
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:15.000]   You see how everything looks blue in in return. They're actually blue light blockers
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:18.040]   So when I put this on it actually automatically
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:20.360]   adjusts, uh
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:25.640]   The the blue light coming at me coming at the the glasses and reduces it by I think about a quarter
[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:29.160]   So that your eyes aren't being exposed to such dramatic blue light
[02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:31.880]   Blue light and it helps you sleep better
[02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:34.920]   Um, it's helped me with my headaches, which is really awesome
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:39.640]   And they just look like they look like normal glasses unless you shine light in them at which point you're like, oh
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:43.880]   There's there's a blue tint so it doesn't look different from your point of view looking at the screen
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:45.560]   No, it um
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:52.440]   It looks a little warmer. Yeah, it looks almost almost like a one or two percent sunglasses tint
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:56.280]   But you can't like you can't actually tell the glasses look clear
[02:12:56.280 --> 02:12:59.240]   Uh, it just to me my eyes
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:03.800]   It almost feels like when you go into a dark room and you slowly see different details
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:09.560]   A few minutes after I put this on but the screen slowly feels like it changes color dimensions
[02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:12.520]   Um, but otherwise I don't I don't notice it at all
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:16.920]   Um, but it but it just helps with my headaches and they're they're cute like you can get them
[02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:25.160]   They sell them prefab in a no in I think six different colors, but you can also get them bespoke in any of jin's uh
[02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:32.680]   Styles and they're really really useful for people who stare at computers a lot. I've been finding them invaluable
[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:35.000]   There's 60 bucks
[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:40.120]   But as you say if you get prescription glasses, you can have the tint added to any prescription glasses
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:44.200]   Yeah, exactly. So if you wear glasses normally and you stare at a computer screen, it might help
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:47.880]   It's uh, it's a retinal ganglion relief or
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:51.560]   Program there j i n s dot
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:54.600]   calm ladies and gentlemen

[02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:04.440]   So that means I guess we're gonna have to do another one next week
