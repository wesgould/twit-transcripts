[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.960]   They're all here.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.280]   We'll talk about why Apple pulled back
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.560]   beta 7 of iOS 12.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.040]   The rumors about the next iPhone.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.080]   Will there be a MacBook this fall or new AirPods?
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.600]   There's some evidence there might be.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.760]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.160]   Netcasts you love.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.360]   This is Detroit.

[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.640]   bides of the Macintosh world, Robert leads the same three guys.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.920]   But they are some of the best minds in the Macintosh world to talk about Apple.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.560]   Mr. Renee Ritchie from iMour.com, host of Vector.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.160]   We are currently flying over, it looks like JFK on your big screen TV.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.320]   It's great to see you, Renee.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.280]   "Ach, Leo Man, it's great to see you, too, I. Thank you for having me on the show."
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.080]   He's teaching us the ways of South African meat consumption.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.080]   It's the very best meat in the world.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.040]   I have ordered a lot.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.200]   All the built-on, all the built-on from the coin, Leo.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.080]   I have just ordered a lot because of you.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.000]   And it turns out, weirdly, we started talking about it, and Alex Lindsey whips it out.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.040]   And chews on it from Pixelcore.com.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.520]   Alex, how did you happen to have some built-on just to hand?
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.360]   I have done a lot of work in Zimbabwe and in South Africa, and I just got hooked on it.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.600]   I mean, and so I constantly am trying to find it in the US.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.040]   There's a couple places that I've ordered it.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.120]   And I just ordered some new built-on that turned out to be the best I've had in the US.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.680]   Where was that from?
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.680]   And that was from Bull and Cleaver.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.480]   Oh, all right.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.040]   So I just ordered some from them as well.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.040]   I just want to make sure that they were the best.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.400]   No, no, that was it.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.040]   And so it literally had shown up this morning.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.800]   So when we started talking about it, I was like, "Well, how opportunity is that?"
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.120]   I only have one thing to say, Bull and Cleaver, how much built-on do you want to sell?
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:17.280]   Also with us, another foodie, Mr. Andy Ennaco, Ennaco.com.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.080]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.640]   Hello, I feel like just to offset all the meat talk, I should talk.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.640]   I should, as my pick of the week, just pick soy curls, this wonderful vegetarian meat substitute
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.120]   that's shelf stable, very filling, easy to cook, easy to enjoy, a treat for both young and old.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.320]   You know, it's not running.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.120]   So I'm not running to...
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.760]   Well, I just...
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.320]   Oh, okay.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.880]   You could just...
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.880]   I see if I were first on deck, I would have said nothing but good things about...
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.480]   Again, I'm looking forward to trying built-on.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.800]   I've got built-on on my to-do list, but again, perhaps.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:59.040]   There are some of our listeners that are already starting to feel something rise in their throats.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.440]   I'll just talk about meat, and I just want to make sure they know that they are excited.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.000]   They are loved.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.200]   Do you want to explain this image?
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.920]   Yes, that is Lea Thompson of Space Camp and Back to the Future Frame.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:20.480]   I did an on-stage Q&A with her at Boston Comic-Con/FanExpo last weekend.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.360]   And she was absolutely delightful and charming and wonderful, and I'm glad that I dressed up
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:37.440]   in my respectable geek costume because it was hard to equal or even approach the amount of class
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.800]   that she presented on that stage.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.440]   It was a really cool weekend.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.760]   I had media passes, and I intended to just imagine that it's Friday, and I'm doing a podcast,
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.360]   and I'm thinking, "Oh, you know, maybe it's Friday.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.760]   It'd be nice to pick up my passes on Friday.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.280]   Maybe I'll just take the camera."
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.080]   And I don't know if I'll come on Sunday, but I'll try to come in on Saturday.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.920]   And then I got a phone call from a friend and said, "Yeah, we got a guy who was going to do
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.080]   eight different Q&A panels, had an accident and couldn't come.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.480]   Could you be here at four o'clock and start interviewing people?"
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:20.400]   And so I went from there to maybe desperately trying to make a train in 30 minutes and then
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.960]   talking to Leon from a camera member's name.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.040]   But he was in a dog day afternoon.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.760]   He played Leon.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.600]   He also played the Prince Humberdink in the Princess Bride.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.440]   This weekend they had almost the entire cast of the Princess Bride, almost the entire cast of that.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.880]   Did you interview Wallace Shawn?
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.480]   Because if you did, I'm going to die.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.440]   Oh my God.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.480]   You can keep Lea Thompson as adorable as she is.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.480]   I want to interview Wallace Shawn.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.000]   Oh my God.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.400]   It was like--
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.200]   Inconceivable!
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.320]   It's inconceivable!
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.040]   I hope someone got a picture of it because that's going up on my wall.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.920]   Even just talking to him backstage was amazing.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.680]   Talking to him on stage was amazing.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.880]   Talking to him backstage afterward was amazing.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.480]   He is just so--
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:12.320]   Obviously there's going to be lots of questions from the audience about the Princess Bride
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.280]   and even the Pixar stuff.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.160]   So I just said, I asked him backstage.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.600]   Is it okay if when we're just talking together before the Q&A,
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.760]   we talk about Vanya on 42nd Street?
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.800]   And it was like--
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.240]   Well, my dinner was on--
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.960]   My dinner was on.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.160]   Which is another.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.720]   No.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.200]   That's a movie all about talking with Wallace Shawn.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.000]   Again, just like--
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:42.400]   I could have gone to seven different topics like that before we even got into Pixar movies.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.200]   Does Wally--
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.360]   Though he must be a little bittersweet irony in the fact that he is there because of his
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.800]   role in Princess Bride more than anything else?
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.640]   Or does he say, "Oh, I'll take it."
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.680]   I didn't ask him about that.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.640]   I don't think anybody specifically asked about that sort of thing.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:06.960]   Obviously he wouldn't be at a cast reunion at the Pankon if he weren't okay with it.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.080]   Someone asked him a question about certain roles that he had taken.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.680]   And he gave the funniest response that amounted to sometimes when you're a character actor,
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.320]   you take jobs because they offer you money to do it.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.400]   And money is useful for many different things.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:29.760]   But he said this in the period of five minutes in perfect timing.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.840]   And whereas everybody was like, "Oh, that's the answer."
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.880]   As it went on, it got funnier and funnier and funnier even though it was just--
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.720]   Like I said, I'm hoping against hope that he will be in Boston again sometime.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.960]   And I'm hoping against hope that whoever it is, that a range of such things lets me
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.760]   talk to him again.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.240]   Because like I said, that was the one I was totally nerding out about.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.200]   That was the one where I only had less than 24 hours to prepare,
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:01.200]   but I must have spent the night before I was up super late watching all my favorite Wall
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.440]   of Shawn movies, the stuff that I hadn't seen before.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:11.280]   And my one thought I was holding in my mind was, "I don't care if the audience hates me.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.880]   I don't care if I never get asked by this organization to do Q&As again.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.680]   I just want Wall of Shawn to think I'm cool."
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.240]   That's pretty much how I would have reacted.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.760]   By the way, it's not my dinner with Andre the Giant.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.280]   That's a different movie.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.040]   Although one, I would also go to see.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.760]   I think it was you who recommended this book on Audible as you wish,
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.000]   which Mr. Shawn's in along with a number of other--
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.920]   Chris Randen, I'm sorry.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.320]   I just remember his name, Chris Randen, who played Prince Humberding.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.600]   So who's my first interview?
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.040]   I'll buy a drink.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.760]   Anyway, this is a great book if you love the Princess Bride.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:52.880]   It's the memoir by Carrie Elwis, who was the pirate--
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.320]   Well, he was a pirate.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.440]   Good, good, pirate Robert.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.040]   He was that, but sort of.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.480]   Well, it's a long story.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.520]   He was Wesley.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.480]   He was Wesley.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.120]   Wesley.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.280]   And Wesley writes this memoir.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.120]   And it is a really great story to read.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.680]   Yeah, so it was you who recommended it.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.240]   He has one of my favorite Audible books of this year.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.320]   Then I listened to this year.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.920]   Well, we should probably talk-- I don't want to,
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.360]   but we should probably talk about Apple.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.680]   No, I do.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.800]   There's a lot to say.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.760]   Should we start with business insiders--
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.840]   Actually, now I said business insider.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.760]   It is business insider, but they're just calling it--
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.240]   this is insider.com.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.880]   Kiff Leswint.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.840]   Insider Empire.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.040]   The Insider Empire.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.200]   How an invite-only meeting at Apple's luxury loft in New York
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.000]   set the stage for one of the biggest subscription businesses in the world.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.240]   In this title, luxury loft in New York was the thing that got my eye.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.680]   And Apple had one.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.920]   Is that where you have been, Renee?
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.880]   Yeah, that's where also when you see some of the YouTube hands-on,
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.480]   the early YouTube hands-on go off.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.000]   That's where that is all shot.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.120]   Is that where Tim Cook lives when he's in New York?
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.920]   Or is it just--
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.040]   No, and I've never seen any evidence of Super Bowl parties.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.240]   Frankly, I've looked for it.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:04.960]   Man, I'm a US.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.480]   But it's just a space that they can--
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.320]   I think it started off with HomeKit, where they wanted to be able to put stuff
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.080]   in permanently so that they could demo it.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.880]   And then they're getting to do more elaborate demos,
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.160]   like with things like iMac Pro and MacBook Pro,
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.080]   they want a room that's dedicated to VR,
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.680]   and one that's dedicated to music editing,
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.600]   and one that's dedicated to photography,
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.600]   so they can sort of demo the thing in all these different professional applications.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.320]   And having to strike that and reset that every time gets tedious.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.520]   So I think they've just settled on this pace of constant demos,
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.440]   and it made sense for them to settle.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:37.920]   There.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.800]   Les Wing writes about this event that happened in April 2017
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.400]   in the trendy Tribeca neighborhood, Apple's luxury loft.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.400]   A group of over 30 mostly independent software developers.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.560]   The developers at Apple's loft soon realized the hardware giant needed
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.240]   something from them, he writes.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.280]   Apple was a few months into a major shift in the App Store's core business model,
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.600]   and it needed buy-in from developers.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.720]   This is a, and you may have, we all may have noticed this,
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.920]   as more and more apps became free within App Purchaser subscription,
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.480]   and fewer and fewer apps just 99 cents.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.120]   Apple apparently was concerned that of the downward pricing pressure
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.360]   on iPhone apps, which is absolutely the case.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.760]   You know, people choke now when they see a $10 app or a $20 app,
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.960]   we used to pay $150 for applications, right?
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.720]   And if you're a member, Steve Jobs famously announced iAdd as a way to help developers make
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.360]   money off free.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.360]   That didn't work out, Southgale.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.120]   So Apple reportedly called this subscriptions 2.0.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:49.520]   The idea was, now there's, on the one hand, if you're really cynical, you could say,
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.160]   well, Apple is just looking for a way to make more money,
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.320]   but of course they were also looking for way for developers to make to make sustainable business.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.360]   And they make less money off subscriptions.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.520]   I believe in the second year they dropped down to 15%.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:05.200]   Well, that's one of the things Apple did, which is we want you to consider making your app
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:05.920]   subscription.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:11.760]   And, you know, yes, we'll take 30% as we do of the purchase price in the first year,
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.080]   but after the first year, if somebody stays as a subscriber, we'll only take 15%.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.440]   So that's the carrot.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.640]   I think I was waiting when I read this.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.840]   I think I read it this morning.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.320]   I was waiting for kind of an earthquake of outrage from users.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.760]   Is this a good thing for users?
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.680]   I mean, it's clearly a good thing for developers in Apple.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.200]   Is this a good thing for users?
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:38.000]   It's, so I did a show a while ago where I had a one password, which went to subscription
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.960]   a long ago, draft, which was just moving to subscription and a peak-alk,
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.360]   which had no intention of moving to subscriptions.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.720]   And it really did vary on a case-by-case basis.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:53.920]   And it's the crux seem to be if you were incurring costs for maintaining users.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.000]   And, you know, on an ongoing basis, like you're providing server-level services,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.960]   and you were doing a lot of things to support the app,
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.360]   it made sense for both of you to be on the subscription model,
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.280]   because that way you didn't have to time, like artificially create this big 2.0 release.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.360]   And these are the features you'll get just to drum up the port.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.600]   You could release features as soon as they were ready.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.240]   And if you were really just making an app and releasing it,
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.680]   then subscriptions made no sense,
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.280]   because it just seemed like an onerous burden on both you and the customer.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.280]   So I think the customers, I talked about this on iOS today,
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.200]   I think that the problem is when people are used to purchasing apps outright,
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.200]   they think of it like a toaster, well, I bought it.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.560]   It has the same problem as every other app model in that,
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.960]   once upon a time, we only bought a handful of apps.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.680]   We bought Photoshop, maybe Office, a couple of things,
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.000]   and they were hundreds of dollars, they came to inboxes,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.920]   and you would time maybe only by one a year and alternate the years that you upgraded.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.280]   And it was a big deal, but then we came to the age of popular apps,
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.360]   and suddenly everyone wanted to download 10 games because they were bored on the weekend,
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.880]   and that doesn't sustain $10, much less $30 pricing.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.120]   So the app prices all plummeted.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.160]   And now even, I think subscriptions are just a temporary measure too,
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.480]   because very soon subscription fatigue hits,
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.200]   and you're like, I really can't afford four subscriptions.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:14.000]   I want four apps, but I can't pay 10 bucks or whatever, 10 bucks a year for 50 different apps.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.120]   And I don't think it's a stopgap, it's not going to solve the-
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.680]   Alex, you've developed apps, you sell apps.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.760]   What do you think?
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.920]   I think that, I do think that the,
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:29.040]   what I worry about with any kind of business model that is a pay once is that
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.000]   it's hard to kazza developer to keep doing it.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.120]   So if there's an app that I really want, to be honest with you,
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.400]   I kind of want to have a small subscription, or I want to know that they're going to be making
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.640]   money. It's why I'm not that excited about free apps.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.240]   I don't want to depend on free apps.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.960]   I mean, either they're selling some kind of advertising, or there's something else going on,
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.960]   or I'm afraid they're not going to be around.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:55.280]   And so I think that we do have to think about the sustainability of what's going on.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.800]   And if we're willing to, as users buy those, I think that that's the way we go.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.960]   I definitely subscribe to some pieces.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.920]   And what I find with a lot of the apps that I've subscribed to is that they are doing updates
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.960]   regularly.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.680]   And what you're doing is, as you have that, that creates a much more stable business model for
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:17.280]   the developers, which allows them to invest. When you know that you have a certain amount
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.400]   of money coming in over time, you now can invest in resources.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.320]   You can invest in hiring more people. You can do all of the things that you need to do to
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.240]   create a more stable business plan.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:33.200]   And so when you have that situation where you get a surge, then it's hard to figure out what
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.040]   you're going to do after that. And I think that it's good for the ecosystem.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.120]   So I think that indirectly it's good for the user.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.600]   I do think that Renee is correct that you could end up with.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.480]   I know that I now look at subscription models.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.800]   And if I see a subscription, I kind of go, "Well, do I really need that?"
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.800]   It's definitely a, I think, through that process.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.240]   Now, if the subscription is low enough and the payoff's high enough, then I'm fine with it.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:01.280]   But I do think that it's important for us to figure out how those developers are going to
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.520]   make a real business out of it, as opposed to—
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.880]   And I don't think it's for everything.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.360]   I think that the other thing is that I don't think that a flashlight model,
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.000]   you know, I get a little app that does something cute.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.880]   If I've developed that, I definitely would not be thinking about subscription.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.320]   I'd be like, "Ah, it's $4."
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.280]   But once you start getting into— I mean, some of these apps that people have released
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:29.280]   are very, very complex. And, you know, any other time they would have cost $40,
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.320]   you know, on a Mac.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.000]   And so the fact that they're only, you know, a small subscription, I think,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.200]   makes up for that, to some degree.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.840]   Yeah, but there's another side to it.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:42.000]   I just do think that whenever I see a really well-made piece of software
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.560]   and the maker is charging a fair price for it, like not the price that people want to pay,
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:51.760]   but a fair price for it, that does make me happy because I think that the more money that
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.600]   they're getting from that app, the more likely it is they're going to be able to continue to
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.520]   support that app years and years in the future.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.120]   And so the result is more cool apps, more awesome apps in the App Store.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.160]   There are a lot of back sides for the users, though.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.280]   One of them is I really think that auto renewal should not be possible.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.600]   I think that every time you're about to be charged for another year's worth of access to a certain
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:22.000]   app or when a 30-day trial expires and you're about to be charged, that doesn't happen automatically.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.120]   You will get a blip coming up saying that, "Oh, by the way, your subscription has laps.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.760]   Push this button to buy another year's worth of this thing."
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.160]   Because I can't tell you the amount of money that I've wasted because there's something that
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.920]   there's a photo app or something that I tried that was kind of okay, but after three or four days,
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.320]   my attention was grabbed by a much, much better app, but then I forgot all about it.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.320]   And now here it is, I think I'm being charged another $7 for it.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.120]   And I have to remember to keep looking at that page to look at my active subscriptions.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:57.920]   It's also a pain in the butt when you have an app like One Password, where I, again,
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.160]   I want them to keep making money. This is one of the most important apps that's in the stable for
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.520]   both Mac and iOS. But when it comes time where I'm really in the middle of a workflow and I need
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.920]   to sign up for a new account for some new server that I've put in and it tells me, "Oh, by the way,
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:17.120]   you can't create new stuff because your subscription is lapsed. Go over here and buy another year's
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:23.200]   subscription." And it's like, "But now it's eat. I've got the $40. It's not that. It's that now I
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:29.680]   have to stop everything and either stop everything and be distracted for a few minutes to go and
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:36.160]   enable the ability to get this password recorded in one password. Or as is more likely, I will simply
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.240]   either just, "Okay, I'll get that. I'll do that later." And either, I don't know which one is worth
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:45.280]   right down the password in a much less secure place or be, "Forget to write it down at all."
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:50.800]   And that's just a big pain in the butt. So it's not neutral to users. I think that there's some
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:55.440]   work to be done to make it better. But again, anything that helps people, helps developers
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.640]   be able to charge a rational amount of money for all the work that they're doing,
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:06.000]   I'm completely in support of that. I think this became, my thinking changed on this
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:13.280]   some years ago. Remember, delicious. I use delicious all the time for bookmarks. It was free.
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:19.360]   It was a great bookmarking site and eventually got sold to Yahoo and just kind of disappeared.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:26.400]   And a guy, but I was completely relying on it. A guy named Maché Chiglowski
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:32.240]   noted this. By the way, he's a great thinker. We got to get him on triangulation at some point.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:38.880]   Carsten, because he's a local. I created this thing. This was a delicious equivalent. We even
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.280]   used the delicious API called Pinboard. But he said, "But it's not going to be free because
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:49.360]   I would have no incentive to keep it up to date. I would have to run the servers.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.360]   You got to pay for it." At the time, he was paying the longer you waited, the more it cost,
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:59.200]   which was, I think, quite clever. At the time, it was a one-time only thing. Now,
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:06.320]   it's $11 a year worth every penny. And that's when my thinking changed because I was so
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.560]   reliant on delicious. And by giving it away, they basically undermined themselves and they
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:16.880]   stopped developing it. But Maché, by saying, "Look, this is going to be a steady income.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:23.920]   I'm going to keep it going." We completely rely on it for my workflow for all of our shows,
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.800]   including this show. There was that excellent blog post from Will Shipley. It must have been
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.680]   like five years ago called Farmers vs. Minor. There are some developers who want to build
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.520]   something great and some developers want to strip out every cent they can and sell to a
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:42.480]   VC or an internet company. Unfortunately, there's such a lot of money to be made right now,
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.200]   being a minor that a lot of people are doing that. But I would rather work with farmers.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.720]   And so I don't... Now, this has come up in an interesting way. So I think a lot of the problem
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.400]   that people have comes from the fact that it's hard to change business models. So once we start
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.000]   giving away Twit, it's going to be... It would be really... And I'll never do this, but it'd be
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.400]   almost impossible to say, "Now you've got to pay." Because people just say, "But no, it was free.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.920]   Why am I paying now?" So you can't change in the middle of the stream. You have to decide at the
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:20.320]   beginning and go with it. But I feel like... The analogy I use when I was today is when you buy a
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:25.440]   toaster, that's it. That's the thing. It's not going to get any better. If it breaks,
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.600]   if it's under warranty, they'll fix it. But otherwise, after a year, you're going to pay to fix it.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.400]   Toaster is a service. A toaster is not a service. It's a toaster. And so people understand that.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:40.000]   And it's 35 bucks, and that's that. But software's not like a toaster. A lot of software, like
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.120]   Pinboard, has a server that has to be run. That's a constant cost. And you also want your software
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:49.920]   to be updated, whether it's new features or maybe even more importantly, security fixes, bug fixes.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:55.520]   You want the attention of the developer. That costs him money. Nobody can work for free.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:02.160]   Here's where it's come up lately that I think is really controversial. Plume, which makes a
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:08.640]   router. Now, until recently, routers were toasters. You'd buy a $40 link, you'd use it till it broke,
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.640]   and then you can get a new one 10 years later. But more recently, I think we understand routers
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:20.000]   are not toasters. That they need to be constantly updated, at least for security, if not for features.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   And in particular, mesh routers, which are, and Plume is a really good example, they are always,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:34.560]   they say, monitoring usage on your network and update constantly to change QOS, to shape your
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:39.760]   bandwidth so that everybody gets a fair amount and everything works. And now they've said, and this
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:45.120]   was very controversial, because remember, you were just paying for it like a toaster. No,
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:49.440]   you're going to have to pay us 100 bucks a year or whatever it is for a subscription. And the
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.040]   thing that was really controversial. And if you buy a Plume and you don't pay the subscription,
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.560]   it will stop working. And that was very controversial. Now, Eero, one of our sponsors,
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:04.000]   does the same thing, but it's not, it's not black or white. The Eero will continue to work, but
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.400]   I gladly pay $99 a year for Eero Plus, which has a lot of additional features, including constant
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:15.440]   updates. And more and more, I'm thinking a router is not a toaster. It needs to be regularly updated.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:20.640]   And I think, frankly, people need to start thinking of a router as a subscription, as a service.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.680]   People don't want to do that. Because for years, it was a toaster.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:32.800]   I agree. I agree completely because not only it's not only from security point of view, which should
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.720]   be pretty obvious that this thing's need to be checked and they need to be updated for security
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:42.800]   patches, but also just the simple way that your needs and your use of a network keep changing.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:48.160]   And every time you drop a new box on this network, you would like to have some help in trying to
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.560]   make sure that your port forwarding or setup, you've got your firewall is still intact,
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:57.680]   even though you've installed the ability to connect a certain local files remotely.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:04.800]   And the ability, if it's just a pay us $30 a year just to keep the lights on, that's no good.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:13.200]   But if you if you develop this as a, we will essentially have this device phone home, so to speak,
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.920]   and tell us, tell us it's a common operational state, like the status of its firmware,
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:23.360]   the status of its security, and we will make changes or ask you to approve changes if necessary.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.720]   That's the sort of thing that people would much rather have taken off their hands. So
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.480]   it depends on how you present it. For a representative value to a consumer, people will pay
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:35.120]   simply hijack their, they're something that's working and say, unless you pay up, it will not be
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:40.480]   working again. That doesn't work except for certain parts of Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia,
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.080]   you know, the mob controlled areas of the city.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.040]   But there is so much pushback against plume. People are furious.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.280]   Oh, it's in bright soil.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.600]   Or at least so that wasn't that wasn't the deal I signed up for.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.720]   Well, oh, but as a, by the way, I have a reminder, as a as a as a I'm grandfathered in for free.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:03.280]   So you it is the deal you sign up for if you buy a new plume. So if you had a plume before, as I did,
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.640]   they said, no, no problem. You don't have to ever pay the subscription. You have a lifetime
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.160]   subscription. One of the deals plume offers is $200 for lifetime subscription. So
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.000]   I guess for people who think want to think of it as a one time purchase, you could do that.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.600]   It's just much more expensive.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.600]   Just like you said, it wasn't the expectation, the credit,
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.320]   expectation, all debt because you buy it. You expect it to just work.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.720]   And when it doesn't do that, something doesn't match.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.240]   I try to think of it as an investment. Like Andy's point earlier, when I buy an app,
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.920]   I want that app to be around a year from now, five years from now, because I get used to using it.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:35.040]   I develop habits and workflows that depend on it. And me just giving them $2 and expecting it to
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.520]   work for 10 years is really, it's really poor investment strategy. So I've, like I said,
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.360]   I hide Craig, Hawking, break, and I stuff dollars in your pockets when you're at WWDC.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.720]   Please take more money. Please.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.600]   Yeah, I'm kidding. Yeah.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:51.120]   But we just need sensible ways and scalable ways to do that. And I think we're still in a lot of
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.360]   some kind of like Amazon famously tried a subscription, and all you could download
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:00.560]   subscription service, there's one for the Mac as well. And Netflix has done that with other
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:06.240]   forms of content and textured that with, you know, with newspapers. And it's not hard to believe
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.960]   that one day apps will be in the same or similar business model where there's one subscription,
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.480]   and you pay that every year and you download all the apps you want to use, and everyone gets
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.400]   reimbursed the way that Spotify works. It's just we're still so much in flux.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.880]   Well, and I think that, and I do think that to get back to something Andy was talking about,
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.080]   just forgetting, I mean, I think that there was one point where I looked and realized I was paying
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:31.120]   like $150 a month in subscriptions. I think that may be more sensitive to it.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.200]   I mean, because the same thing, I'm experimenting. I go, I'll just try this for a month and
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.120]   I just forget about it. It's definitely worth it. I think the one one of my complaints is that
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.200]   it is hidden, you know, so it's not something that you can just go look at my subscriptions.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:49.200]   You can, but it's not like a easy thing to do. So you have to, you know, go into the app store,
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.120]   the iTunes and app store in your preferences, and then you have to click on your Apple ID,
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:58.720]   and then go into it, and then you'll see some. It's kind of like, it's the kind of hide it down.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.960]   Yeah, but it's of all of the ways to do this. At least it's all in one spot.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:08.160]   And I can go there and it tells you very clearly what you subscribe to,
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.560]   what's going to expire, what you'll will new and you could, and I go there regularly and
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.240]   everybody should because you'll be surprised all the stupid things you've subscribed.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.640]   I wonder if that's not a concession because like it's hard to see a company like Netflix or HBO
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.240]   allowing Apple to do subscriptions for them if it was an auto-reno because that's what they
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.120]   have on their side already. So it would be a huge step back.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:32.720]   HBO is a perfect example because HBO, I literally don't have an HBO account.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:38.400]   And then when I, unless I forget, but I won't have it except for Game of Thrones.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.160]   And so Game of Thrones comes on and I turn it on.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.840]   And then I let it run and then Game of Thrones ends and I turn off because it's the only thing
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.480]   I care about on HBO anymore. And that's their fault.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:51.280]   They need to make something on that keeps you subscribed. That's actually their up to on.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.240]   It's the five Game of Thrones spin-offs, Leo, that we'll be getting it.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.560]   Yeah, it's on them. But Andy, you gave an example, which kind of is counter to
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.120]   that point that subscription should automatically, you should not automatically renew one password.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.120]   There are things where you would want it to automatically renew so it doesn't bug you.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.920]   So just keeps going. As long as you want one password or Netflix, it should just auto renew.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.840]   I don't want to, I would hate to have to renew Netflix every month or year.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:22.960]   So long as well, maybe the best way to do it is, what I don't like is that by default,
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:27.840]   it will simply auto renew. What if the first time it at the first time it has renew, it asks,
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.840]   and there's a checkbox saying automatically renew, never asked me this again.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.840]   That would be fine. That would be fine.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.520]   Okay. There's a compromise. Yeah.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:42.400]   A lot of subscriptions now are a yearly, $99 a year seems to be kind of a standard.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.760]   Everybody seems to be doing that.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:55.680]   I understand people don't want a lot of subscriptions, but I think you got to think about,
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.680]   you do want services. You want a router to be updating.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:04.480]   You want, you want, you want to look at it when it's,
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.960]   yeah, but then, and it's 12 things though. It's hard. And when it's 20, and when everything is,
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.320]   it's not that hard, just put it on your credit card. It just happens, right?
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.400]   But also, I mean, wait for it all.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:19.360]   I would like to minimize the amount of nickel and diming that I'm feeling. I'm going through
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:26.720]   every time where I love this transaction, where I will give you $163. You will give me
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:34.400]   a Wi-Fi router that will work great. And I don't like the idea of, I will give you $163,
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:40.480]   and you will give me a router that will work for a time until I start paying you $6 a month to
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:46.160]   keep it running. And it also, it is also particularly in the point of view of software,
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:50.560]   developers can really be shooting themselves in the foot because from your point of view,
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:55.120]   $5 a month is just not a whole lot of money. But just like Renee is saying,
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:01.280]   it's $5 here, then $6 there, no, the $3 there. And before you know it, by the time you really
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:07.680]   audit all of your subscriptions and auto-pays, you've got $130 worth of apps that you thought
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:13.680]   that you kind of liked. But that's like every single month you have, you're paying for a new $90
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.640]   dollar. That's why you should check. Whatever. That's why you should check. But I also don't
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:21.040]   think you should be freeloading. And I understand people don't have unlimited funds. Some people
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:27.280]   can't afford it. But that doesn't, because you can't afford it doesn't mean that you're not
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.920]   getting value for money. It doesn't mean you can go buy a Bentley for $100 because I can't afford
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:36.800]   a Bentley. It means the subscription has to give value. That's a lot like you can't just add a
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:42.480]   subscription model. I mean, just add a subscription. No, absolutely. Meghan was talking about a QR code
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:48.320]   reader that her son had inadvertently downloaded for her eyes iPhone that was $50 a year.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.480]   Yeah, there's no reason. There's some really bad subscription scams on the app store.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:59.440]   Yeah. So there are scams. But so obviously, the amount that you charge should match the amount
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:05.280]   it's going to cost you to give these services. I mean, it should be a fair thing. But as long as
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:10.640]   it's fair and equitable, I think it's unfair and inequitable for a customer to say, well, but I
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.840]   just can't afford all this stuff. Well, then you don't get it. You don't get to use it.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.240]   You can't afford it. You don't get it. If you don't want the auto renew as well,
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:23.280]   as one of the things that I've started to do because I was after I realized I was paying so much
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:32.160]   is I will subscribe and then I put a little reminder to unsubscribe tomorrow. So I literally
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:36.880]   unsubscribe because you still get it. And for the period, if you subscribe for a month or a year,
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:42.400]   you'll get it for that year or you'll get it for that month. And so I just, things I'm not sure
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.320]   about, I learned that I have to do it while it's still fresh or I'll just completely forget.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:52.560]   And so I just literally the next day, I just unsubscribe. And I'm like, well, if I miss it,
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:58.960]   then I will resubscribe. But I just kind of set an expiration date on that process. And I do think
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.280]   I'm a little leery of the ones that I really don't like are big numbers that are a yearly
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:08.240]   subscription. Those really bug me because I feel like if you want a subscription, it's fine.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:16.000]   And I like the idea that you're going to pay a fair value for an app over a year if it works.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.080]   So let's say that that might be worth $30 or $40. And I'm going to now pay
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.840]   little bits all the way up. If I decide halfway through that it wasn't worth it,
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:28.800]   then I turn it off and they don't make as much money. And that keeps our app developers honest
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:34.240]   as well of constantly updating it and making sure that it's a great app. But it allows me to
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:42.160]   decide what I think that having it grow so that if it worked for a year, I paid a price of an app,
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.800]   more than a price of a coffee, which is what it is now. When I think about apps, I go,
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:51.520]   oh, can I sell it for $4? And if I can't think about how to develop it,
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.640]   which I think of a lot of ones like that, and I'm like, I can't develop it and sell it for $4.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:33:01.120]   So then I move on. Well, that's another argument. If you want developers to make great apps,
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:05.200]   and I think there's plenty of people are making that equation.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.880]   Well, there's us. Does it make sense for me to make this because I won't get paid appropriately.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:15.920]   And one thing I'll say is that one of the reasons that the iPad doesn't get updated as often is
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.160]   because all the apps pretty much run on it pretty well. And one of the reasons that's the case is
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:26.000]   because people can't sell very many $60 apps on the iPad where they could put the kind of R&D
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.560]   that's required to take full advantage of the hardware. So you end up with a lot of apps that
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:35.040]   kind of run on lowest common denominator. And I think that if people were making more money on
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:39.120]   those, they would push the hardware a lot harder and it'd be more fun.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:43.280]   And so finding ways to make sure that I think that Apple more than anything else is just
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.600]   trying to find ways to make that ecosystem healthy.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:49.280]   Yeah. There was a great article by Ben Thompson a couple years ago about
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:54.160]   bundling where he says everybody hates bundling until you're no longer bundled.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.400]   And then you see what the individual price right? And it starts to add up. And I think that's in
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.480]   this case too. Like we talked about it previously. You get Spotify, you get Apple music and you get
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:06.800]   pretty much all the music. You're not paying for Atlantis records separately and Interscope records
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:12.880]   separately and Celine Dion separately and Beyonce separately. But that's what's happening right now
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:17.680]   in the TV market where every network and every company is spinning up its own streaming service
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:22.400]   and asking 10 bucks a shot here for C-dope for PC and Marvel.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.880]   There's already noises being made about unbundling in music as well.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:34.480]   Absolutely. And the problem with that is only only Beyonce or Celine Dion can do it.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:38.720]   And then if you're an up and coming young artist, that is a pretty tough proposition.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.600]   Oh, you got to buy our app and subscribe if you want to listen to our music.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:45.600]   And it goes back and forth. So people want the unbundling because they think they'll make more
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.040]   money. But then they realize that people very quickly develop subscription fatigue
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.480]   or payment fatigue or micro payment fatigue. And then they start to bundle again.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.480]   And that's why I think inevitably we'll get bundles by content type where you'll subscribe to
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:00.880]   your new, subscribe to your movies, you'll subscribe to your music, you'll subscribe to your apps,
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.280]   and it'll be much less cognitive load.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:07.840]   Interesting. And I think we're reaching a saturation to a point where I think that the
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:12.240]   market has gotten pretty crowded. And I think that the problem really is going for people,
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:17.440]   newcomers coming into this is going to be that a lot of us have reached equilibrium.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:22.560]   Like we have the content that we need. For my household, my wife likes watching,
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.720]   so you think you can dance. And so we have Hulu because at least it means she can download it
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:32.160]   without ads. I want to be able to watch the Steelers and so we have YouTube TV. And I also
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:40.400]   have the NFL subscribed in India. So that way I don't get any blocking. And then I have HBO
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:44.000]   when Game of Thrones is there and I have Netflix. And it's like, it's kind of like,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.960]   okay, I can't even handle that kind of content. That's all the content that I have time for and
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.440]   more. And when I saw Disney, Disney's going to put a bunch of stuff out and I'm like, that chance.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:59.600]   I'm not even getting a rise out of that. And when people talk about new subscription services,
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:05.680]   I'm like, I've got my YouTube TV, I've got for live, I've got all my little slots filled now.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.360]   And I think that I don't think I'm the only one.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.200]   What a developer is... Go ahead, Annie.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:16.000]   I was just saying that's the big risk. You think that, hey, I'm selling out concerts.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.920]   I've got this huge, huge street team. All my fans love me. They're more than willing to spend
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:27.360]   $6 or $10 a month to have exclusive access to my albums and stuff. And then that's when you find
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.960]   out that they love you, but they love being able to simply click a button on Apple Music and get
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:39.360]   the album. They don't love you enough to find an extra eight bucks a month for you or to automatically
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:45.440]   remember to renew you when they switch credit cards or whatever. It's a tough, tough world up there.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:50.400]   What do Renee, what do developers think about the bundles, like the humble bundle and stuff like
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:54.960]   that? Is that good for them? There was a lot of outrage at first when they first started happening
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:59.520]   because they believed that there was already so much pressure to devalue apps that it was
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.920]   just contributing to it. It was one more thing in literally training your customers to wait for
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:08.640]   your app to go on sale or to be bundled or something like that. But I think we saw a lot of those
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:12.560]   kind of protests early on. I think over time, those are sort of lessened. And I don't know if
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.760]   that's just because it's learned helplessness and they're all in the fetal position going,
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.240]   you know, I will try it out. We'll try anything at this point. Or if it's just they figured out
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:25.680]   that there are ways and there are times when it makes sense. But I think there is, you know,
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:31.520]   it is a big concern. Apps went from being incredibly scarce to being an overabundance.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:35.600]   And that is totally destructive for a marketplace. It's like wooden toys to has
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:40.560]   bromanufactured plastic toys. It goes from artisanal, from craft to mass production. And
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:44.880]   no industry survives that without massive disruption. And we were seeing that in apps for the last
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:53.120]   few years. Let's take a break. When we come back, oh, this is a little bit scary. Max can be remotely
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:59.600]   hacked when connecting to Wi-Fi for the first time. Lily Hey Newman writing for Wired will tell you
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:04.560]   what you should do about that. It's a love black hat abstract day. When that comes out,
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.400]   everyone just reads all the abstract published published published. There are a ton of things
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.120]   coming out of black hat and Defcon Defcon was this weekend. And
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:16.000]   why does black hat have to be so close to voting voting primary days?
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.800]   Could you do it a year a little earlier just so we could prepare? Yeah. You saw the voting machine
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   hall of voting machines that were all hacked. Yeah, by 11 year olds. But one was one was a website
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:34.640]   stated secretary states website and 11 year old. Rachel Tobac showed how easy it was to get
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:40.480]   root access on a voting machine that is currently in use in 18 states. You go into the voting booth
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:44.320]   two minutes later, you have root access to the voting machine. You could change counts. You could
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:50.880]   do anything you want. And if you live in Georgia, maybe you want to go back to like some of a
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:55.440]   lord of the fly sort of way of figuring out who leads because that's probably going to cause
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:00.480]   less disruption than whatever's happening to your electronic voting. That was that was that one
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:06.800]   district in Georgia that had something like 200 registered voters but got 800 votes.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:15.600]   Yeah. Yeah. And they're saying we're fine. Everything's fine. This close. So long as we're
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.640]   so long as the party that decides these rules decides that they're being hacked in our favor,
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:25.840]   it's fine. That's really what it is, isn't it? As long as it's okay, as long as it's good for us,
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:32.160]   I don't care. Who's going to ask you who's going to pay for this? Well, Congress did it
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:38.000]   approve $365 million worth of grants that you haven't asked for. Yeah, but in principle.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:46.720]   So in the mud Creek, Habersham County's mud Creek precinct in Georgia, 276 registered voters
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:51.840]   cast 670 ballots. 243% turnout.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:58.800]   But you know what? We've been trying to get voter turnout for up for a while. So I'm happy. I'm happy
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:02.080]   about that. They're making up for the folks that aren't coming. That's right.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:09.360]   You know, they say vote early vote often. Yeah. You know, maybe maybe what you said before about
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:14.800]   that pricing model where the sooner you buy this app, the lower the prices, maybe a new rule that
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:20.960]   says earlier, the earlier on voting day, you vote, the more counts votes will be counted as your vote.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:26.960]   So if you vote it, if you vote at 7 a.m., you get 10 votes. If you vote like a half hour before,
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:32.560]   that's when you get your one vote. I like that. Our show today brought to you by our fresh air
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:39.440]   in the studio. Smells good, doesn't it? Even though there's smoke in the air from fires,
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:45.680]   from the whole state of California, printing down, apparently, there's, there's VOCs, there's
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:52.800]   all sorts of stuff. We've got a molecule, air purifier, and we love it. So molecule invented,
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.360]   reinvented their hair purifier. You're probably familiar with these. See that HEPA filter on the
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:03.920]   video there? That was invented in World War II for 50 years of antiquated technology.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:09.520]   It was just basically a filter molecule does a lot more. It's using it does have a filter,
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:17.120]   but it also has the Pico air purifier photo electrochemical oxidation. It captures and
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:22.880]   eliminates particles that get right through a HEPA filter. Particles a thousand times smaller
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:31.120]   than those a HEPA filter can catch, including allergens, mold, bacteria, viruses, airborne chemicals,
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:37.520]   the volatile organic compounds coming off paint. It can capture them. It is an amazing thing.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:43.040]   And I know it is because we moved into the country about four years ago, and Lisa ever since
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:48.400]   has woken up with sinus headaches from the allergies, till we got the molecule. We got the molecule
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:54.240]   about a year ago. She's so happy. She wakes up with that headache every morning, except,
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:59.520]   and this is how I know it's working when we move. If we take a, we go on vacation or we take
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:06.720]   a night somewhere else off. She gets that again. It's amazing. It really works. M-O-L-A-E-K-U-L-E.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:14.160]   It makes it easier to cope with asthma allergies and just dirty air. And if you work in an office
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.240]   where they can't open the windows like here in our studio, this is a must. This is a must.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:25.680]   The technology was funded by the EPA extensively tested by real people like me, verified by third
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:30.400]   parties and university labs like the University of South Florida's Center for Biological Defense
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:36.320]   and the University of Minnesota's Particle Calibration Laboratory. It's kind of the apple
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:42.880]   of purifiers too. See that aluminum? It's beautiful. It's a loom and shell. It will pair with your Wi-Fi
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:49.040]   and automatically order new filters when needed, which is really nice. You can connect molecule
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:53.440]   to your Wi-Fi network, control it remotely from your smartphone. I use the molecule app on my
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:57.280]   iPhone, but you don't need to. If you're one of those people who doesn't want that,
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:01.200]   no problem. You can obviously completely control it from the buttons on the top.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:07.440]   We liked it so much. We got one from Michael, our son, and then we got one in the studio.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:12.160]   We're already talking about getting some more. It covers a lot of territory too.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:21.280]   You can have 600 square feet and it'll cover it all. I like sleeping with the windows open in
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:27.520]   my room. It's doing a lot of work, but it keeps it clean. I love it. $75 off your first order.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:34.880]   I'm glad to say they're back in stock. M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E.com, best new product of the year,
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:40.480]   according to the Edison Awards, Times Best Invention, one of their 25 best inventions of 2017,
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:47.120]   Popular Science 10 Greatest Home Innovations of the Year, an air purifier that actually works.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:55.600]   Find out more on the website. M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E, molecule.com. If you want $75 off your first order,
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:04.800]   use the offer code MAC BREAK. Really, can't say enough good things about the molecule.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:09.360]   Molecule, M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E.com, offer code MAC BREAK.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:16.320]   All right. Hacking a brand new MAC remotely right out of the box, Lily Hay Newman.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:25.200]   This is, yeah, it's another one of those Black Hat demos. It uses Apple's device enrollment
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:30.320]   program and its mobile device management platform. This is so that employees can walk
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:35.200]   through the customized IT setup of a MAC without having to get IT involved. However,
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:42.000]   according to Jesse Endall, Chief Security Officer of FleetSmith, which is a MAC management firm in
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.400]   MAC Belanger, a staff engineer at Dropbox, we found a bug that allows us to compromise the device
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.920]   and install malicious software before the user is even logged in for the very first time.
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:56.320]   By the time they're logging in, by the time they see the desktop, the computer's already
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:04.560]   compromised. Good news, there was a fix in 1013.6 high Sierra last month, but there are still plenty
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:09.600]   of devices with older versions of the operating system that will be arriving. And, you know,
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:14.640]   I presume if you re if you wipe your drive and start over, you're also vulnerable. It's part of the
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:20.080]   setup. The way it works, it checks in with the Apple servers to say, "I'm a Macbook with this
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:24.800]   serial number. Do I belong to someone? What should I do?" And if the serial number is enrolled in that
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:31.040]   Dapper MDM, then a predetermined setup experience sequence happens, which I guess
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:38.800]   could include malicious software. You'd have to do a man in the middle. It doesn't sound that easy.
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:44.800]   They can only demonstrate a version of it at Black Hat because end all works at
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.840]   Fleet Smith, which does this kind of thing so they can set up the server.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:51.760]   I think this isn't something to worry about too much and Apple has fixed it.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:57.600]   I bet you the one time when you really want to listen to someone who says that they found a bug
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.760]   is, "Hey, it's like three months before Black Hat. It'd be really great if you fixed this before
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:06.640]   Black Hat." Well, the good news is obviously they did notify Apple and that's why it was fixed before
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:13.920]   Black Hat. There's another one. This is from Defcon, I think,
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:22.000]   which follows right after Black Hat. This is Patrick Wardle. We know Patrick Well,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   right, former NSA staffer, Mac Hacker. This is using the mouse key. This is one hard for Apple
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:38.720]   to fix because it uses mouse keys, which is synthetic clicks as part of the accessibility
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:50.160]   features. He's using Apple Script and mouse clicks. Apple had patched the initial mouse key hack,
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:58.160]   but then he was testing it some more. By accident, he pasted it in instead of a down and up command,
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:02.400]   mouse down, mouse up command, he pasted it in two mouse downs and it turned out the system
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:12.000]   misinterpreted the second down as an up and completed the click. The fix bypassed it. He says,
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.880]   "It's this ridiculous bypass I found by incorrectly pasting code. I tripped over it because I wanted
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:26.960]   to run out and surf and I was being lazy." Apple has not yet responded to wires request for comment
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:32.400]   on Martel's findings. He admits he didn't actually tell Apple the details of his research ahead of
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:41.120]   his talk, but he says after he alerted the company, Apple shouldn't have left sloppy,
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:46.880]   exploitable bugs in the same fix. Sometimes people have to go out and surf.
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:51.680]   Well, also, they rush to get the fix out and then you have to test so many different
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:58.000]   things and people are human. It's fixing it. I think that's why I think shame on Patrick for
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.560]   not telling them ahead of time. There was also this wonderful thing. I love the people at Project
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:08.400]   Zero. I think they provide a phenomenal service to the internet, but there was Project Zero
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:12.880]   saying Apple should give us a bug bounty because we find this stuff because we're hired by Google
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:18.400]   to find it. It was hard to process as well. Or give it to charities. They didn't want it for
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:22.640]   charity. My understanding is that Project Zero was offered an opportunity to participate and they
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:30.320]   said, "No, we're Project Zero." So awkward to do it later. "Okay, rumor time. Rumor, rumor, rumor,
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:42.320]   rumor time. I think we're about a month away roughly from an Apple event. Loop insight.
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:51.600]   Is Marcus working for Loop now? The Loop now?" I don't know. Marcus Brownlee, the 2019 iPhone
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:49:01.600]   10 models. They're talking about his video. I get it. We talked about that with the usual sources
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:06.240]   sent out all the... Oh, this is that? Oh, nevermind. Nevermind. Forget about it.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:10.880]   The rumor from today was from a bunch of analysts who said that the iPhone will have 512 gigabytes
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:17.280]   of storage. It'll be compatible with iPad with Apple Pencil and the LCD version will be $6.99.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:24.400]   $6.99 is a good price. The small LCD version. It's the exact same price as the iPhone 8 is right
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:28.640]   now, which makes exactly all the sense in the world. Oh, okay. The Pencil's new. We didn't know
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:36.160]   that, but that would be nice. 512 gigs of storage, maybe because the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 came out
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:44.800]   with at $250, a 512 gigs device. What usually happens is that over time, because NAND flash is
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:48.800]   very volatile commodity. Sometimes it's really scarce and expensive. Sometimes it's not.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:52.240]   And sometimes they start making newer versions that are actually cheaper to buy than the smaller
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:56.160]   older versions. And because I think Apple still gets a lot of it from Samsung anyway,
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:00.560]   they would probably have made these decisions at similar times months and months ago.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:08.000]   Right. Also, a lot of people are not going to be interested in the cheapest one of whatever it is.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.640]   So if you give them an opportunity to give them more money, whether there's a whole lot of
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:20.240]   advantage to the new edit features or not, that's always a good thing. And I will say myself that
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:28.000]   if I will always do myself and I will always advocate, however much, if you were budgeting $800
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.320]   for whatever the next phone was, anticipating a price increase. And you're, oh my God,
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:37.280]   it's only they actually drop the price. It's only $650. I'm still going to spend that $800.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:41.920]   I'm going to buy as much storage as I possibly can. So they do make a five if it's a trick,
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:46.320]   it works for me. They do make a half terabyte MacBook. I mean, sorry, iPad Pro.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:51.200]   We don't know how well that sells. It's a little different with an iPad, I guess.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:56.880]   Well, it's it's it's a lot different because this is this is something that even Apple is
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:02.000]   promoting as why you don't even need it. It is like it is so it is so suitable as a computer
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.560]   that we're not even going to call it a computer because it's better than a computer.
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:08.640]   Got it. It's it's it's it's a more interesting question when you talk about things like the new
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:16.960]   Samsung Galaxy Note where it's like, wow, here is here is a device with with looking at all the
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:22.880]   stuff that my two year old MacBook has and noticing that this phone kind of smokes it in
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:28.400]   almost every category. And you can still plug it directly into HDMI and get a desktop
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:35.520]   interface for all this sort of stuff. It's are you tempted? I'm not tempted because I don't
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:42.720]   I personally just don't like Samsung as a primary device. And not when Google has their own pixel
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:47.040]   pixel phones out there. I think there's a lot of added value to the pixel brand.
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:55.600]   The note starts at 1000 but for 1254 for 1250 bucks you can get 512 gigs internal storage in
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:52:01.040]   both cases you have an S micro SD card slot. So you could add another 512. Actually,
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:06.160]   internal stories actually are in that, isn't it? Until it was 512. Well, the big one is the 512
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:14.240]   512. So a terabyte total. The little one is 128 512, which seems enough to me. And actually,
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:19.040]   it's not technically limited to 512. That's just the biggest as micro SD card Samsung currently makes.
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:25.440]   But the that's more would support two terabytes. So you could go even bigger if you really wanted
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:31.120]   to store that much on your phone seems to me I may be crazy but 64 gigs is enough for a phone.
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:38.320]   No, well, not when you consider that now you've got the iPhones shooting really wonderful 4k video.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:43.200]   True. So instead of having to here's your here's your eight minutes of film. Now,
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.720]   now what what 12 apps do you want to destroy to get another 30 seconds?
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:51.200]   It must be cool to have the same attitude towards video you have towards photos where
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:56.240]   I never even bother removing photos from my phone because jpegs just don't take that much room
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:01.040]   and there's such an ungodly amount of space. It's almost pointless to even waste the time.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:06.000]   So I bought when I bought the iPhone 10, I bought the of course about the 256 gig model because
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:14.160]   you got to have more storage but I've only I have 170 gigs left. And I haven't used a whole lot.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.880]   Oh, AT&T is calling me. Should I answer? Probably not.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:25.680]   I'll just I'll just put that away. Ah, isn't it that AT&T would call right when I show my phone
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:31.280]   on the air? I think that's a spoofed number or maybe. Here's another rumor from
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:38.480]   I guess Apple insider. Nope. This is from the Chinese language site.
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:46.640]   Chong Deon to all three 2018 iPhones are going to support wireless charging. That's not that
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:51.600]   wouldn't be a surprise. Right. That means just glass back. Right. Yeah. Air power mat to cost
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:54:00.240]   $150 whenever it's available. Yeah, that's a that's a tough price. I think that's you have to give
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:06.240]   given that and I don't think it's a tough price. You know why? Because there's all these other
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:11.360]   choices already. Anybody who really wants a wireless charging, even if it has three
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:14.800]   is got one has got one. The only people are going to buy it are people who are in an Apple store
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:20.080]   saying, Oh, look at the Apple one and they'll buy it at any price. It's a convenience thing to be
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:24.400]   able to take one thing with you that charges all three. So there's and presumably they're going to
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:29.440]   have the your chargeable AirPods packet when they ship that. So you'd have to buy that too,
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:33.840]   by the way, 150 for the pad. And if you want to charge your AirPods, although here's the good
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:38.480]   news and I wonder what this means. You can now get AirPods at Best Buy for 140 bucks.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:43.200]   They're in they're in plentiful supply apparently. Does that mean
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:49.120]   and and so I'll throw this in throw this in with the for for no additional charge.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:56.240]   MacBooks some MacBooks are now sold out at Best Buy. Does this mean new MacBooks new AirPods this
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:02.080]   fall? Usually one of the signs, you know, when the when the angel opened the seventh seal of the
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:09.760]   Apple and it's violence in Best Buy. Or the I five with 512 gigs of storage out of stock in Rose
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:18.880]   Gold, Space Green and Gold, the base rose gold model with 256 gigs. So they're not getting resupplied,
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:24.080]   I guess Apple store still has plenty, I presume, the plant of plenty to two to AirPods doesn't
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:28.640]   necessarily mean there'll be a new AirPod. But the $40 price is low.
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:34.000]   And the AirPods themselves are probably, you know, may not change. Walking that back.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   He knows nothing. He says nothing. Pay no attention. This is not the vector you're looking for.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:52.480]   And I have to say I do I have zero and I'm usually interested in new things. The wireless
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:56.560]   charging I don't I don't even like my charging my watch that way because it always pops off.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:01.920]   You have to watch like I look over what you have to. I know I just don't like it. You know,
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:06.160]   like I know that I have to and I know that they've saved some space but I would much rather just
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:09.120]   plug it in with a lightning. Yeah, I wish there was a little lightning port there that I could use
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:12.960]   because I would never use the magnetic one again because it's always like it's always
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:18.480]   somewhere on my desk and then I look over thinking my watch was was charged and it ends up not
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:22.800]   being charged. It's it popped off a little bit. And I you know, when I'm traveling, I just I have
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:27.920]   much a little lightning cables and I just plug them all in. And I just don't think it's not something
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:35.360]   I'm waiting for. I'm sorry. It's not best by its Costco for $140. And if you don't have a Costco
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:42.160]   membership, you can get them on Amazon for $144.98. And admittedly, I wasn't waiting for these either
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:48.080]   because I was like, Oh, I need I need cables. But now that I've fully gotten used to them,
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:52.000]   now the cables are just you just you plug your headphones in and you're like, Oh my gosh,
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.560]   this is a pan and act. This this cable is like this cable that I've had wrapped around me in
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:01.280]   some way since I was like 14 years old is now this thing that is like, Oh my gosh,
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:06.080]   like this is getting on. I don't know how I live this way. If I hadn't hadn't lost two pairs of
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:14.240]   AirPods now, I've been tempted. But that's I'm I'm on the limit. I'm at my limit. So will there
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:20.560]   be a new MacBook? I think Apple's gonna update everything it can to the Coffee Lake platform is
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:25.120]   I still am not a fan of the M series chips, although Intel now calls them i series just so that we
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:29.200]   think they think we'll be conned into expecting better performance. We're not gonna buy it
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:34.480]   until we still know their M class processors. So but you'll get whatever the benefits Coffee
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:39.040]   Lake are in those chips. And of course, we think that there'll be ninth generation Intel chips
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:45.040]   in October. So I went to sleep again and woke up and there was another Lake Cooper Lake. I mean,
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:48.400]   every time I fall asleep, Leo, there's a new Lake October first eight core
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:55.680]   Cooper Lakes cannon lakes. I don't know if I don't know if I like it is ready. It was so usually
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:58:00.240]   it's two. It's like has well then broad well and it was supposed to be Sky Lake and then
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:05.120]   Cannon Lake, but Intel just could not get the process shrink done. So then we got
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:09.680]   Kaby Lake and then we got Coffee Lake and Whiskey Lake and Ice Lake and Cooper Lake and
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:14.000]   used to be tick talk and now it's tick talk optimized optimized optimized.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.440]   The cannon lakes are the 10 millimeter. Those are the ones where nobody could
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:23.680]   well, nobody didn't tell could figure out how to make everybody else's making them, but
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:29.600]   nobody didn't talk to figure that. Okay, so good. I would love to see a new MacBook. I have to say
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:35.600]   I'm so spoiled by my I nine MacBook Pro and now even Lisa is just by the halo effect. She just
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:39.360]   sees me tapping away there and she's a new MacBook Air that I think is going to be exciting.
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:44.640]   Oh, you think there will be? I hope it's ready. I'm ready. MacBook Air would be really sweet.
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:49.840]   Or it's more like a sub $1000 Apple notebook that's actually modern.
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:53.840]   How do they position that though? Processor wise speed wise. Is it
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:59.280]   is it going to be a slow processor and I? No, I mean, right now it's an i series processor
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:03.840]   and it's only slow because it hasn't been updated in years, but I think Apple recognizes that
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:10.400]   you know one the MacBook MacBook without adjective after it never dropped down in price the way they
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:14.480]   were hoping it would it was an incredibly expensive product to make and it stayed relatively expensive
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:19.040]   to make and the same time the MacBook Air which they were hoping to replace is not you know they
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:23.760]   haven't been able to do that and they need something is under $999 and you know as people like Ben
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:29.360]   Behren will tell you Windows is making a lot of money at the $1000 price point but that Apple will
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:34.400]   suck a lot of that oxygen back out of the room if they if they just update that class of computer
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:37.760]   because they're the ones who kick started this whole ultra book thing it's their category to own
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:43.440]   if they want it kick started and then ignored so if you did a MacBook Air would it still have
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:47.200]   all those connectors or would they go to type C they probably just go to type C right? I'm hoping
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:51.920]   it'll be a hybrid because it's really targeted at education and education is not the fastest
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:57.040]   adopter they're not dong they're not dongle friendly and it'll have a retina display right
[00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:00.960]   well you'll still need dongles because you'll need VGA so I mean it's just a dongle that you get
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:07.760]   so there's always a dongle it's dongles all the way down will it have will it have a
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:14.080]   type of retina display will it have uh okay so the thing is how do you differentiate it for the
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:18.800]   MacBook the price I mean they they they have to they do things by price category and the MacBook
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:24.800]   was originally like if you look at the trajectory the the MacBook Air came out and it was super
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:29.520]   limited and super expensive it literally had the the Millennium Falcon hatch where you put the ports
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.920]   in and then the second generation MacBook Air came out and the price dropped a lot and it kept
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:39.360]   dropping and that's the one that's burned the whole ultra book revolution and I think the MacBook
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:43.040]   I might be wrong but I think the MacBook was supposed to do that be another revolutionary
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.040]   form factor that would get a second edition that would drop the price substantially
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:50.640]   and replace the MacBook Air the same way the MacBook Air replaced the MacBook
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:56.800]   and it just it did not happen and so we got a two couple years of stasis and apples just decided
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.520]   finally we've just got to make a better MacBook Air at this point
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:04.480]   Andy would you buy a MacBook Air would you buy a uh
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:13.760]   an i uh uh MacBook um it really would depend um let's let's let's assume that I'm okay with the
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:18.400]   keyboard uh I think that the I think that the role of them the the role of a MacBook Air really
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:22.560]   has to be the volts computer it really has to be the volts MacBook yeah has to be the one that
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:27.120]   doesn't say where you don't have to pace the stage where your fingers tend to and explain
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:31.920]   why you made certain design decisions it has to be here there's a steering wheel here the radio is
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:37.760]   there the shifter is there it has four tires what we fill with air yes air that can get it any gas
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:43.520]   station any pump it has seats seats that are designed to to make actual humans sit comfortably
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:49.920]   you can't basically say but the problem with a bucket seat is that what if you're carrying a
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:55.600]   bowling ball in one hand as we it's that's that's what I really want the MacBook Air to be uh when
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:02.480]   you when you go below a thousand dollars you really don't have the ability to uh boast about uh
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:07.120]   display tip boast about how advanced your display technology is or just boast about your
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:12.000]   manufacturing process uh as as we've been talking about uh when you're talking about something
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.280]   that's going to be bought a lot by people in education you're talking about people who are
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:20.240]   going to have to interface with stuff that's two three four five eight years old and you're not
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:24.960]   going to make people happy by saying here's all the extra stuff you're going to have to buy here's
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:29.040]   a hundred dollars worth of extra crap you're going to have to buy just to plug in the stuff
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:34.000]   that you normally use and you really can't get away with that when you're compete when the uh when
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.440]   the chopper for this is probably in a best buy uh and is seeing here is another notebook with even
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.760]   better specs than this that that has uh that managed to figure out how to put an actual
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:50.640]   HDMI connector in there that managed to put in at least one USB 3.0 actual type a USB-A type connector
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:55.600]   in there uh it's all this sort of stuff that comes to play when you use when you're starting to charge
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:01.920]   two brand especially two people who are already not just uh died in the world will apple users but
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.320]   they're real believers about it that's when you can sort of say that well the thing is we thought
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:12.800]   that you maybe would like to have four absolutely top-of-the-line high-speed USB-C ports and yes we know
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.800]   that's a that's an inconvenience to having to use dongles but realize that if you want now to have
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:22.560]   four have three 4k displays you can have three 4k displays if you want to have two raids and a
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:27.920]   GPU you can have the two raids and a GPU this is this is why we didn't chimp out on the uh on the
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:33.520]   USB-C's uh under a thousand dollars you have to make a you have to make a machine that's going to
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:40.720]   be practical affordable and functional and oftentimes apple asks you to be happy with just two of those
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:49.760]   things yeah i know i know i know it makes Andy Inaco happy opera on apple music apple music
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:56.720]   has launched a new classical music section this is this is something that uh made me really happy
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.240]   a lot of these uh a lot of these uh streaming services don't really
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:05.440]   they act like everybody's really into the modern stuff and i like classical music
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:10.800]   so this is curated by Deutsche gramophone and Andy will be happy to know there are a lot of
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:19.600]   operas on here including a new visual album gunos romeo and julietz visual albums are essentially
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:26.240]   what is it music videos what is well it gets weird that they are um uh one of the first ones
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:32.880]   they put on there is is gunos romeo and julietz and so if you can listen to just the tracks as
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:37.520]   individual arias but essentially if you start at the first track you will be able to watch the
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:44.000]   entire opera however on my phone here i've not figured out how to turn on subtitles and subtitles
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   in it in an Italian or French or German opera if you're not Italian French or German or an opera
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.400]   student kind of help you to understand what's going on i'll be honest i've been in English
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:58.960]   operas i can understand what they're saying i want this you know when you go to the opera they
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:04.160]   have super titles now that was a revolution in opera if you go to the meta opera they actually
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:09.520]   the seatbacks in themselves actually have lcd no strips on them yep and you can switch between
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:14.000]   different languages or turn them off entirely and they're dimming their orange light dim so that
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.880]   you're not distracted by them they're really wonderful but i'm really glad to see uh a streaming
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:23.520]   music service start to take classical music realize that there are problems that they're that the
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:29.920]   regular categories really don't solve yeah i mean the number of times where uh i i've just got
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:38.640]   a classical music album just on my phone and i can't i have no idea what this what this track is
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:43.760]   because they've decided to they're they're trying to make it work in a here's the album of the title
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:48.800]   here's the album title the album here is the album artist and so every single track is a wolf game
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:54.880]   amaze Mozart they don't have enough lines that's why i'm here for the mrago performed by boston
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:59.520]   symphony orchestra on and then 18 characters later and they're also it's all sort difficult
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:06.560]   like on my plex server i've had to really create a separate library for opera because um like i
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:12.800]   know it's unfair to all the other people who work on an opera but maybe i'm maybe i'm associate i want
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:19.040]   i want la traviata like my my favorite version of la traviata i want the author of that to be an
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:25.120]   intrepid contribco like that's the the the soprano who sung i don't i don't remember what orchestra
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:30.960]   performed it i don't remember uh who who was who who was uh alfredo who was all the other characters
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:36.560]   but again it's hard to do because the the author of this is going to be the orchestra or the name of
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:40.960]   the production or the director of the production so the the just the idea of having better organization
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:47.440]   for this is good just having a curator who knows that there's more to classical music than bok
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:52.800]   beethoven and Mozart and not just bok beethoven and Mozart but the top five hits of each one of
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:59.040]   them and after that they really don't care uh it's people really can get into the the reason why i
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:04.480]   got into opera to begin with wasn't because there was one copy of la traviata one version of la traviata
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:09.120]   that was deemed enough it's that you go into youtube and you see all these kind of bootleg recordings
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:15.200]   and you know that here are eight different sopranos singing the title role and here are uh eight other
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:19.760]   here are six other uh tenors who are singing the the male lead road and here are different
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:24.720]   productions that have different attitudes we gotta agree yeah yeah that would be really nice it's real
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:29.360]   it really is exploration it really it really because opera particularly it's like hyperlinks
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:34.160]   where you get in because uh you might get in because oh Romeo and Julia wonder what that opera
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:38.400]   is like and then you find that i really liked that soprano so i wonder what else that soprano has
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:43.280]   done and then you find that this one production that you also that you found wow that's really cool
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:47.920]   what other stuff has the meta opera done and so that's how you find yourself getting into this
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:53.440]   subject if i realize that there isn't one version of la traviata there are a hundred and some of them
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:59.440]   have totally what what might be termed wacky attitudes towards what the story is about so i'm glad to see
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:04.320]   that being treated as something that really needs to be curated that really needs active guides if i
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:12.320]   play this to i wonder if i play this to airplay if it would if it would maybe have super titles or
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:17.840]   subtitles i don't know maybe where there's more room on the screen hey it's still nice it's a it's a
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:24.880]   it's a high quality video and uh it's a beautiful opera so i'm glad i'm glad to see they've added that
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:30.720]   yeah and this is another opportunity to plug the met opera on demand app uh for your your
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:36.160]   ipad and your apple tv and stuff there you get those titles it's it's decades worth of met opera
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:44.240]   productions as recent as a year or two ago as old as as old as as actual video and this is these
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:49.120]   are the ones where let's let's see three different let's see three different versions of uh luchia
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:54.880]   de lama more let's do one and let's do one in which luchia is sort of an innocent victim let's do
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:00.880]   another one in which it's it's it's really cool that's it's it is one of those subscription services
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:05.600]   though that's one of the things that that's what you want apple music to do and apple does apple
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:11.680]   i guess that's really unique to opera i mean they're not going to do hey let's do the other versions
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:17.920]   of nicky mutton the menage's uh queen uh you know because there aren't other versions i guess you
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:23.280]   could with you could do with it maybe it's uh it's fascinating without without going into a
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:27.840]   too long a tangent in 30 seconds or less it's so what i one of the things i love about all these
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:32.320]   different versions of the same opera is that they never they don't change the score they don't change
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:37.760]   a single line of of dialogue they don't add anything but they figure out a way to what if we simply
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:42.480]   restage it this way what if instead of holding a knife she's holding a gun and what if this what
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:48.560]   if this uh this uh this uh the lead decides that she knows full well that she's being tricked but
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:53.280]   she feels as though she's been hoodwinked and she doesn't see a happy future for her anyway so
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:58.240]   she's just giving up as opposed to being the helpless the helpless uh dame it's it's really
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:02.880]   cool to watch so that's why it's great when you see all this different variety and when you have a
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:06.960]   again a music service that simply says okay we got one you got one copy of the moats are got one copy
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:11.120]   the baton we got one copy of the bachata bach that's good that all people are the only classical music
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:14.720]   people are going to be looking for is what was what was the the soundtrack in that latest wine
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:19.440]   commercial there you go we want to make sure we get the Berndese from La Trovietta then we're done
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:26.880]   so this is uh from the 2008 Salzburg festival it's uh Rolando Villazón uh doing the uh the tenor
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:32.640]   part of Romeo a Juliet and that's nice i didn't even know about these visual albums
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:37.520]   maybe because i'm not a Frank Ocean fan i don't know but uh i'm glad they're doing that that's great
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:43.200]   let's take a little break we shall come back with more Ralph Nader says apple
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:51.040]   should do something i don't know something anything and also and also and also that the apple car
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:58.640]   shouldn't be cool or fun should be unsafe at any speed i showed it i brought to you by zip
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:06.240]   recruiter the best way somebody's at my front door i'm just going to close the ipad the best way to
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:11.440]   hire we found this out the other day we uh our accounting manager uh gave us notice
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:17.600]   it's a fairly important role without uh without the accounting manager and he would not get paid
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:24.000]   Renee we're not get paid uh so uh we said we better fill this because you know what happens
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.880]   and this happens in any business especially a small business like ours if somebody leaves that
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:34.000]   means somebody else has to do two jobs Lisa would have to do all of that work and she was dreading
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:42.560]   that and i said Lisa this is a breakfast let's try zip recruiter oh yeah so she she puts the
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.800]   she puts the job listing on zip recruiter now one thing that we've talked about many times the zip
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.520]   recruiter does it's great is it posts your job listing to a hundred plus sites and twitter and
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:57.840]   facebook and everywhere so that the idea being more people will see your job listing and much more
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:02.240]   likely you're going to reach that one perfect person but this is something that uh we haven't
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:08.160]   talked a lot about that really is remarkable zip recruiter also uses very sophisticated matching
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:14.480]   technology it's it scans all the resumes it has in the database i mean and that's often millions

[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:25.600]   to apply it's almost like an automated headhunter and then as applications come in zip recruiter
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:30.480]   analyzes each one spotlights the top candidates you don't miss a match we posted it at breakfast
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:37.680]   and i'm still eating and she's oh we just kind of we just got an applicant oh we just got another

[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:42.720]   uh let's see what did i what did i tease oh Ralph Nader he's he's why is he stop picking on apple
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:50.000]   he says earlier he remember he sent an open letter to Tim Cook saying uh and i kind of agree this has
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.800]   been one of the problems with the new tax bill is that most of the money's gone to stock buybacks apple
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:14:00.400]   number one in that spent i don't know a hundred billion dollars on stock buybacks then the last one
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:06.480]   i think i think the number is over two hundred billion wow total wow which is great for shareholders
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:13.200]   but you know the hope with the hope with the tax uh yeah the hope with the tax bill was that
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:17.120]   maybe some of that money would go to hiring and investments in rnd and things like that but
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:21.280]   uh and that's what nadir says he says uh you should be using that money to do things like
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:29.840]   increase your number of employees shore up the pension fund um rnd pay the chinese supply chain
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:36.160]   a little bit better the fundamental the fundamental problem with all of these it's is number one as
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:40.800]   i suggested by someone who doesn't actually run a company um doesn't even use an iphone as a matter
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:46.960]   fact or a little typewriter he's gonna look like under wood typewriter right and and the issue is
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:52.000]   is that is that making investments that that have uh it's like a subscription service
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.760]   you know hiring more employees is like a really really big subscription service that costs you
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:03.520]   know millions of dollars and so and so you know a buyback is a one-time thing it's maintained and
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:08.000]   again it is it is about maintaining your stock price it's about increasing your stock price it's
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.160]   about maintaining keeping your employees you know and that is you know that that is why i think
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:16.720]   that's the number one reason apple's doing it is is employee retention you know i you know i think
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:20.960]   that that is you know keeping out moving that we should also point out that everybody on the board
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:25.600]   and all the apple executives have significant stock so they benefit immediately and directly
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:29.440]   from the back they do but they've got a lot of partially they've got more money they can spend
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:34.080]   yeah it's retention of them retention i mean you know i mean it it did when you look at you know
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:39.360]   some of the they're not the highest compensated people in the valley by he's freshly in action
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:44.480]   okay fair enough yeah yeah and so i think that but i think when you're thinking about you know a
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:48.480]   hundred thousand plus or two hundred thousand plus employees i think you're really talking about
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:55.600]   um you know they're there it those golden handcuffs are much harder to break than people think and so
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:01.600]   but but you know if that if that starts to stall it becomes an issue and so so i you know and i wish
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:05.280]   that they would do other things with the money too i mean i i you know i think that you know i
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:09.200]   think they're doing a lot of good stuff i'd love to see them do more you know more tech outreach more
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:14.320]   you know more of those kinds of things that are one time things or one setup or something that
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.600]   we we're going to invest you know the in these directions that but i i do understand the idea of
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:23.520]   number one causing a lot of inflation starting to just pay a whole lot of people more in china
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:27.440]   you know is there's a whole equilibrium there that that becomes very complicated very quickly and
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.960]   it's something you know it's you know foxkon doesn't just work for apple you know like you know they're
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:35.760]   they're working for everyone so it's it's it's a much more uh you know all of the suggestions that he
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:40.880]   gave are are very complicated and they i'm sure that they seem simple to someone who
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:47.920]   has never had to actually make payroll yeah yeah fair enough nonetheless we would like to see
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:54.240]   all companies show a sincere awareness that the way they treat their workers particularly
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:59.920]   their less they're at least paid workers shows a lot about their integrity and their awareness of
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:06.400]   what their impact on the world is so i can i i can understand that uh it's it's not it's not even the
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:09.600]   correct solution to say we're going to make sure that our all of our workers are the best
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:14.240]   high most highly paid workers in the entire industry because as alex says that has an
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:20.400]   knock-on effect that can produce unanticipated results but when you hear a company like amazon
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:26.560]   just not even show any public interest any any interest whatsoever that they're willing to talk
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.960]   to anybody about about making sure that their warehouses are good places to excuse me or even
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:35.680]   okay places to work that's when you start to feel that that's when when you have the the
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:40.560]   the different the choice between spending you need to buy new you want to buy a new camera and
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:45.920]   it's either going to be fifteen hundred dollars at b&h photo or a hundred dollars less on amazon
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:50.480]   that's when you find yourself you know what i think i will i think i'll go to adorama i think
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.960]   i'll go to another store uh after after double checking to see if they're if their employers are
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:18:01.280]   being treated better than warehouse workers at amazon a digital birth control app blamed for
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:09.520]   dozens of pregnancies just got FDA approval uh this is uh you may be familiar with natural
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:16.640]   cycles talk about a subscription eighty dollars a year it comes with a thermometer this is uh a
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:23.040]   swedish uh product and if you know anything about the rhythm method of birth control you know it
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:31.200]   isn't perfect but the idea is by measuring a woman's uh body temperature and her cycles you can
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:38.800]   predict low fertility and high fertility times even even the in sweden the hospital reported 37
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:45.040]   cases of unwanted pregnancies among women using the app that's one hospital but anybody knows this
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:51.920]   is you know an even even uh natural cycle says the apps only about 93 percent effective under typical
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:19:00.400]   use yeah so seven babies out of a hundred love sessions well and a two-bath you gotta say that
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:06.480]   that's still i think the uh i think the uh the pregnancy rate if you're not using birth control
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:12.560]   of something like 42 43 percent and and so if there are if there are people for whatever reason
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:17.680]   no need to judge them don't want to use any form of birth control or or contraception this is
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:22.400]   if that is nothing to yeah it's better than nothing so long as they're not promoting it as a really
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:27.360]   really great solution to this problem uh because we've been talking about subscription services this
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:32.640]   is an this is an app that can cost you 120 000 dollars a year over for for 18 years that's
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:36.560]   that's the hell with subscriptions for uh for a simple uh for that i've got two of those subscriptions
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:40.640]   back in the 90s i'm just i'm just following here but why can't they make an apple watch app that detects
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:45.360]   your heartbeat and says whoa they're young it's no doubt it's just my college costs for a child in
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:53.360]   the u.s and you're like okay well natural cycles says 900 000 people use the app so if you've got a
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:20:00.960]   seven percent pregnancy rate well do the math yeah anyway but i think i'm sure that they're very clear
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:07.280]   in the you know when you install it i haven't tried it but uh because it's not an issue for me
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:13.280]   obviously but but i but i but i think that anyway it's interesting fda approval um for natural
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:17.760]   cycles that's a big deal for natural cycles and and to put it in perspective the the i think
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:22.320]   statistically the the i was just searching what you're doing is is that you know theoretically
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:29.280]   condoms are 98 in in actuality they're rated at about 82 right so right you know so that's what
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:34.960]   that's what natural cycle says 93 effective as typically used if users follow directions perfectly
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:40.800]   it'd be 99 percent so if they spent if they if they spend time using the phone app instead of
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:46.000]   having sex that's good that's a start maybe maybe maybe that's maybe that's an opportunity for
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.480]   developers listening you use the machine learning to monitor what's happening on the apple watch to
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:55.360]   try to detect the changes in pulse rate that happened during foreplay and once it detects that
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:00.000]   uh that sex is probably going to happen in the next 20 to 30 minutes that's when you start unloading
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.160]   lots of notifications about oh text message from this oh the this stock is going like this oh do
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:08.480]   you notice that the red socks are now beating the cardinals uh by three points and sort of get
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:16.160]   people distracted from that speaking of in-house productions apple is ordering a show about a
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:23.200]   video game studio from the it's always sunny in philadelphia crew well i'm loving it's this is based
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:30.640]   on mnginley's novel pachinko and uh it'll be a half hour scripted sitcom i i don't is it wait i
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:34.320]   think that i think that i think we're mixing oh that's a different one i think that yeah because i think
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:39.120]   you this one they're they're doing one about a game company yeah yeah jinco's different okay
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:43.280]   so that's another thing that apples ordered something a series based on pachinko which i
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:48.160]   didn't read so pachinko's not about a video game company parallard you know it's based on another
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:52.640]   book but but the video but the video game company sound one sounds like it will be funny yeah it's
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:58.240]   kind of like if you're in the video games and you like uh silicon valley you'll be happy it'll be
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:03.520]   written by rob mccalenny and charlie day mccalenny will take the lead as an employee at a video game
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:09.520]   studio uh lion's gate and rcg the pair's production company will be also co-produced by
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:18.800]   ooby soft a video game per company how convenient how interesting you know it's always sunny i don't
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:24.160]   watch it religiously but it is great because it's so irreverent and weird and i think that's a good
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:29.520]   team to be producing this and if they can get danny devito in in any way from a former fashion i'll
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:36.160]   be happy apples uh apples gonna run out of that billion dollars pretty quick they may have to put
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:41.440]   some more money towards that is more more where that came from yeah really okay see if i'm
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:48.240]   Ralph nader i'm gonna write dear apple on my underwood buy more great shows t send that off
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:56.560]   and vidya has revealed a next generation gpu almost certainly will not be in any apple products
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:05.200]   ever yep uh it's uh the the touring nicely named gpu architecture uh you know you can read the
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:10.800]   article in an on tech if you want to know the details but uh this is this is something for
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:16.720]   alex lindsey's crowd yeah there's been a lot of talk about there's there's been a lot of talk about
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:23.120]   this uh at seagrath seagrath is this week um in uh bank cooper and so um a good friend of mine mike
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:30.480]   cmore has been uh doing a lot of testing with uh you know around this and um and it is a uh there's
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:35.040]   a lot of people talking about a ray trace real-time ray tracing i mean ray tracing when we started was
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:40.000]   ours like oh you got a ray trace a single image and it's gonna take you uh you know eight hour
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.840]   remember look how good they looked though right because it it's literally trying to trace the path
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:52.160]   of the light source to the object and what that impact would be for as millions of points right
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:55.120]   well there's ray tracing then your global illumination which is almost the
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:01.200]   opposite of that anyway the but the the point is that it's now doing ray tracing in real time so
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:05.760]   now it's thirty seconds just and it's just an incredible amount of processing power and it
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:10.400]   really is going to start becoming a problem because i don't think i don't see amd you know keeping up
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:14.880]   with this high you know high performance uh the that that in video is doing i think it from an
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:19.520]   architectural perspective they're disadvantaged and so i think that as a result we as users i mean
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:25.200]   i look at it i mean you know uh i look at this is you know i'm going to use a mac to manage projects
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:30.400]   you know but when we think about doing the projects we're not considering i mean we don't we don't
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:35.600]   long-term we don't i mean for for real time uh for heavy duty lifting you know we're not thinking
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:42.080]   that we're going to do it on a Mac 10 billion 10 billion giga rays 10 giga rays per second
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:48.480]   is how you measure this stuff that's the fastest Turing parts it is both rasterization and ray
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:55.920]   tracing so it's kind of the you get both in one chip wow yeah it's a it's a lot of power you know
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:59.840]   and it and it's going to make a huge difference when you start talking about uh there's there's a
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:07.120]   couple things one is of course arvr m xr or mr you know mixed reality um so having those kinds of
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:10.640]   things makes a big difference in how things you know come and this is going to get much more
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:16.560]   complicated and much more realistic the the other piece is really film actually tv and film production
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:21.360]   so um there's a friend of mine that i used to work with at Lucasfilm named David Zora to actually
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:29.280]   uh you know he has a show uh Zafari which is it's a kid show and it is all rendered in real time
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:35.440]   you know and and so when you think about you know in real time oh yeah and we were we were close we
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:40.720]   worked on this this the show called video mods for vh1 a decade ago more than a decade ago and we
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:45.120]   were rendering some real time stuff that didn't look you know didn't look amazing but we were like
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:50.640]   hey this is this is the future well you remember in 1996 i was of 3d character called dev nal that
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:54.960]   was rendered in real time but it took a million dollars right the hardware and it was really crappy
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:26:00.560]   looking well and and now we're talking about stuff that looks really realistic that's happening in
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:05.760]   real time and and this is that you know there's a lot there's a lot of stuff in visualization there's
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:12.640]   a lot of pieces when it comes to um visualizing cars visualizing um you know locations you know for
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.800]   for industrial reasons but but i think you know when i think about some of the shows that you know
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:21.360]   we we want to do someday in the future uh you know we're really thinking about how do we do that in
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:25.120]   real time how do we render the whole thing you know and saturday morning cartoons i think we're
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:29.200]   gonna see uh they'll all be real time i think in the next decade you know that that we rendered in
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:33.040]   real time because it lowers the cost it gives you a lot more flexibility this begs the question did
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:39.120]   apple bet on the wrong the wrong horse by supporting it's it's not a wrong or like horse i think
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:46.880]   d but from a pure performance perspective i would say yes um from a uh a man a process management
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.880]   probably not you know that they were never going to have the control that apple wanted over you
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:54.000]   know the problem is that too much of their operating system too much of the gooey that you're looking
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.440]   at is driven by the graphics processor they need to write the drivers they need they don't want to
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:03.520]   you know they they don't they need to i don't think i don't i think that they have to do that
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:07.760]   and in video doesn't want to give that up either and so the the issue is is that they just
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:13.440]   from a pure process management position there was no way apple and in video could get along i think
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:18.560]   the unfortunate part of it is i think that uh in video is starting to pull away from a md from a
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:24.000]   performance perspective maybe a md can turn it around but you know i don't we don't look think about
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:31.120]   a lot of a md uh you know processors for what we do rene is it is it too late for apple to change
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:36.640]   its mind i mean it's it's not that it's not too late it's just that nothing has changed i mean there
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:41.120]   was a couple things there was inciting incidents like in video had a a massive failure that apple
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:45.600]   felt they never took responsibility for um and in there's a there's a bunch of videos you can watch
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:52.160]   on youtube there's a one from adored tv recently that sort of explains why in video is not the
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:57.520]   bet not i don't know what the right word is not a lot of people are actually fans of in video love
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:02.720]   the cards but the company is really bad reputation uh and you know apple was one of the company took
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:08.160]   the brunt of that but also could license i mean in vidya is a fabulous foundry right they could
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:13.440]   license the technology just as they license arms architecture thinking video is so successful
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:18.240]   that they just don't care about apple where a md will do anything include apple a md will support
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:23.040]   apple's metal on the at the metal level isn't that ultimately going to choose their make their own
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:28.640]   you think maybe i mean uh well i mean a md also like everyone counted them out on cpu is and now
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:34.080]   there's thread so it's it's impossible to count them out but apple might move apple you know they
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:39.280]   sever ties with imagination and they're making their own gpu's for uh ios devices now so who
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:43.120]   knows what they'll do next generation they have all the talent the world the legends of a md and
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:46.480]   in vidya and all those companies are working at apple so it's hard to break what they'll do in the
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:52.400]   future actually but the go ahead one one handicap towards them trying to do that sort of stuff in
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:57.360]   house that it's not just the hardware it's the culture of people that learn how to absolutely
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:03.840]   squeeze that silicon to excruciating levels of pain to get the most performance out of it
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:09.440]   uh which is why you often see the same hardware uh outperforming uh outperforming it uh 18
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:13.440]   18 months later simply because developers who are creating these rendering tools or creating
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:19.440]   these gaming tools have figured out exactly where the bottlenecks are or figuring out new methods
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:24.400]   of exploiting its architecture that hadn't even been considered yet so it's gonna it's it depends
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:28.880]   on what you think that they're going to be using a gpu for everything that everything that you're
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:33.760]   using your mac for uh and even your your iphone for today it's essentially a very high performance
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:38.240]   video game with all of the rendering that has to happen just to make uh just to make a dialogue
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:44.320]   box excuse me just to make an alert for a piece of spam mail appear on the screen uh but if you're
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:49.920]   really trying to create great live real-time renders of stuff you're trying to do a lot of AR
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:54.720]   stuff uh if you're trying to do the sort of really high performance stuff that's not consumer oriented
[01:29:54.720 --> 01:30:01.040]   but is actually industry oriented where you're charging a god darn fortune in consulting fees to
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:07.440]   create this bespoke solution for this industry that's where apple might be falling down now but
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:12.240]   we'll have to find out gpu's if you've got if you told me 10 years ago how important a gpu is going
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:16.640]   to be that's not just going to be about increasing the frame rate in the game that this is going to
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:21.520]   be all about artificial intelligence this is all can be all all about artificial reality and
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:27.040]   augmented reality i would not have gotten it because i am always a lot dumber than then i that i will
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:32.560]   be in five years time yeah and some other credits really gpu's are more important than the cpu
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:38.640]   go ahead elix yeah and into their credit and video has been talking about this for 10 or 15 years i
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:44.000]   mean they they definitely had this focus for a long time i remember going to see graph and they
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000]   were showing off you know yeah yeah you can do the graphics and then here's all the other processing
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.280]   you can use um you can use gpu's for so it's it is definitely there and i and i think that it's not
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:56.880]   there are things that gpu's are really good at and things that they're not good at they're not good
[01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:01.440]   at um so they're really a gpu is really good at obviously raw performance it's it's really good at
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:06.000]   putting out a lot of pixels at one time it's really good at doing big processes that are simple
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.600]   what they're not good at is complex processes that especially things that are running in parallel
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:16.320]   so um so a lot of parallel processing i mean they can do that if they're architected well
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:21.680]   but if you look at like the photogrammetry stuff that we do there's this heavy lifting that the gpu
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:26.640]   will do if you if you have a good gpu and but then a lot of the calculation still sit on the g on the
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:31.280]   cpu and there's just things that a cpu is is better at cpu in my opinion is more stable
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:35.200]   um you know you get more of a stable outcome you know a lot of the encoders that we use the
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:40.240]   elementals that we used um a lot early on they were you know and they still are pretty heavy gpu but
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:46.560]   um you know sometimes we've had more uh success on cpu and then there's fpgas where everybody's
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:51.600]   talking about right that's the well and then the fpgas are great because they're low level
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:56.560]   they're very inexpensive and you can reprogram them uh the challenges they're all based in china
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:00.880]   and if you talk to the right people they they talk about the fact that if you let an fpga touch
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:06.800]   the internet it calls home period you know and and really yeah yeah it is not yeah they are not
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:10.400]   if you know there's a lot of folks that i've talked to that that are that have concerns
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:14.480]   um that's interesting there's a defense appropriation bill just passed it includes
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:24.000]   uh uh rules against using hte as zte and uh walway parts in anything that the defense department does
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:31.360]   now maybe you'll have to extend that this is a e gpu from uh razor that can handle right now there's
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:38.720]   an a a m d card in it but i could put and might even try uh an invidia card in here
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:46.000]   but rene i'd have to use what flaky drivers or i mean i think they're beta i mean some people
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.520]   have done it it's just they're not they're not going to use good as cleanly supported
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:53.040]   dissolution from both parties we'll try it i mean i'm going to try we're going to benchmark
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:33:00.640]   this compare this to the uh apple uh you know kind of exclusive black magic e gpu and then maybe
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:07.280]   i'll get i have a ten eighty uh ti how many slots is that i don't know if i if i could open it i
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:11.920]   would but i don't i don't know right uh maybe if i do that and that oh there you go
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:19.520]   there's a handle on the back for easy access it's got a sapphire in here right now
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:27.760]   but it looks like just one one fat slot for uh yep for it for any gpu and a rather large amount of
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:34.080]   cooling at least two two-thirds of the case is cooling right yeah so that's kind of this is kind
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:38.640]   of interesting though we'll do a benchmark i think this saturday on the new screensavers i'm
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:43.680]   going to show a benchmarks on the macbook that i9 macbook pro i'm trying to get my money's worth
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:48.720]   this is really something that it's amazing that we've gotten to the point where you can act with
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:53.040]   usb c specifically that you got to a point where you could just externalize well let usb c
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:58.320]   thunderbolt three i mean you need the 40 gigabit throughput of thunderbolt three to really
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:03.520]   not i meant i just meant the connector but connect uh but yeah but that that um uh yeah
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:08.000]   the it's amazing that we've gotten to a point where we can we can just externalize the the uh
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:15.120]   motherboard it's mind-boggling yeah mind-boggling um yeah that's uh that's i think it's only 300 bucks
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:20.480]   for the case but then you know as much as you want for the card it doesn't come with card not included
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:27.520]   uh speaking of returning superstars dug field is coming back to apple he left to go to tesla
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:35.600]   in 2013 five years ago he is now coming back to work with bob man's field this is a uh a rumor that
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:42.080]   john grooper's reporting it uh during fireball uh and man's field of course is in charge of the
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:48.960]   type project titan the uh apple self-driving car so dug field leaving autopilot from tesla
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:54.000]   and going he oversees the model three production and going back to that this all looks this all looks
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:59.360]   fairly fairly straightforward that he lost his position at at tesla you know and when elan musk
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:04.240]   stepped in to push things forward and of course he puts him in a position where he's going to uh
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:10.160]   want to leave i will say that you know the conspiracy theorist in me uh does say that if i wanted to
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:16.560]   figure out everything i needed to know about doing a car i would let one of my engineers go to tesla
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:22.240]   and have them come back oh that's asking for a lawsuit yeah that's interesting that's kind of
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:29.040]   that's that's the red sparrow model of car autonomous car development yes i i'm i'm guessing
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:34.160]   when he i'm guessing that there was a prenup involved oh i'm sure there's a very before he came
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:38.000]   i should have looked at track show stuff going back and forth there but apple and tesla there's
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:43.360]   kind of a revolving door really between apple and tesla and i imagine and google and tesla and all
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:48.000]   these guys waymo uh they keep the problem with all these projects is that they keep changing
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.880]   directions like the flow so uh like a uh like a many fact excuse me a senior executive at an
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:57.920]   automaker will have been talked into uh the seduced into joining apple because they thought they were
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:02.080]   building a car and then a year and a half later they're not building a car they're building a
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:06.080]   platform and now this is not as interesting to that person as before and sometimes it goes the other
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:10.080]   way around so this is such it is so completely in flux right now that this is why you're playing
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:15.040]   musical chairs with engineers and project managers well and i think it's also so complicated because
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:18.800]   you know what is the future of a car i mean i think we're in this position where we don't even
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:24.720]   know i mean i when i when google came out with the there's no steering wheel and you're just kind
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:28.320]   of you're just going to get in it's going to take you i was like that is crazy i am never giving up
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:32.560]   my steering wheel and now i've gotten to a point where i'm like i really don't want a steering wheel
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:37.600]   like i just want a monitor up there and i just sit back and watch something and i you know i just
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:41.440]   the more i've thought through it and the more i've sat in back of ubers and stuff like that i just
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:46.240]   like i don't i don't need to be able to grab on to that i just just stop pull over the road if
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:52.240]   you're broken so you know but but i think that uh and i think that so i think that a lot of folks have
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:37:01.280]   had to like do we really spend billions on building a a new shiny uh heads up display across our our
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:05.920]   windshield or do we just get rid of the windshield you know and i think that that's that you know i
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:08.560]   think we're in that point where we don't know which way it's going to go
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:16.640]   brine can explain this to us apple pulls ios 12 beta 7 after less than 24 hours
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:23.520]   the rumor is there were performance issues and then the group face time the 32 concurrent user
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:30.800]   face time was also removed from beta 7 the release notes say it will ship in a future software update
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:37.200]   this fall in other words on some made this conclusion maybe it's the face time group chat that's leading
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:44.960]   to a problem in ios 12 no i mean i think those are separate very separate decisions one is because
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:51.440]   there was a bug in this beta that trash performance on on some versions of iphone so you just you pull
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:56.720]   the beta you fix it and you release it as soon as possible the other one is that similar to
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:03.040]   the i message sync last year you know apple apple tries to project forward what are the features
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:07.040]   that we could finish and famously this year they dropped a few features because they wanted to
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:11.120]   spend take some of the key engineers and have them spend their time on performance optimization
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:15.920]   like for example the guy who invented auto layout uh stopped what he was doing for this
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:21.840]   for this release and went back and made auto layout as performant as possible on uh ios 12
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:26.720]   but still not all you can always guess exactly how long a project will take
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:30.960]   especially when it's something at the architectural level of face time which because of a variety of
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:35.120]   different circumstances over the years has been a massive architectural overhaul for apple and
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:39.840]   now you're throwing 32 concurrent connections as we maintain at the same time and they're just
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:44.480]   not going to make the deadline so instead of releasing a version of face time group calls that's
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:49.200]   not great it's going to get them more oh apple can't you know apple's buggy your apple's doing this
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:54.240]   or that wrong they're just going to wait like they did with i message sync last year and like they did
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:59.360]   with airplay too and if you notice there's a similarity between all of these features
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:02.960]   and just waiting till they've absolutely nailed it and then it'll come out either
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:09.120]   you know in ios 12.1 or 0.2 or you know maybe 0.3 if things really slip should someone who got
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:13.120]   beta seven before they pulled it worry about it somebody in the chat i'm saying it's running
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:18.480]   fine on my ipad air yeah it's running fine it'll be a new one right away but if it's not running
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:25.600]   fine just roll yourself back and and uh folks on the public beta we're at six now we're
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:29.120]   it is this version but it usually comes a couple day late so they didn't ship the version for
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:34.640]   public yet so they'll they'll fix that so yeah we're we're we're like weekly now on those betas
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:38.240]   right yeah but the difference is like the public beta they know that i mean they warn people but
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:41.520]   they know that most likely people don't have multiple devices so they're going to put it on
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:46.000]   their carry device right developers are expressly told not to put it on a carry to it is not an
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.960]   early access program uh some people still do and then you get bit by stuff like this but that sort
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:59.680]   of caveat emptor at that point you know it's been uh a while since i have uh brushed my teeth manually
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:07.760]   i am i am now like all into the automatic toothbrush so much so that when i picked up a
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:12.000]   old-fashioned toothbrush the other day i didn't really know what to do with it i was like how do
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.080]   you how do you brush your teeth my wrists didn't have their muscles to do it
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:25.520]   right now i am using a quip this is the best uh toothbrush what what i just call it toothbrush
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:29.920]   it's an automatic about electric toothbrush it's not really electric anymore i guess you call it
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:36.160]   electric toothbrush it's a fraction of the cost of those high end and it does just as well we're
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:41.280]   starting twenty five dollars or starting for this quip toothbrush it's the first subscription
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:44.240]   electric toothbrush approved by the american dental association
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:49.920]   see it turns out a lot of us brush our teeth wrong either we don't do it long enough or we
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:56.880]   forget to change our brushes quip solves that it's of course got the automatic every 30 seconds do

[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:32.080]   uh i got a tube one one was a sort of a last-minute ad we're talking earlier these are these are the
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:39.120]   butler soycrum. oh you weren't joking i was not joking these are really real i a friend of mine
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:43.760]   introduced me to these like a few years ago and they've always been in my kitchen ever since
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:49.280]   what these are is that they're like this is proof proof positive i keep like a in my pantry
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:54.400]   like a some loose these looseies over there there are through some sort of a patented process that
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:44:01.840]   they explain they take soy and they turn it into these like little like completely dried
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:06.720]   little chunks and strips and all you got to do to uh re-activate them is you just get some really
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:11.920]   really hot water doesn't even have to be boiling you just put them in a put them in a cup with
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:17.920]   whatever flavoring you like i usually drop some uh some chicken uh some chicken stock or whatever
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:23.280]   chicken bouillon whatever in there wait for ten minutes there now they will absorb all the flavor
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:31.840]   of whatever you put in there and then you have this really tasty meaty chewy sort of meat sort of
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:37.840]   thing only it's not meat it's soy and i'm again i'm not i'm not a vegetarian i've been thinking
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:43.120]   about doing a vegetarian day of the week just to get my my cooking back into back in his trap but
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:50.160]   it's such it's such a basic staple for like when i really don't want to cook but i don't want to
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:55.200]   like eat junk and go out for dinner i will just heat up some black beans i will
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:45:01.680]   reconstitute some soy curls with some chicken stock and then it will just be a really really
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:06.640]   tasty meal there you can put them in an instant pot with barbecue sauce and it becomes a lot like
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:11.920]   barbecue chicken it doesn't try to be something that it's not really it it i always describe these as
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:16.320]   i'm eating soy curls i'm not eating like some sort of substitute turkey or substitute chicken
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:21.120]   but it gives you that sort of meat experience uh that you really really like it tastes like
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:26.720]   whatever you want it to taste like and the other i will also but i will also say that i love the
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:34.080]   fact that uh a bag of these it costs about three bucks for an eight ounce bag and it's almost completely
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:42.080]   as you can expect a shelf stable so it's not as but i i mean i was like for foods that will survive
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:48.000]   the nuclear apocalypse well not well not just that it's it's like they're they're times when like i've
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:52.960]   either uh they're they're times when like i'll you know i'll buy my usual pork cutlets and and chicken
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:58.480]   breasts but like maybe i've already gone through what i bought and the chicken the the the the fridge
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:03.200]   is empty and i still want to have something that's actually like sort of sustain up sustenance and
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:10.880]   and i will always have a supply of these in a 12 pound bulk bag for only $191 you'd never run out
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:15.120]   there are people who do that they do they do like real barbecue about it they have they can buy
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:18.960]   them in like little chunks you can buy them in big strips all right i'm buying some just to basically
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:23.760]   i buy give you a shot here i buy i buy a box of these like every every two or three months which
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:28.160]   means that even when like i've been traveling like last week i was out of the house and traveling
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:32.720]   of every day for last week and there's nothing in the fridge when i come home after a week
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:37.520]   there is i can quickly throw together like an actual meal because there's always going to be
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:41.760]   something like there's always going to be like this jar or another bag next week around on the
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:48.480]   show we're going to have a taste off between butler's soy curls and the bull and cleaver traditional
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:55.600]   bill tongue that i also purchased thanks to apple pay and we can see which is better well we don't
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:00.720]   we should do we should get some blindfold people in here maybe we'll the studio audience will subject
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:07.600]   you all right what's the other picky indeed oh man the pick they already had is a spyglass gps
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:12.480]   which i as an app that i didn't realize i needed until i needed it and didn't have it
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:19.120]   uh you we we are so reliant on apple maps and google maps that we don't even think about having
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:25.360]   like a navigation app that doesn't require like a big big server to connect to spyglass gps is
[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:30.800]   sort of like a on on device navigation orienteering app it is a much better
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:36.080]   compass than whatever you're going to get uh in uh in that app you can it's very good for when
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:42.400]   you're basically taking a walk and you need to you need to like uh land a place mark or keep a trail
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:47.440]   of where you've been going uh there's there are times where you do find if you're if you're lucky
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:52.800]   enough to live near a park or or conservation land you find that google maps and apple maps is
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:57.760]   not going to help you and get out of that park it's also not going to help you figure remember
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:03.120]   where the exit is uh and you'll be able to do that if you have this app on you because it kept a
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:08.000]   trail of how to where the where the where your car is parked and how to get back there and or just
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.920]   simply where the hell is north how do i get how do i get without any landmarks without any sunlight
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:20.000]   here's how i get in and out of places the basic app gives you a very very good compass for for a
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.080]   six bucks it gives you all the stuff like being able to download off the download maps and keep
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:32.960]   them offline uh like uh uh hud uh features uh uh augmented reality features like i said it's a it's a
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:39.360]   great app to simply download today have it on the phone and then sometime in the next uh 20 hours to
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:45.200]   three years when you're like oh my god i'd be if if only i had a real like compass app that doesn't
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:50.800]   rely on a connection to google maps or apple maps oh wait a minute i actually do i forgot i forgot
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:56.320]   that before i started on this long long drive to this park and before i before i ran out of uh of
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:02.000]   uh of uh of a radio signal here i actually do have something that will help me get out of here today
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:07.840]   as opposed today on foot and by car as opposed to two days from now dehydrated and buy an emergency
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:14.000]   helicopter so as set and it really is just such a cool app besides it's like really a beautiful
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:19.360]   piece of craftsmanship so i'm very very pleased to have it on my phone now mr rene richie your
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:25.920]   pick of the week i have two quick picks one is fantastical has been updated yet again fantastical
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:31.120]   for mac uh it's just got a lot of quality of life features i guess the big new feature is this
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:35.360]   integrates with meetup now so if you use meetup you can have that right in your calendar app but
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:40.640]   there's just a lot of little things that have been polished uh and if if like me you're not a huge
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:47.280]   fan of apples built-in calendar app then fantastical absolutely has you covered work so well with uh
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:53.200]   drafts too i always you know try to remember something i press the button record the you know
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:50:00.320]   haircut at three p.m. on friday and then when i get back home i open my ipad and i just fantastical
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:06.720]   because it understands natural language i i use the drop down menu on my mac too you just type in
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:12.160]   lunch with lisa and it does it does the right thing i really love that it's right it's the fastest
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:16.480]   way to get stuff into your calendar and then find it again afterwards and i hate michael simmons
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:20.000]   for that because i really don't want to be using a calendar but it makes it so easy that i have no
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:26.720]   excuses not to use it so i also use card hop which i highly recommend uh he fixes so many apps one
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:32.560]   app at a time mark can't sell the window really good team card if you have card hop and fantastic
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:37.200]   calendar in your menu on your mac you set you're done yeah everything that's all there so even
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:41.280]   fixed i mess it with chatology but i don't know if he's still doing that but all of us are he does
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:46.640]   is great yeah it's all fantastic um my second pick is blatantly self-serving but we have vector
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:51.680]   pins and t-shirts in and um it was a surprise to me because i forgot they were making them but they
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:57.280]   are just really awesome looking so and pins uh after apple and non-spins at wdce i immediately
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:02.480]   wanted all the pins so i've got like my p-calc pin and a bunch of other pins and uh now i just
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:06.480]   ordered some vector pins that's you know maybe we should do pins too like you're right i never
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:11.280]   thought of pins yeah yeah i should i would take a bandolier of quip pins
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:19.920]   all right we're able to find that i'm more.com/vector that's standard.tv/vector okay it's the standard
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:26.000]   store standard.tv/vector yeah Alex Lindsey pick of the week my friend
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:33.680]   so a long time ago we were trying to do compositing uh compositing is combining you know green screen
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:39.840]   and people and and putting things together and um we got to work with some developers and we put
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:45.360]   together this little app that we used to sell um it was my favorite one of my favorite apps i remember
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:51.360]   you talked about this on call for help i think yeah a long time ago and uh and so we put it together
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:56.800]   we sold it for a while it just didn't find the right niche um just it wasn't i think we weren't
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:01.280]   charging enough to be honest with you it was so powerful uh that we just didn't you know it was
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:05.840]   and complicated uh you know that that we needed to charge a lot more for it uh it's been used on a
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:13.600]   lot of effects uh you know for uh live on set visualization but the reality is it just it's this
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:18.800]   Swiss army knife that you can do almost anything in real time when it comes to compositing and and
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:26.800]   a lot of screen effects so um it's it's free now and uh it's been free and we've used it uh and it
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:32.960]   just got updated so poly uh just updated this to 64 bits so it's brand new um and shiny it might
[01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:37.200]   there might be a couple uh rough edges as he goes out i i've just got it and so far it's been working
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:44.800]   great uh so it's fast um you can throw it on your on your your latest mac and and it's all mac only
[01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:50.640]   so it's not being you know the code is really just just for the uh just for the mac uh it's free and
[01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:54.560]   it is it's basically if you think about nuke or shake or and really what i wanted what i wanted
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:59.280]   when we started having this conversation was i wanted shake but i wanted to be real time and so
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:04.880]   anyway it is uh it's it's not you know it's not a replacement for nuke or or shake but it
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:10.480]   uh a uh what it's great for is just there is an enormous number of effects and poly who who
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:17.360]   writes it he uses it for all kinds of crazy stage uh you know stage events and so on so forth to do
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:21.760]   things on the screen so there's plugins in there that i have no idea what they even do i look at them
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:27.600]   like uh this is it looks cool but there's a lot of great stuff you can do back then we built
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:32.800]   literally 3d compositing so you can do a green screen composite in real time in 3d and play around
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:39.680]   with the interocular or inter axial anyway so um there's uh an incredible number of pieces in the
[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:45.440]   near future now the the 64 bit one is out i'm probably going to do some training uh that is you
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:50.880]   know for um it's great to talk about use in classes because you get instant feedback i can show you
[01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:55.120]   green screen and i can be it's it's actually live and i can change things and you can watch all the
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:54:01.680]   things change as i as i do it and so um so i'll be using it in the near future so my recommendation
[01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:06.720]   if you're at all interested uh is to uh and and really my recommendation is just to download it
[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:10.160]   and play with it it's it's that you can you're it'll turn onto your webcam you can start playing
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:14.640]   with it almost instantly and you get to kind of see what a nodal compositor you know looks like and
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:21.680]   it's free and and easy not i wouldn't say it's easy to use like uh like an like an iPhone app uh it's
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:27.440]   it's it's a little heavy but it is uh uh but it really gives you um a lot of really cool high-end
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:32.640]   tools and because of the real-time feedback yeah you can learn faster because uh you know you get
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:37.520]   to really see it happening um with you can even you know pushing live video put in multiple streams
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:42.960]   of live video uh output live video so there's just a lot of great great little bits and it's free
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:48.320]   it's free which is absolutely insane and i'm just i was really excited i just got surprised
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:54.160]   actually that poly had uh published it had gone ahead and updated it 64-bit and so um i'm really
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:59.200]   excited that it's out i'm gonna use it in the near future and if you have a Mac you should download
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:04.720]   it and play with it i have no idea what you would use this for i wish you would come in some time
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:08.960]   and sit down with us for a while and and show us some stuff about you know i could come in on
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:13.760]   Saturday you know there's the show okay come on the new screen savers come on the new screen savers
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:19.440]   i'm actually on the new screen savers the Saturday oh to show this no no but i we could talk to Anthony
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:23.600]   about it if you want yeah let's let's add this to the to the mix oh good i'm glad you're beyond
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:26.640]   because that's when i'm gonna do the eGPU comparison i'll need your help for that as well
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:34.000]   could i okay so let's say i shot s log video could i use this you should you should be able to
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:38.640]   convert it i haven't tried it i haven't tried to convert so that's quite a lot for it right yeah i
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:42.800]   think that there's lots in there i have is it that kind of thing where you have it you have you have
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:48.400]   a signal that's coming in and you do stuff to it and something comes out the other hand yeah but it
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:53.200]   happens in real time so really what we it's not so much taking you can take files of very simplified
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:59.120]   description kids but what what i used it for we were we we had to do about 110 visual effect shots
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:04.880]   for for a movie about 10 years ago and what we used it for is we're on set we've already shot
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:09.920]   the background plate and we have a couple foreground pieces and what we had to do we the actors were
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:14.880]   so busy we couldn't shoot them at the same time so uh so with the problem that we had is that we
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:17.840]   had to shoot one they were literally sitting next to each other talking to each other now we had
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:23.840]   their digit we had their their actual doubles sitting next we just doing the actual uh so there'd be
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:27.600]   the girl was on one side and hit the double was on the other then the guy was on the other side and
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:32.560]   then the girl the girl's double was on you know he shot him weeks apart and so we had to we had
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:36.240]   to make sure that everything lined up eyes and the background because they were in Santa Monica but
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:40.400]   we were shooting them in Japan and so there was all this bits and pieces i got to bring in four
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:44.960]   grounds and elements and background elements and make sure that they all line up now if you shoot
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:48.880]   that without being able to see what's actually happening you that's why how how effects have
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:55.040]   little problems i'm not in big visual effects um but in little movies you end up with little problems
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:57:03.200]   or big problems and so what we did is on set on a 17 inch laptop you know whatever was the fastest
[01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:08.240]   thing 10 years ago we were able to do all of that in real time you know and so it basically do the
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:12.480]   composite pull the green screens put the background in do all the little bits and pieces do color
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:17.200]   correction everything so while we were there on set we could know that it was going to work and
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:21.200]   we literally had the director come up and look at it it's a real time feed showing the foreground
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:24.560]   and the background and he's like so is it going to look this good in the film and i was like yeah
[01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:29.280]   it's going to look at at least this is in the film you know and so yeah i have no idea what you do
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:37.360]   this but it is free how much did you charge for for conduit when it first came out we used to
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:42.720]   charge i think it was a hundred uh 150 or 200 bucks and then you'd buy the special of the additional
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:48.880]   kit capture tools right stage tools you buy you buy some of those extra and so
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:55.200]   it was with the software you just give it away oh yeah and it's it's and uh it is it's not me giving
[01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:59.120]   it away it's probably giving it away uh you know we were licensing it and selling it um okay thank
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:05.360]   you so but it's awesome yeah probably and and so um but it is it's it's it should have been thousands
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:08.880]   of dollars worth of hardware that was the problem with the business model is is that you didn't
[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:12.640]   charge the number of people using it we didn't charge enough that we had made enough money for the
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:16.560]   the you know it was specialized crew now what we're hoping to do is expand that a little bit by
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:20.640]   or what i think i mean polys just put it out there i think because he's using it i think he
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:25.280]   updated it for himself and figured well i'm not looking at everybody and so um so i'm super excited
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:29.840]   about it and i'm i'm again planning to do some training this fall with it and so uh you should
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:34.880]   download it you should play with it um we'll probably do stuff within our patreon thing about it at
[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:44.000]   first and then make it more public later pixel conduit dot com pixel conduit dot com downloaded
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:55.920]   free right now uh so Alex started mac break many moons ago it was it was a video production uh
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:59:03.200]   a crazy 1080p video production that he could barely edit and well the pretty much no one could
[01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:11.760]   watch but it was awesome and most of the early episodes were about how the hell you make this
[01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:20.720]   thing and they featured sal segoyan one of the great legendary people of apple sal came in on
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:27.760]   friday for the first of two triangulations uh he went on and on so we made it into two shows it is
[01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:33.600]   awesome the stories he tells about steve jobs uh he says i don't want to be the guy who's telling
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:40.240]   stories about steve jobs but he worked with him for a decade and he has some stories he also talked
[01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:45.360]   a lot about automation which he is keeping alive he left apple a few years ago uh but he's keeping
[01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:51.200]   it alive with his commande conference his work for the omni group and more and he gave us a demo
[01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:59.920]   of something that's been built into mac os for more than a decade 13 years that apple has never
[01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:04.640]   demoed on stage if they did it would be like minority report people would go you can do that
[02:00:04.640 --> 02:00:13.920]   voice commands automating things like keynote uh you got you've got to watch the
[02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:20.160]   triangulation from uh friday and then he does a full demo of the dictation commands next friday's
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:27.360]   triangulation or you can go to dictation commands.com but it's kind of complicated and i think but
[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:33.520]   when if you see there's something wrong with his i can't get his video to play uh but he plays it
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:40.160]   for us on the show and you can watch it but if you watch sal working with a keynote presentation
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:47.760]   and his voice in combination doing things like that that would like make a panorama that would
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:56.240]   take forever it will blow your mind and sal is so great so uh it's a person it's a little bit of a
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:01:01.360]   plug for my stuff but uh but i have to say it's really not it's a plug for sal segoyan
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:06.800]   twitt.tv/tri watch the current episode and then make sure you watch next weeks for the dictation
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:12.880]   commands that's amazing yeah you know everybody knows sal we love you know i i also i also want to
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:19.760]   thank you for getting so many form of apple legends to basically create oral histories that are going
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:26.080]   to be preserved because there's so much of this story that's going to inform and inspire uh people
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:31.040]   no matter what sort of job they take in tech or elsewhere to learn what it's like to be in a
[02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:35.760]   position to do really really great things and a very very competitive and high-fritter situation
[02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:41.440]   and the more of these people that you can get to sit down for one hour two hour eight days and tell
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:46.640]   every story that they have and make sure that's there uh that's such a great thing for history well
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:52.080]   we'll probably get sal back i want to do more of this in fact i really want him to do some
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:56.320]   some tips for us so we're going to figure out some way to get sal to do kind of what he already
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:02:03.040]   did in the in the earliest days of mac break uh some more for us on that and uh to that note
