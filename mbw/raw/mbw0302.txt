[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.060]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly and it's going to be the Bizarro edition because neither Andy
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.060]   and not Konora Alex Lindsay are with us today, but that doesn't mean we don't have a great crew
[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.060]   starting to my left with the Mac Daddy himself, the Chris Breen, the hair of Chris Breen.
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.060]   And yes, lovely to see you from Macworld, Mac 9-1-1.
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.060]   >> Body of Breen is his Twitter account.
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.060]   >> It's great to see you too.
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.060]   >> And I asked him already, kids, I know you want to know, if you're watching video,
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.060]   what is that thing to his left, that keyboard?
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.060]   >> Yeah, the keyboard on the left is a profit five from sequential circuits from back in the day.
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:06.060]   Heavily featured in every recording from about 1984 on to '88, and then just to the left of that
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.060]   is Laurie Anderson's United States Live because it's Laurie's birthday.
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.060]   It's her 60th birthday.
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.060]   >> She's 65.
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.060]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.060]   >> Oh, man, that makes me feel old.
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.060]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.060]   >> Oh, golly.
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.060]   Laurie Anderson, great street performer.
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.060]   You might have seen her on Saturday Night Live in the '70s.
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.060]   And she did, oh, Superman.
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.060]   [LAUGHING]
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.060]   >> Wow.
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.060]   >> It's nice.
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.060]   Every time Chris is on, he has a featured highlighted album.
[00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.060]   Then this guy over here, this cat over here, that's Mike Elgin of Mike Elgin.
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.060]   He's also writing for Computer World and where else?
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.060]   I can't remember.
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.060]   >> Cult of Mac is probably the most good.
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.060]   >> Cult of Mac.
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.060]   >> It's your main site, which I love writing for.
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.060]   It's a great audience.
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.060]   But also I'm writing for a bunch of other folks.
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:06.060]   I actually write a lot of iOS and Apple oriented stuff for a site called How's, H-O-U-Z-E, which is a home design site.
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:18.060]   And it's amazing how much stuff there is surrounding Apple coffee tables and crazy speaker systems that are actually quite beautiful home decor thing.
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.060]   So I'm writing a lot of Apple stuff for How's.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.060]   >> Neato.
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.060]   Yeah, Apple, the Apple stores and apps, they're going to be selling the nest.
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.060]   >> Yes.
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.060]   >> Which is kind of cool.
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.060]   >> Yes.
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.060]   >> That means that How's was right to do Apple stuff.
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.060]   >> Yep.
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.060]   So it's a lot of fun.
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.060]   It's huge.
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.060]   The existing audience on that site just eats it up.
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:48.060]   They love the tech stuff because there's so much excitement in home design for tech, which I'm sure we're going to talk about today.
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.060]   >> Kind of confirms what people think about people who are really already in a home design.
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.060]   They probably have Macs, right?
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.060]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.060]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:05.060]   >> I mean, if you want something, if you're into beautiful objects, you're probably not going to get a, you know, an ad book or something.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.060]   >> Right.
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.060]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.060]   No kidding.
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.060]   Well, it's good to have you.
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.060]   Alex is traveling and boy, we got a schedule from him that is just kind of mind-boggling.
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.060]   He's going to be all over the world.
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.060]   We're going to get her him back on sometime soon.
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.060]   And then Andy's the London weather, so we hope you feel better, Andy.
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.060]   We miss you.
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.060]   We miss you.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.060]   But there is a lot to talk about.
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:34.060]   I'm so glad we have a great cast of experts on here because, gosh, there's WDBWDC and I want to talk about that.
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:44.060]   But really, in the eyes of some, we crossed a very important Rubicon on January, on June 1st.
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:51.060]   The app store on the Mac now requires sandboxing.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.060]   Chris, would you explain what this means and why people are so, some developers are so ahead up about this?
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.060]   Sure.
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:13.060]   The idea is that when you have an iOS device, like you have your iPad or your iPhone, they have taken all the elements that go with it, all the little preface files, all the added files, all the support files, and instead of tucking them away somewhere in a folder, they put them all within the app.
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:23.060]   And the idea here is that they want to protect we poor users because clearly, you know, even after 25 years of doing this sort of thing, we can get ourselves into trouble.
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.060]   Viruses may be able to get in and wreak havoc.
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.060]   We might, as poor stupid users, get in and start throwing files away that we shouldn't.
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.060]   And so Apple is protecting us.
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.060]   They are acting as our benevolent nanny.
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.060]   And they've taken this feature over to the Mac OS.
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:06:02.060]   And what they want to do is they want to take applications and they want to incorporate all those peripheral files and connect them with the application so that they are within this sandbox so that you don't have the opportunity to play with these files and that you can't get in trouble by things
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.060]   mucking about with them.
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:16.060]   The difficulty of this for some developers is that there are certain kinds of applications that need to talk at a very low level with other applications and with the operating system.
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.060]   Not that low level.
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.060]   That's the point.
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.060]   It would be fine if we're like, oh, no, don't worry.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.060]   I mean, it's really low level stuff.
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.060]   But it's things like jumping to a particular folder in the open and safe dialogue.
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:39.060]   Okay, right. I mean, it's stuff that we have become used to having the ability to have administrator privilege is to edit administrator files.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.060]   I think that's the whole point.
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.060]   They want us to stop being used to having that.
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.060]   Apple is very systematically moving us to a post PC world.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.060]   And I think this is an example of that.
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:07:00.060]   They want to get everybody used to the idea that file access is going in the direction of everything access is going in the direction of the iOS.
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.060]   The good news is you don't have to buy stuff in the app store.
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.060]   Although, you know, there's a lot of incentive to do so.
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.060]   It makes it a lot easier.
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.060]   You can put it on five different apps.
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.060]   It's a five or 10.
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.060]   I can never remember.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.060]   It's a number of different machines.
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:18.060]   It's nice when you create a new machine because you just log into your account and boom, all that you update all your files that you've purchased.
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:33.060]   Jonathan Wrench, who's a Mac developer, wrote on his blog, Wrench.com, R-E-N-T-S-Z-C-H, that one of the big issues that has long been a question mark was, should I buy on the app store or should I buy it directly from the developer?
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:40.060]   And there are a lot of developers like BB Edit, you know, and others who continue to offer versions on their website.
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:49.060]   He says, "Now the answer is very clear. You should buy directly from the developer because you'll get non-Sandbox Dabs."
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.060]   So you get a better experience.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:08:00.060]   Non-Sandbox apps can auto-navigate the user to correct folders, run user-written Apple scripts, control iTunes, and install PDF services automatically.
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:05.060]   Non-Sandbox BB Edit, can directly edit files that require administrative privileges.
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:11.060]   Non-Sandbox Dabney Focus can automatically determine the selected document in the Finder when creating a clipping.
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:17.060]   There's lots more and he has all linked to a long list of things that you're going to lose if you...
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:23.060]   This actually comes from Lex Friedman writing in Mac World on Friday.
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:30.060]   He says, "Lek says, 'Depending on whom you ask, Friday is the best or worst thing to come to the Mac app store since it's opened its doors.'"
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:39.060]   What do you think... I understand what you're saying, Mike Elgin, that Apple's trying to make things more secure.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.060]   I mean, this is what we've got on the iPad, but we have it on the iPad.
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.060]   Should it be on the desktop, too?
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:49.060]   I just think, well, I just think that they're doing two things.
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.060]   One, they're trying to... There are two issues they're trying to deal with.
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.060]   They're trying to improve their operating systems or in their view improve.
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.060]   They're also trying to improve the user.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:05.060]   Part of this is they have some vision.
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:12.060]   We don't know what their vision is, but they have... I'm sure Apple has a very strong idea of how the world will work,
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.060]   how Apple products will work in 10 years, in five years.
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:21.060]   They chip away at that progress every chance they get.
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.060]   When they do stuff like this, really, what they're telling us is, this is where we're going.
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:36.060]   We're going in a direction of a radical appliance model where they don't want anybody in their tinkering and optimizing
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.060]   and changing and accessing things.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:45.060]   They don't want you to install the app and use it and do things the Apple way.
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:51.060]   I think this is the kind of thing, I think, what Apple means about the post-PC world.
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:10:01.060]   I've been predicting for a while that eventually, even as the OS 10 gets more iOS-like,
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:06.060]   it will eventually be replaced by iOS.
[00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.060]   I'm sure of it.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.060]   That runs on very, very powerful hardware.
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:24.060]   The people who do high-end stuff now will be doing it with touch, voice, gesture, pen, iPads, the size of big-screen TVs.
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.060]   They're moving us in that direction.
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:34.060]   This is the behind-the-scenes version of the applianceification of everything.
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:40.060]   Somebody in our chat room says, "I was a pirate until the App Store came along,
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:46.060]   and it's such a good experience that I now buy all my software.
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.060]   It's less expensive.
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.060]   It's easy.
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.060]   It's automatically updated or relatively automatically updated.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.060]   You just run the App Store and then ask for updates.
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.060]   I just updated a bunch of apps this morning.
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.060]   It does sound like, though, at least for now we have the choice.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.060]   The question is, and this is, by the way, what I brought up when the App Store launched.
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.060]   I was very nervous about this kind of move.
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:16.060]   I just wonder how long before OS X becomes like iOS, where you have to jailbreak it
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.060]   if you want to buy third-party apps.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:26.060]   Listen to what Rich Segal of Bear Bones told Macworld in November about features that won't work in a sandbox BB edit.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.060]   Multi-file search and replace.
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.060]   Text factory, which is really fantastic.
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:35.060]   Multi-application automation using AppleScript or Automator.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:43.060]   Open file by name, disk browsers, live folder views and projects, SCM integration, bulk HTML tool operations,
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.060]   and lots of behind the scenes stuff like scanning directories from CTAGs data.
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.060]   So does this break BB edit?
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.060]   He offers a stripped-down version in the App Store.
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.060]   What do you think, Chris Breen?
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.060]   Is this a positive move?
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.060]   I think it depends on what kind of use you are.
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:04.060]   I think Apple has fundamentally changed, or is trying to change our mind,
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.060]   about what kind of people should be using their stuff.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.060]   They're looking at the person coming from iOS and moving to the Mac,
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:15.060]   and they want to have that similar experience.
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.060]   So if you started on an iPhone, if you started on an iPod Touch or an iPad,
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.060]   and you move to the Mac, you're going to say, "Oh, I understand what this experience is like.
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.060]   It's just like it is on an iPhone."
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:29.060]   That leaves behind a lot of people like us who've been doing this for a long time.
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.060]   It's us old farts that are complaining.
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:35.060]   Well, and I think, look at where the market is.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:40.060]   The market of old farts is declining because we're dying off.
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.060]   We're dying off.
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.060]   And the young soon- - But you'd be older farts.
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:50.060]   Don't you need hackers to continue to develop and make advances and innovate?
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.060]   I mean, don't you need, it's not just old farts.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.060]   It's people who want to hack around.
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.060]   Don't you still need us?
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.060]   Well, I think you do.
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.060]   Yeah, I think you do.
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:04.060]   But at this point, and I think Mount Lion at least provides a nice hint that by default,
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.060]   yes, they are going to direct you to the Mac App Store, but you don't have to do that.
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.060]   They're giving you three levels.
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:14.060]   So if you want to download something from Rich Single Site, for example, or a developer site,
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.060]   you can do that and you can tell the OS to back off.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.060]   I want to install just as I always have.
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.060]   Right.
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.060]   Let's hope you can keep doing that.
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.060]   They're going to let you do it.
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.060]   And the folks who do Alfred, and I'm a big fan of Alfred as you know,
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:32.060]   wrote on their blog recently that Gatekeeper is going to solve this in Mount Lion.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:42.060]   That Gatekeeper will allow you to digitally sign your apps and then things that won't
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:47.060]   work in the App Store, you'll still have the, in other words, you'll have the security as
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.060]   an end user because you could say, I only want to use digitally signed apps.
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:55.060]   Those apps, to get the digital certificate, make specific requests about things they want
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:14:00.060]   to do and don't want to do, and Apple presumably can check them out, make sure that they're
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.060]   doing things that, you know, they're doing all that, give them a certificate.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:09.060]   So Gatekeeper will eliminate the need to be in the sandbox but give users security.
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.060]   Does that sound right?
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:16.060]   By the way, Alfred says, yes, we offer a Mac App Store, but your best bet is to download
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:21.060]   Alfred from our website, which is what I do because you can't use the Powerpack.
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:28.060]   What they've done is they've effectively forked, unfortunately, they've forked their app
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:33.060]   and there's a limited version on the App Store which I had to stop, you know, I bought
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:40.060]   and I canceled and now I have to download from Alfred's site because I want the Powerpack.
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:45.060]   I've heard that from developers too, is that that is the strategy going forward.
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:50.060]   People say, yes, we want to be in the App Store because there's lots of money there because
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:55.460]   those newbies are going to go there, but we're also, for people who are savvy enough to
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.060]   know that they need these features, they can go to our site and do it.
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:04.060]   I agree, it seems goofy to have to split the thing into like the power user version and
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.060]   the non-power user version.
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.060]   It feels like Fashism.
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.060]   It feels like Fashism to me.
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.060]   Like you're hitting your keyboard kind of hard when you return.
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.060]   I hear it to the phone.
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:23.060]   So it's going right up through that microphone there and into the airwaves.
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:28.060]   Gardener questions my use of the word Fashism, but isn't it Fashism when you say you do
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.060]   it our way or the highway?
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:35.060]   And then the other issue I think, frankly, is it more secure?
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:40.460]   And I don't think that that's been proven that having Apple, it's certainly not been more
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.420]   secure in iOS.
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:47.900]   There's plenty of stuff in iOS that's a problem, right?
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.940]   Well, here's one thing about actual Fashism.
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:59.220]   One of the things that makes it possible is that I was a political science major and we
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.940]   talked a lot about this and in communist societies as well.
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.100]   The trains run on time is the always the same.
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.420]   The trains run on time, but there's always these little pressure valves.
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:15.780]   So for example, the reason the Soviet Union lasted so long is that some speculate is that
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.820]   there are all these different ways to cheat.
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:22.620]   And so people were oppressed, but at the same time they kind of got a chance to stick
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.300]   it to the man of the black market.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.420]   You could get toilet paper from the guy.
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.420]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.980]   You cheat by cutting in line, all that stuff.
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:38.220]   But if in Apple's case, the power users, the hackers, the explorers, the rebels, the
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:45.300]   people that he referred to in those commercials, the troublemakers, they'll find a way and
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:51.700]   they'll jailbreak their iOS devices and they'll eventually maybe have to jailbreak their OS
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.620]   10 devices.
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:17:00.540]   But you wonder whether Apple just knows that's going to happen and doesn't try too hard
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.620]   to shut it down.
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:09.900]   Some might disagree with that, but they're trying to sell to as many people as possible.
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.420]   And this may be the good formula.
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:18.340]   Maybe you have this sort of lockdown controlled system and then the people who are going to
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.780]   tinker, the people who are going to mess with things are going to do it anyway no matter
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.780]   what.
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:23.940]   So it all kind of works out.
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.540]   I guess my issue is that you got the iPad.
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:32.060]   And so I steer, I admittedly, I steer a lot of people, you know, inexperienced novices
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:38.420]   and so forth who don't need, you know, to do heavy duty computing to the iPad because
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.860]   it is, you know, sandbox.
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:40.860]   It is more secure.
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.420]   It's less, it's not even just about security.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.980]   It's about less confusing because there's no file system.
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.340]   There's no desktop.
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.500]   But they've got that.
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.460]   So why can't we just keep our gosh darn desktops?
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.700]   Well, you know, there's, there's actually nothing new about this.
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:59.340]   The entire history of user interfaces is, is along the same trajectory.
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:04.420]   There was a time at which you had to be, you know, basically a rocket scientist to get
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.100]   within 10 feet of any computer.
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:12.740]   And then as computer power, Moore's law gives us more and cheaper compute power that can
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.700]   be applied to user interfaces.
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:20.540]   That application has always been around about making the device more friendly to the user.
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:27.140]   And so for example, in the 80s, 70s and 80s to use a computer was essentially to program
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.820]   it to a certain extent.
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.660]   And eventually we had applications, but throughout the 90s we spent all our time optimizing and
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:37.580]   tweaking and configuring and defragging and doing the most management and tweaking.
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:38.780]   And we used to love that stuff.
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.700]   I mean, that was fun, but that was using a computer.
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:46.740]   It was, it satisfied our, you know, our inner engineer or whatever.
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:52.780]   But just as it has for decades, it continues away from that toward the masses, toward just
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:56.820]   it being this thing that you use and not something that you work on.
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.540]   Cars are the same way, by the way.
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:02.820]   You know, years ago, people used to own a car was to open the hood and master everything.
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.300]   You can't do that anymore, can you?
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.300]   You don't do it.
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.300]   You open the hood now and it's like, who knows what's going on.
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.020]   It's a proprietary computer.
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.380]   Yeah, Compreius has eight computers.
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.700]   I don't know what's going on in there.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.860]   And I'm going to think about it.
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.860]   I'm just going to drive it.
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.980]   As your dealer and spend, you know, tens of thousands of dollars on diagnostic equipment,
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.900]   there's no user serviceable parts inside.
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:26.580]   And yeah, and I guess it's the shade tree mechanic, it bugged about that.
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.740]   And I guess when Chris says, "Old farts, what are you talking about?
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:34.860]   Shade tree computer users, right, who want to mess around on the inside."
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.620]   I mean, it's not like we don't have a choice.
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.620]   We could go to Linux.
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.700]   I'm just saying I would like to keep using apples and I would like to keep being able
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.900]   to get under the hood and I frankly think that this is the first step in a long march
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:49.580]   to locking it down in exactly the same way iOS is.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:50.580]   You disagree?
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.580]   Well, I certainly hope not.
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:57.540]   No, it could be, you know, but you know, anytime that I look at what Apple's doing and I think
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.980]   about the companies arrogance, which they're known for at times.
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.780]   And I think they're going to do something awful.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:06.260]   And then six months down the line, I see what they actually do and I go, "Oh, well, there
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.260]   are plenty of people inside Apple."
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.900]   It's quite as bad as I thought it was.
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:16.260]   So, plenty of people inside Apple like us, I mean, that's who's writing the software.
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:20.020]   So they must be making noises themselves saying, "Well, let's not go too far."
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.900]   I mean, is that protecting us?
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.100]   Or is Tim Cook going to rule with the iron fist that Steve Jobs did and said, "Doesn't
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.540]   matter what you think, we're locking this sucker down?"
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:33.060]   Yeah, you know, honestly, I'm just going to have to wait and see.
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.900]   Yeah, I want to make a lot.
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.620]   I want to rattle a cage.
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:40.860]   I know, but I think it's our job to rattle a cage and say, "Don't go there.
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.860]   Don't go there, Apple."
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.660]   I'm sure they've heard this.
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.460]   You know, it's not like developers aren't saying.
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:49.740]   Well, if we don't make a lot of noise, I think Apple's going to say, "A-S-E."
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.260]   Nobody cares.
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.260]   You know?
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.340]   Well, but I do think people do care.
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:59.340]   You know, I think there wouldn't be a vital and lively jailbreak community out there on
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.580]   the iOS if people didn't care.
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:07.140]   But certainly, Apple has done things like, "Well, let's take Final Cut," when they released
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.420]   it.
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:13.660]   And the people who are doing professional video editing, that kind of thing, screamed
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.980]   bloody murder.
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:19.980]   And there were reviews on the App Store that just stole the thing.
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.540]   And three or four months later, they said, "Okay."
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.540]   They backed off.
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.540]   We get, yeah.
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:29.580]   And it's like Apple, that PR, they don't say the next day, "Gee, we really blew it.
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.820]   We'll get back to you in three months."
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.140]   They stay quiet until they've got the solution.
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:36.580]   And then they say, "Yeah, well, we're working on this all along and here.
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:37.940]   Now you've got what you want."
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.980]   So I do think that Apple hears, I think developers talk to them, I think users talk
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:42.980]   to them.
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:47.180]   And sometimes, yes, they sort of get this mindset that, "This is what my mom would like,
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.940]   and so this is what we're going to do."
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:53.260]   But eventually, they hear it from people like us and from regular users as well, and they
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.700]   go, "Okay, we've taken that step too far."
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.060]   And I do think it's a great idea.
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:03.300]   I mean, whenever I can, I buy the app from the App Store because it is a great experience.
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.620]   So there's a lot to be said for that.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.620]   That's what scares me.
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.180]   If we're a crappy experience, I'd say, "Yeah, no, don't worry about it."
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.580]   If it were Ping, I wouldn't worry about it.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:15.060]   It's not Ping, it's good.
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:19.540]   And I think we have to stick up for ourselves a little bit.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.540]   And Gatekeeper's going to be a big improvement, I think.
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:27.380]   Initially, I was a little nervous about the idea that apps would have to go through this
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.580]   process to get signed.
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.020]   And now that I understand it, I think it's a great idea.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:36.540]   I was saying, "You have to say as an application, you have to say what you want access to.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.540]   You can do all these things that the App Store won't let you do, but you have to check that
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.540]   box, and then you have to submit it, and you have to get a certificate."
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.940]   And you still don't have to have a certificate.
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.780]   But I can use Gatekeeper and say, "Hey, don't let my mom download anything that doesn't have
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:50.780]   a certificate."
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:54.140]   And I presume Gatekeeper will also say, "Don't let my mom buy anything that's not in the
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.140]   App Store."
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.140]   Right.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.820]   And I just don't let my mom buy anything.
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.820]   Yeah, really.
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:00.140]   No, no, my mom's good.
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.380]   She's very sophisticated, actually.
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:04.540]   But I mean, look at Lion.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.940]   When they suddenly took away access to the user library, right, you try to go in there
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.460]   and that file's invisible now.
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:15.340]   Well, you can get there, so it still provides the way, but you have to know the secret in
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.340]   order to do that.
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.460]   So I think that's such a bad thing.
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.540]   Although, I mean, I find myself doing it.
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:21.980]   I did it like four times yesterday.
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.820]   So I was like a little annoying.
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.620]   It's like, "Oh, come on, really?
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.780]   Can I just turn it on?"
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.780]   All right.
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.780]   Yeah.
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.780]   Enough.
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:36.420]   I just think this is an important watershed in the history of Apple and of Macintosh in
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.220]   particular.
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.300]   And I think it's a big deal.
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.980]   And I think it could be very positive.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:42.980]   I mean, I do.
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.660]   I mean, I think that most people will buy from the App Store.
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.380]   They will be safer because of it.
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.020]   If will be a little bit easier.
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.540]   Although the myth of Apple being of Macintosh being easier to use than anything else is
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.220]   long gone.
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:00.540]   Partly I'm concerned because Windows is going in the same direction.
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:05.180]   And I worry that there won't be, you know, the big two are just going to be both of them
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.700]   tablet operating systems.
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:12.660]   And you'll have to use Linux if you want to use a desktop.
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.580]   Neither of you have anything to say to me.
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.900]   Well, I mean, I think desktops are going to become tablets.
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:18.900]   I mean, I think that's a very absolute--
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.900]   That's what I'm afraid of.
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:26.740]   --sir'd well, but it'll be-- these tablets are going to do absolutely everything.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:30.180]   And for example, let's imagine this for a sec.
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:35.020]   You have this big screen TV tilted at an angle like a drafting table.
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.380]   And you're a writer.
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.940]   You don't like on-screen keyboards.
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.180]   You like physical keyboards.
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.980]   So you have a keyboard that's kind of got a wedge shape underneath it.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.020]   So it's designed to sit on a drafting table angle.
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.060]   Plunk it down on the screen.
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:51.500]   The screen recognizes it as a keyboard, kicks over to physical keyboard mode.
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.260]   A document pops up in front of it.
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.180]   And you type away.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.900]   And it's just like a desktop.
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.300]   It has all kinds of apps or whatever.
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.540]   You talk to it.
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.020]   It understands gestures and things like that.
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:09.340]   So, you know, almost in almost every area of technology, nothing ever goes away.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.340]   If you look at the history of media, nothing ever--
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.140]   I guess the telegraph kind of went away.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:16.620]   But pretty much every track that could set, there are things go away.
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:17.700]   Things go away.
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.300]   Well, yes, but like radio, for example.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.100]   Player pianos.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.140]   Never went away.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.020]   Well, yeah, there are a few examples of things that didn't go away.
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.780]   I can give you lots of examples of things that did go away.
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.500]   But I mean, you don't play--
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:31.740]   Lucky whips.
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.580]   I have a player piano on my iPhone.
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:34.780]   I mean, they don't go away.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:35.300]   You know what I mean?
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.060]   They get integrated into the new stuff.
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:42.700]   And so everything that you do on a desktop will be doable on the tablet desktop of the future.
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.140]   Yeah, and I think probably we'll be able to hack.
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:47.980]   But I worry about the--
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.140]   where are you going to get the hackers of the next generation if they can't mess around
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:51.900]   with their stuff?
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:55.780]   And so I just hope that-- I guess there'll be an active jailbreak community.
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.340]   I think most people who jailbreak their iPhones are not adults.
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.020]   They're young people who want to hack around with it.
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:07.900]   So I think we've got to rely on the app development community to create apps that will
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.780]   turn children into hackers as bad as that sounds.
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.180]   That's what we need.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.020]   I agree.
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:14.500]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.660]   And I think we can count on that.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:16.420]   I think it'll happen.
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.300]   Good.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.020]   All right.
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.700]   I won't worry then.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.620]   All is well.
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.220]   I think your children-- I feel better already.
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.620]   We are going to take a break.
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:31.260]   When we come back, we'll talk about the WWDC is coming up June 11th for the keynote.
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:36.500]   We will cover that live, by the way, from the Brickhouse studios.
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.420]   And we're trying to figure out if Andy's going to come out or not.
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:45.220]   And either way, we'll have coverage of the-- you'll be going, Chris Breen, right?
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:45.980]   I will be around.
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:46.180]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.020]   I'm going to be around that week.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:47.940]   I'm not going to the keynote.
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:48.540]   I'm not going to the keynote.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:49.500]   You can get my invitation.
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.100]   Jason's going.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.020]   But I will be hanging around.
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.780]   Jason Snow is probably going.
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:53.780]   Yeah.
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.660]   Well, so we'll get some people on them and we'll cover it.
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.660]   And I don't think they're going to stream it.
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:26:59.860]   They haven't done that in ages.
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.340]   But we will watch the blogs, the live blogs.
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.540]   We'll watch Jason Snow.
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.660]   Type, type, type.
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.860]   It looks to be.
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.460]   There are going to be some big announcements.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:14.060]   In fact, this may be the biggest keynote in a long, long, long time.
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.260]   And we'll talk about those announcements in just a second.
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:21.780]   But first, a word from our sponsor, carbonites.com.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.100]   Well, I hope carbonite can still work in a sandbox.
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:27.700]   I guess it doesn't matter because you don't buy carbonite on the app store.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.580]   OK, OK.
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.660]   We don't want time machine to be the only backup.
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:36.020]   Time machine's fine as far as it goes, backing up to a local hard drive.
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.540]   And you've got everything go back in time.
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.860]   You've got the star field and the magic interface.
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:44.140]   But let's be honest, the best backup is like time machine automatic, right?
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:44.900]   You don't have to think about it.
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.420]   Continuous.
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:49.540]   One thing time machine's missing, offsite.
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.180]   Because if there's a fire, a flood, a disaster, you don't want your backups to be
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.380]   sitting there right next to the computer because they're going to go to.
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.060]   Somebody comes and steals everything.
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.460]   They're going to steal the hard drive, too.
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:05.260]   That's why carbonite is a great addition to your backup process.
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:09.540]   For Windows or Mac, carbonite lets you back up automatically, continuously, online.
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.340]   It's like time machine into the internet.
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:17.500]   It's a great partner for time machine, especially since it starts at less than $59, less than
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:22.660]   $5 a month, $59 a year for everything on your internal drive.
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.420]   They do have plans for external drives, multiple computers, and so forth.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.260]   That's all there at the carbonite website.
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:33.580]   Your files can be encrypted, so you have total privacy.
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:38.420]   They're using SSL, so you don't have to worry about even an open access, Wi-Fi access spot.
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.300]   You still can back up from there.
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.260]   And then if you have a computer disaster, it couldn't be easier to restore.
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.980]   But better than that, you can also, it's kind of better than iCloud because you can access
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.460]   your files anywhere, anytime, on any computer.
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:54.820]   Just log into your carbonite account, but they also have an iPad app, free, smartphone
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.500]   apps, free.
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:02.580]   So it's cloud storage plus backup, less than $5 a month.
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:07.140]   And if you use our offer code Mac break, when you sign up, you're going to get 14 months
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.580]   for the price of 12, so it's even more affordable.
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.220]   No credit card required for the free trial, two weeks free.
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.580]   Go to carbonite.com, give it a try.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.900]   That's why we always encourage everybody to take advantage of the free trial.
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:23.180]   All of our advertisers do that, and we really encourage them to do so because we think that
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:29.620]   you're smart, and the best way to talk to a smart buyer customer is to say, "Hey,
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:30.620]   try it.
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:31.620]   You decide.
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:32.620]   Does it work for you?
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.620]   Let us know."
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.060]   And if it does, then buy it.
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.940]   If it doesn't, no, no sweat.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.500]   Carbonite.com, the offer code for this is Mac break.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:49.940]   Now, the way WWDC Worldwide Developers Conference works is that journalists can go, but only
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:55.620]   to the keynote, and then they kick us all out, and only developers can stick around,
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:59.060]   and they are enjoined from saying anything to anybody.
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.620]   So basically, it's a sealed conference.
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:05.020]   There's no way to get information out of it unless you have a developer who's willing
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:10.780]   to break their NDA, and none of the developers I work with are going to do that because they're
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.100]   decent, honorable people.
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:17.460]   They sign the deal, and they said, "We're not going to break our NDA.
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.900]   Did we lose Chris Breen?"
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.140]   Are you there?
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.580]   I think his bandwidth went on.
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:25.420]   Mike, it's just you and me today.
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.420]   Just you and me.
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:27.420]   We'll see.
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:32.740]   Well, I think I always hold out hope for a dishonorable developer who will go in there
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.940]   and just lie and break his NDA.
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:35.940]   That would be great.
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.220]   There usually is somebody.
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.220]   Contact me.
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.220]   Mind it, Elgin.com.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:43.860]   Although, Apple's pretty good, and I think Apple's developers are pretty good about not
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:44.860]   leaking.
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.500]   There have not been a lot of leaks from WWDC.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:52.220]   It is a little frustrating because we go to the keynote and they say, "Okay, that's
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:53.220]   all.
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.220]   See ya."
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:58.340]   Then when we get people on Rich Segal from Bearbone Software, Oliver Bridenbach from
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:03.700]   Blank is going to come up afterwards after the keynote.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.260]   Everybody's in town.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:10.700]   So is Aaron Hilligas from Big Nerd Ranch, but they won't sit them down and say, "Well,"
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:14.020]   and they'll say, "I can't say anything.
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.940]   How about that keynote, though?"
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.700]   How about the stuff you were spoon-fed.
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:19.700]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:28.220]   But it stands in total contrast to Google I/O, which I go to and which is just completely
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.420]   open to the press.
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.420]   I know.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:31.420]   I love it.
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.780]   It's just night and day.
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:38.700]   But that's how both of those companies operate.
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:43.260]   One of them is incredibly close and the other one is incredibly open.
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:50.180]   It's a mixed bag and either if you can get some insight information from WWDC, then you've
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.180]   got a scoop.
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.180]   There's no way to get a scoop at Google I/O.
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.180]   It's funny.
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.860]   Everybody now, I think Microsoft started these developer conferences.
[00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.940]   Everybody does them now, Microsoft, Apple, Google.
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:00.940]   Facebook does.
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.420]   They have their FA conference.
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:09.100]   And they're really a great resource for geekier audiences like ours because it's an insight
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.100]   into what's going on.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:14.100]   So this WWDC, we are going to, there's a new iOS.
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.460]   We're going to see details of iOS 6.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.460]   Pretty sure about this.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.700]   This is all speculation.
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:26.980]   We're going to see details of Mountain Lion and probably we are going to see some new
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:27.980]   hardware.
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.500]   And that's the interesting story.
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:34.140]   There are lots of rumors now circulating.
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:35.540]   There's so much information.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:39.380]   There's so much speculation about what they're going to in so many different categories about
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:44.100]   big announcements that if they didn't announce something huge, that would be the biggest
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.100]   story of all.
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.100]   That's happened.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.620]   That's happened where Apple has not lived up to the rumor mill, shocking.
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:55.220]   But I don't think everybody's disappointed that Apple didn't break up to the stuff that
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.220]   they had nothing to do with.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:58.220]   Right.
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.220]   Yeah.
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:00.220]   It's a solemn certainty.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.140]   You can feel the, it's kind of like tectonic plates.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.580]   You can feel the pressure building.
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:07.820]   And at some point, there's going to be the big one.
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:15.140]   The best case scenario is if everything comes true, Apple TV, completely new phone, bunch
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.660]   of surprises all over the OS 10.
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:22.100]   New laptops, new desktops, new Mac minis.
[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.100]   And I think it's likely.
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.100]   Yeah.
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:25.100]   Wow.
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:26.100]   Somewhere already.
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.980]   Well, here's one of the reasons I think you're seeing the new hardware rumors is because
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:33.140]   Intel's Sandy Bridge part, the desktop part shipped last month, this month's the laptop
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:34.140]   part.
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:37.100]   And it is a, it is a none of the Apple hardware.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:41.420]   So it seems very likely that Sandy Bridge will come to Macintosh.
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:48.340]   And when it does, it will bring a USB three, for instance, Mac, daddy, Chris Breen is back.
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.660]   What are you hearing about the rumors?
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.460]   Well, I've heard everything.
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:53.460]   Yes.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.460]   Including unicorns.
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:55.460]   And I think that's unlikely.
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:56.460]   No unicorns.
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.940]   There's a pony in there somewhere.
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:33:59.940]   Right.
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:05.980]   I, I, what, what I don't expect to see this new iPad's new iPhone, new, I, anything.
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.780]   I think we will see new MacBook Pros.
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.420]   They're talking about the 15 inch being a slimmer, not an app, not a MacBook Air, but
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:16.740]   at least slimming the thing down with USB on it, the new Sandy Bridge chipset on there.
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:17.740]   That makes sense.
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:23.500]   Because when Apple does these announcements at WWDC, they, they try to bend them a little
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.740]   bit toward the professional market, toward developers.
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:31.100]   So that's why no I'm back because that's the, even though it's, you don't, you don't
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.980]   think an I'm back.
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:33.980]   I don't think so.
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:34.980]   I think that's for a fall event.
[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:36.700]   I think that really is for.
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:37.700]   So nine to five.
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:40.540]   Here's what nine to five Mac is saying.
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:48.020]   They believe there will be the largest simultaneous launch of new Max in Apple's history.
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:52.980]   They believe, according to their sources, four out of the five Mac lines will be updated
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:57.460]   June 11th at the WWDC kickoff.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:03.500]   They expect updates to for sure, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac.
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:07.260]   And then the only question mark is which one's not going to be updated?
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.100]   Will it be the mini or the pro?
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.180]   They think the pro will not be updated, even though it's way overdue.
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.700]   We have no Thunderbolt.
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:18.300]   We could, but the pro is not in that, you know, i357 line.
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:20.380]   It's a Xeon line.
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:24.780]   So I don't, I don't know if Sandy Bridge of pressure on the pro.
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:27.260]   So maybe it's, they think it's going to be the Mac mini.
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.060]   Does that seem not credible that they would make these?
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.100]   I mean, they've got iOS six and mountain line to talk about.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.420]   There's a lot of new stuff in the software and you're right.
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.580]   Is it developer conference?
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:37.940]   Should they have a separate hardware?
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:39.620]   Will they have a separate hardware event?
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.220]   We've got red displays across the line.
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.100]   I think that they do some of the hardware.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:50.060]   I think I will go on the record and saying that I think nine to five Mac is on crack.
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:55.620]   Because it just isn't, it just doesn't make any sense in regard to what they've ever done
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:56.620]   in the past.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:00.300]   So to say no, this time is ultra special.
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.340]   I think it's going to be one of those things where people are let down afterwards because
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:04.340]   they didn't get everything.
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.340]   Well, one thing is different.
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:06.340]   It's huge.
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:08.980]   I mean, that's, this is a big, big deal.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.780]   Mountain line, people need details on this.
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:14.940]   If they're going to do some kind of new Apple TV strategy, that too is huge.
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.780]   Why throw everything into one bucket when you don't need to?
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:22.580]   The other thing is that that's a good thing to announce a little bit later in the year
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:24.460]   just before the holiday season.
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:29.460]   No, no, they want to get it out in time for school, which means you do it now so that
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:33.100]   you can get it for the September buying season.
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:37.900]   And traditionally, okay, I'm going to give you the counter argument.
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:41.380]   I think you guys are probably right, but I'm going to give you the counter argument that
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:45.220]   Apple no longer has these big events.
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:47.780]   They don't have Mac world expo.
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.260]   They don't have another, they don't have CES.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:54.180]   They don't have another time to announce this stuff.
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:59.380]   It would be kind of silly to have all of this software stuff and then have in July or August
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:06.460]   another event when you've already got Moscone Center, least.
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:09.940]   And why not just boom, why not just do it all, Chris?
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:13.100]   Is there a marketing reason that you'd want to dribble and grab it out?
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.540]   Plus all of this stuff is due for update.
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:15.540]   You would agree on that, right?
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.540]   I mean, yeah, I do.
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:23.620]   I think if you think they're going to put Sandy Bridge or my Ivy Bridge and this stuff,
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.620]   why not now?
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:25.620]   It's this month.
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.220]   Yeah, I don't because I don't think they need to.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:31.100]   I think that Apple doesn't rely on these big events anymore.
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.860]   And that's one reason they don't do except for this.
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:39.020]   And this is really about developers because Apple has the power to send out a press release
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:43.980]   or an invitation a week before something happens and everybody in the world comes and it gets
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:49.140]   on the front page of every paper and periodical and website in the world.
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.100]   Apple has that kind of juice now.
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.380]   So that's true.
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:55.100]   They can do things on their own time.
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:59.500]   And I don't think that they want to get locked into what they used to do with Macworld Expo,
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.860]   which is come June every single year.
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:07.100]   They go, oh, God, we got to stop work and we have to have a bunch of stuff ready so that
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:12.380]   we can do this where I do think it's important that they have a bigish splash this year is
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:17.300]   because this is Tim Cook's not exactly is coming out party, but it's getting close in
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:23.780]   that he has to show that Apple is still innovating that they can still release new products and
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:25.340]   they want to have some splashy stuff.
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:30.820]   But that could be just the iOS six and that stuff along with a very cool looking MacBook
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.820]   Pro.
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:32.820]   All right.
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:36.020]   Here's the argument for why you do it on another argument for why you do all now.
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:37.020]   Okay.
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:38.500]   Retina means OS updates.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:43.260]   Retina means a big shift in you're going to be talking about in order to talk about what's
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:50.500]   new really new in Mountain Lion, USB three because of Ivy Bridge, retina displays, you
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:54.980]   almost need to say and by the way, here's the hardware that goes with it.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.380]   Yeah.
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.740]   That would be my counter argument.
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.740]   It's my belief.
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:01.740]   This is good.
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.060]   We'll find out in a week.
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.860]   That's my belief that that nine to five is right and that there will be this will be a
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:12.420]   massive product launch for Apple that they will get a ton of attention for it.
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:16.100]   They are way overdue if they don't do it.
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:20.900]   And I think it is as CR one says, Tim Cook's Kinsai Anyera.
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.700]   What did they say?
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.500]   It is his big coming out party.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.580]   He is he is the it's the debut top ball.
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:32.940]   You saw it kind of already last week at D 10 at the the All Things D conference where
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:37.860]   Tim Cook took the stage at an event that Steve Jobs had dominated for years and really
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:42.100]   got a lot of attention and was and was very CEO like.
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.100]   Was he not?
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.100]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.100]   Yeah.
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:49.660]   I think this is Tim Cook saying, here I am boys and look what we got.
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:53.180]   And I think this is a big opportunity for him to do just that.
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:56.700]   Well, I think there's another thing that I think that one of the things that people
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:02.740]   aren't talking enough about, I don't think there are enough rumors around this event.
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.100]   So I'll start another one.
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:09.180]   I think that there was some chatter and I actually got into it and wrote something about
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.780]   this about Apple's e-commerce platform.
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.300]   Oh my God.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:19.580]   And there was a guy who made a really interesting prediction, which is that Apple would embrace
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:28.020]   Bluetooth 4.0 as either an alternative to NFC or as an addition to NFC.
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:31.500]   And I found that argument incredibly persuasive.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:36.900]   Now Apple is the in the world of cash cash registers.
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:38.900]   You should have a show called this week in cash registers.
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:39.900]   Alleo kidding.
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:40.900]   We should.
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:42.100]   This week in POS.
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:50.740]   But in the POS world, the nuclear bomb that has been going off recently is the rise of
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:53.060]   iPads as cash registers, new businesses.
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.060]   I see them everywhere.
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.060]   You're right.
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.460]   It's the point of sale device because of Square.
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:58.620]   Yes.
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.660]   They're selling Square now.
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.660]   Where did I see it?
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:04.420]   They're selling Square in retail stores like Office Max and stuff like that.
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.420]   You can buy Square.
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.420]   Everywhere.
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:08.540]   We go into the coffee shop down the street and it's the one we use, even though there's
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:11.700]   eight coffee shops with a two block radius of this place.
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:12.700]   Literally.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.340]   We go to the one by the register.
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:16.980]   Yeah, we go to one because I can go in and I can say it's Leo.
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:17.980]   Put it on Leo.
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:19.580]   He goes, yeah, no problem.
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:20.580]   Okay.
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:21.860]   So here's the argument.
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.980]   If you go to an Apple store, you'll notice there are no cash registers.
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:25.980]   Right.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:29.860]   What happens is you find some kid in a T-shirt with the logo on it and you say, hey, I like
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:30.860]   to buy this.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.580]   I, you know, it's an iPhone case.
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.580]   And they're like, sure.
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:36.500]   And they whip out this little thing and they swipe your card and they're like, okay,
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.820]   you want the receipt sent to your email address.
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:39.820]   You're like, sure.
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:41.660]   And then you wander out of the store with it.
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.900]   This is, I think this is Apple's vision for all retail.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:45.900]   Interesting.
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.340]   I think they want to kill the cash register.
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.620]   They want to kill the, the, the practice.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:55.140]   They have a way of reinventing whole processes, whole sort of cultural things.
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:59.700]   And one of these things that we do that's kind of weird is we, we go to some big store,
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:04.700]   we find the, the item that we'd like to purchase, we carry it to the desk where they have this
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:05.980]   giant machine.
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:09.300]   And we wait in line and we walk up the machine and then there's a per, it all has to take
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:14.380]   place in that place because that cash register is this big monster from the 19th century.
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:18.540]   It's like this big like super typewriter thing.
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.940]   And I think Apple just wants to destroy that.
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:26.380]   If, if, if they, if the point of sale device is Bluetooth 4.0, which has a, you know, a
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:30.700]   distance of what is it, 150 feet or something like that, you can make a purchase anywhere
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.100]   in the store.
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.900]   And so I'm, I'm very persuaded by that.
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:38.540]   Here's another point of detail on that.
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.380]   Apple is pretty slow with new technologies.
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.580]   They roll out new technologies when they're super ready.
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.780]   They don't do it just for the sake of doing it.
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:51.020]   And yet they were the most aggressive company bar none at rolling out for Bluetooth 4.0.
[00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:54.740]   They've had it on every single device they've released last summer.
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.060]   They were the first phone, the first tablet.
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.260]   What's new in Bluetooth 4.0?
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:00.260]   What is it?
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:01.260]   What is the difference in 4.0?
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:05.100]   The point, 4.0 has this wonderful low power mode.
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:08.300]   So right now we all have these, or some of us have these Bluetooth keyboards that Apple
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:09.300]   sells.
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:13.980]   I use one with my iPad and you have to change the batteries every four or five months, something
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.340]   like that, little AA batteries.
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:22.180]   The power mode on Bluetooth 4.0 is so low, you will never have to change the batteries
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.300]   ever in the lifetime of that keyboard.
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:29.780]   It'll last five, six years without needing to be recharged or having the batteries replaced.
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:33.140]   It's so low power and it has this kind of ability to wake up.
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:37.780]   So right now there are all kinds of proprietary wireless technologies.
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:42.820]   You can buy a thermometer, outdoor thermometer that communicates via some proprietary wireless
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:43.820]   thing.
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.140]   They're all these little household things all over the place.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:48.220]   We don't even think about the used wireless technologies.
[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:53.820]   Bluetooth 4.0 is the standard that will replace all of those proprietary technologies because
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:56.500]   it can do magic things like wake things up.
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.020]   It's very low power, it can trickle out.
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:02.020]   It can maintain a contact with a device that's off.
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:05.340]   So when you turn the device back on, it just knows you're there.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:07.860]   It's a really breathtaking technology.
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:13.340]   What if Apple, what if Tim Cook, not only made WWDC the biggest product announcement of
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:15.940]   all time, but just like kind of blew the lid off of it.
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.140]   Okay, now I'm going to go even farther.
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:24.020]   What if they include Qualcomm announced a Computext, by the way, a new Bluetooth 4 chip that includes
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.780]   the new 802.11ac?
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:32.940]   What if they announce all of the above USB 3 because the Sani Bridge, Ivy Bridge gives
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:33.940]   it to you?
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.700]   Of course, still they're going to continue to do Thunderbolt.
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:41.900]   Maybe they'll even do the optical Thunderbolt, the light peak that it's copper now.
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:48.900]   Maybe they'll do the optical and 802.11ac, which means new airport extremes.
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:54.300]   And by the way, let's throw an Apple TV, a television set in there as well.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.300]   Well, you know, let's just go crazy.
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:00.780]   Let us imagine the fewer are Chris Breen.
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.220]   Imagine the world would go crazy.
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:08.020]   They'd have the news cycle, not for two days, for two weeks, for two months.
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.180]   It's all anybody would talk about it.
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:10.500]   It'd be an Apple summer.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.620]   What if Tim Cook says, "I'm going to make," and by the way, these intimated that they're
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:16.060]   going to do major product announcements this year.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:17.420]   As has Johnny Ive.
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:22.220]   What if they made this the summer of Apple?
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:28.540]   I love Seinfeld references.
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:32.620]   They would be masters of the entire domain.
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:34.580]   They're already masters of the entire domain.
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:35.580]   They don't have to do it.
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.620]   No, but Apple, you know, did you watch Mad Men on Sunday?
[00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:43.820]   Because there was a wonderful moment when Don Draper says, "You have 50% of the market."
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.980]   That's what are you talking about?
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:46.980]   Dow has 50.
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:47.980]   You want 100%.
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:51.860]   I will not rest until you have 100% of the market.
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:54.420]   Apple is not content with a 90% market share.
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.420]   They want 100%.
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.420]   Yes, they do.
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:02.220]   Why not make it the summer of Apple?
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:04.180]   The summer of Tim?
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:10.820]   I'm just not getting the summer of Tim, because I think that, you know, why blow your wad on
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:11.820]   one thing?
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:15.540]   Because that implies they only, because then they'll have another wad next summer.
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.140]   Well, I tell you why though.
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:20.500]   Well, yeah, but they might not have lots of little wads as you go about throughout the
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:21.500]   year.
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:22.500]   It's the same one.
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.740]   It's like, "Oh, well, Apple's done."
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:25.740]   And that's it.
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:29.020]   You know, it's sort of like a 65-year-old man having sex.
[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:30.740]   It's like, "Okay, here.
[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:31.740]   Done.
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.740]   I'll see you next month."
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:36.940]   So, you know, I would prefer to be the...
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:42.540]   You'd rather have lots of little wads than be the master for your domain with one giant
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:43.540]   wad.
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:47.820]   I, without going even any farther on that.
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:48.820]   Yeah.
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:49.820]   Yeah.
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:55.260]   I think it's just a deep philosophical difference between you and me, Chris Breen.
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:56.260]   It may be.
[00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:58.300]   And maybe it's...
[00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.660]   I have history on my side.
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:01.660]   I don't know.
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:02.660]   You do.
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:05.260]   You do have history on your side, and that's why it's all going to be...
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:08.940]   This is Tim Cook's chance to say, "Forget Steve Jobs.
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:15.060]   I am Tim Cook, and I am here, and we're going to do it a little differently, and we're
[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:18.460]   going to knock your socks off."
[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:20.380]   I think that could be interesting.
[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:24.020]   I think you should have me back in two weeks, and then we can have an, "I told you so."
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:25.020]   Yeah, one of us...
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:30.060]   And one of the other of us will have to wear the dust hat, and it may be me.
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:34.020]   Actually, you know, the way it usually works is, first of all, I'm always wrong.
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:36.580]   So you won just by default.
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:39.740]   But second of all, it usually isn't all one way or the other, right?
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:42.700]   There'll be a little bit of this, a little bit of that.
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:43.700]   And I'm always...
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:47.900]   Every time I try to predict what Apple's going to do, I'm like...
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:48.900]   It's in chess.
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:52.540]   It's like Apple's Bobby Fisher, and I'm just some guy on the street going, "I think you
[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:54.340]   should move your queen."
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:57.940]   And he looks at me and goes, "Well, and that's the problem is that all of us are the guys
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:58.940]   in the street, right?"
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:01.500]   And we're honestly, "Okay, this is how it's going to work."
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:05.660]   And then they do something else, and you know, that's why they're working company and not
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:06.660]   me.
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:07.660]   That's why it's fun to cover Apple.
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:09.940]   It is a company that...
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.300]   You know, people keep saying, "Why does Apple get such good press?"
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:13.300]   Because it's fun.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.300]   Period.
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:15.300]   Oh, sure.
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:16.300]   It's just fun to cover.
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:17.860]   Plus, they're good at it.
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:24.100]   A lot of the other companies in the industry, they're so desperate to get some play in the
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:27.540]   media that they're working on something, and they're like, "Look, we're working on this
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:28.540]   fantastic thing.
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:29.540]   Look at what we're working on."
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:33.580]   By the time they ship it, nobody cares anymore, because they've been talking about it so much.
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:34.580]   Exactly.
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:40.500]   Steve Jobs once said that great artists steal, and that's an often misunderstood quote.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:44.860]   But the thing that great artists always do is they always surprise.
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:50.300]   And if you can't surprise, I think they do a great job of surprising people.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:53.620]   If they go through an announcement and everybody says, "Yeah, that's what we expected."
[00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:54.620]   And they've done it before.
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:57.940]   They've done it recently.
[00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:00.220]   It allows you an announcement.
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:04.180]   When they throw something out there, and nobody expected it, the degree to which it's
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:09.300]   surprising is the degree to which it gets huge press, a lot of attention.
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.460]   And so they're really good at that.
[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:13.980]   Their message discipline is legendary.
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:18.780]   The way they control these, the fact they don't invite you and me to any of their events.
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:23.100]   This is all part of their secret sauce for success, because they're really good at surprise.
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.260]   So there will be surprises.
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:27.460]   There will be some things that are not surprising at this, but there will be some surprises.
[00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:32.500]   And what we're hoping for is gigantic, gigantic surprises.
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.940]   But I think in the larger scheme of things, what they're doing is they're working on,
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:37.860]   they have a vision for many of these things.
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:41.220]   There's some things they don't really have fully gelled vision.
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:43.580]   But many of these things share qualities.
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.820]   They're always unifying, unifying, unifying.
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:48.660]   They want everything to work and look and feel very similar.
[00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:54.180]   If you look at the use of aluminum, the use of these different technologies, everything,
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:58.620]   funneling everything to and from iCloud, they're just constantly unifying things.
[00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:02.860]   And when they have an announcement, they come out and say, "Well, what's ready to announce?"
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:06.940]   I don't think it's a thing where Tim Cook says, "I'm going to show everybody that I'm
[00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:08.380]   like this awesome CEO.
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:09.660]   I don't even think that's his style."
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:15.140]   I think it's his job to announce things and whatever they have to announce as a company,
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:16.660]   he's going to announce.
[00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:20.620]   And sometimes there's lots of stuff.
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:25.620]   And I think it feels like this time this announcement is going to be a lot of stuff
[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:28.740]   and probably a couple of really big things.
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.700]   I think it's going to be a great announcement.
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:31.900]   I wish they would let me go.
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:34.460]   Marmite does make a very good point in our chat room.
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:38.700]   He says, "Look, you can't release all these things at once because there's limited budget.
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.900]   Everybody can buy all these new things at once."
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:46.820]   So that would be the argument about spreading it out because if you hope to get more of
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:51.180]   the consumers' dollar, you would wait and slowly roll these things out.
[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:52.180]   I just think this is--
[00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:55.340]   Well, I think you also have the option with-- you were talking about the retina display
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:59.460]   and why that might help people to do it.
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:04.860]   If they give a deadline for Mountain Line, and I think they will, let's say they say,
[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:07.580]   "Okay, it'll be ready September."
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:12.260]   They could easily do the MacBook Pros now and say, "Yeah, it's going to be retina.
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:14.380]   It'll pay off in September."
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:16.540]   But then they can release the iMacs in September.
[00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:20.420]   So they don't really have to say, "Operating system a couple months from now, and you have
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:22.180]   to have the new hardware now, too."
[00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:23.180]   That will come.
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:24.180]   Here's the problem, though.
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:28.740]   If you announce retina capability in Mountain Line, then everybody's going to say, "Okay,
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:33.100]   we see new retina computers coming and you kill all sales for the rest of the summer."
[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:34.100]   Right?
[00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:39.380]   Well, yeah, or they could not play it up so much as they may not even have to mention
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:43.620]   it as part of Mountain Line, but rather just release it in a new MacBook Pro and just say,
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:47.980]   "Hey, it has a retina display without dropping the other shoe, which is all in by the way."
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:51.980]   Yeah, well, that's another compelling reason to do it all at once, because what you don't
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:53.420]   want to do is kill existing sales.
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:57.100]   I mean, you can't talk, for instance, about an iPhone 5 now, because you want to keep selling
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:00.700]   iPhone 4Ss until it comes out in September.
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:06.380]   If you are ready with new MacBook Pros, if you're going to allude to anything that would
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:10.820]   make people confirm those rumors that they're coming, then you'd better start selling them
[00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:13.740]   pretty quick because you're going to kill all sales until you do.
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.380]   I tell you what I'm going to do.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:19.020]   I am going to just, and the chat room's demanding this of me, so I'm going to do it, buy one
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:24.340]   of each Apple product tomorrow, and then that way Apple can go ahead and just ship all
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:28.060]   the new stuff, because I know they wait until I buy it.
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:29.060]   Would you do that, Leo?
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:30.060]   Yeah.
[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:35.900]   I'm going to do that, and then I'll just, actually, there is product protection, right?
[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.620]   How long does that typically go for, Chris?
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:41.980]   If you buy a 30-day, so I think you can take it back and get the other one.
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:44.020]   So I should do that.
[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:45.900]   And then in the 30 days, because I don't want everything.
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:49.660]   If they do, look, if they ship the new thin MacBook Pro, I'm going to want that.
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:52.020]   If they want, if they do, right now I'm going to want that.
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:57.900]   If they do a thunderbolt on a Mac, I'm going to want that.
[00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:59.820]   So I'm going to have to upgrade anyway.
[00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:00.820]   I might as well just buy it.
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:04.980]   Well, the thing is, Leo, though, that they've got your account tagged with a little red flag.
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:10.020]   And so as soon as you buy that stuff, you know, it'll show up and say, "Oh, this will
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.020]   be available in..."
[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:20.860]   Now, this day, 31 days later, it's like, "Oh, here it is, and there's Leo."
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:25.260]   Oh, you could see me at this event watching this event, and it ships August 1st.
[00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:26.420]   Oh, dear.
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:29.260]   And that's, yeah, that'll be the experience of this year.
[00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:33.580]   Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
[00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:34.980]   Well that's why we have Gazelle.
[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:42.300]   Thank goodness for Gazelle.com because if it weren't for Gazelle, I would be stuck with
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:43.620]   a lot of old Apple gear.
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:50.060]   Gazelle allows you to sell your iPhone, your iPad, your iPod, your Android smartphone,
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:53.860]   even your BlackBerry or your Nokia phone, so you can get the latest versions.
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:57.860]   Just select a product, scroll down there, see all the...
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:01.620]   And then you pick those desktops that you want to get rid of, the laptops, the Apple
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.620]   display.
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:07.180]   You know, I'm thinking I'm going to replace my 12-at-27-inch display, which I love, but
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:09.100]   I want the new retina, right?
[00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:10.100]   So here's your chance.
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:13.340]   And by the way, when you get a quote from Gazelle.com, that quote's good for 30 days.
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:17.500]   So get the quote now because I got to tell you, as soon as a new thing comes out, the price
[00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.180]   drops like crazy, right?
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:21.220]   So now's the time to go to Gazelle.com.
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:22.900]   Yeah, normal wear and ta...
[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:23.900]   No, it's brand...
[00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:25.460]   Okay, slight wear, slight, slight.
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:26.900]   It's pretty good shape.
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:28.300]   I dusted it dearly.
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:29.460]   Let's just see how much that's worth.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:30.660]   Yeah, I got all this stuff.
[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:32.980]   I don't have the original box now.
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:33.980]   Let's see what that...
[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:34.980]   Whoa!
[00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:35.980]   Okay, that's good.
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:38.460]   That's a third of the way towards my new display.
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:40.060]   And then so here's the thing.
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:41.300]   You throw this stuff in the box.
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.300]   They pay the shipping.
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:44.460]   You don't have to worry about the shipping.
[00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:50.780]   And then you get a check or PayPal or best yet you can get an Amazon gift card and get
[00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:56.100]   an additional 5% because they rebate the Amazon affiliate fee to you.
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:03.540]   And Alfred, Leo, can I make the case for this type of thing as an environmentally friendly
[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:04.540]   thing to do?
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:09.780]   Because a lot of people think, "Well, I should hang on to my device and use it to the bitter
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:10.780]   end."
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:15.300]   But this is actually the most environmentally friendly thing you can do is to upgrade as
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:20.380]   often as possible because what happens is, no, the reason is if you have a good device
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:23.180]   and you sell it back and they're going to sell it to somebody, somebody's going to be
[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:26.180]   using that device and it's still going to be a good shape, it's still going to be pretty
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:27.180]   new.
[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:28.180]   Right.
[00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:29.180]   And that's really the solution.
[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:32.860]   The only environmentally friendly gadget is the one that isn't manufactured.
[00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:33.860]   Good points.
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:39.900]   And the more people pass around the previously owned devices, the fewer need to be manufactured.
[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:43.860]   Wow, I never even thought of it that way, but you're absolutely right.
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.140]   Better than recycling.
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:47.140]   And that's why their slogan is keep it moving.
[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:49.780]   Don't pile it up in the closet in the drawer.
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:53.940]   Rent a, you know, rent a space for your own gadgets.
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:55.780]   That's not helping anybody.
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:56.860]   Keep it moving.
[00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:57.860]   Pay it forward.
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:03.780]   Gazelle.com, you get cash, somebody else gets a brand new device and everybody is happy.
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:04.780]   You're right.
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:06.220]   This is a great company, gazel.com.
[00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:08.500]   Do it now.
[00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:11.980]   The sooner you do it, the more your gadget will be worth.
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:16.300]   And you definitely want to Gazelle before WWDC.
[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:21.260]   Because if I'm right, everything changes on Monday, the 11th.
[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:22.260]   Everything.
[00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:23.260]   Yep.
[00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:25.620]   It's all up for actually.
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.260]   It's Monday the 11th, right?
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:28.260]   Yeah.
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:29.260]   This Monday.
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.660]   In fact, what we're going to do, we're going to cover it and then we'll do a Mac break weekly
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:32.660]   right after.
[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:35.980]   In fact, Chris, if you'd like to join us, we'd love to have you if you're not doing anything
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:36.980]   else.
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:37.980]   Mike, you too.
[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:39.580]   Will you have the non-scap with you?
[00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:40.580]   Because I will.
[00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:41.580]   I will.
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:42.580]   You can.
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:46.140]   This is you don't have to wait two weeks next Monday, six days from now.
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:47.900]   You can mock me.
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:50.660]   You can say, no, no, I mean, you know what you can do the other way.
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:51.660]   You could pull up the tape.
[00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:56.260]   You could say, Leo, let's review last week's Mac break weekly in which you made it complete
[00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:57.260]   fool of yourself.
[00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:02.700]   All right, because we have little checkboxes where like, uh, Chris, wrong, Leo, right?
[00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:04.380]   We should have a big go.
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:05.780]   I'm sure there's a product bingo.
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:07.980]   Everybody, every time there's an announcement, they have a product bingo.
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:09.060]   And boy, there's going to be a lot.
[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:12.620]   We know that we know, because it's a developers conference, that they will absolutely talk
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:15.460]   about iOS six and about mountain line.
[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:17.500]   And we know a lot about mountain line because it's been beta.
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.180]   We don't know much about iOS six.
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:24.500]   It's been a while since the latest iOS almost a year now.
[00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:30.820]   Since iOS five came out, there is a great rumor that I would love to have come true
[00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:34.820]   that iOS six will bring full Siri integration into the iPad.
[00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:36.820]   You think so?
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:37.820]   I do.
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:41.980]   And I think, I think not only the, I think the better news will be that Siri will be
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:45.700]   upgraded in some way that's smarter, the more dramatic.
[00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:52.900]   Well, for example, I think I think back in the old days before Siri was part of iOS five,
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:55.180]   it actually had some level of agency.
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:58:00.460]   You could actually make a restaurant reservation through open table.
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:03.980]   And they were promising all kinds of other things that would, where Siri would actually
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:09.180]   do things, not just give you information, but actually buy things and stuff like that.
[00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:14.220]   So I would love to see the next step of Siri, which is essentially go back to the old Siri,
[00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:18.260]   which is, you know, to be able to go do things, go make a reservation.
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:23.100]   Yes, actually purchase and arrange for the delivery of flowers to my wife, which by the
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:25.620]   way, the old Siri app could do.
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:26.620]   Yes.
[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:27.620]   Yes.
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:28.620]   Absolutely.
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:32.060]   And they were going to do and everybody was talking about the millions of possibilities
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:34.460]   around reservations on it.
[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:35.460]   Yeah.
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:39.140]   So I think agency, the general category of that type of activity is called agency.
[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:42.580]   And I'd love to see agency and Siri more than even having it on the iPad.
[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:47.380]   Although I do understand why Apple pulled out, pulled back a little bit because Siri, even
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:51.860]   with the limited functionality, it has Apple just couldn't keep up with the demand.
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:55.700]   And Siri still sometimes just doesn't respond.
[00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:59.460]   Although it's my experience has been much better than it was.
[00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:00.460]   Yeah.
[00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:01.980]   My experience is the opposite.
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:05.620]   The first like two weeks or three weeks, it seemed to be great.
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:08.060]   Maybe I just had lower expectations than I'm.
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:13.140]   I'm not sure, but I really struggle with Siri and it has trouble.
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:16.060]   You know, you have a perfect voice.
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:17.060]   That's true.
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:18.340]   Like you have a really clear voice.
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:19.980]   I say Siri, please.
[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:20.980]   Yes.
[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:22.340]   Add to my shopping list.
[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:23.340]   And I have them.
[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:26.020]   The rest of us are mumbling and you know, stuff like that.
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:27.660]   So I felt like such an idiot.
[00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:29.380]   I was walking down the street yesterday.
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:31.980]   I said, yeah, boom, boom.
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:34.220]   Add toilet paper to my shopping list.
[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:37.660]   And I looked up and there's somebody right in front of me and I go, Oh geez Louise.
[00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:39.660]   You can't be embarrassing.
[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:41.660]   I'm just talking to you.
[00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:42.660]   Yeah.
[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:47.860]   Literally, that actually happened to me and I was like, Oh God.
[00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:53.500]   It's one thing if you're with other people who use Siri, but when somebody doesn't really
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:56.620]   know what you're doing, sees you talking to your phone, add toilet paper.
[00:59:56.620 --> 01:00:01.460]   And I do an uncead, add toilet paper to my shopping list.
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:02.460]   I'm actually really excited.
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:03.460]   Right.
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:05.460]   And it's far worse than you have to repeat it over and over and over again.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:06.460]   I did.
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:07.460]   I had to repeat it once.
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:11.460]   I said, Hey, actually if I else do, I describe this to you.
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:12.900]   I said one thing.
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:16.700]   I said Kleenex and it added what did it add to my shopping list?
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:20.980]   Something that I didn't change because I thought, well, I'll know what that means.
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:25.940]   Oh, no, clean next.
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:28.740]   Add clean next to my shopping list.
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:29.740]   All right.
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:30.980]   Cannot find clean next.
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:31.980]   Yeah.
[01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:32.980]   You're you.
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:33.980]   You're on the side of the car.
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.980]   Extra small condoms to my shopping list.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:38.460]   That was the embarrassing one.
[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:41.460]   No, you got to be careful what you say.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:42.460]   Yes.
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:43.460]   Out loud.
[01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:49.020]   In last week, last week, Alex recommended a headset that's super, yes, I think it was
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:52.380]   last week, a super noise canceling.
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:54.620]   And I ordered one and I'm just like so excited.
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.340]   I think it was a couple of weeks ago.
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:00.380]   So excited to use this thing, especially with Siri because you can be in a really noisy
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.140]   room and you can whisper.
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:05.380]   So for the condom and the toilet paper, you can whisper to Siri.
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:06.380]   Siri.
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:07.380]   Don't tell anyone.
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:08.380]   I need these.
[01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:09.380]   Exactly.
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:10.380]   So.
[01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:16.860]   And then you can, when Siri's done, you could say, I need extra large condoms, please.
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:21.380]   Well, I was relieved because I did think Siri might repeat it.
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:25.260]   And then Siri, when you're adding the shopping list, does not say, okay, Leo, I will add
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:27.660]   toilet paper to your, it doesn't say that.
[01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:28.740]   Thank God.
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:32.100]   It does repeat some other, it repeats your texts back to you.
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:34.540]   I guess that's so if you're driving, you can.
[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:35.540]   Yeah.
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:38.940]   I would like to see, and well, of course, the other rumor of this Apple TV rumor is that
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:40.380]   there'll be Siri in the Apple TV.
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:45.420]   Now interestingly, the thing that we can ignore is that there's pressure on Apple because
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:48.860]   other people, no, I don't know, maybe this doesn't, maybe Apple doesn't, and Andy and
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:52.220]   Akos have heard this for years, that Apple doesn't care what other people are doing.
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:58.660]   But Microsoft at E3 yesterday announced capabilities in the Xbox that are actually going to challenge
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:02.540]   Apple TV in many ways, including connect speech.
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:08.180]   I think they announced precisely the thing that Steve Jobs was referring to when he said
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:09.700]   we cracked the code.
[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.340]   And here's what that thing is.
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:14.180]   I would call it reverse airplay.
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.860]   So we have airplay.
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:20.260]   I don't think the general culture has caught on to the implications of airplay.
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:25.060]   Airplay, you're watching something on your phone, you have some piece of media on an
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:26.060]   iPad or something.
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:30.380]   You don't play it on the TV and you have this airplane mirroring and whatever is on your
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.860]   mobile device shows up on the TV beautifully.
[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:37.700]   And my son is really into this and he's done some really amazing things with this.
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:38.700]   It's just so great.
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:42.500]   And when people try it, it's just revolutionary.
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:47.740]   But the really revolutionary thing is reverse airplay to take anything on the TV and just
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:50.220]   bring it over to any device.
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:56.020]   And once you can do both of those things, what happens is Apple becomes the game.
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:04.580]   The gatekeeper becomes the only necessary link in your overall entertainment chain because
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:07.100]   people are going to be going in both directions with media.
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:08.660]   It's not something you're always saying.
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:11.140]   And I've been saying too, for a long time, gosh, I wish they would replace the whole
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:14.220]   cable thing and the whole dish network thing.
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:17.060]   But they don't need to yet.
[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:24.500]   They can co-opt all of that by turning your iPad into a TV that uses your TV cable system.
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:31.300]   I use HBO Go on my iPad, even though I have HBO on my TV and it's really nice.
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.300]   I mean, that's a...
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:33.820]   But see, they talk about that.
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:38.780]   HBO Go is in the Xbox as a cord cutting thing, but you can't use HBO Go unless you have an
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:40.980]   HBO subscription through a cable company.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.300]   I think the way Apple...
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.260]   And it's bigger than just TV and movies.
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:45.980]   I think Apple...
[01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:49.580]   My belief is that Apple looks at these screens, not as this one's mobile, that one isn't
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:50.580]   mobile.
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:51.580]   This one's...
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:55.820]   I think the way they look at it is that how far is it from your face?
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:04:00.740]   An iPhone is going to be a foot from your face when you're using it as a media.
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:03.020]   The iPad is going to be a foot and a half.
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:07.540]   The tablet or desktop is going to be two to three feet away, maybe.
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:10.940]   And the TV is going to be further than five feet, 10 feet away.
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.420]   And those are the really used case.
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:15.060]   So you're going to use your TV as a...
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:20.460]   In many of the same ways you're using your iPhone or iPad or desktop.
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:21.780]   And vice versa.
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:25.620]   And they're all just screens that you use that are of different sizes that you use from
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:28.220]   different differences from your eyes.
[01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:29.660]   And I think that's the vision.
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:36.100]   So everything is going to do everything.
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:40.940]   So can we have you on next Monday when everything doesn't do everything and say, "You, you are
[01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:41.940]   wrong!"
[01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:44.740]   Yes, everything does nothing.
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:45.740]   Everything does nothing.
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:47.460]   I will do anything.
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:51.980]   I will be wrong, but I can almost guarantee you that more things will do more things.
[01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:55.940]   So I'll take that bet.
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:57.380]   I like reverse airplay.
[01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:59.540]   That's a really interesting concept.
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:02.540]   And that's essentially what the Xbox announcement is.
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:03.540]   Right.
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.980]   Well, I mean, it's very clear.
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:11.420]   And I've actually had this in my speeches from 15 years ago that what people want with
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:15.980]   media is they want what they want, when they want it, anywhere they want it without any
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:16.980]   restrictions.
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:21.700]   So if I have a platform, if I have a screen, I want to be able to watch whatever I want
[01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.380]   on that screen.
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:26.140]   And if I have a copy in one place, it should be everywhere.
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:30.100]   You know what the biggest restriction is with the way most people watch TV?
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:35.740]   It's the interface that the cable company gives you, the clunky thing with the big remote
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:37.180]   with the millions of buttons.
[01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:42.500]   And then you're sitting there trying to navigate to this clunky thing from the 80s that just
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:43.500]   chunks down.
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.500]   Where is that show?
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.500]   I don't know where the show, you search.
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:46.500]   It doesn't work.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.500]   It's awful.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:51.780]   And that's really such a big barrier for people who were used to just clicking and watching.
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:52.780]   Yeah.
[01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:58.340]   What about Facebook integration?
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:03.220]   Remember last week when Tim Cook was on stage at all things, Deacris Breeny said,
[01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:04.220]   stay tuned.
[01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:05.780]   He said, we love Facebook.
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:07.460]   There's deep integration of Twitter.
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:08.460]   Facebook's missing.
[01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:13.860]   Do you think iOS six will suddenly have deep Facebook integration?
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:14.860]   I think it will.
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:18.300]   I think this is a change with Tim Cook.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.100]   Yeah, this is Tim versus Steve Jobs.
[01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:21.380]   This is Tim's.
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:25.540]   I think that Steve Jobs was not happy with Facebook.
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:30.540]   Originally when they conceived Ping, it was supposed to interface with Facebook.
[01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:33.660]   And if it had, it would have been more successful than it was.
[01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:36.620]   But Jobs talked about Facebook's onerous terms.
[01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:41.740]   So even though I think he admired Zuckerberg and Facebook, he felt that they were a competitor,
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:47.380]   but he wanted to dominate and turned out that Facebook wasn't going to go along with
[01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:48.380]   it.
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:53.180]   I think Tim Cook has come in with a more reasonable idea.
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:57.420]   Doesn't want to challenge Facebook, but rather partner with them, where it makes sense, particularly
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:01.180]   after Apple has shown that it doesn't do social networking very well.
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:05.140]   So I think that once Steve was gone and they had a chance to clear the air, they probably
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:09.500]   Apple and Facebook got together and said, okay, let's see how we can do this to our mutual
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:10.660]   benefit.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:14.860]   And so yes, I think we're going to see a lot of Facebook hooks built into iOS 6.
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:21.380]   So anything that you create or consume, you're going to be able to link onto your Facebook
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:25.620]   page and stuff that's on Facebook, you're going to be able to bring into iOS 6 pretty
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:26.620]   easily.
[01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:32.060]   I think there's going to be some Facebook integration, but I think it's going to be limited indefinitely
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:37.300]   because Facebook's only benefit to Apple, other than the fact that they have, you know,
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:42.740]   the gazillions and gazillions of users, is that they're sort of like the enemy of my
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:45.620]   enemy is my friend kind of a thing.
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:46.940]   And they're not Google.
[01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:52.300]   And I think it's part of the Thermonuclear War for Apple to partner a certain extent
[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:53.300]   with Facebook.
[01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:55.100]   But I haven't seen any evidence.
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:59.340]   There are these statements that are being trotted out as evidence that Apple is really,
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:02.900]   really excited to get really, really close to Facebook.
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:05.140]   And there is no evidence for that.
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:10.660]   The things that Tim Cook said at All Things D were, you know, the kind of generic things
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:11.820]   that you say about a company.
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:15.900]   So we really respect and like the company and, you know, paraphrasing, but it was, you
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:20.660]   know, it was, it was, those are the kinds of things you say about a company that is
[01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:24.260]   a major company that you're not openly at war with.
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:28.500]   And I think there'll be some integration, but I don't think it will or should get anywhere
[01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:29.780]   near Twitter integration.
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:35.100]   Twitter is a fantastic social partner for Apple in many, many ways.
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:38.180]   I mean, you know, remember what happened in September?
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:44.460]   Facebook came out with all these things that were alternatives to using Apple as your main
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:45.460]   source of media.
[01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:49.460]   New York Times called it the Internet's primary entertainment hub.
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:54.260]   They started partnering with all of Apple's competitors, Spotify and all these other things.
[01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:58.980]   And not just competitors in terms of sources for music and media and movies, but the whole
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:05.100]   approach to how you discover and find and use and consume content.
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:08.980]   And Facebook just boldly plowed right into that direct competitive thing.
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:10.580]   And there are all kinds of ways that doing that.
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:19.620]   For example, in iOS, Apple, Facebook is starting to, trying to replace Apple apps for high,
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:22.620]   and essentially hijacking the iOS user experience.
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:26.940]   For example, they came out with Apple, they came out with Facebook Messenger, which is
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:32.380]   a separate app from the Facebook app that pretty much competes directly with iMessage.
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:37.500]   They came out with a camera app last week that competes directly with a camera app.
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:41.260]   Well, it also competes with Instagram, which they own.
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:43.820]   So that doesn't mean Facebook knows what it's doing.
[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:47.140]   It means, in fact, that is the bizarist thing I've ever seen.
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:52.420]   But it means they buy Instagram for a billion dollars than a month later release a duplicate
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:56.100]   product, even though they don't own Instagram, didn't even close.
[01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:58.420]   So Facebook, it doesn't know what it's doing.
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:09:59.420]   Yeah.
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:04.940]   Well, I mean, it doesn't know what it's doing, but you couldn't conceive of Apple, say,
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:07.860]   partnering with Amazon.
[01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:08.860]   Because Amazon has a lot of--
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:10.540]   They're natural enemies.
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:11.540]   Natural enemies.
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:15.340]   And to a very large extent, Facebook is a natural enemy as well, because Facebook wants
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:18.980]   everybody to, instead of using Apple's services.
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:24.020]   And there's even rumors that Facebook's going to launch a phone using Apple engineers
[01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:25.020]   and Apple P.
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:26.020]   Right.
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:27.020]   It's going to hurt to the iPhone.
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.020]   Yeah.
[01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:31.100]   So I think Apple should just laugh at that one.
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:32.100]   Go ahead.
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:37.980]   Well, they don't like-- whether it will succeed or not, I think is really different from the
[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:42.740]   fact that they like partners who aren't going to get anywhere near any of their core businesses.
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:43.740]   Like Twitter.
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:46.500]   Twitter doesn't get anywhere near anything Apple does.
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:51.780]   They don't pretend to be the internet's entertainment hub.
[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.460]   They don't try to replace all of Apple's--
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:56.540]   And Facebook is potentially a huge competitor.
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:57.540]   Yes.
[01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:58.540]   Yeah.
[01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:00.740]   So I think Apple should buy Twitter.
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:05.180]   And even though it'll cost them $10 billion or something like that, which is an unusually
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:07.620]   large acquisition for Apple.
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:11.980]   But I just think Twitter is a perfect fit for Apple in so many ways.
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:12.980]   Yeah.
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:14.820]   What do you think, Chris?
[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:16.180]   I disagree.
[01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:19.860]   I think-- well, first of all, I'd like to go back to the competitive aspects of it.
[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:23.540]   I don't think Spotify is a competitor to Apple's business at all.
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:24.540]   Really?
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:26.100]   It's a completely-- no, it's a completely different model.
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:30.060]   If you want to buy the music, it actually will send you to iTunes, won't it?
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:31.060]   You go to iTunes.
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:36.020]   So what you do is you bring all that whole Facebook music initiative is all about streaming
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.100]   and it's all about discovery.
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:41.460]   As we've discovered from Ping, Ping has nothing to do with discovery.
[01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.460]   It's terrible at it.
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:44.460]   So if you were to integrate something--
[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:49.180]   And by the way, I think Tim Cook implied that this was a mistake and they're going
[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:50.180]   to--
[01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:51.180]   Right.
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:52.180]   Yeah, it's dead.
[01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:53.180]   It's dead.
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:57.020]   So-- but if you integrate into the music app, for example, on your iOS device, something
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:03.140]   like Facebook's music initiative, so it can be Spotify or MOG or can be Rhapsody.
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:05.060]   You have the opportunity to stream some of this stuff.
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:08.420]   And when it comes time to buy, that's when you're directed to the iTunes store.
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:09.620]   I think that's complementary.
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:14.700]   I don't think it's something where you're talking about a competitive nature.
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:18.700]   I do agree with Mike that the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:22.020]   I mean, Facebook and Google+, are deep in it.
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.020]   Yeah, but--
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:25.020]   And you're never going to see Google+ on iPhone.
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:27.380]   Yeah, but look at what the models are really about.
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:32.140]   Yes, they're both intended to sell your information to other people for advertising,
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:33.980]   but take it down a level.
[01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:37.580]   And really, Facebook is about people and connecting to people and Google is not at all about
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:42.340]   that even with Google+, I don't think that works.
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:47.500]   So yes, they are enemies at a particular level, but I do think that they're separate enough
[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:55.300]   where an alliance with Facebook in some circumstances makes sense, particularly that people connection,
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:59.860]   because again, Apple doesn't do that very well.
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:01.740]   What else are we going to sell?
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:07.100]   Siri, better Siri, Facebook integration, possibly.
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:10.460]   What else will be new in I-- some stuff we know, don't we, or do we not know?
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:11.460]   Is it all--
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:12.460]   That's right.
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:13.460]   Oh, that's right.
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:16.620]   So tomorrow, Google is having a map event in which they're going to announce the new
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:19.580]   Google Maps hoping to steal a little thunder.
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:21.180]   By the way, this never works, guys.
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:26.460]   You should know better from Apple's announcement on June 11th, the following Monday, that they're
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:30.540]   dumping Google Maps in iOS 6 and they're going to have this incredible map app.
[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:36.740]   They are, by the way, encouraging everybody who uses mapping to start using their mapping
[01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:37.740]   API.
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:42.780]   I didn't know this, but I saw an article that they actually started a new location service
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:50.620]   in iOS some time ago, and they've been encouraging developers to use this for some time.
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:58.860]   So they're kind of ready to move on a completely new map system, yes?
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:13:59.860]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:02.420]   Well, yeah, plus they've killed GPS completely.
[01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:03.420]   What do you mean?
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:04.420]   GPS units.
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:05.420]   I mean, why--
[01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:06.420]   Yeah.
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:07.420]   Well, why would you go and buy a garment unit now?
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:08.420]   But that's the point.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:12.060]   And, Andrew, you got turned by turn through the Google Maps, through the Navigator, and
[01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:13.540]   you don't on iOS.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:14.540]   You have to buy a turn by turn now.
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:15.900]   Yeah, but that does come with this next--
[01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:16.900]   Yeah.
[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:17.900]   --turn by turn is part of it.
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:18.900]   So that's the deal.
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:19.900]   Right?
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:20.900]   So--
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:21.900]   I have it.
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:22.900]   --and if you have Siri integration, where you're in your car and you've got your iPhone,
[01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:23.900]   yeah.
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:28.340]   And you just say, oh, wait, I need to stop at a drugstore before I continue on, Siri.
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.180]   It says, oh, OK, well, turn left here.
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:31.180]   Take her right here.
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:32.180]   Here's the map.
[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:33.180]   There you are.
[01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:34.180]   Where do you want to go now?
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:35.180]   I want to go back.
[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:36.180]   OK, fine.
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:37.180]   Let's go ahead and do that.
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:38.180]   Mm-hmm.
[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:43.860]   The key to the future of mobile marketing, and everybody knows it, and I think that's
[01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:46.580]   part of what's behind what's going on here.
[01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:53.340]   I mean, last week, Google announced the integration of Zagat into Maps and Google+,
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:58.380]   and this is an example of the kind of thing that Apple's going to want a piece of.
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:02.060]   You know, the basic function-- you know, one of the things we use our phones most for
[01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:03.740]   is, where am I going?
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:06.140]   I need to find a Starbucks.
[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:07.500]   Where can I find a gas station?
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:08.740]   Where's a good restaurant?
[01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:14.220]   And all that stuff, in both the case of Google and Apple, is all going to voice assistance.
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:17.980]   You know, you just say it, and you'll get the answer, and here's a map, and all that
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:18.980]   stuff.
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:24.180]   So getting people to use your mapping application is going to be really important for both Apple
[01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:25.380]   and Google.
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:29.220]   So this makes perfect sense for Apple to do this, although it kind of drags Apple out
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:36.940]   of the hardware software integrated thing into the content management business.
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:42.380]   Because once you get into Maps, you get into all kinds of-- you know, you have to constantly
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:47.780]   managing bad Maps, and you have partners that aggregate the satellite--
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:49.460]   But you can crowdsource that.
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:53.060]   I mean, that's one advantage of putting it on a phone, and one advantage that Google has
[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:58.220]   had is that every phone-- and by the way, which Google's about to lose, every phone as it
[01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:01.340]   goes around is giving you new data.
[01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:05.700]   And so the fact that Google Maps is not going to be on iOS takes 50 million devices out
[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:07.460]   of Google's database.
[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:09.460]   I think it's not insignificant.
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:10.460]   It is not.
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:15.540]   And I don't think that-- I think it's going to be spun as Steve Jobs hated-- you know,
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:18.980]   I'm going to kill-- to thermonuclear war against Google, and it isn't.
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:20.020]   It's as you said, Mike.
[01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:23.020]   This is-- it's profit.
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:25.300]   This is a good business, and Apple wants to be in it.
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:27.060]   Why should they see it to Google?
[01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:28.060]   Why shouldn't they have this?
[01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:31.020]   And they're going to have-- we already know they want to put traffic data into it from
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:35.540]   that kerfuffle about saving the data, the location data on the phone.
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:42.100]   Well, I also think that Apple is very good at identifying user experiences that are horrible
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:46.900]   and seeing them for what they are, which are opportunities for Apple to present.
[01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:47.900]   Wonderful.
[01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:52.660]   I actually think that-- I use Google Maps on the iPhone constantly, and I hate it.
[01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:53.660]   It's really bad.
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:55.620]   The first of all, I use it on iOS, so there's no time.
[01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:57.180]   It's much better on Android.
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:59.060]   It's so much better on Android.
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:02.380]   You can't read the instructions.
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:06.740]   They actually made it worse recently because they now have this blue line and they have
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:11.900]   multiple options, and then the location of where you are is also blue.
[01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:20.420]   So I'm over the age of 40 slightly by a couple of weeks.
[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:21.420]   And kidding.
[01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:23.500]   I'm significantly older than 40.
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:26.940]   But I don't wear my reading glasses when I'm driving.
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:31.860]   I think probably half the population doesn't wear reading glasses while driving.
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:36.780]   And so that's when you're not supposed to when you're driving, but that's when people
[01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:38.900]   use the Maps app most.
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:42.100]   And I can't-- it's so hard to read what it says.
[01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:44.100]   It's so hard to see where I am on the blue line.
[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:50.300]   It's just the fundamental basic, simplest use of this thing is just on the border of
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:51.300]   being useless.
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:55.380]   The only thing that makes it good is the fact that the map itself is really great.
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:18:00.180]   The user interface is horrible, and I'm counting on Apple to do something better.
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:05.220]   Well, I think this is one thing that we all agree is going to happen in iOS 6.
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:11.420]   Even the Wall Street Journal, which seems to have kind of an inside track to Apple, says
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:12.420]   that.
[01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:13.420]   Yeah.
[01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:15.020]   Let's talk about Mountain Lion.
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:18.060]   What do we know about Mountain Lion, Chris Breen?
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.820]   Is there any-- is it rumors?
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:23.540]   Or is there some-- well, I guess they've been pushing out developer versions, so developers
[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:24.820]   know some stuff.
[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:29.620]   Yeah, they're on developer version three, I think, are for you three.
[01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:33.060]   So we know things like Gatekeeper, which we were talking about earlier.
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:34.060]   Gatekeeper's cool.
[01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:35.060]   I like Gatekeeper.
[01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:37.700]   Yeah, I think it is too.
[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:40.660]   But again, we kind of go back to that argument.
[01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:42.100]   Is this a good thing or a bad thing?
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:43.260]   Well, you don't have to--
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:44.260]   You could compromise.
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:46.980]   So tell me about Gatekeeper.
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:52.380]   My sense of it is that you can turn off or on Gatekeeper.
[01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:56.940]   So if you turn it on, it will only install apps that have a certificate, right?
[01:18:56.940 --> 01:19:00.460]   Well, yeah, the three levels, it's App Store only.
[01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:02.060]   App Store only, right.
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:03.620]   And then there's the--
[01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:06.460]   Which you would turn off for the highest level of security, presumably.
[01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:07.460]   Right.
[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:09.460]   And then there's everything open, which is--
[01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:10.460]   Right.
[01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:11.460]   --do what you want.
[01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:12.460]   And that's what we enjoy.
[01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:13.460]   But, yeah, I like that.
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:14.460]   I mean, that's what Android does.
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:16.220]   It says, you can get stuff from third party.
[01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:17.420]   It's not safe.
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.180]   Or you can be locked down like iOS is.
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:20.220]   And I like the switch.
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:21.580]   I like the button.
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:24.220]   I don't want them to take out the button.
[01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:25.220]   Right.
[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:28.340]   I think Gatekeeper's huge.
[01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:34.580]   Some say that Mountain Lion will be at a TV OS as well.
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:38.500]   Or will they have something separate for an Apple?
[01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.500]   Do you believe--
[01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:44.140]   Alex Lindsay's like on record saying there's no way Apple's ever going to do a TV.
[01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:48.180]   Where do you stand in the new television from Apple?
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:53.340]   I think that they will have one, but I think they'll also have a kind of kit that turns
[01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:54.340]   your regular--
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:55.340]   Oh.
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:56.340]   --TV into one.
[01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:58.700]   So it'll be a box plus maybe a motion control thing.
[01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:02.380]   So you could use the existing Apple TV plus some additional hardware perhaps or something
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:03.380]   like that.
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:04.380]   Yeah.
[01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:09.180]   Or there'll be a new-- I have heard some pretty compelling speculation that there could be
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:15.020]   a strip like thing that looks kind of like connect that does motion capture and all the
[01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:16.980]   rest, maybe voice recognition stuff.
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:20.740]   But then they'll go ahead and sell a TV with all that built in.
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:22.980]   I don't see why they wouldn't build a TV.
[01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:24.340]   The numbers are never going to be huge.
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:29.940]   They're never going to be like the iPhone or anything like that or even the iPad.
[01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:30.940]   But why not?
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:33.460]   They already have the manufacturing capability.
[01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:35.300]   They already have designs.
[01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:42.060]   Why not just make it look exactly like an iMac and build a TV with an incredible display
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:44.740]   and all of the Apple TV stuff built in.
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:46.860]   I think it'd be cool and a lot of people would buy it.
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:48.900]   Is that what you think's going to happen, Chris?
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:51.380]   No, I'm going to be disagreeable.
[01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:53.580]   No, I like it.
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:55.420]   If we all agree, it's no fun at all.
[01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:56.420]   Oh, OK.
[01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:57.420]   I disagree.
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:58.420]   I think we should all agree.
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:20:59.420]   I disagree.
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:00.420]   You're wrong.
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:01.420]   Yeah.
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:04.820]   I think there are a few things that problems that I have with this, although I think it
[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:05.820]   would be cool.
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:06.820]   I agree with that.
[01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:12.420]   One is that we don't turn over TVs every year or two, which we do with the iOS devices.
[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:13.420]   They're expensive.
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:18.740]   So look at a $1,500 TV and people tend to hang on their TVs for six years or something.
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:19.740]   It's not a good business.
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:20.740]   Not a good business.
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:22.820]   Yeah, it's not a-- I don't think it's a terrific business.
[01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:26.900]   I think it would be great to have that little Apple logo on my television set.
[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:31.340]   But I think that the Apple TV strategies already exists.
[01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:35.980]   And I think people aren't paying attention to it, which is that the Apple TV, as we know
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:38.620]   it now, is really just a portal.
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:43.140]   So you've got-- your controller is this thing and your content is coming from listening
[01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:44.140]   to your own.
[01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:48.020]   Why build a TV at all when you could just make the Apple TV-- the existing Apple TV,
[01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:49.020]   be the thing.
[01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:53.820]   You have to say that Tim Cook was not crazy about the Apple TV and this all things D thing.
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:58.980]   He said, "Yes, sales have doubled, but it's still not--" he implied it was the-- what
[01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:02.020]   do you say, the fist leg of a stool?
[01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:05.420]   There are a few reasons to do a physical TV.
[01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:06.420]   Okay.
[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:08.620]   One of them is that the alternatives to not do a TV.
[01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:14.620]   So if they're profitable, then additional revenue is better than no additional revenue.
[01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:17.020]   Secondly, it screws Samsung.
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:19.940]   Secondly, it's a kind of branding.
[01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:23.940]   People spend hours and hours and hours staring at their TV.
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:31.060]   And if it has an Apple logo on it, that has some unmeasurable benefits for Apple as a
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:32.340]   brand.
[01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:34.500]   And like I said before, they have economies of scale.
[01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:37.340]   They have the relationships with all the manufacturers.
[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:44.740]   I just think it's-- if I were to say, you make a-- let's say you make-- I go to somebody
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:50.860]   who makes $100,000 a year and I say, you make $100,000 a year, so $20 is not much for you.
[01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:54.340]   But would you like $20 or would you like not $20?
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:59.180]   You take the $20-- I just think there's-- I just can't think of a downside for them to
[01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:00.180]   do it.
[01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:01.180]   I don't know.
[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:03.180]   Well, but I have a TV.
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:04.180]   Yeah.
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:05.180]   You know, I've got a big TV.
[01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:06.180]   Yeah.
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:08.860]   So why wouldn't I want to buy a $99 box?
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:09.860]   Or let's say that they're going to build money.
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:11.340]   Well, the mic saying they'll do both.
[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:13.020]   32 gigabytes of storage in it.
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:14.020]   Right.
[01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:15.020]   It could do both.
[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:21.220]   But again, I just think if I can have a 32 gigabyte box for say, $200 that has an app
[01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:23.460]   store connected to it.
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:24.620]   I don't think they'll be any storage.
[01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:25.620]   I don't think they'll do storage.
[01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:27.220]   I think storage is dead.
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:30.420]   I think streaming is what everybody, including the content creators want.
[01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:32.020]   They don't like the idea of storage.
[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:38.060]   Yeah, I like that except the problem I have is that if you-- let's say you want to play
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.580]   a massive game on that thing.
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:42.820]   You have to have an iOS experience.
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:48.700]   So if you have some-- because I mean, they have 8 gigabytes in it now just for buffering.
[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:52.100]   But if you're going to have an app store and I think maybe that could happen, then you
[01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:53.500]   do need some kind of storage in there.
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.540]   But then you need a controller as well.
[01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:56.540]   Yeah.
[01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:59.780]   And that's where I get twisted around because I don't think that Apple wants to try to build
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:00.780]   a controller.
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:01.780]   What they want to do is--
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:02.780]   It's just Kippen.
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:03.780]   --is depend on you own.
[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:04.780]   They don't want to build a--
[01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:05.780]   Yeah.
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:06.780]   --pippen.
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:07.780]   But I have to say this is where Microsoft is going.
[01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:11.580]   I mean, the new Xbox, the way that what they're doing with the Xbox is head-on, dead
[01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:12.580]   set against Apple.
[01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:15.380]   The only negative is it's kind of interesting.
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:19.580]   Won't work-- will only work on Windows, Windows, Phone, and Xbox.
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:22.980]   They don't have it on anything else.
[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:23.980]   So--
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:24.980]   Yeah.
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:25.980]   So-- well, you think they will.
[01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:29.140]   This is funny because when iTunes came out, remember the big battle that Walter Isaac
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:32.220]   said talks about in the biography where Steve said we'll never put this on Windows.
[01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:33.220]   And everybody says, Steve, you're nuts.
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:34.900]   You've got to put this on Windows.
[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:36.140]   And finally Apple did put it on Windows.
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:40.420]   And of course, it's a more iPod just sold to Windows users than our to Mac users.
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:48.260]   And I just think that Apple's Uber strategy not to be this to death, but I think that
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:52.580]   they go after the major content consumption platforms.
[01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:55.420]   Yeah, they'll go after iOS.
[01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:56.420]   They have to.
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:57.420]   And yeah.
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:24:58.420]   But yeah.
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:24:59.420]   So I--
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:01.820]   Actually, they're telling me that in the press conference they did say iOS and Android.
[01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:03.580]   I did not realize that.
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:04.580]   Okay.
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:05.580]   Yeah.
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:11.860]   But I do think both-- I don't think-- it's obviously not going to go the other way.
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:18.740]   When Apple does reverse airplay, it's not going to go to the Windows phone probably.
[01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:27.900]   And so I think that's just an indication of where the market power is.
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:29.820]   This is very exciting times.
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:30.820]   Yes.
[01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:36.380]   So some of the rumors, this is from Boygenius report that Mountain Lion will share many
[01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:41.060]   features with iOS 6 along with I/O message.
[01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:43.860]   They already got that message app that's been beta, which is--
[01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:45.700]   Do you use that Chris Breen?
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:46.700]   It's so crappy.
[01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:47.700]   Yeah, it is crappy.
[01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:48.700]   It's so crappy.
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:51.900]   I stopped using it and I went back to I/Cha.
[01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:55.940]   The only time I use it though is when I'm liking a long text messaging session with somebody
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:57.260]   on the iPhone.
[01:25:57.260 --> 01:26:01.140]   And then I can at least launch it on the desktop and start using a real keyboard.
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:02.140]   So that's one--
[01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:06.860]   Well, that's why I use it because I like to use it on my iPad with the keyboard.
[01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:09.780]   I spend a lot of time with my iPad on the keyboard.
[01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:13.780]   And every single person in my family has an iOS device.
[01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:19.580]   And so it's just a really nice way to chat with a full-sized keyboard.
[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:22.260]   Yeah, but then you get too fast for everybody.
[01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:23.260]   Yeah.
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:25.660]   They're on a phone and you're going off.
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:33.020]   Yeah, they're like, hey, do not disturb feature, which would be kind of cool, especially if
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:35.900]   you get my message and game center on there.
[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:39.980]   How many things are in your notification in the settings?
[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:44.140]   I've got several dozen things that are all popping up notifications.
[01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:45.580]   That do not disturb thing.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:47.420]   It's going to be really handy.
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:49.540]   And if you're going to put notifications on the desktop, which apparently they're going
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:51.340]   to do, you'll want the same thing.
[01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:52.340]   Chris, have you seen it?
[01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:54.300]   Does it slide down from the top?
[01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:56.180]   It slides on the side, right, on the desktop?
[01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:58.180]   Yeah, it comes in from the side.
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:02.100]   So it's much like your phone except you don't have to do this.
[01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:05.460]   It just there's a little blue button up in the corner.
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:08.060]   You click on it or when notifications, it's like growl to you.
[01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:09.060]   It's growl.
[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:12.180]   Yeah, a little pop-up shows up and says, oh, by the way, here's this.
[01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:16.460]   And you can decide whether you want to have that kind of notification or you don't.
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:19.740]   They, BGR also says iCloud tabs support.
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:20.740]   What's that?
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:21.740]   I don't know what that is.
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:22.740]   Unmountainline.
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:27.540]   Oh, tabs, syncing tabs on your browser?
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:28.540]   Is that what they mean?
[01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:30.220]   I don't know what that means.
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:32.180]   Male VIPs.
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:38.180]   It's kind of like Google's Gmail's, you know, priority mailbox.
[01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:39.180]   Yeah.
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:40.180]   I like that.
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:46.500]   It doesn't work for me very well on Google, but it'd be nice if Apple did it right.
[01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:51.340]   Apple's iCloud tabs allows users to sync open Safari browser tabs across Mac and OIO
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:52.340]   iOS devices.
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:55.420]   It's something that's in Chrome, the new Chrome.
[01:27:55.420 --> 01:28:00.020]   Male VIPs will let users designate VIPs to allow select emails to stand out.
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:02.500]   So it is like priority inbox, except it's you doing it by hand.
[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:04.220]   Google tries to do it programmatically.
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:10.220]   You know, again, everything they've been doing in the last couple of years has been leading
[01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:15.140]   toward the idea that there are screens here, screening your pockets, screen over there,
[01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:20.060]   screen on the TV, and whichever screen you walk up to, it's the same thing that you see,
[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:25.260]   the same tabs on your browser, the same email, same everything, same features.
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:26.260]   Yeah.
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:28.260]   You want that, Chris Breen?
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:29.260]   Sure.
[01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:34.740]   You know, I just wanted to work, which is generally what I want from iCloud altogether.
[01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:38.460]   So, you know, that's the main thing I want from Mountain Lion.
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:41.980]   So I want iCloud to work and I want Siri to work and I want all this stuff just to work
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:44.220]   the way it was designed to work.
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:49.140]   The demos are great, but in real use, sometimes you do things with iCloud and you get triple
[01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:50.900]   gets of this, a duplicate of that.
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:53.660]   It just wants to stop stuff.
[01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:55.860]   So they say that's a good marketing.
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:56.860]   Let's see.
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:57.860]   All right.
[01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:01.620]   Let's just go through a couple of quick stories and then we'll get our tips and picks and
[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:04.140]   all of that stuff.
[01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:08.140]   Netflix is now number one in the online movie business, the Throning iTunes for the first
[01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:16.380]   time ever a new report by IHSI Supply said that in 2011, Netflix share of the online
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:20.620]   movie market jumped from 0.5% to 44%.
[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:26.100]   In one year, Apple fell from 60% in 2010 to 32.3%.
[01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:31.500]   So kind of a shift from, and Netflix was just not there and all of a sudden they're
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:33.380]   huge in streaming.
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:34.380]   Number three player.
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:36.740]   That is an interesting when everybody was going to leave Netflix, right?
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:37.740]   Yeah.
[01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:40.340]   The price thing went into and so everybody said, "No, that's it.
[01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:41.340]   I'm quitting Netflix."
[01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:47.020]   And finally, I had a Netflix disk subscription and streaming, which gets kind of expensive.
[01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:50.740]   I finally, because we had five disks, I looked into the TV.
[01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:56.580]   They were all dusty from August of last year and I had never watched.
[01:29:56.580 --> 01:30:01.020]   And I said, "I'm paying like 35 bucks a month for nothing."
[01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:04.260]   So I mailed them all back and I went to streaming only and I know I'm not alone.
[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:07.260]   I think a lot of people, that's what they use Netflix for.
[01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:12.820]   The thing that they don't talk about in this report of enough is that it's a different
[01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:15.860]   customer and this is often the case with Apple.
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:17.260]   It's a better customer.
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:23.100]   And the reason is that Apple offers a lot more newer movies and the quality of those
[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:24.580]   movies are significantly higher.
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:26.020]   But you pay for them.
[01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:27.020]   You pay for them.
[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:28.020]   You pay for them.
[01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:29.020]   Yes.
[01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:32.140]   And so they're going after the people with deep pockets who have more, you know, who have
[01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:33.140]   more...
[01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:40.380]   It's not the people who are watching me run a major pain again.
[01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:41.740]   It's the people who are, you know...
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:43.220]   But the Apple TV gives you both.
[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:44.580]   And so that's what I really like.
[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:50.780]   If I want to watch a late, you know, hot movie that just came out, I can watch that on iTunes
[01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:52.540]   but I can also, I've also got Netflix there.
[01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:58.660]   I just bought Sherlock, you know, the PBS Sherlock series on iTunes because I want to
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:30:59.660]   see that.
[01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:01.580]   It's not on Netflix but the previous year is on Netflix.
[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:02.980]   So, you know, I think it's a good...
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:04.180]   I think it's a one-two punch.
[01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:05.500]   I don't think there's a winner there.
[01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:07.980]   No, it's great for the users to have everything.
[01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:08.980]   But when you...
[01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:10.980]   When this report compares...
[01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:12.460]   Whoa, there's a big job.
[01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:13.460]   Well, there's a big job.
[01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:14.620]   Market share with Apple.
[01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:17.340]   It's kind of like market share in the phone business.
[01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:21.420]   Apple does not have the majority of share in the phone business but it has three quarters
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:23.060]   of the profit or something like that.
[01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:24.060]   It's a different...
[01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:28.940]   They target the sweet spot of the market yet again.
[01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:30.940]   Apple...
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:34.340]   Let's see.
[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:39.060]   So, under...
[01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:43.340]   This is an article that you wrote in March, Chris Breen, understanding the aim of Apple
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:47.340]   TV and this is kind of what you were saying earlier.
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:48.340]   Yeah.
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:51.900]   That it is the TV.
[01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:54.180]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:57.180]   You know, that it's... people are looking at...
[01:31:57.180 --> 01:31:59.580]   Apple has to release a TV and they don't.
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:00.860]   We already have it.
[01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:02.340]   The technology is already there.
[01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:07.140]   And this came up because all things D wrote, probably a story yesterday, basically saying
[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:08.980]   the same thing and people were tweeting about it.
[01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:14.060]   I said that in March because I'm another guy on the Internet who has to say, "I wrote
[01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:15.060]   that or..."
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:16.060]   I wrote that.
[01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:17.060]   Yeah.
[01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:18.860]   But that's what I said on my blog.
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:20.580]   Of course, it's true.
[01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:24.780]   Yeah, so that's the idea, is that the Apple TV is the portal that...
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:29.660]   And I've talked to Apple about it and they won't confirm or deny, but they sort of say,
[01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:34.460]   "Yeah, you put your content on your iPad and you have airplay or with Mountain Lion, you
[01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:38.740]   put your stuff on your Mac and you'll have airplay there if we have complete mirroring
[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:42.300]   and that's how we think you work it."
[01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:44.220]   Although, as you point out...
[01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:48.780]   Right now, you can't do airplay with HBO Go or Hulu.
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:50.180]   Unless you jailbreak.
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:51.180]   And they have...
[01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:53.420]   There's a switch that says, "No mirroring."
[01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:54.420]   Right.
[01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:55.420]   And that's...
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:57.860]   I mean, this is the whole thing about this...
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:02.060]   The Apple, the real Apple TV or the fake one is that there are really two levels of going
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:03.060]   at this.
[01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:06.900]   One is the Apple level and that Apple can completely control the others' content and
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:08.140]   they can't.
[01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:13.580]   And the problem is that these content companies really want to undermine Apple as much as
[01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:17.940]   they can because they desperately want to hang on to their satellite and cable businesses.
[01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:20.180]   So when...
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:23.180]   Let's say Apple were to release a real-life TV and people would turn it on and say,
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:26.460]   "Great, now I can cut the cable because I have access to all this content."
[01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:30.460]   Well, no, you don't because the cable companies won't let you have cut the cable, normal
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:31.460]   the satellite companies.
[01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:33.660]   They want to hold on to that material.
[01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:39.660]   So really, what you're looking at is a device that's going to deliver what internet content
[01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:43.460]   exists like TWIT, for example, and applications.
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:48.260]   But in terms of traditional content, no, that's not going to happen.
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:52.580]   So use the Apple TV for that kind of content and you'll be happy.
[01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:57.020]   But if you clunk down 1,500 bucks on a real TV and find out that you can't cut the cable,
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:59.140]   then more people are going to be disappointed.
[01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:00.980]   I had a couple more quick stories.
[01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:04.220]   One is about a new airline, Skoot.
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:05.220]   Skoot.
[01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:09.340]   Which is, I guess, a budget airline.
[01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:11.260]   I'm not sure where they fly.
[01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:18.220]   But they bought a bunch of planes from Singapore Air that had big entertainment systems on them.
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:22.540]   They took them out, saving, on average, two tons per plane.
[01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:26.060]   And now they'll rent you an iPad on the plane for $17.
[01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:27.060]   Yeah.
[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:31.540]   I think it's a Singaporean airline.
[01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:32.540]   It is brilliant.
[01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:36.700]   I don't see people watching the entertainment systems anymore on any of these planes.
[01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:39.420]   If you have an iPad, you're better off.
[01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:40.420]   They're upgradable.
[01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:41.420]   They're modular.
[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:43.020]   If one breaks, you just swap it out.
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:44.020]   It's cheap.
[01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:46.220]   It's familiar.
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:49.980]   The only reason not to do it is if there's turbulence, everybody's going to get clocked
[01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:51.780]   for one of these iPads.
[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:55.020]   Well, they just tether it to your trade table.
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:56.060]   Yeah, lock it down.
[01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:57.660]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:35:00.940]   We've seen this other airline's handout devices.
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:04.500]   But this is, I mean, and frankly, I wouldn't fly anywhere with that an iPad.
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:05.900]   This is the only way to fly now.
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:06.900]   Yeah.
[01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:09.380]   Well, I think we're going to end up in the same situation where people,
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:13.380]   it used to be the airlines would rent you headsets or headphones, you know?
[01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:14.380]   Yes.
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:15.380]   Why?
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:16.380]   Because we all have them now.
[01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:17.380]   Right.
[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:18.860]   So look five years down the line and pretty soon, you know, it's like, well, they're not
[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:22.140]   going to be showing movies on the plane anymore because why?
[01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:23.980]   We've all got some device to do that.
[01:35:23.980 --> 01:35:24.980]   We don't need that.
[01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:25.980]   And it saves a lot of fuel.
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:29.820]   One of the reasons you want to take two tons out of that plane is it saves you a huge
[01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:30.820]   amount.
[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:33.220]   Fuel is like 40 or 50% of the cost of the flight.
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:37.380]   As the obesity crisis grows, you find ways to lighten up the load.
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:40.780]   It's a lot easier to be a budget airline in Singapore than it is in the US.
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:43.100]   I can tell you that right now.
[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:45.660]   Aaron Sork and I won't say no more.
[01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:51.140]   Aaron Sork and also at All Things D talked with Walt Mossberg said he's working on the
[01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:54.300]   Steve Jobs movie based on the Isaacson biography.
[01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:58.260]   He says it's going to be a painting, not a photograph.
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:00.500]   Oh, that sounds bad.
[01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:06.820]   The problem is unlike the social network where only a few nerds really knew the story
[01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:10.180]   of Facebook, everybody knows the Steve Jobs story kind of intimately.
[01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:17.820]   You can't bend the rules as much as he did in the Facebook movie.
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:19.660]   He says I can't judge the character.
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:21.780]   For me, it has to be a hero.
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:23.420]   I have to defend the character.
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:26.300]   You want to write the character like they're making the case to God why they should go
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:27.300]   to heaven.
[01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:31.660]   So I guess we get some idea of how he's going to treat Steve Jobs.
[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:33.460]   Unique idiosyncrasies.
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:34.460]   Yeah.
[01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:42.180]   And it sounds like it sounds like, and I like to see it focus on the wilderness years.
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:49.300]   The whole gut wrenching experience of being drummed out of the company, trying to launch
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:54.180]   these from happening and then coming back and it was really that whole experience was
[01:36:54.180 --> 01:37:02.420]   really the thing that made Steve Jobs the person who was able to give us the apple that we
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:03.420]   have today.
[01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:08.180]   It was really a new Steve Jobs who really understood how to do things.
[01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:18.260]   He was a loose cannon volatile kid before then who was just out of control.
[01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:22.980]   And then when he came back, this was a masterful CEO.
[01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:23.980]   I like that.
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:27.500]   I mean, there's drama and every bit of Steve Jobs career.
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:28.500]   There's all sorts of exciting drama.
[01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:31.580]   I mean, the young years were with Woz and he's a hacker.
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:36.580]   But I do think you're absolutely right that if you start with him being fired, maybe you
[01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:40.740]   start with him hiring Scully and then being fired and then you go through the wilderness
[01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:45.820]   years and then the triumphant return, that's a nice arc.
[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:50.140]   And I think that that, you know, he says, "I'm probably going to, he's not going to do
[01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:51.380]   a cradle to grave narrative.
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:54.940]   I'm probably going to instead identify the point of friction that appeals to me and write
[01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:56.700]   about that."
[01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:58.460]   I think that that you might be right.
[01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:00.500]   That would be a great movie.
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:04.500]   And this is by the way for those not following this too closely.
[01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:06.900]   This is not the Aston Kutcher version.
[01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:07.900]   That's a good one.
[01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:08.900]   And that's a different one.
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:13.780]   And the fact that they hired Aston Kutcher indicates that they're going to focus, that
[01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:17.900]   one is going to focus on the younger Steve Jobs because he, Kutcher doesn't look anything
[01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:21.140]   like the, you know, 50 plus year old Steve Jobs.
[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:27.540]   He looks like the 20, 7 year old photographer, Henry Hartgreeves, deep fat fried apple gadgets
[01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:29.260]   and my, they look tasty.
[01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:33.660]   There's a deep fat fried iPhone, deep fat fried.
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:34.660]   Look here.
[01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:35.660]   An iPod.
[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:41.140]   More proof that deep fried anything is not good for you.
[01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:43.420]   Are those screens powered?
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:44.780]   They seem to have icons and things.
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:48.660]   I don't see how they could possibly be powered, but they do look that way.
[01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:51.700]   This MacBook does not look like it's in good shape.
[01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:52.700]   No.
[01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:53.700]   Wow.
[01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:59.100]   They're funny, I guess, in a painful sort of way.
[01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:01.900]   Well, they couldn't find that blender big enough for the MacBook.
[01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:03.700]   So I guess they figured it out for that.
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:04.700]   I never liked it.
[01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:07.780]   It's an indication of the iconic nature of apple devices though.
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:13.820]   If you did this with a Samsung Galaxy, something or other, you know, they wouldn't have gotten
[01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:14.820]   any press attention.
[01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:18.620]   Did you love Harry McCracken's review of the Newton?
[01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:20.700]   That was awesome.
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:27.500]   In the technologizer blog techland.com, he decided, hey, it's, the Newton is 20 years
[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:28.820]   old.
[01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:36.500]   This would be a good time to go back and review it as if it were brand new.
[01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:38.140]   This is one of those things when I read it.
[01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:40.820]   It just pisses me off because I should have done it.
[01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:41.980]   What a brilliant idea.
[01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:43.540]   Well, we were all there.
[01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:49.020]   You know, I mean, 20 years ago, we were in this business.
[01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:54.900]   To me, the most, the starkest fact that he uncovered was the horrid quality of the screen.
[01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:56.380]   The screen's terrible.
[01:39:56.380 --> 01:39:59.940]   One of the things that screens are kind of a funny thing and Apple clearly knows this.
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:06.020]   When I upgraded from the iPad to to the iPad, I thought, well, that's a better screen.
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:07.820]   I really like the screen.
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:14.980]   It's a fairly gentle to go to a better screen is a fairly gentle process to go back to an
[01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:20.300]   older screen is traumatic and unacceptable and to go that far back to that much older
[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:21.380]   of a screen.
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:27.300]   He said it was just a darkish green, urban lightish green.
[01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:28.300]   There's no contrast.
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:29.300]   Yeah.
[01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:30.300]   Yeah.
[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:34.540]   And the thing that he pointed out was nobody really complained about the screen back then.
[01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:36.380]   Well, that was good.
[01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:39.060]   You know, and people were really focused on the thing that was unique.
[01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:40.060]   It was handwriting.
[01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:43.940]   It recognized handwriting, sort of.
[01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:45.020]   It was somewhat smart.
[01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:49.620]   You could make an appointment, something like write lunch with Mike and it would kind of
[01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:50.620]   know.
[01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:52.500]   There were some cool things about that.
[01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:56.300]   Chris, you were covering Apple back in 1992, weren't you?
[01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:57.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:57.300 --> 01:40:58.300]   And I have.
[01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:02.060]   I still have my Newton 2100 and I fired it up the other day just to.
[01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:03.660]   You know, it's nice to use this regular battery.
[01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:06.420]   So you just put regular batteries in and it launches mine too.
[01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:10.700]   Yeah, I haven't touched a thing in 10 years and I just throw some new batteries and it
[01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:12.620]   went, oh my God, it still works.
[01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:13.620]   Yeah.
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:14.620]   But you're right.
[01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:16.300]   You go back to it and kind of go look at the connectors.
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:19.180]   I mean, you had to have all these to put a modem in it.
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:21.220]   You had to have a PC card modem.
[01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:23.820]   Little things like that.
[01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:26.380]   And I think, remember, this is not a Steve Jobs product.
[01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:28.260]   This is a John Scully product.
[01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:29.260]   Yeah.
[01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:33.820]   It was the victim of a kind of a witch hunt though in the press and by Gary Trudeau.
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:34.820]   Yeah, I remember that.
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:35.820]   You remember that?
[01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:36.820]   Yeah.
[01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:40.740]   Who just, you know, there was a vicious campaign against the handwriting recognition and a
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:46.060]   lot of mockery and it sort of went down in history as a laughable product because of
[01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:47.060]   that.
[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:52.820]   And a year or two, I don't know how very shortly thereafter the Palm pilot came out that used
[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:59.420]   the same graffiti technology and it was a little better because it was a little newer,
[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:00.420]   I think.
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:06.060]   Actually, the pilot, my memory is that Jeff Hawkins looked at the Newton and said, here's
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:07.780]   the problem with the Newton.
[01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:10.900]   They did sell them the, I believe they sold them the handwriting recognition.
[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:13.300]   It's trying to use a normal alphabet, right?
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:18.740]   And the thing about graffiti was you had to modify a few letters instead of using a normal
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:21.060]   alphabet and it was like 100% more accurate.
[01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:22.460]   Isn't that right?
[01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:23.460]   Yeah.
[01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:27.620]   Yeah, because the Newton was too fiddly in terms of the handwriting recognition.
[01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:28.620]   Sometimes it works sometimes.
[01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:31.100]   It wouldn't have got better with different software releases.
[01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:34.580]   But, you know, the Palm folks looked at it and went, oh, we could do better.
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:36.060]   But just simplify this.
[01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:37.060]   And they did.
[01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:38.060]   And they killed.
[01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:40.260]   I mean, they totally killed for a number of years.
[01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:43.700]   Jeff's book on on intelligence, he talks, I think as I remember he talks about it and
[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:49.940]   said, I had the insight that you didn't, you couldn't make the computer come to you.
[01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:52.260]   You had to, you couldn't go to the computer.
[01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:53.380]   You had to make the computer come to you.
[01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:57.220]   You had to make the alphabet easier instead of trying to get the computer to understand
[01:42:57.220 --> 01:42:58.220]   how you could write.
[01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:02.620]   And even today, pure handwriting recognition is not very easy to do.
[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:06.700]   Graffiti was much more accurate.
[01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:11.780]   Apple has denied its ban on the Samsung Galaxy tab sales, but it's on technicality.
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:16.620]   The judges sent it back to a federal court where it's possible it still could.
[01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:19.780]   But this was a little blow against Apple in their attempt to keep Samsung out of the
[01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:22.900]   US.
[01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:25.100]   I think that's it for the main stories.
[01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:26.220]   I'm so glad you guys are here.
[01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:27.500]   I really appreciate it.
[01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:29.020]   Let's get to our picks of the week.
[01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:31.580]   I don't know if Chris, if you had, oh, yeah, Chris, we've got one.
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:33.940]   I don't know if Mike, if you had time to do a pick of the week.
[01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:34.940]   I do.
[01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:35.940]   All right.
[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:39.260]   And then we'll get to you and I'll wrap her up.
[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:41.180]   Okay.
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:44.500]   I have recently jailbroken my iPad three.
[01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:45.500]   Really?
[01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:48.860]   There's now a yes, there's a jailbreak out for it called absence.
[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:56.220]   And then snow, snow breeze has also been updated so that you can now jailbreak your devices
[01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:57.980]   with an A5 chip in them.
[01:43:57.980 --> 01:44:04.900]   And so I often want to capture the screen for motion video on my devices.
[01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:07.140]   And so there are some jailbreak apps that will do that.
[01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:09.460]   One of them is called display recorder.
[01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:13.760]   And I don't know if you guys got the copy of the video I sent, but I put one in a drop
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:14.760]   box some more.
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:17.820]   Oh, I'll get Chad to look for that.
[01:44:17.820 --> 01:44:20.460]   Yeah, that's what the interface looks like.
[01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:22.540]   It's in the show notes thing.
[01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:23.540]   Okay.
[01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:24.700]   And it's $5.
[01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:27.820]   So you have to get it through the studio store.
[01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:32.860]   And what it will do is you just hold down your sleep button for about a second.
[01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:36.500]   And then I'll pop a little dialog box and it says, would you like to start recording?
[01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:37.500]   Yes.
[01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:42.700]   And then it will record anything that you're doing on your iOS device at the time.
[01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:43.700]   That's you can.
[01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:49.300]   And also it will also put a little dot wherever you tap.
[01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:52.860]   And so a lot of times when you're presenting and using something like an airplane to do
[01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:54.580]   this, you can't see where you're tapping.
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:55.580]   Where's the finger?
[01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:56.580]   To tell the audience.
[01:44:56.580 --> 01:44:57.580]   Yeah, here's his video.
[01:44:57.580 --> 01:44:58.580]   Here's here.
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:44:59.580]   Okay.
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:00.580]   Yeah.
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:01.580]   Here's the video.
[01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:02.580]   So you recorded this directly.
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:03.580]   That's really great.
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:07.500]   It's one of the things we tried to decide with the iPad today.
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:11.020]   Should we just show because we could take HDMI out, but it's weird because you can't
[01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:12.020]   see where the finger is.
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:15.980]   So we just we actually shoot the screen for that reason.
[01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:16.980]   This is nice.
[01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:17.980]   I like this.
[01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:18.980]   Yeah.
[01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:24.180]   So again, you have to jailbreak to do it, but it's just $5.
[01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:28.700]   And then it will store the video on your device and you can set it up to Facebook if
[01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:30.980]   you're to YouTube if you want to.
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:36.900]   You can also send it to the camera roll or you can turn on a little server button and
[01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:38.140]   it will give you an address.
[01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:41.980]   You go in with a web browser on your computer, get into it on the same network and then you
[01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:46.740]   can download the videos directly to your Mac and then and then send them out anyway.
[01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:49.500]   You're like, very nice, very cool.
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:54.100]   By the way, it's by a guy named Ryan Patrick.
[01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:58.180]   So Joe, another tool called display out.
[01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:01.180]   So jailbreak using absence.
[01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:03.140]   Is that what you used?
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:06.140]   Is that your favorite?
[01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:07.620]   It was the first one to come out.
[01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:12.260]   And so because whenever a new exploit comes out and I can jailbreak, I do, because I
[01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:14.620]   use this exactly this technology for that.
[01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:15.780]   So that's what I use.
[01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:20.660]   But now the other ones, other tools have been updated so you can jailbreak the current version
[01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:21.660]   of the OS.
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:22.660]   You don't have to downgrade.
[01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:23.980]   You can use 511.
[01:46:23.980 --> 01:46:28.140]   Of course, you know, if six comes out next week, then.
[01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:29.140]   You'll have to wait for another.
[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:32.940]   Do you think it'll come out next week or will it be when the iPhone 5 comes out in the fall?
[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:34.780]   It'll be in the fall, right?
[01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:35.780]   I think it's later.
[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:36.780]   Yeah.
[01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:39.020]   I think that they have to preview this for developers because, you know, developers haven't seen
[01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:40.220]   this at all.
[01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:42.580]   So they need time to get things ready for.
[01:46:42.580 --> 01:46:45.740]   And September also for Mountain Lion or wait a minute.
[01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:48.340]   No, they said it'd be this summer, didn't they?
[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:51.260]   Yeah, well, summer technically goes until September 22nd.
[01:46:51.260 --> 01:46:55.220]   But it could be or could it be next week, Mountain Lion?
[01:46:55.220 --> 01:47:02.100]   Yeah, I don't think there's been enough activity on the developer site for that to be.
[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:06.220]   So we should be seeing a lot of stuff, even GM by now and none of that's happened.
[01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:07.980]   So I think they're at least a month out.
[01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:08.980]   Good point.
[01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:14.940]   But if they ask new Macs and they said shipping June 21st or shipping August 1st or whatever
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:18.420]   with Mountain Lion, that would make sense.
[01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:19.420]   Sure.
[01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:21.660]   Mike Elgin, your pick of the week.
[01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:22.660]   Yes.
[01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:24.820]   My pick of the week is surprising.
[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:29.700]   I hope because it's something everybody has heard about for a long time.
[01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:33.580]   It's the Apple Bluetooth mobile keyboard.
[01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:39.420]   However, my pick is the use of this keyboard as a mobile device.
[01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:43.860]   I recommend that I've been doing this for some time and it's just been the most fantastic
[01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:44.860]   thing ever.
[01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:49.860]   I use my keyboard with my iPad incessantly and I also use it with my iPhone, which I rarely
[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:51.500]   see anybody doing.
[01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:56.820]   But the usage model, I would recommend a water field keyboard slip.
[01:47:56.820 --> 01:48:00.820]   This is a little case, a little $30 case for the keyboard.
[01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:04.900]   Fits right in there, which protects the keyboard and makes it more, you can toss it around,
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:06.300]   stuff like this.
[01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:10.500]   I just kind of leave the keyboard in my car or in my backpack.
[01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:15.380]   And whenever I want to, if I've got a couple of minutes and I'm sitting around and I just
[01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:18.700]   got my phone, I grab the keyboard and blog something from the phone.
[01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:20.780]   And it's just fantastic to always have a keyboard.
[01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:24.340]   I also happen to think that this Bluetooth keyboard is the very best keyboard I've ever
[01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:25.820]   used.
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:31.100]   I like it better for reasons I don't quite understand than the wired keyboard that Apple
[01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:32.460]   offers.
[01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:37.300]   And I like it better than the keyboard's built into the MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air.
[01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:43.060]   It's just a great, great keyboard and I bring it with me everywhere and I think everybody
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:44.060]   should try doing that.
[01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:46.460]   It's just a wonderful thing to have with you all the time.
[01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:50.540]   You have you tried the Logitech Ultra Thin keyboard yet?
[01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:51.540]   I have not.
[01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:52.540]   I've heard about it.
[01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:53.540]   It's kind of cool.
[01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:57.260]   I mean, this is, first of all, it uses the smart magnets.
[01:48:57.260 --> 01:48:59.140]   So it's a smart cover.
[01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:04.300]   And then when you open the iPad, the magnets goes into the slot on the keyboard.
[01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:06.260]   So it's a stand as well.
[01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:10.620]   And I have the Bluetooth keyboard from Apple.
[01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:11.620]   It's comparable.
[01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:14.020]   It does have which is nice iOS keys.
[01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:17.100]   Like there's cut, I don't even know iOS could do cut copy and paste.
[01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:18.900]   Well, it can with these keys.
[01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:20.100]   There's a home key.
[01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:21.900]   There's a search key, which is kind of cool.
[01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:23.300]   It'll go to the search.
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:26.980]   It has some nice features, volume keys.
[01:49:26.980 --> 01:49:29.980]   The iOS also do command the command C and all that stuff.
[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:30.980]   Okay.
[01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:33.380]   So that's obviously it's built in iOS or it wouldn't work.
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:34.380]   Yeah.
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:40.020]   But in general, I strongly recommend that people not be locked in the idea that the iPhone
[01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:42.060]   and iPad don't have physical keyboards.
[01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:46.820]   They can just buy one and use it and it's great.
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:47.820]   Interesting.
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:50.380]   All right, my, I got two picks.
[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:51.380]   First from Encyclopedia.
[01:49:51.380 --> 01:49:53.060]   Huh, a tip.
[01:49:53.060 --> 01:49:58.540]   This is an iOS or a Mac OS 10 lion tip.
[01:49:58.540 --> 01:50:02.660]   We were complaining earlier about the fact that the library folder wasn't visible.
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:06.020]   Very simple terminal command using CH flags.
[01:50:06.020 --> 01:50:07.420]   Thank you, Encyclopedia.
[01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:10.740]   CH flags, no hidden.
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:16.220]   Tilda slash library slash unhides the library folder.
[01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:18.340]   That's nice.
[01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:23.780]   So now I, let me see if my library folder, when I open Finder, do I see and I go to my
[01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:30.860]   home, let's see if I see my library in there.
[01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:31.860]   No.
[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:33.700]   Oh, there it is.
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:35.100]   Look at that.
[01:50:35.100 --> 01:50:36.100]   Hallelujah.
[01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:37.100]   All right.
[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:38.100]   So thank you, Encyclopedia.
[01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:39.100]   But my pick is not that.
[01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:46.020]   It's actually an iOS app that just came out that I found out about from Laughing Squid called
[01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:47.020]   Stila.
[01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:48.700]   Have you seen this guys yet?
[01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:54.220]   STI, L.L.A. it is a 3D photography app.
[01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:56.060]   So I'll launch the camera.
[01:50:56.060 --> 01:51:01.540]   And what you do is you take pictures, you take a series of pictures, it uses the gyroscope
[01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:02.540]   in the camera.
[01:51:02.540 --> 01:51:04.260]   It's kind of pretty nice user interface.
[01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:11.020]   And if I go back and I can show you, I've recently done some pictures of my microphone.
[01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:17.500]   And it turns it into a kind of a 3D microphone picture thing.
[01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:20.900]   Wow, it's like being on acid.
[01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:23.740]   It's got a, now I have to try it with taking more images.
[01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:27.580]   It might be the more images you take the less because you have this weird transition
[01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:29.340]   effect in between the images.
[01:51:29.340 --> 01:51:30.420]   But what a great way.
[01:51:30.420 --> 01:51:36.620]   And by the way, you can then post it to the Stila site and link from there to here.
[01:51:36.620 --> 01:51:37.720]   I'll put up.
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:45.080]   This is the Stila site, STI, L.L.A. and then when you link it, say on a Facebook, it does
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:47.120]   use WebGL.
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:50.860]   So you have to have, you can zoom and move and all that stuff.
[01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:52.560]   It's not very good as a fact.
[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:55.000]   I do feel like I'm going to ask it right now.
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:00.560]   But an interesting app, I think perhaps I could perfect the 3D image a little bit.
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:01.560]   That's cool.
[01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:02.560]   But isn't that kind of neat?
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:09.840]   If you had a product shot that you wanted to do, so you know, like when my Galaxy S3
[01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:12.120]   comes, I'll do this.
[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:15.520]   Something you can't do on a Galaxy S3, I'll take 3D images.
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:17.200]   You know, only took like five or six images.
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:20.560]   I bet you if you took more, you could get a more refined 3D shot.
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:25.480]   Yeah, and if you had it on a little tripod or something, always at exactly the same height
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:26.480]   or something.
[01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:30.920]   You don't need to because it's using the accelerometer, the gyroscope to position it.
[01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:32.520]   So they say you don't need to.
[01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:36.320]   If you look at that, is that wild?
[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:37.320]   So this is a new kind of--
[01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:38.320]   It's very nice.
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:39.320]   Yeah.
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:42.840]   It's a $1.99 on the iPhone App Store.
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:46.120]   It is called Stilla, STILA.
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:51.080]   You get a free account with a Stilla website where you can post your Stillas because obviously
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:53.000]   you need something special to play them back.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.760]   WebGL, it takes a few steps to turn on WebGL.
[01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:58.120]   I didn't even know you could insofar.
[01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:02.560]   Sorry, you have to turn on the developer menu and then enable WebGL.
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:05.560]   But you can do that in Safari or use Chrome.
[01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:08.680]   They say it's easier to just use Chrome.
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:09.840]   So that's my pick of the way.
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:11.240]   Hey, it's so nice to have you guys.
[01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:12.240]   Thank you.
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:13.240]   Thank you.
[01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:14.480]   Thank you for being here.
[01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:17.880]   Mike Elgin is at Elgin, E-L-G-A-N.com.
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:21.800]   He also writes for so many people, including the Cult of Mac blog.
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:28.100]   And his regular posts on Google+ have kept that site alive for me anyway.
[01:53:28.100 --> 01:53:30.100]   And it has kept me alive.
[01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:32.000]   We've sustained, we complete each other.
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:33.000]   We complete each other.
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.320]   Google+, you complete me.
[01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:42.000]   You can find the Mac Daddy, Mac Chris McBreen, on Macworld.com.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.480]   He writes the Mac 9-1-1 column and is a wonderful musician.
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:48.000]   You got any gigs coming up?
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.160]   You want a plug?
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:57.640]   If you happen to be in the San Francisco Bay Area in Belmont, I think.
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:54:01.980]   He'll be standing on the street corner going.
[01:54:01.980 --> 01:54:04.480]   Yes, he'll be doing all my favorites.
[01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:06.460]   Laurie Anderson thing.
[01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:08.780]   Oh, Christmas tree.
[01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:11.420]   And he's doing it.
[01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:12.420]   20.
[01:54:12.420 --> 01:54:13.420]   I surprised him.
[01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:14.420]   Yeah.
[01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:16.380]   We're going to be at the downtown Belmont.
[01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:24.260]   My band system 9 is going to be playing at the 1-4 at their Music in the Park series.
[01:54:24.260 --> 01:54:28.460]   So come on down, it's an R&B band and we're good.
[01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:29.460]   I love that.
[01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:30.460]   I love that.
[01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:34.500]   Even your band has a Mac reference system 9.
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:35.500]   But they don't.
[01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:38.620]   The thing is that we came up with this name long before.
[01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:39.620]   You're kidding.
[01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:40.620]   So this band's been around.
[01:54:40.620 --> 01:54:43.820]   No, I came up with a name in 1981.
[01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:45.660]   Well it was OS 9.
[01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:47.700]   You should have been system 7.
[01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:48.700]   Then.
[01:54:48.700 --> 01:54:52.500]   Yeah, that's why they had to change the whole naming protocols because I was going to sue
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:53.500]   the way you trademarked.
[01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:54.940]   We can't be system 9.
[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:55.940]   It's your fault.
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:58.940]   You can't be anyone.
[01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:00.740]   Coming up, we've got some program notes.
[01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:07.020]   We've got a great Twit photo coming up with our good friend Bert Monroy is here.
[01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:11.660]   Bert, of course, is the Photoshop artist who did the amazing, you know, Times Square,
[01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:15.580]   practically a life-size Photoshop painting of Times Square.
[01:55:15.580 --> 01:55:19.220]   He's going to be here for a Twit photo in just a few minutes.
[01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:22.060]   We are going to do special coverage next week.
[01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:23.060]   Our show will be a day early.
[01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:24.380]   It'll be on June 11th.
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:29.260]   We start our special coverage of WWDC with the keynote, roughly 10 a.m.
[01:55:29.260 --> 01:55:30.300]   Pacific 1 p.m.
[01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:35.060]   Eastern time and then continue on with Mac Break Weekly shortly thereafter.
[01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:40.140]   So please tune in on Monday, not Tuesday for Mac Break Weekly next week starting a little
[01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:41.100]   bit early at 10 a.m.
[01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:42.100]   Pacific 1 p.m.
[01:55:42.100 --> 01:55:44.940]   Eastern 1700 UTC on Twit.tv.
[01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:50.700]   In fact, this show normally is Tuesday 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time 1800 UTC.
[01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:52.860]   But you don't have to watch live on Tuesdays.
[01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:59.540]   You can watch any time by just downloading the audio or video for your very own self.
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:00.780]   Some day we'll have a button.
[01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:02.700]   You just play it on everything.
[01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:05.540]   We make it as easy as possible anyway.
[01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:07.020]   What there was some other program.
[01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:08.260]   Oh, one other program note.
[01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:10.140]   Yeah, iPad today.
[01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:13.940]   Sarah's going to London for a little web and then going to spend some time in the south
[01:56:13.940 --> 01:56:15.580]   of France, lucky girl.
[01:56:15.580 --> 01:56:18.500]   So we're doing some extra iPads today.
[01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:19.980]   Of course, our usual time is Thursday.
[01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:24.700]   We will be on Thursday, but we're also going to be on this afternoon, Tuesday 4 p.m. Pacific,
[01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:30.500]   7 p.m. Eastern time 2300 UTC for a special edition of iPad today this afternoon.
[01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:32.500]   So tune in for that.
[01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:33.500]   Thank you, Chris Breen.
[01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:34.500]   Thank you, Mike Elgin.
[01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:35.500]   Thank you for joining now.
[01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:36.500]   Get back to work.
[01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:37.500]   Break time is over.
[01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:37.500]   [music]
[01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:40.100]   (upbeat music)
[01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:42.680]   (upbeat music)
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:45.260]   (upbeat music)
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:47.840]   (upbeat music)
