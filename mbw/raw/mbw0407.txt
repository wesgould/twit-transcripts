[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   The Apple World, such a big, brave new world.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Here with us to talk about it. Andy Ennato, he of the hat and sideburns.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   This time the hat's from Colorado University Boulder. He's got an Apple II. Look at that behind him.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Hey, Andy.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Hey, good to see you.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I think it was a mistake to remove the cassette port from Apple desktop computers.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I mean, I understand that it gets in the way from mobile, but you like to have that expandability.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   When I had my Apple II, I was very disappointed in the fact that I could not get all the lyrics
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   and music from the police if I just played the tape into the computer.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   That, my friends, is Alex Lindsay. You can reach him at pixelcourt.com for further questioning.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Sorry.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   And also here, Mr. Renee Richie from iMore.com.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   It's a solidarity with you, Leo. Look at his roots.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   He's running his beats. There we go. Now you won't look so lonely.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Do those look good? Do you think those beats?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Do you think that makes you look like you're with it in a hip?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   It doesn't matter how I look, Leo. It matters how people think I look.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   My actual, my real question on this is, did you just buy those?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   We got them for some photography that we were doing because we don't, we like having nice-looking pictures
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   and we had the same beats picture over and over again.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   So I bought a pair. It's like a take a bunch of different.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   How much did you pay for this fabulous beats headphones?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   An embarrassing amount, Leo.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   A destructive to my soul amount.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And do they sound really good?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I have not plugged the menu.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   So you are the ultimate beats user. You're just buying them for the look.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I'm just going to walk around with the cordless like this.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I think it looks very futuristic.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   You know, it's so funny to watch the gyrations everybody goes through trying to explain why Apple bought beats.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   The latest, of course, is Bono.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Bono said it.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Bono said it. Apple bought speeds for the personnel, for the people.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Of course, I'm sure Bono's friends with Dre and Iovine.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   So could be.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   He wants to get purchased by Samsung.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   I think, I think, I think an acquisition of three point, an acquisition of two people for 3.2 billion is,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   it's a lot of money.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   I know, I'm not sold on it.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Oh, that was fine.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   It was fine.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I'm telling you.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   We'll buy your company for a hundred million dollars and then we'll pay you with 3.1.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   A billion is not what it used to be. That's the truth.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   It's an Apple billion.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   It's an Apple billion or a Google billion or a Facebook billion.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   It's just not what it used to be.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Times did it.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   What are they going to do by Skybox instead?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I mean, come on.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   You got all this money lying around on the floor.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   You got to do something with it.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Buy new ones.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   You can make that.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   That's a scary thing.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   So that's the current rumor that nuance is up on the market and have gone to hat and hand both companies at licensed nuance technology, Samsung and Apple.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Apple does not, now correct me if I'm wrong, does not do the voice recognition itself.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   The rumor is not current.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   We don't know.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   The rumor as Apple, of course, has their own team.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   It does a lot of work on these kinds of things.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   It turns out they have the money to just have teams just doing, you know, guys thinking stuff up and guys backing them up.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And so I think that the concern for nuance may be that you might want to sell while it's high before a lot of other people write a lot of other software.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So here's a deal with nuance.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Pardon me.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   I mean, these guys have been an action.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   The founder of nuance is now working at Google, but that's another story.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   But I mean, these guys, I don't mean the founders, but these nuances been around.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   It's not like they came.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   They're not like a dot com.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   No, I was making to differ.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   I was using Dragon software.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   They bought Dragon.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Oh, do they buy Dragon?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   They bought a learnout.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   They bought all the actual Microsoft Butler.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   But they bought all.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   So here's the deal with nuance.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   They had a fairly crappy voice.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Correct me.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Andy's got the memory for this, I think, because he's a historian in the bunch.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   But they had a fairly cr-- and they're in Boston.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   They had a fairly crappy voice recognition engine, but nuance ended up becoming a holding company, acquiring all of the companies in the space.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   By the way, also all the scanning companies in the space.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Also suing them into the point where they could acquire them.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Is that right, Andy?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Is that roughly my memory?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Pretty much.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   I mean, at the time when there are at least two competing Mac speech products and they were both bought, I think, by nuance.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And they actually kept their brands open for many, many years.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   I haven't checked recently, but yeah.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   It was almost like the end of the Godfather where instead of shotgunning every other speech company, they just simply shotgun them with money and that seemed to do the trick.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And furthermore, the guy who-- because nuance's own voice did have their own voice recognition system.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I'm looking at nuance's article, the article.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   It was founded as visionier.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Yep.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   In 1992.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And the guy who did their original voice recognition, I believe, is now working at Google.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   So let's look at the history of this.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Which is how the Google got around all the patent stuff that's spent everyone else from doing things.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   That's right.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   So, oh boy, is it complicated?
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   The name nuance, the original nuance was actually, I think, a good company.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   And that guy has left.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Skansoft bought them in 2005.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   But where did Skansoft come?
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   That's the Kurzweil voice recognition engine.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Ray Kurzweil developed it.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   He sold that in 1980 to Xerox, which became Xerox imaging systems, which became Skansoft.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   In 1992, a company called Visionier-- remember the Visionier Scanner?
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Yep.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Right.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   The paper port?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Right.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   It actually was pretty cool stuff.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.480]   They sold the hardware division to Primax in '99, acquired Skansoft in 2001 from Xerox.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.000]   They formed a company called Skansoft.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.520]   So confusing.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:41.440]   And then they acquired nuance in 2005, taking the nuance name.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.640]   So the company nuance is only relatively recently nuanced.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.120]   It was originally kind of, I guess, a vision.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.880]   I think what I was always connected to was Dragon.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.880]   And Dragon is something that I got in 1998.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.160]   And that was from a different company in '98, yes.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.040]   So they acquired that technology, all the OCR companies.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.400]   They bought Vylingo a couple years ago.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.400]   That's right.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.600]   So really, they combined everything into one big blob.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.880]   And at least early on, Siri was licensed from nuance.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.200]   It even said so, I think.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.200]   Yes.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.840]   I don't think they said so, but it was.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.840]   Okay.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.840]   Is it still?
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.280]   Well, I believe there was still nuance.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.960]   At least there was of last year, there was still nuance on Apple servers.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.760]   But like Alex said, they have their own speech lab in Boston.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.280]   And it's been profiled a couple times.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.960]   And they're doing a lot of their own work there.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.160]   And they still have the Siri team there.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.760]   I don't-- originally, it was said that nuance didn't want to sell, that they had basically
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.720]   poisoned pills and affected stop people from buying them.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.080]   They were much more interested in licensing their technology.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.920]   But now you have Carl Icahn as one of the principal shareholders of nuance.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.920]   It's got 15%.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.920]   It's also a result with Apple.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.360]   It's a two-year stock price of nuance.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.440]   It's not good.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.200]   It's been kind of going down.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.280]   And that's, I think, an indicator.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.640]   It's off Google in their space now.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.960]   It's an indicator that the stock market at least didn't have much confidence in the future
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.200]   of nuance, even with the Siri deal.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.560]   Samsung uses nuance as well in its own Samsung speech.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.840]   Remember that Samsung-- this is one of the reasons I don't like Samsung phones.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.000]   When you get a Google phone, you have Google's voice recognition.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.120]   But Samsung overrides that with their own speech recognition.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.880]   It's darn hard to turn that off.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.880]   S voice.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.880]   S voice.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.880]   I hate it.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.120]   Truthfully, the Google voice recognition is, I think, the best in the space followed
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.360]   closely by Siri.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:30.480]   So apparently, nuance is looking to unload for $6.1 billion.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.760]   I bet you its pressure from Carl Icahn.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:40.680]   Also, awareness that at this point, it's hard for a company like that to keep up with the
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.840]   firepower of Apple and Google and their ability to improve their own products and fight the
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:50.120]   patent wars such that they might at some point have a company that's worth about $100,000.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.800]   If they will set it out, they may as well just sell it this point and cash out.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.080]   Certainly if Apple paid $3.2 or $3 now, I guess, for Beats, they could pay $6 for new
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.080]   ones.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.840]   Because they felt like they needed it.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.840]   That's the question.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.960]   It's how far along Apple's own efforts are.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:11.400]   Because that also affects it because obviously, Samsung has to continue to be competitive
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.400]   as well.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.640]   So you can see why they'd want to buy it in Apple.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.960]   I think if Apple feels like they're really dependent on nuance, they'd probably get into
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.840]   a bidding war with Samsung.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.080]   So I think we'll find out.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:29.240]   So according to the Forbes article, customers include besides Apple, Samsung, HTC, LG, Nintendo,
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:35.800]   Panasonic, Intel, Audi, BMW, Ford, GM, and Toyota.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.320]   They made sure they were the only option outside of Google.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:44.200]   And in response to that, I think both Apple, Google, and actually include Microsoft in
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.680]   this, worked, started working very hard, I think, on their own speech recognition technology.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.600]   Google has not bought Tell Me.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.480]   Microsoft bought Tell Me, but they also have done their own stuff.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.760]   Xbox One is not Tell Me, I don't think.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.520]   I think it's its own internal stuff.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.400]   That's a smart play, right?
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.760]   Like you exist in the slack of the market until these giant companies can replicate and maybe
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.280]   even better your service.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.800]   And then you sell as fast as you freak and can because your value is going to plummet
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.880]   when they stop licensing.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.160]   And Apple, I think obviously we've talked about this in the past, but Apple is pretty
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:22.320]   traditionally somewhat resistant to having outside forces provide core technologies.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.280]   Active-fisted investor Carl Icahn typically gets involved.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.840]   This is what Carl Icahn likes.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.360]   He likes to get in these situations where you've got bidding wars, the price might be overvalued,
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.360]   and he can get out.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.000]   He has, I'm sorry, 19% stake, not 15.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.240]   It's his, one of his biggest holdings.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:45.680]   So thank God, the eye of Mordor has turned from Apple and is now paying attention to
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.680]   New Orleans.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.520]   Yeah, distract him.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.520]   Distract value, yeah.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.800]   I don't think this really impacts anybody at this point.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.720]   This is almost, I would guess, a fire sale.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.320]   But Apple, Google, and Microsoft are setting for it.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.240]   I don't know if it's a fire sale yet, but it's definitely like they see the writing on
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.400]   the wall that increase competition, with companies that have pockets they just can't compete
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.400]   with, it definitely seems like the right time for them to find a partner.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.880]   It's a good time for Samsung to share that up as well.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:19.600]   One of the advantages Google has in this respect is that they have a lot of voice samples.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.240]   They're not loath as Apple is, Microsoft might be, to send those recordings, those voice
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:29.080]   dictation, all of that stuff back to the home office and save it.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.360]   In fact, the rumor was that the Google for a while offered a free 411 service, Google
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.360]   411.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.800]   The rumor was they did that to enhance their voice recognition because they killed it after
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.960]   a couple of years.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.880]   Well, in Google Voice, transcriptions.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:44.880]   That's right.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.880]   Not very good.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.880]   YouTube transcriptions too.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.380]   Not very good.
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.400]   But I'm sure a big database that can get better and better.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:57.320]   Yeah, in fact, when you get a Google Voice transcription, at least some of the time, they
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.800]   ask you, how did we do?
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.800]   Was that good?
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.080]   Would you like to correct anything?
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.160]   That would be useful.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.120]   Apple bought the company that sold Dragon to Nuance.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.320]   This is from the chatroom.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:16.560]   The company, Novaris Technologies, Dr. James Baker, was the founder of Dragon Systems.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.640]   Dragon was the best dictation system, I think, for a long time.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.640]   Very long time.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.280]   I knew that for a while, for a long period of time, I couldn't move my hands well enough.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.080]   I didn't have to type.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.160]   And so I used it in 1998 through 2000, and pretty much to do anything that I had to do
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.160]   with the computer.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:40.920]   So this is a UK company that Apple secretly bought.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.640]   Apple buys company from time to time.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.640]   Secretly.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.640]   Yes, that's right.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.640]   Isn't that-- you sound like Tim Cook.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.800]   You're chilling, Tim Cook.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:54.200]   Taking the acquisition took place last year, only announced in April of this year.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:14:03.280]   The UK-based automatic speech recognition company, Nuvaris, that's really interesting
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.640]   because that indicates that Apple's going full speed ahead of doing its own thing, right?
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.520]   And they're doing streaming voice now with iOS 8, and it's not hard to believe that once
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.880]   the hardware's up to part, maybe they'll start moving to on-device.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.920]   I mean, it's going to be a big part of their future.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:16.920]   What's streaming voice?
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.080]   What do you mean by that?
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.400]   So previously, you would say something, and then when you stopped speaking, it would take
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:26.440]   that what you'd said in transfer to the series servers for voice to text.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.240]   Now as you're talking, it starts transferring the data immediately, so you don't have to
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.640]   wait to be finished and wait for the transfer.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.400]   Yeah, Google's done that forever, and it's really a much-- I have to tell you the difference
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.440]   in experience is significant.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:42.280]   If you speak and see it transcribed as you're speaking, and that's how Dragon used to work,
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.960]   you get much more-- the confidence level is much higher than if you have to-- and this
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.960]   has happened to me so many times this year, you'll say a whole paragraph, and then I'll
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.360]   say, sorry, I can't reach the server.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.360]   Purple dot, purple dot, purple dot.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.680]   Well, and the Dragon software is so good at all of the things of all the editing, and
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.640]   when you're editing, it's getting smarter.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.640]   So it's not just that it kind of spits something out and doesn't really know what happens.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:06.320]   Every time you correct it, it's learning more about the way you use it, so the more you use
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.560]   it, the better it gets.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.920]   This is why I consider it a fire seal.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.000]   That the big three Google, Apple, and Microsoft all have their own technology.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.880]   And they're much longer than they're going to like this.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.800]   There's a lot of inconveniences with the Dragon software because every time you exchange
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.800]   mics it wants you to retrain it.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.160]   And I understand that, but you get used to Google and Apple and just being able to pick
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.160]   it up and it just works.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.960]   Andy, do you ever use a dictation to write your stuff?
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:37.560]   Not really, because I have tried to use a dictation software, but it seems as though
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.920]   my brain is hardwired to sound it out with my fingers as opposed to my voice.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.760]   Every time I try to do it, I can't do it as-- I can't create the same sort of first
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.440]   draft as I can with my hands.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.960]   What I find interesting is that the voice that I speak with and the voice that I write
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.640]   with are very different.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:58.080]   It literally sounds like a different person is writing the article.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.240]   Like when I'm writing blog posts or whatever, if I do it with dictation, it's literally
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.360]   a different whole different cadence than what I'm typing.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.360]   Did you--
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.360]   I think it's more of a question of being able to read what you're writing while you're
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.600]   writing it.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.240]   And you're sort of being your own editor as you're preparing this draft.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.040]   And by the time you get midway through, you see the form that this is going to take and
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.920]   where you need to steer the horses to get them back into the corral at the end of the
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.920]   column.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.120]   Whereas if I'm speaking, I'm certainly trying to think ahead and making sure that I'm actually
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.200]   going to an actual point.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   But it's hard for me to build that kind of structure over a thousand words if I'm just
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.600]   speaking as opposed to using my fingers.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.240]   Well, here it is.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.240]   The website.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.400]   It's called dictation.io.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.680]   This is another reason why companies like Dragon and others are going to have a problem.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.400]   This is a website, dictation.io.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.880]   And I am now dictating to dictation.io, but it doesn't seem to be hearing.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.520]   It is hearing what I'm saying.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:00.400]   Actually, you know, I think because I'm so far from the microphone, it's not doing a
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.880]   great job of this.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.120]   Let me get a little bit closer and talk a little bit louder.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.560]   This is actually doing exactly what you were talking about, Renee.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.920]   It's streaming the dictation as we go.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.840]   The beauty of this is you don't have to buy anything.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.560]   It does this on the web as you're going.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.040]   And it puts it in a text box.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.120]   It's fairly easy to just go in and edit.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.200]   That's one of the things I didn't like about Dragon was you had to say, "Stop back," you
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   know, and so forth.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.560]   This is fairly easy to do a hybrid thing.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.560]   You know what?
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.560]   It's doing a terrible job right now.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.240]   I was like, "I don't like it."
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.600]   I have used it before with a bit.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.880]   You know, I was using it in my office with the microphone and it worked much better.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.040]   Well, and I think that one of the things is it's not...
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:52.160]   It has to learn how to talk to you, but to do this really well and to do full emails
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.720]   and blog posts, you have to also learn how it likes to hear things.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.520]   And so, like the person who's actually much better at yourself, yeah.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.720]   The person who's much better at this than I am is my father.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.120]   My father's been dictating to a secretary since the early '80s.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.560]   And when you listen to him, he can do an entire contractual agreement that's like 12 pages
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.040]   long with a...
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.560]   Just sitting there going, "Click this, this, this period, comma."
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.560]   And he'll...
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.520]   Every punctuation, everything, because he can just visualize it all and he hands it to
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.680]   someone in a tape and then it gets written down.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.400]   But when he sits down and does it, he did a test online without any training and it
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.400]   was perfect.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.680]   Let me just read back to you what dictation that I thought you were saying.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:37.280]   I like about Dragons United States, top back.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.360]   You know what this is doing a terrible job reviews did before with.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.240]   You know I was using it in my office with a microphone and it works much better when
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.520]   you have to learn how to talk, but your butt blog posts, you have to learn how it liked
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.000]   to hear things in South Lyon, Michigan 48182.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Back with Mario.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   A secretary.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.320]   Certainly '80s in animal, you listen to him, he can do an entire contractual agreement,
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:03.920]   the 12 pages long without this period, comma, every punctuation, everything, but it mean
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.160]   when online without any training or was it just read.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.400]   So okay, I take it back, this thing sucks.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.600]   No, but the fact that without buying any software without any training, we were able
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.360]   to create enormous amount of gobble a good.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.400]   But it worked fine when I did it with a better microphone.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.400]   It's obviously...
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.400]   After blogging.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.400]   Without any trading, it was able to do absolutely nothing useful.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.280]   Imagine trying to type that fast.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.880]   Not many people can keep it.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.320]   I think it's the end of that.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.320]   Think of that.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.920]   If I went back to my notes from WWDC where there are sections where I'm trying to write
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:41.680]   down exactly what someone is saying, that's about what it's going to look like.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:47.840]   Andy, are you doing a little freelance advertising in your spare time?
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.960]   Have you seen it in the motorway when the wind is up, the waves are 10, sometimes 11 meters
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.960]   high.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:58.200]   Just walking through these doors makes you smarter.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.200]   What's the story here?
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.920]   Home to Canada's most famous animals.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.080]   The mistake is that that guy is outside.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.880]   That's how you know it's not me.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.760]   I think this is the Canadian tourism board or something.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.560]   I think intentionally they're duplicating your look.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.560]   Do you not?
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.560]   I feel that.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.600]   I am a tastemaker.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.040]   By the way, what?
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.680]   Maybe we'll have to ask our resident Canadian.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.400]   What is Uduway?
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.040]   Utaue, that's outside Ottawa.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.800]   You have the Ottawa Hall Uduway region.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.960]   It's just that whole area because it's close to the Quebec-Ontario border.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.720]   That is kind of like the nuanced version of Andy and Aco.
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.680]   It kind of got it right.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.680]   It's cosplay Andy.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.360]   It's like Andy and Aco on Coke.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:48.640]   But really seriously, is there a look with the big hat and the big sideburns or do they
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.760]   look at you and say, "We can't get Andy."
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.360]   Let's get somebody who looks just like you.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.840]   The question is, Andy, did they call you first?
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.840]   That's what we want to know.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.800]   Did you turn down Uduway?
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:05.200]   This is like when Mr. Dreyfuss has to go check with his Asian state.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:11.000]   Was I offered this commercial before someone decided to go with a sound alike or did they
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.160]   just simply go straight there?
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.760]   Did they figure that we can't possibly reach Andy and Aco's price?
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.880]   It's way above our price range.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.720]   When we go to the national ad, that's when we approach Andy's voice agent.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.360]   I get all the time emails for people to say, "Hey, I saw you."
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:31.400]   It's always because all us heavy middle-aged men with gray hair look pretty much the same.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.680]   When I first got this email, I thought, "Oh, yeah, I know that couldn't look."
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:39.800]   Then I played it and it went, "God, it did look like you."
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:45.920]   If you only see me once a week, I think the brain is programmed to say, "Okay, heavy set,
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.920]   sideburn, a white brim hat."
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.000]   That's good enough for a match.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.760]   I have a, if you're a longtime viewer of my Flickr stream, I have a running joke known
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:02.520]   as my BFF identification algorithm inside my camera, where sometimes I'll be taking pictures
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:08.520]   and there'll be a guy who looks a lot like a friend I've had since junior high school.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:13.520]   It's not because they look necessarily like him, but because, okay, there are at least,
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:18.360]   if you're writing a piece of software to identify somebody, you're going to film up with here
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:22.400]   are five identification points before you kick it to a human for confirmation.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.720]   For me, it's sideburns and lovely, lovely hat.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.720]   I entered BFF, Andy BFF, and I got this.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.280]   I don't, this doesn't look right.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:41.840]   You might want to live at that to my screen because that's definitely, doesn't look anything
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.840]   like you.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.600]   You know, I think you're right.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:49.320]   I think the human brain is designed, and some people more than others, is designed to kind
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.320]   of, there you go.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.320]   It looks just like--
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.320]   Well, pattern matching machine.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.320]   Wait, no, that's the ad.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.320]   That's what--
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.320]   Is that real?
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.320]   See the--
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.320]   That's the ad.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.320]   Wow.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.320]   That's the ad.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.320]   See, that's-- well, I'll also, if you cover up the eyes for these big sunglasses--
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.320]   Okay.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.320]   --the eyes give it away.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.520]   He doesn't look anything like you.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:09.520]   Also, I mean, I would have been very, very pleased to be a member of Possum Lodge, but
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.240]   given that I am not, and so therefore I don't have the fishing vest.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.880]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.280]   We have the question engine up.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.600]   In fact, we have the author of the question engine in studio.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.600]   Yes.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.600]   It's pretty cool.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.760]   You want to give him some props?
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.920]   You know his name?
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.920]   Andy Abgonson.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.040]   You didn't want to have to say the last name.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.040]   Abgonson.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.040]   Abgonson.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.040]   Abgonson.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.040]   I always say it badly.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.040]   Is that Swiss?
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.040]   Yes.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.040]   But he lives in the UK currently.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.400]   Yes, Andy is the mastermind behind the question system.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:42.440]   So the two of us sit there and chat away on it all day, and then he creates the magic.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.720]   And so he is visiting so that we have more time to informally chat about it.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.720]   It's really cool.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.480]   Are you just doing that out of the goodness of your own heart?
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.600]   Or is they paying you to do this?
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.600]   They're not paying you well, apparently.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.680]   A little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little stuff is, yeah, yeah,
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.680]   yeah.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.480]   So he told me he uses Node.js and JavaScript to do this, which is pretty impressive.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:13.000]   So if you want to take a look at the question engine, go to twit.to/mbw407.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.480]   That's our show today.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.600]   And the way it works, you can ask a question.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.800]   And you don't need to go to an iPad view now.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.800]   You don't.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.200]   I'm going to log in first real quickly, but you can.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.880]   We added, see we added social logins.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.360]   It's gotten very fancy.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.360]   It's getting there.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.360]   And it doesn't recognize.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.960]   It's a new website, so it won't recognize your last.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.960]   It's not recognized.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:32.960]   It's not recognized the old logins.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.960]   What is the old website?
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.120]   Yeah, what's the old website, Heroku?
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.000]   Or just retype it in.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   I just want to.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   I don't know it.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   I have to go to last.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   I'll just retype it in.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.600]   It'll work just fine.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.600]   I don't know what it was.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.240]   Now it's, if I send you like, if I send you like, $50 towards the development of this
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.520]   app, will I be like a millionaire in five years?
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.240]   Yes, that's our hope.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.240]   That's our hope, Andy.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.520]   That's, that's what we're, give me the address.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.120]   I got 50 bucks for you.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.320]   So you're taking investors.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.560]   This could be the nuance of the 2020 decade.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.600]   I'm a copy of the password.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.400]   I bet, I bet, I bet in a couple years you can even some dummy to give you $100 million
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.840]   for that and then walk away.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.240]   I have, I have faith in the, in the investments.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.680]   There's stupid money floating around everywhere, apparently.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.680]   Good.
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.680]   All right.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.240]   I've logged in and, yes, save site.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.240]   Thank you, LastPass.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.240]   Do save that site.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.600]   I think from now on, we will save that.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.160]   So to get back to what we were talking about, God, you've changed the whole UI.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.760]   I can't figure out the thing at all.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.760]   So now if you want to answer stuff and just hit answer, like you don't have to go, I don't
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.760]   have to go to the dashboard.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:40.760]   You can.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.240]   If you want to go to an iPad view, you hit that right here.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.240]   So here's the deal.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.280]   You can ask questions there.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.720]   If you just go now the login stops some people, but you're just, you could do anything.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.720]   I'll do your social login now.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.720]   You can do anything.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.080]   Social, you can use a trash login if you wish, right?
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.080]   You just have to remember it.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.600]   Currently, but we'll tighten that up.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.080]   You know, most of most of the login stuff is mostly to.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.080]   A lot of our people don't want to manage.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.080]   Manage.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.640]   Well, I give up their email.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.160]   I mean, yeah, you can use it.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.960]   You can set up any kind of login, but it's going to be, but you can also use social
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.960]   login.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.600]   So you don't have to log in with anything with us.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.480]   So does that make you all feel better?
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:19.080]   Well, anyway, is there a way to minimize spam and that type of thing?
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.200]   That's the way it is, unfortunately.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.360]   We don't have an on login at this point, but create a login.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.040]   And if you don't want to, that's fine.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:34.520]   And just ask your question there or more, just as important, vote up or down questions
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.520]   if you choose to.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.920]   I see there's an iPad view, which is very nice and clean and easy.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:44.120]   So we'll go through a few of those questions when we come back answering your questions
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.720]   on the question engine again.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.800]   Twit two.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.880]   That's our new shortening engine that we Patrick De La Hadley created for us.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.880]   Twit.to/MBW407.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:57.080]   Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.080]   Not a law firm.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.480]   Let me be very clear about that.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.680]   It's better than a law firm.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.880]   It's self-help.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:09.200]   At your direction, they will help you do the legal stuff you need to do, an LLC, for instance,
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:15.800]   to start your business or an incorporation, LLC from $99 plus the filing fees, the incorporation,
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:19.200]   $99 plus the state filing fees, S-Corp or C-Corp.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:26.680]   Actually, if you're starting a business, you should also do your trademark, $199.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.720]   You should trademark Twit and our logo.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.880]   This was back when I didn't have a lawyer, which is me.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.040]   There was no one else, but I decided to set this up.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.080]   You know, we're still using all of the legal work that we did then.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:42.760]   I did that in 2005 because most of the stuff you can do yourself, last will in Testament
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:50.400]   from $69, they have all kinds of personal and business-oriented legal services.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.120]   I know sometimes you go, "Well, I'll give you an example."
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.640]   When I started the LLC, I said, "Should it be an LLC?"
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.640]   Should it be a chapter?
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.720]   Should it be a C-Corp?
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.040]   I'm not sure.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.560]   What's nice is you can now ask an attorney at LegalZoom.com.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:10.040]   They have pre-negotiated flat rate pricing for a low monthly fee.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:14.520]   To talk to an attorney licensed in your state, you can read the attorney's profile and unedited
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:20.080]   customer reviews to get an idea if that person is right for you.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.360]   It's just great.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.880]   Very affordable legal help from LegalZoom.com.

[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.040]   There's many.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:07.120]   Actually, for a slow news week, there's a lot of big stories.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:12.680]   I think maybe the big story is Apple has reached a settlement on the eBooks lawsuit.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.120]   They're going to pay.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.040]   Was a class action lawsuit?
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.880]   The terms are currently under seal have to be approved by court, but it seems that
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.880]   everybody agrees.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.640]   Judge Denise Coté.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.640]   Letter.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:30.680]   I think this was extremely well played by Amazon.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.680]   I mean, this is how we...
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.680]   Because the thing is, is that the true monopoly, the true man...
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.680]   Excellience.
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.520]   So before there was Apple, before there was iBooks, there was Amazon.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.520]   Before there was iBooks.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.160]   And we're talking about eBooks specifically, right?
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.880]   And we're talking about basically 50% of all books bought, right?
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.680]   Or bought through Amazon.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.480]   And so Amazon has been increasing there.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.960]   And when they started burning out the eBooks, they just said, "This is how much we're going
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.960]   to..."
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.960]   This is how much you will charge for them.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.520]   There are two different ways to do this.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.320]   There's the Amazon way, which is...
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:06.280]   This came from the days when Amazon bought books from a middleman from a room and other
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.280]   distributors.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.840]   They paid a certain price for the book, and then they, as any bookstore does, would set
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.840]   a price in the bookstore.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.840]   Right.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.840]   The wholesale retail model.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.920]   Apple decided to do something different.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:21.080]   They set an agency model where they said, "You price the book, Mr. Publisher.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.080]   We just take 30%.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.280]   Much like Apple's done in the App Store and the iTunes Store."
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:29.440]   But actually with iTunes, though, Apple had gone the other way for a long time saying,
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.440]   "99 cents."
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.440]   It was $0.99.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.440]   It was $0.99.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.440]   It was $0.99.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.160]   Whatever those things were, it was always going to be the same.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.160]   So because they didn't have leverage, they went the other direction.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:44.520]   Which to me, I still feel like what Apple did was go around and sell.
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.960]   I really don't feel like it was collusion as much as it was selling a good idea.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.440]   This is a much better deal for you to work with us.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:54.520]   I think it mostly came organically from two different directions.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:31:00.440]   From one from the old direction, the old bookstore model, and one from the modern iTunes/App Store
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.440]   model.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.560]   However, Apple did put one.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.680]   There were a couple of things that got Apple in trouble.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:10.080]   They put it in a clause that said, "And by the way, you'll set the price, but it may
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:13.680]   not be offered at a lower price anywhere else, including Amazon."
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.920]   That was illegal, one.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.440]   Then they emailed around about it.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.600]   Steve Jobs, even in the biography, said...
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.920]   That was probably not a good idea.
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.160]   Publicly, this was all about Amazon.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.080]   That was a mistake.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:32.760]   In fact, Judge Cote last year ruled that Apple had colluded with the publishers to drive
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:37.360]   up ebook prices, undermining Amazon's pricing model.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:42.920]   Which is now essentially, I believe, Amazon's pricing model now has been, they don't have
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.920]   that control.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.240]   They don't have that.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.480]   Not everything's the same price now.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.240]   That said, Amazon is showing what happens when you have 50%.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:56.280]   They're showing a really good lesson of what happens when a company has too much of a market
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:01.320]   where they are just telling book publishers, "We're not going to supply your book if you
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.120]   don't meet our demands."
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:10.080]   The Justice Department was one of the sewers, but so were many states, Attorney General.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:14.760]   The Justice Department said, "As long as you put in a monitor, that's fine.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.000]   We don't want monetary damages, but you've got to put a monitor to make sure Apple doesn't."
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.400]   Remember, this is the monitor that Apple hates with a passion, with a fury that burns
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.400]   like the fire.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:27.200]   Yeah, qualified monitor, unstructured text front.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.640]   Yeah, right.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:35.280]   Meanwhile, the state's Attorney's General continued the lawsuit.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:41.520]   The same judge, Denise Cote, says now that Apple and the plaintiffs have reached an agreement
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:42.520]   in principle.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.520]   The terms are undersealed.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.200]   They will have to be approved by Judge Cote.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:52.080]   The plaintiffs, this is a class action at this point, have been seeking $480 million from
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.680]   Apple.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.760]   Claiming Apple had overcharged.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:59.360]   Apple has continued to argue, A, we don't violate antitrust laws.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.040]   B, we don't want a court-appointed monitor.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.120]   B, we'd see we didn't do anything wrong.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.720]   This is good for consumers.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.920]   The Justice Department's been satisfied that Apple won't, with this monitor, that Apple's
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.200]   not going to do it again.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.440]   Apple may have now settled.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.440]   What is it?
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.440]   That's nothing.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.440]   $280 million?
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.440]   That's nothing.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.640]   It's one-eighth of a beat.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.640]   One night.
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.640]   One night.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.840]   So it's possible that Apple settled for the full amount.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.480]   Probably they settled for something less, but it's like glad to get-
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.480]   It's a couple days of earnings.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.480]   Yeah, glad to get this stuff.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.480]   It's just like, it literally, it's a couple days.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.480]   A couple days.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.480]   I think it's a couple days.

[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:06.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.480]   I think it's a couple days.

[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.480]   I think it's a couple days.

[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:57.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:02.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:06.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:07.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:08.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:10.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.480]   I think it's a couple days.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:18.480]   It might be as simple as the old statement that it's a great idea but a lot of people
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:19.480]   are going to have to die first.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:24.480]   Meaning that whole generation of people who grew up doing nothing but start at page one,
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.480]   read through page 300.
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.480]   At some point, stop and look at pieces of media.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:34.480]   Those people have to age out of the system and a new generation that never really got
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:39.480]   into reading so much as assimilating and experience and information through Google
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:44.480]   and through games and through interactivity that they might simply think that they might
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:50.480]   be the people who are able to visualize a story in the terms of there has to be interactive,
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.480]   there has to be multiple paths.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.480]   No, but I don't necessarily have to go anywhere.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:57.480]   I think narrative is another thing and I think that we can decide where that's.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:02.480]   But narrative from a pure narrative is the biggest sellers I think if I'm correct.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:08.480]   But if you really wanted to lie down and read a book but if you walk into what you used
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:16.480]   to walk into Borders bookstore, the fictional area was one tenth of the square footage of
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.480]   a bookstore.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.480]   Nonfiction has been somewhat replaced by the web.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.480]   A lot of this, the answer is the web.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:31.480]   There was a great talk by Serenity Caldwell from Macworld about how at Singleton two years ago
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:34.480]   I think I'll put the link in the chat room but she explained how hard it was for her to
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:38.480]   make one book from Macworld available on just two or three different platforms.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.480]   And it was arduous.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.480]   Well it's not arduous if it's text.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.480]   It's not arduous at all.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.480]   You use caliber or something like that and you pump out all the formats.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.480]   It's only arduous if you have multimedia.
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:49.480]   She added images.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:55.480]   And Serenity is a master at building you books.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:58.480]   If you tweet out a question to her she'll fix things for you.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:01.480]   But see that's the third major issue.
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:07.480]   In movies everyone's talking about how it's impossible for a middle budget movie to be made
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.480]   nowadays.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:12.480]   And he has to be made for so little money that there's no way to not make a profit or it
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:16.480]   has to cost two hundred three hundred million dollars and bet on becoming an international
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.480]   blockbuster.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:21.480]   I think one of the reasons why we see such a lush environment for books is that it doesn't
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:23.480]   cost that much money to produce a book.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:29.480]   It's not that risky an investment to buy a manuscript prepped for publication and put it
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:30.480]   out there.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:35.480]   I think one of the difficulties we're facing is that once we start looking at it as a software
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:39.480]   project now we start to say well this is going to cost us a minimum of seven hundred thousand
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:43.480]   dollars just to make this and to support it and to make sure that people can actually
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:44.480]   access it and read it.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:50.480]   At that point we can't really go for the Wes Anderson style like quirky stories or the topics
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:53.480]   that we don't think there's going to be the nonfiction books for which there is not a
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.480]   wide audience.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:58.480]   So it's a problem with lots and lots of layers.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.880]   I don't think it's necessarily Apple's problem to fix.
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:09.980]   I think it's going to be situations which publishers of magazines like the Loop or like
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:15.480]   the magazine that are unsatisfied with the product that they're putting out right now.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:20.920]   Them themselves bank rolling the solutions for their own business much like the way Elon
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:25.480]   Musk has bank rolled the idea of well let's do our own electric car company and let's
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.480]   do our own spacecraft company.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:32.280]   We might succeed we might fail but there's ways to do this as individuals that you can't
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:35.880]   do as a large large like global industry.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:41.480]   You know it's fascinating it's really all because we're transforming or transitioning
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:45.280]   from the old way of doing things printing words on paper it's turbulence and this happens
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:51.040]   in every sector but it seems like there's a fairly good roadmap for how this can occur.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:56.960]   There will always be this linear page driven text heavy format.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:57.960]   We think we do like that.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:58.960]   I think so.
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.960]   I think we like that.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:06.040]   And I think there will also and that is not software that's a very static format and
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:09.040]   then there's software and it could be as simple as what Serenity was doing was just
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:14.080]   adding images to something much more complex and interactive but that becomes software.
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:18.640]   And I think what's happening is we have publishers plenty of them for plain text.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:24.200]   We don't yet have a model for how this more elaborate software based and I think you nailed
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:31.120]   it Andy when you said when you pointed out medium and the others who are basically publishers
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:35.560]   providing a software platform for people who want to do something more sophisticated than
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:36.560]   just plain text.
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.960]   And I think that I don't think that it's Apple's problem to solve but I do think it's
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:41.320]   Apple's opportunity to solve it.
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.320]   I don't think it is.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:47.360]   I think it isn't because Apple's so proprietary and I think that's that's that's bad.
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:51.840]   We can say it's a consumer but I can say it from an Apple from pure Apple perspective.
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.200]   It's good for Apple's business but it's terrible for the consumer.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:57.600]   If you had to go to a bookstore and they said well you can read this book but only if
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:02.040]   you're a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant that's not good.
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:08.240]   But if Apple created an Apple created another revolution of how we make books and how we
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:13.440]   send you know share information and so on and so forth it wouldn't stay proprietary to
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:14.440]   Apple.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.280]   What would happen is other people would do something else.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.440]   It wouldn't be iBooks.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:21.800]   It would be another interactive medium but we'd start building interactive books.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:25.360]   And when we talk about Apple having so much money that they have to start giving it back
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:29.040]   to investors which I view as pouring down the drain.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:37.920]   The spending $2 billion a year on pushing both various versions of e-learning, iBooks
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:42.120]   and so on and so forth would be a good investment for Apple given that the entire education
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.960]   system is probably going to crumble in the next decade.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:47.560]   I think you're just completely wrong.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:48.560]   I'll do that.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:49.560]   I'll just say well.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.560]   I'll just say well.
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:54.200]   Apple is not the answer.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:58.600]   I'm just saying that I think that Apple is providing a solution like that but the solution
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.600]   is an iBooks author.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.560]   The solution is Xcode.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:02.560]   Okay.
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:03.560]   Sure.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:04.560]   I'm looking at serenity.
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:09.720]   By the way serenity speech thank you Renee for the link is on Vimeo you can search for
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:12.000]   it but I'm looking at some of her slides from her speech.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.200]   She has several different workflows she proposed.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.600]   This is an example of the complexity.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.160]   She's just doing three formats.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:22.880]   PDF, ePub and Moby which are probably three that you would want to do and the complexity
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:28.000]   of what she's attempting it becomes clear when she starts and pages for PDF she goes
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.720]   to eDesign for ePub she goes to from pages to ePub to Sigil to BB Ed to caliber.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:37.480]   This is two years ago but I don't know anyone's done or any favors in simplifying it.
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.040]   This is these are her criteria for doing it.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.040]   This is it.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:47.140]   She says I don't want to use more than four apps to generate my book but I think this
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:51.560]   is a do it yourself thing and I think the solution is probably that somebody provides
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:54.720]   this as a service.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:55.720]   I don't know.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:52:01.800]   It just feels like this is going to be complicated but I do think that any proprietary solution
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:06.520]   or solution that attempts to own it as iBooks and Amazon both seem to be wanting to do is
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.240]   not going to be the end run.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:11.640]   I like a proprietary interface and then an open format.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:12.640]   That always ends up being a good result.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.160]   Someone's a perfect way to make it but the format that it spits out should be standard.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:19.460]   That's perfect.
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:21.700]   So enough of the eBooks.
[00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:23.740]   We're boring everybody.
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:29.060]   Let's talk about the Tim Cook profile in the New York Times and then the Jonathan I've
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:30.980]   profile in the New York Times.
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:35.300]   Times getting some interesting.
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:39.700]   When I mentioned this profile Renee you said that the Tim Cook profile was mostly a piece
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:40.700]   of fiction.
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:41.700]   No.
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:42.700]   I mean it was.
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:44.260]   What's the best way to say it?
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.580]   I think the Jonathan I've quote is great.
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:49.000]   You know the Robert Iger quote those are all good.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.020]   I think the premise of the article I don't know what went into it.
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:57.320]   I did complain about it both in Twitter and privately but you read the article and the
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:00.560]   crux of the article is Tim Cook is not Steve Jobs which is fine.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.560]   Well that's almost.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.560]   That's almost.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:04.560]   I mean tell us something we don't know.
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.260]   That's the entire article summed up at the very end.
[00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:09.720]   There's a couple developers saying I can't believe Tim Cook announced health kit without
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:10.720]   any new hardware.
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.240]   Steve Jobs would never do that.
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:18.460]   And in fact you know WWDC 2011, no new hardware, past book, no new hardware, home kit, no new
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:19.460]   hardware.
[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:22.640]   He did it all the time and I think when you get something that substantial wrong in an
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:27.220]   article when you disprove your own thesis that that botchodly and I'm not so worried
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:28.380]   but I'm creating it for this.
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:30.060]   Botchodly is a good word.
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.060]   Yeah.
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:34.460]   I think the entire thing becomes actually less valuable than if you hadn't.
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:37.500]   The Johnny I've quote was it's hard for all of us to be patient.
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:39.100]   It was hard for Steve.
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.460]   It is hard for Tim.
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:42.780]   Is that the quote you're talking about?
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:43.780]   There's one right above that.
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:46.480]   The paragraph right above that too where he says that he doesn't think the divine philosophy
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.840]   has changed very much at Apple.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.140]   It's just matured so to speak.
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:50.840]   Yeah because he leads it.
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:56.960]   Well, Tim Cook, people say that you know Tim Cook has no Steve Jobs but Steve Jobs was
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:57.960]   no Tim Cook.
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:01.240]   He was smart enough to hire Tim Cook and Tim Cook likewise is smart enough to hire people
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:02.440]   who compliment his skills.
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.440]   Did we learn anything about Tim?
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:07.200]   I mean there were facts in here that I didn't know about Tim Cook.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.440]   I don't know if out Jermaine they are.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.640]   I hate to see.
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:13.260]   Yeah the cross burning was interesting.
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:20.060]   But you know one of the things that I think happened to Steve Jobs in Apple was the beatification
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:23.580]   of Steve Jobs and the cult of personality that surrounded him.
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:27.180]   It seems like Tim Cook is actively trying to avoid that.
[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:28.540]   That is both a benefit.
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:33.220]   It's certainly an ego boost but it's also a detriment because it makes it harder for
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:34.820]   you to be a human.
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:40.620]   Well, I think that's one of the differences in leadership style.
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:45.740]   As evidence through the public statements, I mean WWDC, everybody was talking about Craig
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:46.740]   Federighi.
[00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:51.700]   Almost nobody was talking about Tim Cook because he basically was there to hand.
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:54.420]   He was essentially the MC, not the main presenter.
[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:59.780]   And he was never, never, never, never hesitant to hand things off to other people and basically
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:05.820]   say I'm here to represent the Apple logo but I'm going to hand off for all every technology
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:08.660]   and every product that we're talking about it during this keynote.
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:12.460]   I'm going to let the manager who's responsible for that product and that product space do
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:13.700]   the entire thing.
[00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:20.060]   Which is certainly not unheard of during the Steve Jobs era but every moment that Steve
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:24.100]   Jobs spent off the stage was notable for whatever reason.
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:27.820]   You feel as though he's going back to get some water and to close a deal.
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:30.740]   That's why he decided to be off the stage for 15 minutes.
[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:34.620]   Mr. Cook is amassing a creative brain trust according to Bono, the lead singer of the
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:36.620]   band U2.
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:41.260]   A cult of personality who befriended Mr. Jobs and worked closely with him and Apple's team
[00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:44.380]   on developing that black and red U2 branded iPod.
[00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:46.100]   It should be black and red.
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:48.700]   I doubt that he did more than that.
[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:51.780]   And that you would have all our songs on it for a great price.
[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:56.660]   Mr. Cook is not saying quote, "I'm here to replace him," said Bono.
[00:55:56.660 --> 00:56:01.860]   He's saying, this is the quote, "I'll try to replace him with five Steve Jobs with five
[00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:02.860]   people."
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:07.500]   He explains the acquisition of Beats, says Bono.
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:12.740]   I keep trying to figure out why we're still having these, sorry, not us on this path.
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:15.740]   No, but in general, the world cannot let this rest.
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:18.100]   It's a big purchase and no one understands it.
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:20.300]   Not just Beats but does Steve Jobs do?
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:21.300]   No, not Beats.
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:26.100]   That again, well gosh, he's had this job now for what, six years now?
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:32.500]   And it really is like, I don't know, it's at some point after the Red Sox replaced their
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:37.540]   manager, you got to talk about the Red Sox as though they are an ongoing concern and
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:38.540]   not limping along.
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:40.940]   But Andy, that's Don Zimmer 30 years ago.
[00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:44.820]   That's the concept, by the way, the late Popeye, we're sorry to lose you.
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:46.580]   That's the consequence of beatification, right?
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:51.860]   If you have a saint leading a company, then it's very hard for a mortal man to take over.
[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:52.860]   Right.
[00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:55.060]   Unless he's a pope.
[00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:59.140]   It almost becomes a situation where when I see that phrase, I can't believe that this
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:01.060]   is not something Steve Jobs would have done.
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:05.420]   It's not that I disregard whatever someone says before or after that, but I suddenly
[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:10.340]   start to look through this in the prism of someone who has an nostalgic view of Apple
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:14.660]   as opposed to seeing it as a modern and dynamic company that changes from quarter to quarter
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:15.660]   year to year.
[00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:16.660]   Well, there's a lot of things.
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:19.500]   But what the observation is, is that it is not the same Apple.
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:20.500]   If you leave out the name.
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:24.940]   Of course not, but the same thing would be if Steve Jobs had beaten the cancer and had
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:30.340]   been into remission, Apple of 2015, 2014 would still be a different Apple from what it was
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:31.340]   once 2009.
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:38.860]   So it's a discussion that is it's nice to have a few beers and retire after ever movie
[00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:39.820]   and talk about this.
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:45.380]   But it's I get a little bit frustrated that I don't know when people are going to be willing
[00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:49.820]   to completely move on and treat Apple as though again, they're not they're not what they were
[00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:50.820]   in 2009.
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:53.180]   They were they are what they are in 2014.
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:55.900]   Changes is integral to the concept of life.
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:56.900]   If you know, I agree.
[00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:57.900]   It does not change.
[00:57:57.900 --> 00:57:58.900]   Life dies.
[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:00.620]   I think you're out as who is this Tim Cook.
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:02.580]   What is a Tim Cook Apple going to be?
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:03.580]   What is it?
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:04.580]   I think the big thing right now, we see it.
[00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:08.500]   The thing the thing that now that's really impresses me is that people and we talked about
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:12.540]   this two years ago, but the general mainstream media, I think didn't understand how valuable
[00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:14.540]   Tim Cook was to Apple until more recently.
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:18.500]   I don't know if they understand it still, but I think a lot of these articles, you know,
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:22.660]   Matt Drans had a great article Jason Snell did John Gruber all had great articles on this
[00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:25.700]   that, you know, people keep talking about Apple without Steve Jobs.
[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:30.100]   But if you start trying to do the math on Apple without Tim Cook, that that is not a
[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:31.100]   good thing.
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:32.100]   Yeah.
[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:35.380]   Tim Cook is incredibly it's contributed incredibly to the success of Apple in the modern age
[00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:37.100]   and innumerable ways.
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:41.580]   I think Tim Cook's somewhat of a cipher and a lot of this ink is not really about Steve
[00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:44.060]   Jobs anymore, but who is Tim Cook?
[00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:45.420]   And what does a Tim Cook lead?
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:51.420]   Let Apple look like and with all due respect, we've yet to see that Apple has not released
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:53.980]   any new they keep saying new categories, new products.
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:59.180]   We learned a little bit at WWDC about some new software that might come out this fall,
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:04.340]   but I think we still don't really know what the app the Tim Cook Apple is going to do.
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:08.220]   Because the I what we have the iPhone five as that was at Steve's last product, probably
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:11.500]   John Gruber had a great piece on this called only Apple where he sort of lynched it to
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:14.980]   Tim Cook saying only Apple could do this and he went through the thought exercise of could
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:16.940]   only Apple do this.
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:21.180]   And what we what he came to is back in 2007, they had to stop working on OS 10 in order to
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:24.260]   get I know to get the iPhone out the gate.
[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:29.420]   This year, Tim Cook's Apple came out with Maverick, sorry, with Yosemite with iOS 8 with
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:32.820]   Swift with all the new developer tools all at once.
[00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:36.900]   And it goes back to, you know, when Scott forced all left and I drew this analogy that
[00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:40.460]   you know, when Steve Cook, sorry, when Steve Jobs came back to Apple, he put the products
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:45.820]   in a category professional, sorry, consumer professional laptop desktop.
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:47.740]   That's exactly what Tim Cook did with Apple internally.
[00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:52.020]   He turned Apple's corporation into an Apple product and we're now seeing the results of
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:53.020]   that.
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:54.260]   And I think it's incredibly impressive as a product.
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:57.660]   I say it's probably better than a watch at this point because it can create things like
[00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.180]   watching the future.
[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:00.180]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:07.780]   It also feels like setting Tim Cook up for failure because it's everything that he does
[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:13.220]   is going in the future is of course going to build upon iPhone, iPad, iOS and Mac OS.
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:18.740]   And those things were things that were created under various Steve Jobs 10 years.
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:23.100]   And so anything that fails, anything that succeeds will be seen as well.
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:25.140]   Yeah, he had iOS.
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.540]   He had this multi-touch technology.
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:30.300]   He had this amazingly successful product.
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:36.420]   The fact that he articulated it into the form of a watch or moved into TV, big deal.
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:40.140]   That's something he inherited from the previous administration.
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:43.260]   If he does something that fails and that is not something that he inherited from Steve
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:44.260]   Jobs or from previous.
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.260]   By the way, we're all assuming there's a watch.
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:48.260]   Nobody has said there's a watch.
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.260]   There's no watch.
[01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:50.260]   That's made up.
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:53.900]   It's starting to be a bit of a struggle because it's not going to be a beat.
[01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:54.900]   It's going to be a beat.
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:55.900]   It's going to be a bit of a beat.
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:56.900]   There may not be a watch.
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.900]   We just have this conversation I thought about.
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.580]   I'm talking about things if it's a real deal.
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:01.580]   It's not.
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.580]   It beats.
[01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:03.580]   It beats.
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:07.620]   I was using that as an example of something that is unique to something that's something
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:11.500]   that we weren't talking about six years ago, but we're talking about right now.
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.500]   I'm saying that if it's.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:17.500]   I understand we're talking about it, but I'm again pointing out that Apple has yet to
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:23.420]   do anything to illustrate what the Tim Cook era is going to deliver except for WWDC.
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:26.740]   The first time we've seen any kind of roadmap.
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:32.060]   Although I mean, are you looking for like when a new director takes over the Star Wars
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:34.580]   franchise and now there's a way for the movie.
[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:38.980]   It's between there was there was there was six Star Wars movies that were made before
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:42.380]   the sky came along and now there's going to be another one that come afterwards and
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:47.020]   now whatever happens between the end of the previous movie and this new movie is what this
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:48.020]   director changed.
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.940]   We know that there's going to be a new movie.
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.940]   Apple has not announced any new products.
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:53.460]   Well, but I think I remember too.
[01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.460]   They don't do that.
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:55.460]   Why not?
[01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:58.460]   I'm just saying we don't know.
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:00.580]   That would have been revolutionary.
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:05.280]   And I think that I'd be totally on the bandwagon of, Oh my God, this is a this is a sea change
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:09.900]   in the character of Apple that they're willing to show off at WWDC saying, here's what we're
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:10.900]   playing.
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:14.380]   They did if they were to do a Google Glass style, we think this is a really great idea.
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:15.740]   We don't know the best way to do it.
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:18.940]   But here's what we're playing with right now and just show off.
[01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:20.620]   This is this is alpha hardware.
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:23.540]   There's something we've just built for ourselves to show you what our thinking is.
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.180]   And many ways of asking them to do that.
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:26.180]   I'm just pointing.
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:27.900]   I'm not saying they should or shouldn't do that.
[01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:33.820]   I'm pointing out that everything we say about what Apple is is all projection of our own
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:35.980]   hopes, dreams, fears and fantasies at this point.
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.140]   But it's important to really thank you.
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:40.140]   Tim Cook was responsible for a lot of the products that we attribute to Steve Jobs.
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:43.020]   Steve Jobs didn't, you know, handcraft them all by himself.
[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:46.860]   The famous line is that how, wow, how did Apple make an iPad and that Steve Jobs, but
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:48.380]   how did they make it for $500?
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:49.380]   Well, that's Tim Cook.
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:52.620]   He was integral to almost all the major modern products they've launched.
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:53.620]   He hasn't gone anywhere.
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:54.620]   He's still there.
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:59.540]   So people act like I want him to release something or I'm just pointing out that we are projecting.
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.540]   Are we not?
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:01.540]   No, I want him to release.
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:07.540]   No, that's absolutely my point.
[01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:12.100]   It seems unfair to be saying that, well, we're going to judge Tim Cook because we haven't
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:13.100]   seen what he's done.
[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:17.140]   We haven't seen things that we feel is indicative of a new Apple.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:21.500]   But what we're saying is what I think what we're really saying is that here's the thing
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:26.140]   that Apple would have to do for me to recognize that as major, major change.
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:31.780]   When in truth, it could be something as simple as Mac OS and iOS working together as though
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:34.420]   they were made by the same company.
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:39.540]   That could be just as revolutionary as the iPad, as the iPhone.
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:43.580]   It really, to me, it really is the booster rocket that I think is taking, has the potential
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:45.900]   to take Apple into a higher orbit.
[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:49.460]   But if the fact that it's not something that I would have predicted a year ago as the, as
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:55.020]   an exciting new direction for Apple, that doesn't negate the value of that development.
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:59.380]   I guess the problem is we have to do a show every week, frankly.
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:02.540]   We can do it about software.
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:03.540]   And we did.
[01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:05.820]   We've talked a lot about iOS 8 and your Sematy.
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:07.660]   They got updated today.
[01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:08.660]   Really?
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:10.340]   Yeah, beta two for both of them came out today.
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:11.340]   Tell me about the changes.
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:12.340]   What's new?
[01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:14.140]   I have only just installed it.
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:15.220]   I've only had time to play with it.
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:20.420]   But according to the interwebs, things are working better and they've added additional
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:21.420]   functionality.
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:24.060]   I'm going to have to dig into it when we're done here.
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.060]   Okay.
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:27.540]   Do we know what's, we had one of the questions from the question engine was what's new in
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.460]   OS 10 or Yosemite beta two?
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.460]   I'll tell you what, let's stop.
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:36.020]   And when we come back, we start answering questions from the question engine in just
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:37.020]   a moment.
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:41.540]   Our show today brought to you by squarespace.com when it's time to make a website.
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:44.100]   It's kind of the Apple of web hosting.
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:45.100]   It's beautiful.
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:46.300]   It's elegant.
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:47.300]   It's clean.
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.300]   It's simple.
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:49.300]   Scalable.
[01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:50.700]   It scales beautifully.
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:52.860]   We've never brought a squarespace site down.
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:56.900]   So we're talking hosting plus software beautifully combined.
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:59.780]   This is an example.
[01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:04.500]   Who was it said if you really want to make great software, you got to make the hardware
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.500]   too.
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.740]   If you really wanted to do great web hosting and great, great web sites, you got to do
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:10.220]   the hosting and the software together.
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:11.220]   I remember those days.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:15.380]   They're all along together and squarespace has done it incredibly easy to use.

[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:26.740]   That's the beauty of it.
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:28.740]   Ecommerce too.

[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:28.780]   I can't go.
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:31.540]   I cannot praise this enough.
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:33.180]   It's just wonderful.

[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:48.900]   That's making me hungry.
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:50.180]   The park slope tavern.
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:51.180]   That looked good.
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:53.580]   All right, time for the quest shown engine.
[01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:57.060]   Why don't you do you want to MC this or shall I either way?
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:58.060]   Ready?
[01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:04.380]   I should have given out the URL again, twit.to/ it's going to be the same from now on because
[01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:05.820]   we control this.
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:11.780]   So it'll be MBW and the show number in this case, 407, twit.to/MBW4.
[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:13.420]   You like the new design?
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:14.580]   I really like the new design.
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:15.580]   It's getting pretty.
[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:17.580]   See, you can see questions that I answered on.
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:19.340]   Why is Leo so grumpy today?
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:20.340]   Grumpy.
[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:21.340]   I already answered that one.
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:22.340]   I hate grumpy.
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:23.340]   I hate grumpy.
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:27.380]   Look, somebody's got to see the problem is there are some people who watch this show
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:31.620]   who think we should just be cheerleaders and that everything Apple does is wonderful and
[01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:32.620]   gorgeous.
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:33.620]   And that's not this show.
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:35.620]   That's some other show you're thinking of.
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:39.500]   We just want to talk honestly about what we think is going on in the world.
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:42.100]   And yes, I represent the user, not Apple.
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.620]   Will Apple reave?
[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.180]   Is this in order when I look at this?
[01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:46.180]   That's in order.
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:49.900]   The number one question comes from Steve Kellner in Southern California.
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.220]   What's the number there?
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:52.220]   How many upvotes?
[01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:53.220]   Twenty twenty one.
[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:54.220]   Wow.
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:56.940]   Will Apple revamp iTunes in the fall?
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:57.940]   The UI so data.
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:01.780]   Why are you so grumpy, Steve?
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:02.780]   It's true.
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:03.780]   iTunes has been just left.
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.060]   Yeah, I feel like they're ignoring it.
[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:08.460]   It was really a collection of Apple scripts for so long.
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:14.940]   They just ignoring it because somewhere somebody is writing a beautiful, swift based
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:18.340]   elegant, fast version of iTunes.
[01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:19.340]   Yes.
[01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:20.340]   I think it's a dream.
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:23.540]   I think one of the problems is that it's it is also does a lot of things.
[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:27.300]   So I think it's complicated to fix it and still achieve all the things that they're trying
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:28.300]   to do.
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:30.420]   So I think that's probably why it's taking so long.
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:33.140]   I mean, it's a big problem with the rest of it.
[01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:34.140]   Go ahead, Renee.
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:37.100]   Also, his biggest problem is that it has to be transportable to Windows.
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:41.140]   So they put everything that they ever have to use for any iPod or iPhone or iPad user
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:45.060]   on Windows, bundle in that app and then make it easy to cross develop for.
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:48.620]   And that is a horrible news around like, tunes is neck.
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:53.500]   That's why I wonder if the next real revolution for iTunes is for them to unbeknownst to them
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:58.140]   bundle the hardware support features, make to make the best app they possibly can to
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:02.380]   support your iPhone and your iPad on your Mac and on your Windows device and then make
[01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:06.740]   the music management and the playlist management and the jukebox features a totally separate
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:12.260]   app so that they can really leverage the advantages that they have in Mac OS.
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:13.500]   It really it really is clumsy.
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:17.860]   I'm one of the reasons why I do so much of my music management now directly on the device
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:23.420]   is because it's no longer any fun whatsoever to manipulate playlists and tailor my music
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:25.140]   on iTunes itself.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:27.060]   So that's the real tragedy here.
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:34.540]   And now ladies and gentlemen from Mac world UK iTunes 12 separate.
[01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:35.940]   We're going to have to redesign it, right?
[01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:37.820]   That's at least something they're going to have to do.
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:43.460]   This is this is this leak accurate or is this from is this from Yosemite?
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:45.740]   The iTunes 12 preview.
[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:48.620]   They have a new icon that we haven't seen yet on Yosemite, the red one, but you just
[01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:50.140]   have to think that Yosemite is such a big redesign.
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:54.900]   They're going to have to give a code of paint at the very least iTunes or what match.
[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:59.660]   Also considering that now it really if they say Apple is working in a big overalls.
[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:04.220]   Yeah, I mean, on top of everything else now that there's everything is in Yosemite is
[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:05.420]   digitized.
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:11.340]   You feel as though you have to reconsider if iTunes role is simply to provide a deck of
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:16.180]   playback controls into the notification bar or into other apps or if you really do have
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:21.740]   to make this as much of a system wide music and playlist manager as the photos app is,
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:24.980]   for instance, for iOS.
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:26.820]   Question so thank you, Steve.
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:33.220]   Question two with 19 up votes comes from the UK, London, Andreas Lindstrom.
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:36.860]   What do you think Johnny I've talked about when he hinted they're working with new types
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:41.900]   of materials in that New York Times bits blog interview?
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:44.180]   They're working with liquid metal on a Tanium.
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:45.180]   Unmptanium.
[01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:46.580]   Anything he loves material.
[01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:48.180]   That's his big thing.
[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:49.180]   Yeah.
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:51.540]   I think I think it's basically.
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:52.540]   Sapphire.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:56.700]   Sapphire curved glass.
[01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:01.780]   I think that if Apple does do something that translates to an actual watch as opposed
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:07.460]   to a fitness band, I think we're going to learn a lot about what is what is what is
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.700]   driving Apple design right now.
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:13.660]   What materials fascinate them at this point that they haven't really worked with yet?
[01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:17.500]   Well, I think as you get into wearables, I mean, the wearables are so challenging.
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:21.020]   I think you're going to end up with a lot of innovation in the way we build things because
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:25.580]   it's just not going to be something you can just put, you know, clump some raw material
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:27.580]   together to make it work.
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:30.260]   Especially if you want it to be as good for women as it is for men.
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:31.260]   Right.
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:33.740]   Unmptanium is very good for women and men.
[01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:34.740]   Yeah, I hear.
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:35.740]   At a MantiM2.
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:36.740]   At a MantiM2.
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:37.740]   Unmptanium.
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:39.940]   They're all having to get out of plasticized dragon tears.
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:42.740]   They're having yield problems.
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:45.540]   They lose about 100 engineers for every gram that they can carve us.
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:46.940]   But they're working on.
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:47.940]   I forgot Leo.
[01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:51.540]   One thing I did notice in iOS 8 beta 2 is that the podcast app, at least in this beta,
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:52.540]   is default.
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:53.540]   It's no longer from the app store.
[01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:54.820]   So that should benefit all of us.
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:55.820]   You don't have to download it.
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:56.820]   It's just on there.
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:57.820]   That's good.
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:11:58.820]   Yeah.
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:00.660]   That answers Chris Peachman's question.
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:02.940]   What's new in iOS beta 2?
[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:09.660]   It's so new that I don't think any we first of all, some of us don't know what it is because
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:11.420]   we're not signing NDAs.
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:14.580]   Other of us signed NDAs and can't speak.
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.340]   Well, the NDAs different this year, remember, you just can't do screenshots, videos or
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:19.340]   reviews.
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:20.340]   So you can speak.
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:21.340]   Yeah.
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:22.340]   Yeah.
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:25.380]   Well, and then finally, most of anybody who has it just got it.
[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:29.300]   So yeah, and right now Twitter is flooded with people announcing new features that Apple
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.300]   announced them, you know, two weeks ago.
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.820]   I'm going to start through that.
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:34.820]   It's too early.
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:35.820]   It's fun to watch.
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:36.820]   It's fun to watch.
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.740]   Everybody try to be the first to break a story.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:42.340]   Jason Snell tweeted like, "Am I the first to say that the energy saver icon is now an
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:45.140]   LED bulb instead of a complex fluorescent?"
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:48.140]   Well, finally, it's about time.
[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:51.780]   Here's from- You see, that's a Tim Cook innovation.
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:52.780]   Yeah.
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:57.300]   According to the release notes Safari will now block ads from automatically redirecting
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.380]   to the app store without user interaction.
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:00.380]   Yes.
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:01.380]   That is true.
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:02.380]   Okay.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:03.380]   Also a new feature.
[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:04.380]   You can hear a lot from the layer with that.
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:05.380]   Go ahead.
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:06.380]   It's horrible.
[01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:10.100]   There would be ads and they would sneak into Google which everyone uses across the internet
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:12.860]   and you would go to a web page on a mobile browser and it would immediately shoot you
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:13.860]   to the app store.
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:14.860]   That's not good.
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:16.740]   And as a publisher, we couldn't stop it either because we had no way of knowing which ads
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:18.860]   had it and it was a huge pain.
[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:22.580]   And I hope Google and Chrome do this immediately as well.
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:24.740]   That just fixes a bug, it sounds like.
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:28.940]   Well, they were exploiting the way URLs worked in the system.
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:29.820]   So to all you are-
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:32.180]   Well, URLs should automatically launch ever.
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:33.180]   No.
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:34.180]   Ever.
[01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:35.180]   Yes.
[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:37.180]   In many, many ways.
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:39.380]   In fact, I'm surprised that that-
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:43.620]   Well, I mean, Chrome does that on iOS.
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:44.780]   I don't know.
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:46.500]   I want this feature everywhere.
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.340]   I think that was a bug in Safari.
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:49.340]   I don't think-
[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:52.660]   It might have been, but also, you start giving people the ability to launch pop-ups and
[01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:53.660]   they start embedding URLs and that.
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:56.340]   I mean, there's a lot of ways that you can game systems.
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:57.340]   Yeah.
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:14:01.340]   App Store purchases apps in the App Store purchased tab.
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:03.580]   This is all from, by the way, from MacRumors.
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:05.460]   They're working as fast as they can.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:08.100]   They probably have 15 people going, "Hey, look!
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:11.260]   Apps in the App Store purchased tab are once again sorted by purchase date."
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:12.260]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:16.740]   Quick type keyboard now available on the iPad, brightness, toggle, message.
[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:18.260]   All this is, you know, little do-
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:19.740]   Is it more stable?
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:20.740]   That's the question.
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:23.860]   I guess you really won't know that until you use it for a while.
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:26.220]   Was beta one kind of rocky?
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:27.220]   Stay away.
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:28.220]   Stay away.
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:30.340]   Well, iOS 7, as much as people complained, it was-
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:31.340]   Most of it was a paint job.
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:32.340]   It was a new design.
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:34.180]   Things worked very similarly.
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:37.420]   Now with extensibility and with all the other features, the underlying stuff has changed
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:40.220]   a lot and apps had very unpredictable behavior.
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:43.220]   A lot of your favorite apps might not have worked the way you wanted them to.
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:47.060]   And I don't ever think it's a classic of complaining about bugs for a beta.
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:48.060]   That's how it is.
[01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:51.300]   But when they say, "Don't put beta software on your primary phone," they really don't
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:52.300]   mean that to stop.
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:53.300]   Yeah.
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:54.300]   How about this one?
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:59.780]   This, I think, is interesting, but maybe you all have heard of this before.
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:04.340]   There is a new home data section within the privacy settings.
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:07.100]   Applications that have requested access to home data.
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:09.100]   Is that the home automation stuff?
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:11.140]   Yeah, home kit.
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:12.140]   Interesting.
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:13.140]   That's interesting.
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:16.740]   So it sounds like, much like HealthKit, there'd be a repository of-
[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:19.580]   And you can decide what you're sharing data with.
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:22.740]   Well, this Hue app wants to affect my Hue lights.
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:23.740]   Much like you have-
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:24.740]   Can they do that?
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:29.140]   Much like, do these have the apps have access to your cellular or that type of thing?
[01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:31.980]   You're buzz-saw-ed like access to your cell.
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:32.980]   Let's not do that.
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:36.500]   I have, by the way, and I didn't get around to doing it, 'cause I was supposed to do it
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:40.940]   for before you by today, a robotic lawn mower sitting on my lawn right now.
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:41.940]   There's a whole lot of-
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:45.020]   That seems dangerous.
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:46.340]   That seems like a bad idea.
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:51.380]   You know, we used to, when I was a kid, they had a field in the back that they would cut
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.380]   with the whirly.
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:54.380]   And the whirly is this big thing that you put in the back-
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:55.740]   It's like basically a grain reaper.
[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:58.940]   And we all had to go inside when the whirly was running because it would throw through
[01:15:58.940 --> 01:15:59.940]   rocks-
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:01.860]   A good, a solid 200 meters.
[01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:05.980]   And if you go anywhere near the whirly, look at whatever body part is extended.
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:06.980]   It was pretty good.
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:08.300]   You'd be amazed at what you could do with your brush.
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:09.300]   That's all insane.
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:10.300]   With what?
[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:11.300]   You'd go through brush.
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.780]   You know, I thought you meant like hairbrush.
[01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:14.420]   Were you throwing objects at the whirly?
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:15.420]   No, no, no, no.
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:16.420]   You'd be going through the whirly.
[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:19.420]   You'd hit a brush with small animals, all kinds of other stuff.
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:20.900]   That was it.
[01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:21.900]   What is-
[01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:22.900]   Okay, so now what is new?
[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:27.140]   Ben asks in Yosemite beta 2, and I guess too early to really talk about that too.
[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:28.660]   To play with it a bit.
[01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:29.740]   I'm sure the internet is filled with it.
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:32.180]   But again, the problem I'm having is that people are announcing things that aren't new
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:34.020]   as new, so it's hard to sift through.
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.300]   You know, give us some time.
[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:37.300]   Just give us some time.
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:38.300]   Next going to space.
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:39.300]   Yeah, and also-
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:40.300]   Photo booth is back.
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:41.300]   If you were worried about photo booth is back.
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:42.300]   Oh, hallelujah.
[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:44.780]   They'd be crazy to take photo booth out.
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:48.580]   That is the one thing that everybody, when they're demoing a Mac, immediately launches.
[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:51.180]   Look at this.
[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:58.020]   From Nathan Houston, Texas, would you recommend Swift as a first language for an aspiring programmer?
[01:16:58.020 --> 01:16:59.020]   No.
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.020]   No.
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:05.540]   I think if you want, if you've never programmed before, I think you start with Ruby, because
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:08.100]   it's an interactive language.
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:12.220]   There are tutorials that can actually have you typing live code and executing it as you
[01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:13.220]   go.
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:14.740]   It's simpler and you will also come up.
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:19.020]   If you once you spend two or three months learning Ruby, not only will you have a useful
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:22.780]   language under your belt, but also you will have learned about object oriented programming.
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:25.140]   You will have learned about the data structures you need to know.
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:28.980]   And you will also have learned about the idea of, I've got this task that I want to turn
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:29.980]   into a program.
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:32.900]   How do I break it that down into modules and steps?
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:33.900]   Ruby or Python, I think.
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.900]   All about machine languages.
[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.380]   It's all about machine languages.
[01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:37.380]   Yeah.
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:38.740]   You know, assembly is not hard to learn.
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:42.260]   And it does teach you how to compute a lot about structure.
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.260]   Get eight toggle switches.
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:47.780]   Hook them up by USB and just click, click, click, click, send.
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:49.780]   Click, click, click, click, send.
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:50.780]   Swift is-
[01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:55.100]   The reason people think that, and we talked about it, of course, is this wonderful playground
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:59.860]   feature, which is really an advanced debugger that lets you kind of scroll through your
[01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:03.180]   program, find a point, change a variable, see the result.
[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:05.420]   And especially for graphical programming, that's great.
[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:06.420]   It certainly would be good.
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:10.460]   My reason for not recommending it is it's not cross-platform.
[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:15.300]   Well, it's beta, which means it's stuff's going to change as Ed Bot pointed out.
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.500]   It's not a finished spec, but also it's not cross-platform.
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:23.700]   And to me, if you want to really start to learn programming, you should learn on something
[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:26.980]   that is going to work everywhere in a similar way.
[01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:27.980]   And I really like the-
[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:28.980]   It's mature.
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:29.980]   You're right, Andy.
[01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:32.540]   The advantage of the playground is really the feedback loop because-
[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:33.540]   That's awesome.
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:38.180]   Because in what I do, you know, a lot of times with 3D, everything is about the-
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:39.180]   How many iterations?
[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:42.260]   How many times do you get to see what you did over and over and over again?
[01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:45.420]   And it really changes the way you look at every variable because you really have enough
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:50.420]   iterations, enough samples to really build a picture.
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:52.780]   Right.
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:55.020]   Anthony Perry, will we see a refreshed iMac?
[01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:56.460]   New design?
[01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:57.460]   Some day?
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:58.460]   Yes.
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:18:59.460]   Tomorrow?
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:00.460]   No.
[01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:04.260]   We had a major redesign just last year, and Apple doesn't care enough about-
[01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:06.940]   Apple doesn't think the iMac is important enough to fresh it every single year, like
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:07.940]   an iPhone or an iPad.
[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:08.940]   Right.
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:11.460]   So I think it's going to be at least a year till we see a real new iMac.
[01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:12.460]   Same question for the Mac mini.
[01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:13.460]   They get a speed.
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:14.460]   Dale in Seattle.
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:15.460]   Is the Mac mini dead?
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:16.460]   No.
[01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:17.460]   No.
[01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:21.100]   You will see a speed bump and maybe a price drop for the iMac though, and the i-
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:22.740]   The Mac mini will go to Haswell.
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:26.340]   We can do both of those with that announcement until they bring those chips by just changing
[01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:27.340]   the store.
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:28.340]   Right.
[01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:29.340]   Yeah.
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:30.340]   Apple.
[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:32.580]   I'm keen to see if Apple's going to bother to redesign the case though, or rather if
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:36.220]   they're just going to maintain it as a look, what can we do with a square box with rounded
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:37.220]   edges?
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:38.500]   People are not buying this as a sexy product.
[01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:42.620]   They're hiding in colossus anyway, but we'll definitely maintain it with new hardware.
[01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:44.860]   If Leo would just buy one, the rest of us could have the new iMac.
[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:46.460]   I am so happy with the Mac Pro.
[01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:48.260]   I'm not buying anything.
[01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:49.940]   Love it with the 4K display.
[01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:51.500]   That's why we don't have the new iMac.
[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.500]   That's it.
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:56.540]   How about an Apple TV, a new Apple TV set top box?
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:57.540]   Yep.
[01:19:57.540 --> 01:19:58.540]   Absolutely.
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:19:59.540]   Absolutely.
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:00.540]   Someday.
[01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:01.540]   Absolutely this year.
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:02.540]   Soon.
[01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:03.540]   Soon.
[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:04.540]   Fall.
[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:09.780]   Last question from Mr. Joshua Kirtelene Idaho.
[01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:12.140]   Andy, we appreciated your pieces on Android last year.
[01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:17.900]   Does the new direction of philosophy for Apple mean that you might be switching back
[01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:21.700]   to iPhone in the fall?
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:22.700]   More than might.
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:28.500]   I think that if Apple produces a large screen iPhone, it's like I said, really right after
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:32.820]   the keynote, I will be almost out of reasons to keep on using Android.
[01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:36.980]   There's still some things that Android does that I think are egg better exceptional, that
[01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:39.100]   I haven't seen in iOS 8.
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:45.100]   Really, in terms of a phone that lets me customize it, that has apps that work together, that
[01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:51.220]   has a screen that's flexible for movie viewing and reading stuff for long term, it really
[01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:56.180]   is as though they took that series of articles I wrote last year, put it on a whiteboard
[01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:58.420]   and said, okay, that's our goal for iOS 8.
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:20:59.420]   Get this one user back.
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:01.420]   Because that's what they did, of course.
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:02.420]   It's not going to be five inches.
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:03.420]   We won his $200.
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:04.420]   It's not going to be five and a half.
[01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:05.420]   It's not going to be six inches.
[01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:07.060]   It's going to be 4.7, right?
[01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:08.620]   4.7 and 5.5.
[01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:10.180]   And 5.5.
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:11.620]   If they can get the panels in time, you know.
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:13.420]   It'd be really interesting something that big.
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:14.420]   Which way do you go for Andy?
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:15.500]   4.7 or 5.5?
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:18.500]   I'd have to feel them both.
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:21.300]   4.7, I think, is a current real sweet spot.
[01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:22.300]   Me too.
[01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:25.740]   The current iPhone 5 screen, it really does seem too small.
[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:30.660]   But if 5.5, depending on how it feels in my hand, I'm not the sort of...
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:33.380]   I don't wear it on my wrist.
[01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:37.940]   I don't care a little makeup purse so I can have something that's...
[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:42.380]   As long as it fits in a shirt pocket and without a good chance of tumbling out or tearing
[01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:44.820]   my sleeve, I think that would go for the larger one.
[01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:48.020]   I really like this is the Moto X, which is the...
[01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:50.620]   To me, this is the phone you've got to beat.
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:51.860]   And that's 4.7.
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:54.140]   It just fits the hand naturally.
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:55.140]   Feels like...
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:57.780]   Yeah, and this is the Nexus 5 and it's a little bit larger than that.
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:59.780]   It's still too big.
[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:02.020]   I don't know.
[01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:03.740]   There are a lot of 4.7 and 5.
[01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:08.720]   I like the 5 inch screen, maybe because a lot of what I use my phone for is it sits there
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:11.700]   in my dashboard on my car.
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:15.220]   And I don't need a center console TV screen to do it.
[01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:19.780]   And this is a nice display that doesn't require me to be going like...
[01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:21.780]   It's a funny thing.
[01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:23.060]   Here's an iPhone 5.
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:26.100]   This is Alex's iPhone 5 S.
[01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:27.580]   Is that a 5S?
[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:28.580]   Yeah.
[01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:29.580]   No, it's a 5.
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:30.580]   Okay.
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:34.420]   Compared to the 4.7, you see it's not so much bigger than the Moto X, but just a little
[01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:35.420]   scooch.
[01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:39.940]   To go after your points, I think people forget like this is the Nexus 5 and the Lumia 1020.
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:40.940]   And the Lumia...
[01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:44.220]   They have the same screen size, but the Lumia 1020 feels much bigger and way heavier in
[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:45.220]   my hand.
[01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:48.940]   And it's amazing how the entire package influences not just the screen size.
[01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:49.940]   And I find...
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:50.940]   There's a lot of things...
[01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:54.260]   I have an HTC One, which I like.
[01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:55.260]   But for...
[01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:57.260]   There's a lot of things like working out and doing other things that I don't...
[01:22:57.260 --> 01:22:58.260]   It's too big.
[01:22:58.260 --> 01:22:59.260]   Yeah, the new one is 5.
[01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:00.260]   It's a nice...
[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:01.260]   The new...
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:02.260]   They have that new little one or whatever.
[01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:03.260]   Oh, you have the mini.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:04.260]   No, I have the big one.
[01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:05.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:06.260]   No, the HTC, the M8.
[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:07.260]   Yep, the M8.
[01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:08.260]   That's what I normally would have carried.
[01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:09.260]   I think that's 5.
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:10.260]   Yeah, but it's just...
[01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:12.020]   Like, it's too much for a lot of things that I do.
[01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:13.740]   Thank you for your questions, everyone.
[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:18.340]   We have our picks of the week coming up in just a little bit.
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:19.340]   But first a word...
[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:23.180]   You know, we talk about Shutterstock a lot and they have a new product.
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:27.220]   A new brand called Offset that I think is really cool.
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:37.300]   I want you to visit offset.com/welcome/macbreak because you get a little welcome.
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:38.300]   What is it?
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:39.300]   Well, it's the same idea as Shutterstock.
[01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:43.900]   It is royalty-free photos and illustrations.
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:48.340]   But this is top quality editorial and commercial artists.
[01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:56.140]   So what you're getting is very high quality images from people whose work is featured

[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:03.700]   campaigns.
[01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:04.820]   This is stuff suitable for framing.
[01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:11.700]   If you're looking for editorial photography, editorial illustrations that are super high
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:18.980]   quality, Offset is the place to go award-winning artists, authentic imagery, all royalty-free.

[01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:20.980]   Is that iguazu?
[01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:22.380]   I think that's iguazu falls.
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:23.740]   Gorgeous stuff.
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:24.740]   This is all new too.
[01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:28.060]   This is not stuff you've seen before on Shutterstock.

[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:00.100]   for prints.

[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:16.060]   That's Miriam Bleeker, who's a really amazing photographer.
[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:19.460]   Her work has appeared in Conde Nast Traveler Alonley Planet.
[01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:22.780]   She's one of those world traveler types.
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:26.460]   She lives in Amsterdam, but she'll find images from Miriam all over the world.
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:27.460]   Great.
[01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:28.460]   Look at this stuff.
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:32.060]   So it's a new brand from Shutterstock and one I think you're going to like a lot.
[01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:34.660]   Offset.com/welcome/macbreak.
[01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:37.060]   We thank them for their support of Mac Break Weekly.

[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:48.420]   Andy and Aco, your pick of the week.
[01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:49.940]   This is an unusual pick for me.
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:53.180]   Usually I pick something that I have used and tested and really recommend.
[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:56.540]   This time I'm recommending something that I hope a friend of mine buys so that I can
[01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:58.220]   actually play with it and see it work.
[01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:00.500]   It sounds like the coolest thing ever.
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:03.420]   It's called the mellow sous vide cooker.
[01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:06.180]   Oh, I guess I know who will buy that.
[01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:10.180]   Hey, Mr. sous vide is it nice to me.
[01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:11.180]   It's pretty cool.
[01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:12.180]   You know what a sous vide cooker is?
[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:16.780]   It's an immersion cooker where there's a heater and a pump in a vessel of water.
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:20.140]   You put the food in a bag and it circulates heated water around it.
[01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:24.860]   So it cooks chicken for like nine hours, but brings it to a cook set at a safe lower temperature.
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:26.340]   So it's all moist and delicious.
[01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:30.380]   And basically, if you have a friend who has one of these sous vide cookers, it's like having
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:31.700]   a friend with a Tesla.
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:35.140]   Every conversation goes around to, "Oh, well, last week I decided to sous vide, decided
[01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:36.140]   to beef."
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:39.980]   It took about 1100 hours and I had some chives in there.
[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:40.980]   You know, I just...
[01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:41.940]   It's a little bit different.
[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:46.420]   So this is like a crock pot/sous vide.
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:48.220]   It's beautiful.
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:51.380]   What it is is it not only doesn't have a heater and a circular...
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:52.380]   That's the other...
[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:56.300]   It also has a chiller in it so that what you can do is you can basically...
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:27:01.580]   Prepare your food, put them in the bags, put it in the water and then leave for work.
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:08.100]   And the cooker will basically keep that food at the raw materials at refrigerated temperature
[01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:10.500]   until you've told it that I want to...
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:15.660]   This is a chicken breast with vegetables I want to eat at 6 p.m.
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:21.300]   So it will keep it refrigerated in the water all day long until it's time to start at cooking.
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:24.700]   And so if you tell it that you want dinner to be ready at 6, dinner will be ready at
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:28.260]   6 p.m. and we'll start the cooking process at the right time so that the food will be
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:29.980]   cooked and ready to eat at 6 p.m.
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:33.140]   The key with sous vide is very low temperature, very slow.
[01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:35.060]   It's not a very low temperature.
[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:36.300]   Alex does this all the time.
[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:39.900]   Yeah, I've learned that it doesn't only people if I talk about it all the time so I've slowed
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:40.900]   down.
[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:44.620]   But a lot of the sous vide cookers we've talked about before are like things you put in a
[01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:46.700]   pot and stuff like that.
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:47.700]   I have one that's...
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:48.700]   This is an all-in-one unit.
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:50.300]   It looks like kind of like a water...
[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:52.020]   It's much prettier than mine.
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:54.300]   It's also controllable by the iPhone.
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:55.620]   Well that is the big.
[01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:57.340]   Like being able to tell at what time you want it to be ready.
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:27:58.340]   And refrigeration.
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:27:59.340]   I know.
[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:00.340]   Yeah, the...
[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:01.340]   How much is this?
[01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:02.980]   Wait a minute, I get it.
[01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:03.980]   Okay.
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:05.220]   Retail price is 500.
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:07.020]   If you pre-order it, it's 400.
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:08.020]   That's not bad.
[01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:09.020]   It's not the one I bought.
[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:10.020]   That's not bad.
[01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:11.900]   But it's controlled by an iPhone.
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:12.900]   This was available when I bought mine.
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:13.900]   I would have...
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:14.900]   I'm ordering it right now.
[01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:15.900]   I'm not ordering it right now.
[01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:16.900]   Me too.
[01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:17.900]   It's like...
[01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:18.900]   I'm all secret of course.
[01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:19.900]   I was going to get another one anyway because...
[01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:24.980]   So when you have a party, you have one set of meat at one temperature and then you want
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:26.500]   to have another set of meat at another temperature.
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:29.820]   So I was already ready to invest in more sous-vids.
[01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:30.820]   At least...
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:35.620]   Yeah, see this, but for me it's different because there's a reason why I keep frozen
[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:37.140]   dinners in the freezer.
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:41.180]   I try not to eat frozen dinners like a link-whizzines every single night.
[01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:45.820]   But the day goes in such a way where you're just working, working, working and you realize,
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:48.420]   "Oh wait, it's eight o'clock and I haven't had dinner yet."
[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:50.660]   I don't want to then spend an hour cooking.
[01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:55.620]   I just want to go downstairs where someone has prepared me a dinner and I can have it
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:57.140]   in three minutes.
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:29:01.620]   And if I had one of these, I feel as though before I start working for the day, I could
[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:06.740]   just dump whatever I want to have for dinner in seven hours in there and just simply wait
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:12.100]   for a voice to come from my phone that is similar to my mom's voice saying, "Andy, dinner!
[01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:14.300]   Sous-vids ready!"
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:19.580]   That looks beautiful.
[01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:23.460]   I want that experience from when I was a kid where I could just do whatever I want and
[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:26.020]   just be told that dinner is ready.
[01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:27.020]   This is very intriguing.
[01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:28.020]   The only sous-vide bacon.
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:32.420]   And I got to say, as soon as you start sous-videing your eggs, they show an egg there.
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:33.420]   Soft oil.
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:37.260]   When you do soft oil, it is so good.
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:38.260]   I closed it.
[01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:39.260]   It's so good.
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.260]   It's so old.
[01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:41.260]   It's old.
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:45.500]   These little cock-toe glasses that I brought to your 4th of July.
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:46.500]   I love those.
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:49.340]   I use those and then I take the little soft oil thing and I pop it in there and I pull
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:50.340]   a salt on it.
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:51.340]   That's very good.
[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:55.060]   And then sometimes if you're making meat or fish, you would maybe grill it real quickly
[01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:56.460]   just to give it a little crust.
[01:29:56.460 --> 01:30:02.140]   At the very end, I'll usually use my big green egg and get it up to sear it on the outside
[01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:03.140]   with...
[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:04.140]   Yeah.
[01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:05.140]   Okay.
[01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:09.100]   Rich Siegel is the one of a bare-bones software.
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:11.060]   He's the one who told me about mellow.
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:15.940]   At the end of a conversation, he was excited about this kickstarter product for exec what
[01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:16.940]   you're talking about.
[01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:22.340]   It is essentially a blowtorch designed to do nuts just to sear things.
[01:30:22.340 --> 01:30:26.700]   You know, I found just the demo video where they're just the big butane torch and they're
[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:31.060]   essentially painting a caramelized crust onto this steak.
[01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:36.180]   Once you go down this road of buying expensive kitchen gadgets, it really never ends.
[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:40.980]   Yesterday, it got a lot of tweeting out his rocket pizza oven, which cooks an entire pizza
[01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:41.980]   in like 45 seconds.
[01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:44.140]   There's no limit.
[01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:46.780]   Just there really is no limit to what you might do.
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:49.780]   Well, now I've pre-ordered it and I'm going to blame you Andy.
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:50.780]   Me too.
[01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:51.780]   There you go.
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:52.780]   You too?
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:53.780]   Two feet partly.
[01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:54.780]   Two feet partly.
[01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:55.780]   I tricked his work.
[01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:56.780]   I worked.
[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:58.980]   I now have a friend who definitely has one of those things coming in and tell me about how
[01:30:58.980 --> 01:30:59.980]   well it works.
[01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:02.660]   Seems like 400 is not horrible.
[01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:09.420]   I like the idea that refrigerates because then it's safe to leave your meat in there.
[01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:13.420]   And then it will jag's Leo waking up to soft boiled eggs.
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:16.020]   Are they really bad version if you did them in a little pot with boil.
[01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:17.420]   I just said you don't have to think about it.
[01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:20.060]   So what happens with the eggs is I just throw them in and then I go back to whatever I was
[01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:21.060]   doing.
[01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:23.260]   Then I come back like 15 minutes later or 20 minutes later and they're perfect every time.
[01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:25.140]   What about the chemicals in the plastic in the back?
[01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:27.900]   Because you're putting it in a sealed vacuum sealed bag, right?
[01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:28.900]   Yeah.
[01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:29.900]   Isn't that bad?
[01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:31.860]   Isn't it like these are going to leech BPH out of there or something?
[01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:35.020]   No, technically they say it's not BPH, but there's lots of things in plastic.
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:36.580]   We eat so much stuff that's in plastic.
[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:37.580]   I'm not sure if it makes any difference.
[01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:39.380]   I just don't know if I want to add more plastic to my.
[01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:42.060]   I just don't think I'm adding a significant amount of plastic.
[01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:43.620]   I have plastic in my eyes every morning.
[01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:44.900]   Look, we're all going to get cancer.
[01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:45.900]   It's just a matter of when.
[01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:46.900]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:47.900]   We're all going to die somehow.
[01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:52.140]   You may as well enjoy a nice soft boiled egg before you get cancer and die.
[01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:54.340]   I just wish you could soviet the bacon to go with it.
[01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:55.340]   Why don't put the egg in?
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:56.340]   I used to eat bacon.
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:57.340]   I don't think it would work.
[01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:01.380]   I think it would be very good when Chris Bob, right?
[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:02.380]   Yeah.
[01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:03.380]   Tragedy.
[01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:05.820]   All right.
[01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:06.820]   Thank you.
[01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:08.500]   Thank you, Andy, for spending my money.
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:09.500]   Apparently, Renee's as well.
[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:10.500]   Yes.
[01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:11.500]   See, look, there it is.
[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:12.500]   Hold on.
[01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:14.780]   Renee, would you like us to spend money on?
[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:18.060]   So I have a pick and an anti-pick, which is the only thing I can term it.
[01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:21.860]   So my pick of the week is Launch Center Pro, which is one of my favorite iOS apps.
[01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:23.460]   It's now available for the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:24.620]   Got a big update.
[01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:28.860]   And one of the primary things in this update is if it supports, so if this then that.
[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:29.860]   Oh, nice.
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:35.340]   This is basically an action launcher because in the days before extensibility, there was
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:38.860]   no way to do internet communications and they did a lot of really smart things with
[01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:42.660]   URL schemes and ex-callback URLs.
[01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:44.820]   And they're adapting for the future of extensibility.
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:49.060]   But in the meantime, you can use this now to trigger all sorts of really, really clever
[01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:50.740]   procedures you have stored on if it.
[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:55.620]   And if you are a high order bit geek, then that is an incredibly attractive proposition
[01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:56.620]   for you.
[01:32:56.620 --> 01:32:58.660]   So it's not a brand new app, but it is a brand new update.
[01:32:58.660 --> 01:32:59.980]   It's free to everyone already has it.
[01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:02.140]   And if you don't have it, you can get it for iPhone and iPad.
[01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:03.140]   Awesome stuff.
[01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:04.140]   Really productive.
[01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:08.180]   Anti-pick is this thing called Slingshot, which Facebook introduced right before the show that
[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:09.580]   I spent a few minutes looking at.
[01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:10.580]   Oh, it came out.
[01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:13.140]   Yeah, it is snap is basically Snapchat.
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:16.740]   But if Leo sends me a picture, I have to send back a picture to Leo before I can look
[01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:20.940]   at the picture Leo stupid, which sounds like the worst possible app I can imagine.
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:25.940]   Why is Facebook having so much trouble that they created poke to duplicate Snapchat, right?
[01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:27.540]   Or no, yeah, they did.
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:29.820]   I mean, they have some of the best is I mean, they have Mike Mattis.
[01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:32.140]   He did the photo app and the camera app on the original iPhone.
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:33.780]   He did, you know, delicious library.
[01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:34.780]   He's creating paper.
[01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:36.380]   He didn't do this app, but I don't understand.
[01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:40.220]   It's like Facebook figures out what apps we don't want and then rushes them through
[01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:41.220]   the pipeline.
[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:42.220]   They're just brilliant.
[01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:46.660]   And in fact, they've done the same thing with the news feed where it's just like crap
[01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:47.660]   now.
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:48.660]   Okay.
[01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:49.660]   Well, thank you.
[01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:50.660]   Don't buy Slingshot.
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:51.660]   Oh, it's free.
[01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:53.780]   I'm sure it's free, but it takes her sanity.
[01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:56.260]   It costs you your sanity.
[01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:58.980]   Your attention is not free, my friend.
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:00.300]   Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:02.020]   What do you got?
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:03.860]   I don't think I've recommended this before.
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:07.340]   People keep on asking about it because they've seen me talk about it a little bit.
[01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:10.220]   So this is what I travel with.
[01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:12.260]   So my recommendation is for the Seagate.
[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:13.940]   This is the Thunderbolt adapter.
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:14.940]   Yes.
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:16.860]   This thing is awesome.
[01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:18.540]   All right.
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:20.340]   So is it Thunderbolt one or two?
[01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:21.340]   Thunderbolt one.
[01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:22.340]   Yeah.
[01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:23.340]   Okay.
[01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:25.180]   What it's designed for is Seagate makes these little drives that you put onto it.
[01:34:25.180 --> 01:34:26.180]   I don't know.
[01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:30.100]   They're completely useless as far as I'm concerned, but the adapter by itself is like a hundred
[01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:31.100]   bucks.
[01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:34.660]   So as you take this, see this little SSD.
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:36.780]   Now because it's all it is is a SATA connection.
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:38.940]   So it doesn't really matter what it is.
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:44.500]   You take this SSD, any SSD, and then you slide it on.
[01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:54.460]   And now you have a whatever size your SSD is 120, 256, 480, whatever gigabyte hard drive.
[01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:58.140]   Now what I do is it doesn't fit perfectly because it had a hard drive.
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:04.300]   So I take old hotel car, hotel keys, which I have a lot of and I and I have and I tape
[01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:05.300]   them.
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:08.300]   So right here, a little little pad to figure out something to do with all those hotel
[01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:09.300]   keys.
[01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:12.260]   It turns out they're great little, they're great as shims.
[01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:14.740]   So anyway, so then then you, then you pop it on.
[01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:18.260]   Now if you're going to leave it on, a lot of times I tape, you know, I just put a little
[01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:22.820]   gaff tape on the outside here and then I name it whatever I want.
[01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:27.740]   And the big thing is, is that is it does get a little extra attention by TSA.
[01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:30.420]   I will admit, taped things that look technology and tape.
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:31.940]   Yeah, it looks like a bomb.
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:35.980]   But anyway, but, but the cool thing is, is that now you have, you hook up to your thunderbolt
[01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:42.820]   and you transfer an entire 256 gig drive to another 256 gig drive in like eight minutes.
[01:35:42.820 --> 01:35:46.820]   You know, so it's, it's the super fast way to back up stuff, download it most importantly
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:50.940]   for me because I travel a lot is most of the places that I, that I work, I can at least
[01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:53.380]   find someone that sells SSDs.
[01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:57.060]   So what I do is if I, if I want to really fast, these really fast drives to edit from
[01:35:57.060 --> 01:36:00.340]   them and so on, so forth on the road, I can throw all my footage on here.
[01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:01.340]   It's really, really fast.
[01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:05.980]   And when it fills up, I just go to a, you know, to a store and I buy another SSD and
[01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:10.660]   I slide this one out and I put another one in and it's just the cheapest, fastest way
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:15.660]   to have a really fast solution that's in your backpack that, that you can edit on the
[01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:21.020]   road and do all kinds of things that normally would require a lot of local hard drive space.
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:23.740]   And so I use it to kind of swap SSDs all the time.
[01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:26.980]   And now all you need is a computer that can use Thunderbolt.
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:29.980]   Yes, which is all my computer is just under both.
[01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:35.580]   So anyway, so, so the, but the, the, I will say one thing about that is that most of these,
[01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:44.780]   I'm told by relatively good sources, John Tatoly's, it's sound devices that these, that these
[01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:49.100]   SSDs are only rated for about 150 insertions.
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:52.140]   You know, so, you know, they're not really built to do what I'm doing.
[01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:55.700]   So I don't, other than what I'm showing you on TV, which I'm shorting, it's life, I'm sure
[01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:58.940]   right now is I, it's not like I pull these out and put them on all the time.
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:02.380]   I really tape them up and use them and then, and then when I need to, I pop them out.
[01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:06.140]   But, you know, even then I think they would last as long as a spinning drive would last
[01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:06.660]   with me anyway.
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:10.540]   So anyway, that's just the, the one disclaimer at the end of that, but it is just like a
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:12.780]   physical limitation of the connectors.
[01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:14.700]   Connectors just aren't really built for that.
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:17.620]   They're not, you know, these, these connectors here just aren't really, you know, they're not
[01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:18.940]   really built to be slid in and out.
[01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:20.860]   They were designed to be inserted and left.
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:24.380]   So anyway, that's the, that is it.
[01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:28.820]   But anyway, it's a, it's a useful, hopefully that people, someone finds that useful.
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:32.220]   Did I mention a reader to recently?
[01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:34.460]   I think I mentioned it last week, but I don't know if I showed it.
[01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:38.260]   Reader R, double E D E R for the Macintosh.
[01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:42.820]   It's the, it's a really good feed reader and version two just came out.
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:43.260]   And I'm not sure.
[01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:45.220]   I think it's five bucks, 10 bucks.
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:50.580]   But if you still, and I will not let RSS die, if you're still looking for a
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:55.580]   great RSS reader, the good news is thank you feedly for keeping a Google reader alive.
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:59.340]   Because I attached my Google reader account to Feedly, I can now easily log in.
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:01.620]   Let's look at Apple stories.
[01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:03.340]   I can scan through stories very quickly.
[01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:08.900]   It has nice sharing capabilities, you know, that support all of the kind of different sharing
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:09.940]   services you might use.
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:15.580]   I use pinboard, but delicious Twitter, Facebook, mail link, message, a link, copy a link and
[01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:16.900]   put it in some other application.
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:23.220]   It is, it is, thank God, there is still a good RSS reader out there.
[01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:27.140]   You can add a feed bin, feed Wrangler, fever account.
[01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:33.140]   You can connect it to your pocket or readability, those different services.
[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:37.820]   It's, you can add them on, you know, any of these services, quite a few services to it.
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:38.940]   I just like it.
[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:42.420]   R E E D E R two came out.
[01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:44.500]   R E D E R two.
[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:45.380]   You've played with it, right?
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:47.620]   Renee, I think we talked about it last week.
[01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:53.620]   Yeah, last week, Renee brought up unread and that was for iOS and I love unread for iOS.
[01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:53.860]   Right.
[01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:54.700]   And you brought up.
[01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:56.540]   And I mentioned reader, but I didn't show it to you.
[01:38:56.540 --> 01:38:57.100]   Here it is.
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:58.700]   If you want to, you know, take a look.
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:02.700]   I, I, I have been using it pretty much nonstop to prepare for shows now.
[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:04.540]   And it's a, it's a really great reader.
[01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:07.540]   And you can also subscribe to podcasts and if you should choose.
[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:11.140]   One of the nice things about RSS is in the new in iOS eight.
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:15.100]   And I think in Yosemite, two apples, they killed a RSS reader in
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:17.180]   Safari a while ago, but they've now brought it back.
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:17.660]   You started.
[01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:19.660]   Yeah, they brought it back a version of it.
[01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:20.580]   That's actually really clever.
[01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:21.620]   What does that mean?
[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:22.820]   Is that that I don't?
[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:25.940]   It's, I think it's encouraging, but I'm not sure why they.
[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:28.740]   Decided to do that.
[01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:30.820]   Why did they killed it or why they brought it back?
[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:31.580]   I understand why they killed it.
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:32.620]   Everybody's killing RSS.
[01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:33.580]   RSS is dead, right?
[01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:37.420]   I think because the framework that they created that lets you do those, those
[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:41.100]   those basically the read later stuff inside Safari is a better mechanism for it
[01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:44.820]   than the original RSS tabs were because now you can put it sort of in your
[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:45.500]   reading lesson.
[01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:47.620]   It's sort of a really good mental fit for that model.
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:48.780]   I agree with that.
[01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:53.100]   The basically, as far as used to be an RSS reader, now you just use the RSS
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:54.820]   feeds to save stuff to your read it later.
[01:39:54.820 --> 01:39:57.260]   And I have to admit, flip board really kind of.
[01:39:57.260 --> 01:39:59.260]   Flip board Twitter.
[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:00.700]   A lot of things are replaced RSS.
[01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:01.940]   But you're more than anything else.
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:05.300]   But see what so this is the difference in this is the use case.
[01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:08.780]   So I have my Apple section here and I've added all actually I have to update this,
[01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:10.900]   but I've added all the different sources Apple and Sutter.
[01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:13.460]   I was technical, Max Center, I more.com.
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:15.620]   You know, nine to five, all of them.
[01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:18.860]   And then I go to the Apple stories and these are the unread stories and I can
[01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:22.180]   so quickly scan through those stories.
[01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:24.700]   If I want to get the full story, I just click the link.
[01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:27.540]   It's got a built in browser so I could see the link and then I can share it
[01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:27.940]   very easily.
[01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:31.740]   So my, you know, this, this fits what I do, which is go through a lot of news
[01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:33.980]   sources, triage, triage, trying to find stuff.
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:38.580]   But if you have an area of interest, you create a folder with the 10 websites
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:39.180]   that you log.
[01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:41.820]   And I mean, I spent that's just a different use.
[01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:44.940]   This is how I researched shows for years.
[01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:48.140]   Yeah, at least it's a little more, you know, kind of random.
[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:48.620]   It's fun.
[01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:49.940]   It's a lot, but we're just a parameter.
[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:53.620]   Specific people's needs, you know, I think that that, you know, or specific
[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:56.140]   groups, Mac news or that type of thing.
[01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:58.220]   I think you get you don't have as much control.
[01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:00.260]   I will say you don't have quite the same flow.
[01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:01.380]   It's more comfortable.
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:02.260]   It's more like reading.
[01:41:02.260 --> 01:41:02.820]   It's easier.
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:04.500]   It's easier to do while I'm standing in the airport.
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:05.660]   But it's not a power tool.
[01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:06.340]   This is a part.
[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:06.500]   Yeah.
[01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:11.460]   I like the ability to target a specific news source, which is something
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:12.660]   that Flipboard doesn't let me do.
[01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:16.580]   If I want to go to what what what what new notes has Apple posted today?
[01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:16.940]   Right.
[01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:21.100]   Have I am I up to date on that as opposed to hopefully that in the midst
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:24.180]   of every other piece of Apple news from every other blog, their
[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:25.860]   Flipboard is assembling from it.
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:29.140]   The fact that I don't happen to have seen a tech note from so from Apple
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:31.820]   that maybe that doesn't mean there's one there or does that mean that I just
[01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:32.340]   haven't seen it.
[01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:34.220]   Thank you everybody.
[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:34.940]   We're out of time.
[01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:39.180]   I want to thank you, Alex Lindsey for being in studio with us next week.
[01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:43.780]   Yes. And by the way, so Thursday, we're trying this whole final cut virtual
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:44.460]   user group.
[01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:52.980]   So it is, and I believe it's bitly slash FC VUG.
[01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:55.580]   So that's how it's dirty.
[01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:58.860]   FFC final cut virtual user group.
[01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:00.940]   So it's your self.
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:05.620]   The event page is actually on on our question system because we're going to be
[01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:06.340]   really.
[01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:11.900]   So what basically we've got great experts, of course, Stephen Mark are going to be
[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:17.780]   up here, but we're and but it is but we're going to bring a couple guys up from LA
[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:21.060]   and basically we're going to be there for people to ask questions.
[01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:25.900]   So, you know, if you have if you've got questions about final cut 10, this is a
[01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:27.620]   final cut 10 virtual user group.
[01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:31.340]   This is a, you know, this is a place for you to ask it.
[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:32.900]   And so it's an experiment.
[01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:35.740]   We'd love to have people, you know, come check it out.
[01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:36.820]   Let us know what you think of it.
[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:41.220]   The idea is a user group where instead of having you be a fly on the wall,
[01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:46.380]   watching a user group in the back from the back, you're actually, you know, it's
[01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:49.180]   it's all of us just talking and answering questions that are coming in from the
[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:50.940]   question system and so on and so forth.
[01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:53.620]   So we hope to keep on building on that.
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:58.340]   But if you're if you're interested and it's bitly, I'm sorry, it's bitly
[01:42:58.340 --> 01:43:02.940]   FFC VUG VUG dash one.
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:04.420]   Because we've done by the way.
[01:43:04.420 --> 01:43:06.140]   Yeah, you did that really quick.
[01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:07.100]   Quick silver.
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:08.820]   How do you quick silver is great for big techs?
[01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:09.180]   Yeah.
[01:43:09.180 --> 01:43:13.140]   Hey, thanks to, by the way, the questions on air creator who wrote this
[01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:15.100]   Heroku app that is fabulous.
[01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:18.020]   I assume it was Ruby because it was in a Roku, but I guess it's
[01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:20.980]   JavaScript and Node.js and your name again.
[01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:23.740]   Sad God's fun.
[01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:24.820]   Very nicely done.
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:26.620]   Andy, thank you so much for doing it.
[01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:28.220]   And we love using it.
[01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:29.140]   We really appreciate it.
[01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:31.500]   Thanks to Renee Richie.
[01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:32.500]   I'm more calm.
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:33.780]   Good to have you here.
[01:43:33.780 --> 01:43:35.860]   You can really quickly.
[01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:36.420]   Yes.
[01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:40.020]   So starting tomorrow on debug, we're going to have a multi part series.
[01:43:40.020 --> 01:43:43.140]   It might be two or three parts, but Guy English and I got a chance to sit down
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:47.900]   with Nitin Gennatra, who started Apple on DTS, then went to system seven,
[01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:51.500]   then worked on the early versions of OS 10 and then finally worked on the super
[01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:55.700]   secret iPhone project and retired as director of iOS apps at Apple.
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:56.060]   Nice.
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:58.660]   So he has some fantastic, you know, if you're a history buff, he has some
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:43:59.660]   fantastic stories.
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:02.420]   I'm more.com/debug tomorrow.
[01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:07.580]   And by the way, speaking of tomorrow, I didn't mention this, but we're going to
[01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:08.620]   find out what Amazon has.
[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:09.260]   That's up at sleep.
[01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:11.500]   We'll be doing our broadcast at 10 30 in the morning.
[01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:14.900]   Pacific time that's two 30 p.m.
[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:16.940]   Eastern time, 17 30 UTC.
[01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:19.740]   Matthew Ingram will join me, Mike Elgin.
[01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:23.220]   If any of you guys want to stop by and talk about it, that would be great.
[01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:25.420]   This phone is well, this Amazon.
[01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:28.660]   And that's what is apparently a 3D phone on AT&T.
[01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:30.780]   Whoa, we're great in Canada.
[01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:36.500]   Yeah, yeah, I think AT&T is not yet in Canada, but stay tuned there.
[01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:38.540]   They seem to be gobbling everybody else up.
[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:42.500]   And thank you so much, Andy and I go for being here from the Chicago Sun
[01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:45.500]   Times and what is the name of that province?
[01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:46.380]   Wawa noa.
[01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:47.380]   Wawa.
[01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:49.460]   I expect to find out.
[01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:53.740]   As a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, like, well, during commercial break,
[01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:57.100]   I was checking my email and I'm apparently now a semi finalist in the Amtrak
[01:44:57.100 --> 01:44:58.180]   residency program.
[01:44:58.460 --> 01:45:04.380]   So if I do get that, maybe I'll just use my my free Amtrak trip to go check that
[01:45:04.380 --> 01:45:05.740]   out and ask where my role to do.
[01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:06.500]   So what are they doing?
[01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:08.700]   They're putting writers and residents on trains.
[01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:09.460]   Is that what they're doing?
[01:45:09.460 --> 01:45:14.980]   Yeah, apparently this is I applied a couple of months ago when they tweeted this out.
[01:45:14.980 --> 01:45:18.940]   So if you're a writer, you can apply it to say, well, here's here's I'm a writer.
[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:23.220]   If I get to write Amtrak, I'll not necessarily write about the experience, but
[01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:27.540]   I'll be blogging about what I'm going to be doing and what and the projects I'm
[01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:28.380]   working on.
[01:45:28.380 --> 01:45:32.060]   So I wrote a nice little application and say, here's what I if here's here's
[01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:34.620]   a sort of trip that I would like to take and here's what I would do with it.
[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:39.540]   And and you know, if I've done exactly have Justin Bieber social media numbers,
[01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:42.860]   but apparently it's high enough to qualify for whatever they hope to do for.
[01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:46.380]   I'm a big, big fan of Amtrak and I've been blogging about and tweeting about it
[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:48.180]   like since way before Twitter and stuff like that.
[01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:51.220]   So in all seriousness, I do hope I get this because it'd be cool.
[01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:52.220]   It'd be fun to do it.
[01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:52.940]   It'd be fun.
[01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:54.300]   I've always wanted to do an overnight.
[01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:58.340]   I've always wanted to do sleeper car service on Amtrak where you have this little
[01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:01.420]   room that you can just you could be what you could be out there with people.
[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:03.620]   But then when you don't want to be with people anymore, you can just be in this
[01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:06.500]   little room and close the door and you have a bed and so it's a sleeper.
[01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:07.940]   This is not you're not going to be sitting up.
[01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:10.140]   Well, I don't I don't I don't know.
[01:46:10.140 --> 01:46:12.060]   This is this is the sort of things I was talking about that.
[01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:14.020]   This is this is the experience that I would love to do.
[01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:18.100]   I basically want to be Michael Palin, only American and not quite so distinguished
[01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:18.900]   or intelligent.
[01:46:18.900 --> 01:46:21.420]   I think it sounds marvelous, my friend.
[01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:26.460]   I'm a novelist, let me send my finalist, but do can we vote?
[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:29.860]   Can we support you by going to some site and saying yes, pick Andy?
[01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:32.060]   I'm hoping I'm hoping that will happen.
[01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:35.460]   I'll again, I was just checking my email during the during the first
[01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:37.540]   of a break and that really got my attention immediately.
[01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:40.820]   So now I have to click a link and basically say, yes, please continue to
[01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:43.020]   consider me for for this for a residency.
[01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:46.660]   But yes, but believe me, if there is a social media component, I am absolutely
[01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:50.300]   not above exploiting the the massive and influential Twitter audience to get me
[01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:53.700]   to get me into that that train ride to Manitoba or whatever.
[01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:58.420]   So we will be once again broadcasting live with Amazon's announcement, 1030
[01:46:58.420 --> 01:46:59.220]   Pacific.
[01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:03.620]   I'm sorry, that's 130 Eastern time got that wrong, 1730 UTC tomorrow.
[01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:07.420]   A little program note, if you missed marketing Mavericks this morning with
[01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:08.700]   Tonya Hall, what an interesting show.
[01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:15.060]   She had Arthur Chu, the guy who gamed Jeopardy on the subject of the show
[01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:17.740]   was building a personal brand after reality TV.
[01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:23.660]   So she's got a bunch of reality TV stars, including Arthur Chu on the show.
[01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:25.180]   This morning was really fascinating.
[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:25.940]   Highly recommended.
[01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:27.500]   Twitter TV slash mm.
[01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:30.140]   It's up now if you want to watch that.
[01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:31.380]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:34.940]   But now I must say, get back to work unless you want to stay around for a
[01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:35.500]   security now.
[01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:38.580]   But otherwise, break time is over.
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:49.820]   [Music]
