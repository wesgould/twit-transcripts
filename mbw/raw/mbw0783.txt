[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.440]   It's not complicated.

[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.680]   It's time for Macbreak Weekly, the show we cover
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.280]   the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.200]   And yes, there's a little bit of news today.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.920]   Renee Ritchie is getting brief, but Annie Anacos here
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.960]   from WGBH in Boston.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.360]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.200]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.760]   You are quickly typing out as the event spooled out.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.480]   You are quickly typing out all your notes, I hope.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.320]   Yes, I have thank you once again to Omni Outliner
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.960]   every week, my pick of the week.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.680]   Otherwise, it's like, OK, what a nice--
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.120]   BBN it is wonderful, but sometimes you need organization
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.400]   that you don't figure out until you're--
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.320]   That's a good way to do it.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.640]   I like that idea.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.760]   Alex Lindsey's also here.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.000]   We have many questions for you about cinematic mode
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.920]   and others.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.760]   Hello, Alex from full 9.0.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.400]   It's got media and officehours.global.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.520]   Good to see you.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.400]   Were you all watching in office hours?
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.040]   We were.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.880]   There was like 100 of us.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.680]   That's what I'm watching together.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.640]   Yeah, we do this kind of--
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.080]   it's a mixture of--
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.680]   everyone watches it on their own.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.000]   So they get to watch it throughout.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.600]   We don't stream it.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.480]   But then Zoom becomes the second ear.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.480]   Yeah, perfect.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.400]   And so we were able to-- and that also allowed me
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.000]   to put my-- because we're pretty certain it was in spatial.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.760]   It sounded pretty good.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.280]   Was it?
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.760]   I was wondering.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.280]   Oh, interesting.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.160]   Yeah, so I heard--
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.680]   I heard it was--
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.200]   I heard it was on.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.040]   We'll get to that.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.680]   But first--
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.920]   I've been letting him order his iPad mini,
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.600]   but now he's done, so we can introduce--
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.600]   I'm just adding more notes.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.560]   Like a sergeant.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.120]   Hello.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.480]   From iOS today and Tech News Weekly.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.840]   And of course, he was with me during the event.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.760]   Did you get it ordered?
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.280]   No, no.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.920]   I was taking more notes for the show.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.840]   Oh, you don't have to do that.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.480]   Well, we can all probably manage.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.000]   We can fully get there somehow.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.600]   He was doing what Andy was doing as we were watching the event.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.240]   He was like--
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.960]   I didn't realize it.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.400]   I went to the--
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.320]   You're going to have all the highlights?
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.760]   Yeah, very nicely done.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.680]   Well done.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.320]   [CLEARS THROAT]
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.320]   We might mention that you can order the mini now.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.800]   Yes, so the standard iPad and the mini--
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.160]   Somebody in the chat room said, I'd go over to get my mini.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.440]   I went, wait, I thought--
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.720]   so it was interesting, because not everything
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.680]   is available right away.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.280]   For instance, the new Apple Watch this sometime this fall,
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.240]   which we had heard rumors that were having trouble making
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.560]   the screen and the yields were low,
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.680]   and maybe that's the case.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.440]   The new mini-- the new iPads in general are available right now.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.400]   Everything else, the new iPhone ordering this Friday,
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.720]   the 17th for delivery on the 24th, if you move quickly.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.280]   And I was able to get the mini delivered on the 24th.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.080]   Nice.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.600]   That's a good news.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.720]   And what color did you get?
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.360]   I don't even know what starlight is,
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.800]   but that's the color I got.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.000]   That's strange, Champagne.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.320]   Champagne?
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.280]   Yeah, there's pink.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.440]   There's what they call purple, which
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.440]   really is a more lavender-y kind of shade, space gray,
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.760]   for the professionals, for professionals.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.840]   And then I don't know what starlight is, but it's not white.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.120]   It's kind of creamy.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.960]   I do love that across the board, the idea
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.440]   of adding more colors to the product lines
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.440]   seems to be an ongoing thing.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.000]   So it's the Apple's Too Cool Company of Stupka.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.600]   Then it's available in gray, and another color of gray.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.100]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.760]   No, because give us pink, give us yellow,
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.520]   give us purple, give us blue if we want them.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.920]   No keyboard announced for the new iPad mini,
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.560]   but they do have smart folios.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.480]   And it works with the second-generation Apple pencil.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.000]   Yes.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.760]   It's kind of funny.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.360]   They put the pencil next to it.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.480]   It's the same size.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.400]   No one takes over.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.400]   It's like hella.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.640]   You wonder if they designed it.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.840]   So we can't make it any smaller, because then the pencil
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.440]   will stick out.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.000]   Oh, that is.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.520]   And it's effectively eight inches.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.560]   It's the biggest mini ever because of smaller bezels.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.800]   No home button.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.680]   But it does have a fingerprint reader in the switch.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.480]   Touch ID in the sleep switch, just like the regular iPad.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.760]   There are things that I think that we're all
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.040]   kind of keeping an eye on.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.160]   One of them is, where is the line of demarcation
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.640]   between Touch ID and Face ID going to be?
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.280]   Where are they going to be?
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.160]   A couple of years ago, I was thinking,
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.080]   are they going to be trying to do away with Touch ID
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.920]   wherever they can to switch to Face ID?
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.680]   Or are they just going to see where it makes sense,
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.520]   where they can actually fit it in?
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.600]   We saw another really huge upgrade
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.600]   to their super entry level $329 iPad.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.000]   And they didn't bother to switch to that upgrade
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.800]   to that new bezel-less design.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.160]   It still has a clicky home button on it,
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.560]   which is not necessarily surprising,
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.560]   given that their goal was 3, 2, 9.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.800]   That's how much this costs.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.720]   If doing anything better will cost us 3, 3, 3.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.880]   We are not doing it because we are holding the line
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.760]   on that entry point.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.480]   Because for $329, it is--
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.800]   is one of the best bargains in even productivity computers
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.640]   that I can really think of.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.280]   And they focused on the full-size iPad, the new base-level iPad.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.080]   They focused on schools, education, which makes a lot of sense.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.480]   Very much so.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.520]   And with that, we kind of talked a little bit
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.680]   about the bezels.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.560]   And I did get to thinking, you know, those of us who--
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.040]   many of us have these bigger hands where we've
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.960]   got more stabilization when we're holding the iPad.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.320]   You don't need as much bezel.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.600]   But imagine a kid with these little hands kind of picking up
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.120]   the sides.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.880]   They've got more room to work with there.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.840]   So it makes sense.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.560]   We're keeping the bezel around in that screen.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.680]   And then also, just the idea of having a bunch of kids
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.680]   enroll and re-enroll and face ID is kind of oof.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.800]   So I could see why they're kind of keeping that--
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.920]   the standard button around.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.120]   That might be a public perception, given that they keep
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.240]   saying, hey, no, we're not Google.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.960]   We are doing all this stuff on device.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.000]   But nonetheless, it's another thing that can break.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.880]   It's another thing that they're going to have to have
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.440]   the kid talk to mom or dad say, hey,
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.920]   how come I can't get into my iPad?
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.920]   Also, I actually wonder, how does the fact that a child's
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.040]   face can change a lot over the two to three to four years
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.760]   of a device?
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.480]   I wonder how that would play into things.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.080]   I've never actually looked into that.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.720]   This has-- the iPads have the A13 bionic chip, two
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.360]   generations old.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.920]   But that's fine.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.440]   And I thought it was interesting that the Mini has the Type C
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.000]   connector.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.440]   That's what I ever got about that.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.000]   So in a way, it's kind of like halfway between a regular iPad
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.040]   and the iPad Pro.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.040]   You call it the Pro Lite?
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.920]   I think that's partly because once again, if you've got--
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.000]   if they're trying to put these into schools,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.880]   and remember the comparisons that they were making,
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.360]   they were specifically saying, hey, this is up to three times
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.240]   faster than the fastest Chromebook,
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.360]   they really have to make sure that when they're talking
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.160]   to educators that, no, you will not
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.680]   have to buy 1,000 copies of a different connector
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.000]   or a different type of recharging base or whatever.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.880]   The fact that it's still used to the old lightning port
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.680]   is going to be a feature, not a drawback.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.400]   And I think that the big challenge for school for Apple
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.160]   is just trying to somehow push back
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.040]   what Google has already kind of taken as far as that space
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.960]   goes.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.600]   In the world of the good enough is oftentimes the enemy
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.520]   of great.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.600]   The thing is that Google figured out
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.360]   what is good enough across a very large area.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.120]   And a lot of this had to do with fleet management
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.760]   that Apple didn't do very well at the very beginning.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.800]   And now it's just a more of a challenge for them
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.400]   to kind of manage.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.080]   And so the problem they really get into
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.160]   is that the Chromebooks are cripplingly bad.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.440]   My kids both have them.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.120]   They're just horrible pieces of machinery.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.080]   They would throw them into the pool if I let them.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.960]   And they just hate them.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.320]   And part of it is because they have iPads.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.160]   So they have iPads on their side and they use iPads all day
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.800]   and they use Chromebooks at school.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.000]   And that juxtaposition is what makes them hate the Chromebooks.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.960]   And I think that the problem is the Chromebooks really
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.640]   squeeze out most of the creativity that the iPad brings.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.240]   You know, the iPad lets you draw on things
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.680]   and take pictures and do all the other things
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.000]   that the Chromebooks can't do.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.160]   So I think Apple can extend that process and push that.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.320]   But it has to be to schools that are willing to not have
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.680]   as a refined management process that the teachers want.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.040]   But I should mention that the Mini has the A15 Bionic.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.280]   So the Mini is--
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.000]   I think we can safely say that the base model iPad
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.840]   is for schools and students.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.840]   And the Mini is for airline pilots.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.840]   Exactly.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.280]   And so it's very clear the distinction now.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.160]   Finally, we know who wins for.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:43.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.640]   Sorry, Andy.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.920]   I'm sorry, no, I just want to point out
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.800]   there is some good news in the competition
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.520]   between Apple and Chromebooks.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.160]   When you take a look at the numbers on the big gains
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.640]   that Chromebooks have been making overall,
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.800]   they haven't been stealing sales from the iPad.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.640]   They've been stealing sales from Windows.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.840]   So it's not as though they've been--
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.600]   that the Chromebook has been landing
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.720]   as crippling a blow against the iPad
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.760]   as anybody might want to say.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.880]   However, so that's very, very good news.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.160]   But you did-- that is a point that I made two or three times.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.600]   As I'm looking at the iPad, I'm taking notes on, OK,
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.400]   are they going to try to position this solely as, hey,
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.480]   look at this.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.720]   Here's a better version of the Amazon Fire tablet.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.200]   Here's something that's more portable.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.280]   That can give you a more cinematic experience for games,
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.400]   for movies, for stuff.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.720]   And no, they are talking really, really careful about,
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.840]   here are people like emergency flight crews that
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.120]   are using it strapped to their leg.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.960]   When they're talking about USB-C, they're saying,
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.920]   any-- I don't think I can probably scroll to in time.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:47.200]   But they're saying, oh, here, it can't get a USB-C.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.200]   And they showed a doctor using a--
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.800]   using butterfly to connect to an ultrasound reader.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.880]   So they're definitely trying to say that this is not just, hey,
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.080]   look, here's the bigger iPhone that maybe you wanted,
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:58.800]   maybe you didn't.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.120]   They're really saying, here is something
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.280]   that's a better solution for whole sectors of the marketplace.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:08.840]   I thought it was funny that I was curious when I saw the ultrasound
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.800]   connected to the iPad.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.920]   I was like, oh, I wonder how much that costs.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.240]   I couldn't find out.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.120]   I couldn't find out because that page was dead.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.440]   I was like, oh, it was like-- you know, I thought to myself,
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.840]   I'm not the only one who wanted it.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.840]   Home ultrasound.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.200]   Home ultrasound.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.480]   Let's all do it.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.400]   You can now have an ultrasound party.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.400]   Home ultrasound party.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.580]   Come on over yet.
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.080]   It's a great example.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.740]   I've been in the Fenn Chromebooks for older students.
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:33.940]   Your kids are young.
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.320]   Maybe the mini-air, the iPad is good for them.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.400]   But having a keyboard and having an actual real web experience
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.500]   and having the ability to write documents and so forth
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.820]   in a real fashion is for-- as soon as you get to fifth grade,
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.180]   you come back and tell me the Chromebook sucks.
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:48.660]   But--
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.500]   I agree for that.
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.900]   There are little kids now.
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.140]   And I think the seventh thing is great.
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.340]   But I really think that there's a reason schools use it
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.740]   beyond management.
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.100]   That it is an actual computer, as opposed to a toy,
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.600]   which is what the iPad is.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.720]   I won't open the archmallows to simply say that the idea
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.720]   that universally they suck, that's not accurate.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.480]   And in fact, educational stuff on iPad
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.840]   has been a failure, which is why the LA School Department is
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.620]   sued Apple because they were given a--
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.860]   promised a lot of--
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.140]   Fundamentally, the issue is that the management system that
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.200]   Apple has-- the management that Apple has done
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.340]   hasn't worked at all.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.340]   You don't like to your point.
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.620]   I mean, the fleet management being
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.860]   able to-- all the cloud stuff that you can put up
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.700]   and manage those pieces and everything else,
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.100]   those are the things that just Apple just dropped the ball on.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.260]   And that is why they haven't been able to do it.
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.460]   I do think that they have a superior piece of hardware.
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:44.100]   So in that area, because--
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.420]   Again, we all write--
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.220]   We all write until we're done with college,
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.020]   and then we make slide decks.
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.180]   But I would say that anybody who is tempted by the iPad Mini,
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.820]   but they don't know if they can really afford it.
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.980]   Again, $329 for this new iPad.
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.700]   It's not that much larger than the iPad Mini.
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:07.420]   After using my tablets and my iPad Pro for so much time,
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.580]   I kind of forget how small by comparison,
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.980]   like the standard iPad sizes.
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:17.780]   And once again, it is just such a killer deal,
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.500]   particularly amongst Apple and Apple.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.340]   I'm like shocking to this.
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:21.740]   I'm thrilled that they're keeping--
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:25.180]   Yeah, it's great that they have the 329-299 education price.
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.140]   I'm also thrilled that the Mini is getting some love.
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.420]   Because that's a great size.
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.020]   People loved it.
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.660]   We bought so many of them.
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.780]   We used them for all kinds of things.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.580]   And when they get old, we used those clocks.
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.420]   Yeah, they're fun.
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:37.900]   Exactly.
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.300]   A little smart display in your home.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.140]   I like the idea of being able to use it as my home kit.
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.620]   I can put it on a wall.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.460]   I think it's-- it might be 12 South,
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.620]   or there's another company that makes these great little
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.580]   on wall accessories.
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.140]   You install them with a screw, and it has like a cord route
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:54.660]   and everything.
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.780]   And then you just plug that in.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.060]   And suddenly, you've got home kit controls on your wall.
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.380]   And for folks who aren't super into the smart home,
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.180]   they don't want to shout out to have things done.
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.460]   That's kind of a nice little place to have.
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.780]   A little smart display on your wall.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.780]   Yeah.
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.820]   I have a three or four year old iPad Mini 4.
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.420]   And I still use it.
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.940]   I wouldn't say all the time, but there's
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.380]   so many circumstances in which it is the absolute perfect thing.
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.860]   And I'm glad that years ago, I spent $500 for it,
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.980]   and that it's been-- and that I put a really good impact
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.900]   case on it so that I can kick it around for five years
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.380]   and it still works perfectly.
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:29.100]   I think that new iPad OS 15 feature, the notes feature,
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.460]   was 1,000% made for this iPad Mini.
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.700]   They even showed somebody dragging a note up.
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.860]   Yeah, from the corner.
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.420]   Imagine-- because you do see lots of health care workers
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.860]   with their tablets, and they are-- they can be kind of unwieldy.
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.180]   So the idea of just being able to-- I mean,
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.540]   especially with my monster hands,
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.780]   I'll be able to hold this iPad Mini in one hand,
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:47.980]   have the Apple Pencil in the other,
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.340]   and just take some quick notes as you move around.
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.460]   And it doesn't feel like it's so much in the hand.
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.100]   So yeah, I think we were both pretty excited about the iPad
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:55.900]   Mini.
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.180]   And it's not just marketing.
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:01.100]   I was in a helicopter in LA, and the pilot was--
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.620]   Was it strapped to his thigh?
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:03.820]   No, he wasn't strapped to his thigh.
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.220]   It was connected to the helicopter itself.
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.020]   But it's how he was managing his checklists,
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.420]   and his flight paths, and everything else
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.780]   as he was looking through it.
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.540]   8.38 inches.
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.700]   So I'm sure Apple's done a lot of research on just how small
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.460]   can you make this and still make it usable and legible?
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.700]   They showed multitasking.
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.340]   They showed the notes feature.
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.620]   One thing they didn't do on this entire hour and 15 minute
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.980]   event is mention iOS 15 or iPad OS 15.
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.180]   You don't really know when those are coming.
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.500]   Presumably they will come.
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.580]   I mean, if I get a new-- I ordered the Mini.
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.820]   I'm going to figure it's going to come with 15 on it.
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.540]   But who knows?
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.700]   That's a thought.
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.300]   I'm surprised.
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.460]   I'm surprised they didn't even talk it up.
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.740]   They did definitely integrate talk
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.300]   about all the great new features, the highlight features
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:54.780]   of iPad OS and the new iOS amongst the demos
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.620]   and amongst the talk of the intro hardware features.
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.620]   But I was surprised they didn't--
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.380]   with all the time they already put into it,
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.700]   why not put five minutes into it?
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:07.220]   Oh, and by the way, here is how much value all iPad
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.020]   and all iOS users are going to have
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.860]   with the great features of iOS 15.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.940]   Because I think that the people that are going
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.940]   to be buying a new iPhone every year, no matter
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.140]   what, it doesn't matter what gets said.
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.620]   So long as there's as long as there's
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.860]   a number that is incrementally one higher
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.420]   than the number associated with the thing that's
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.140]   already in their pocket, they're going to buy it,
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.820]   everybody else is going to be very, very pleased to know
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.660]   that the iPhone they bought last year has added value
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.140]   and it will help Apple to sell them the next iPhone
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.860]   or the next iPad after that.
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.340]   Well, this just in--
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.340]   Micah scrolled a little farther down the page.
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.260]   iPad OS 15 arrives on the 20th.
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.740]   As well as iOS 15, I just checked the page there
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.260]   as well.
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.500]   So yeah, we didn't have a date.
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.740]   I guess they just didn't mention it.
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:48.260]   It was so much.
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:49.420]   They only had so much time.
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.220]   So I guess.
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.300]   Yeah, I think you get into a sense of, wow,
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.220]   this is really getting long.
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.860]   I mean, when we work on keynotes, other people's keynotes,
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.780]   a lot of times you get to a point
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.980]   where you just have to start cutting things out
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.580]   because it's really long.
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:02.940]   Do we really need to talk about this?
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:03.820]   Or can we just move on?
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.140]   Because we've got a lot to talk about.
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.380]   Micah and I were actually concerned
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.780]   because we were at the hour of Mark
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.460]   and they hadn't mentioned the Pro yet.
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.140]   And we were thinking, are they going to save this
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:12.340]   for another event or whatever.
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.900]   But I have a theory, and maybe Alex,
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.420]   you kind of mentioned this on previous events
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.820]   where you could see jump cuts where there would normally
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.180]   be a transition.
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.820]   I have a theory that maybe they make it a little bit longer
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:26.660]   thinking perhaps they're going to be cutting things out.
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.980]   And in this case, everything that was--
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.660]   they were ready to talk about everything
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.860]   so they didn't cut anything out.
[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.140]   So it was an hour and 16 instead.
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.420]   Yeah, the transitions were amazing.
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.700]   I mean, like the production value again
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.900]   is just gold standard.
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.020]   I actually love that they've gone outside Apple campus now.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:42.860]   That was so fun.
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:43.700]   I think it's really good.
[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.780]   I think it's really small over California.
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.900]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.700]   I don't know how they go back to the stage.
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:48.420]   No, they can't.
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.540]   They never go back to the stage.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.460]   This is them saying, yeah, you know what?
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.940]   That's it.
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.500]   I did think it interesting that Tim's--
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.180]   the home base for Tim was the Steve Jobs Theater
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.940]   with the Big Supers display amongst it.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.540]   To remind people of this thing exists, sidebar,
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.860]   I do think that someone needs on Etsy
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.460]   or somewhere needs to start selling
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:09.980]   and now back to Tim T-shirts.
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.940]   Because I will buy one in two different sizes.
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.780]   But on top of that, I started to wonder,
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.660]   I wonder if when they have--
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:23.740]   they're using the exterior of the Apple spaceship
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.780]   as transitionals for a lot of different things.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.220]   You think that they are doing that with drones
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.180]   or are they--
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.380]   A lot of drone shots here.
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.820]   Let's build a digital--
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.660]   Let's build a digital one Apple campus
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.380]   so that any time we need that shot in any lighting
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.220]   we can make it.
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.660]   Yeah, some of it did look actually CG'd.
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.380]   So there's a handful of places that are relatively easy
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.220]   to do CG.
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.940]   The transition's going through the windows.
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:47.940]   That can be CG.
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.100]   But the thing is, there's so much foliage.
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.780]   As a visual-- building that digitally
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.540]   gets really difficult to have the foliage really--
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.620]   to pull it off gets super expensive.
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.540]   So I think that-- and we actually looked at it pretty closely
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.020]   in office hours while we were watching it.
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:05.500]   And we think that those are LED walls.
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.020]   Like we--
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.180]   That's what I think too.
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.660]   So the transition that was the most interesting--
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.660]   and I think it's right here where we're leaving the Apple
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.620]   fitness thing and we go back to Tim, your T-shirt.
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:20.140]   And he is walking in a desert and then walks out
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.540]   of the desert onto-- first it looks like he's walking on water,
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.180]   which even for Tim Cook might be a little challenging.
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.300]   But it turns out he's actually now back on the stage.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.180]   That had to be--
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.460]   I don't know what.
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.940]   Maybe I'm in the wrong spot.
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.180]   I got a--
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:34.580]   Was it--
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.220]   No, no, no.
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.220]   It was--
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.020]   Right after that opening video.
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.220]   Is it--
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.380]   I do think in some of the-- there was a transition there
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.820]   that I was pretty sure was green screen
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.660]   because it was really hard.
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:47.380]   Like if you did-- it was going from him-- he was onstage
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.660]   and it went out.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.460]   And I was like, oh, I think that they must have done that
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.860]   on green screen because it was--
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.860]   it was-- that would have been really hard to match up.
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:54.780]   You know?
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.620]   They did a really good shot that could have been a drone shot
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:01.020]   because drone pilots are ungodly good.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:01.620]   They're--
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.620]   Oh, especially the FPV--
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.060]   I think the first person view drone pilots, they can do anything.
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.260]   OK, yeah, here it is.
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.020]   So here's in the desert.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.260]   That's Tim's-- well, maybe not Tim.
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.060]   Just--
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.020]   It's somebody's feet.
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:14.900]   And then he walks out.
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:15.420]   So you know what?
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.060]   That's actually a pretty easy transition.
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:17.620]   I--
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:18.620]   They can--
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.060]   It's cool to me.
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:19.500]   And they're cool to me.
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.620]   You can keep on by a bag of sand.
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.220]   Yeah.
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.660]   So literally, you're bag of sand on the stage.
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.180]   You know what it's--
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.100]   Well, I don't know.
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.680]   I think that might have been a real spot.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.540]   And then there's a cut, I guess, right?
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.780]   And obviously that's not Tim because then it just
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:34.060]   shows trademark sneakers and jeans.
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.300]   And let's look at it again real quickly.
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.300]   I do love all these.
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.220]   This music being--
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.620]   We're going to find out years from now
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.460]   with Alex.
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:40.940]   That was--
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:41.460]   Of course.
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.140]   See, there he is.
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.860]   Now that's the desert, right?
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.180]   Right?
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:44.700]   Yeah.
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.340]   That does look like--
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:46.220]   And then that.
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.180]   How do they do that transition?
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:49.860]   Oh, I know.
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:50.580]   I figured it out.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.620]   I already figured it out.
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.460]   You put a little mirror glass in the desert.
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.340]   He walks into that.
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.100]   And then you cut Tim on stage.
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:57.460]   That's--
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.980]   When in doubt, it's usually the simplest thing.
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.420]   It usually becomes--
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.900]   It's not as complicated.
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.900]   Usually try to do it physically as first.
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.900]   Occums via effects.
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:06.340]   Before you do it.
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:06.860]   Yeah.
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:10.140]   And I think that, and generally, I think Apple is more prone
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.780]   to let's do it in camera.
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:13.420]   Yeah, look.
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.260]   This is in camera.
[00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.660]   There is-- that's there.
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.900]   That's easy to do.
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:18.820]   And then they cut to this.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.300]   And you see, there's even a gap between the mini--
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.860]   this LED screen and this floor there.
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.220]   So yeah.
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.420]   All right.
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.740]   That just mystified the whole damn thing.
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:33.060]   This is why Pen and Teller will never tell you how they do.
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:37.420]   But think about what a great series of long-term decisions
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.580]   that Apple has made that we are talking about just
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.180]   how beautiful this event was to watch,
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.340]   just as a cinematic event.
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.260]   A product announcement, right?
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.420]   And it's a movie.
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:53.220]   And the thing is that we can watch them progress.
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.140]   The very first one was a little rough.
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.180]   And they've just taken it.
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.060]   They just keep taking it to a whole nother level.
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.660]   And this one was at a whole nother level
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.100]   from what they did before.
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.460]   I could see a point where they had
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.580]   Tim on stage when they bring people back
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.180]   into Steve Jobs Theater.
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.820]   And then he's just throwing to one movie out of--
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.060]   that could be the almost the setup is,
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.700]   I'm going to have a whole bunch of videos
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.540]   that you're going to watch.
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.780]   But I'm going to keep on throwing you from the stage
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:17.940]   to tie you back in.
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.460]   I mean, I could see that as a model that they could use,
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.220]   at least in the interim, before they just put a movie up.
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.660]   I don't know what they're going to do.
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.260]   But I have to say, you're going to want to watch
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.780]   every single time because they've really upped the Andy,
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.060]   the production Andy.
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.820]   As they should because Apple--
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:35.700]   this is an arena Apple wants to be known for.
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.060]   And we'll talk a little bit about the new cameras
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:41.340]   on the iPhone Pro and using Casper and Bigelow,
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.580]   Double Oscar, Usker winning award director
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.900]   to make a movie.
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.460]   Who said she won't ever stream another?
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.580]   Isn't she the one that said she wasn't going to--
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.620]   I'll never stream to Netflix again.
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:55.060]   And then Apple came with a million dollar check.
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:58.620]   And 400 iPhone 13s.
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.980]   All right, let's take a little break there.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.300]   So just we've done the iPads.
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:08.140]   Available now for order now, both a $329 base model iPad
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.140]   and the iPad mini 6th generation,
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.180]   both available now for delivery on the 24th.
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.260]   I think still the 24th.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.380]   $4.99 the starting point for the iPad mini,
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.660]   which is the starting point for the original iPad.
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.940]   That's a kind of a magical starting point for all of these.
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:25.620]   I maxed it out because I wanted--
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:29.780]   you only can go up to, I think, 256 gigs of storage.
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.940]   And I maxed it out by putting in the Wi-Fi plus--
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.660]   I think it's a great little cellular device.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.580]   It's kind of like a no phone.
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:37.940]   Yes.
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:38.940]   You can only call Leo--
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.220]   How do I give it a number, though?
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.860]   I guess I'll have to use Google Voice or something
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:43.580]   to give it a number.
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:44.060]   Yeah.
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:44.560]   Right?
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.020]   I need to have a phone number.
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:46.860]   We'll figure that out.
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:50.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:53.260]   We're going to get to the meat of the conversation
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:58.300]   just a second, but first a word from our sponsor, ITProTV.
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:59.340]   We know your geeks.
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.980]   Come on and admit it.
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:04.220]   And maybe perhaps you've considered a career in IT,
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.500]   or maybe you're already doing IT.
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.300]   And a lot of our audience does.
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.980]   And you want to go farther in your position
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:12.420]   or get a better job or just keep up with your skills, ITProTV,
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:17.100]   the best place to learn IT, to update your certifications,
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.820]   to get the certifications in the first place.
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:24.460]   Seven studios now in their Gainesville, Florida headquarters
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.380]   is really kind of amazing.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.220]   They're shooting all day, every day, Monday through Friday.
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.380]   There are always new stuff going in there,
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.220]   which is incredible.
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.260]   It's a great place for you to learn IT, always up to date,
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.860]   always fresh, always interesting.
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.900]   And lately, they've been doing a monthly theme.
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.300]   This month, it's Microsoft at ITProTV.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:46.100]   They'll be featuring more than 800 hours of Microsoft content.
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.500]   They're also going to have a free weekend.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.700]   This coming weekend, September 18th and 19th,
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.300]   that includes PowerShell and Azure training.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.340]   ITProTV is a Microsoft expert,
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:00.380]   and they can make you one, two, check out their courses.
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:04.940]   MTA Windows Operating System Fundamentals, 98-349.
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.980]   MTA Security Fundamentals, 98-367.
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:13.060]   Microsoft Azure, AZ 500, and so many more.
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.500]   The thing I love about ITProTV is the great team
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.340]   they've got there.
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.500]   They call them edutainers.
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.780]   They're experts in the field, of course,
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:25.100]   but they also are great at making IT interesting and fun.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.820]   You'll get the most up-to-date information
[00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.180]   while you're preparing for the exams.
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.420]   You'll get brand new content from the studio
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.380]   to their course library within 24 hours.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.140]   All the topics are divided into 20 and 30-minute episodes,
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:40.420]   which makes it easy for you to just, you know,
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.220]   during a lunch break, watch one or two.
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.460]   And there's searchable transcripts for everything too,
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.940]   which means you can jump right to the part
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.380]   you need to know.
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.420]   The edutainers are on staff, so they're always there.
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.580]   Anytime you need assistance.
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.180]   On demand, you can watch it on your computer.
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.300]   You can watch it on your iPhone, your Android device.
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.980]   They've got apps for both.
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.260]   They also, you can, of course, Chromecast it,
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.380]   but they have a Roku app, an Apple TV app.
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.060]   It is very easy to watch.
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:11.580]   On demand, worldwide ITProTV.
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.700]   If you're ready to get a better career in IT
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.540]   or get your first job in IT, learn the fundamentals,
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.180]   make sure your certs are up to date.
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.940]   Go to itpro.tv/macbreak.

[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.020]   We thank ITProTV for their support.
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.020]   We've been with them since the very beginning,
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.160]   since they started big fans.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.020]   Itpro.tv/macbrake, we thank you for supporting us
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.260]   by using that address.
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:55.940]   And don't forget the offer code MACbrake30.
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.880]   Ah, we skipped ahead because they started off with...
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.420]   You know, I don't even know it's worth mentioning
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:02.780]   an ad for Apple TV+.
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.020]   - Yeah, that's pretty much what it was, yup.
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.740]   They said, hey, you know, we've won lots
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.300]   or we've been nominated for lots of awards.
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.880]   - Tka-la-sa-tad-la-sa, tka-la-sa-tad-la-sa.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.720]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.620]   - Tka-la-sa-tad-la-sa.
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.420]   - But for more than this, let's go to Ted Lassen.
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.580]   (laughing)
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:17.880]   - That's exactly what it was.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.540]   - I can't quite figure out what it is.
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.340]   I don't like about Apple TV+ shows.
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.340]   - About every single TV+ show, you know.
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.820]   - But there's just, I mean, look,
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.180]   most shows don't make it, right?
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.780]   On Netflix, on HBO Max, most shows aren't,
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.260]   good enough for you to binge.
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.860]   I've yet to see anything on Apple TV
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.100]   that makes me go, wow, they really have nailed this.
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.900]   And there is definitely a style.
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:40.820]   Are my wrong, Alex?
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.820]   - There's a style, it's a style of money.
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.660]   (laughing)
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.340]   - But it just shows you can't throw money at talent
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.220]   and get a great thing necessarily.
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.140]   - There is, but there is a,
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.940]   some of the stuff has been really good.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.820]   I mean, I have to admit that I've been drawn more
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.820]   to their non-fictional stuff than their fiction.
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.380]   So, you know, as a parent--
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.620]   - The documentary stuff's good, I agree.
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.300]   - As a parent, I have to admit, I look at a lot of the stuff.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.520]   And as soon as it says, "M.A., I'm like,
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.340]   "well, I'm not watching that, I don't have any time."
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.500]   You know, like, I don't have to do that.
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.220]   - What piece of the Apple TV style is to show their edgy
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.460]   by throwing in the F word as much as possible.
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.300]   - If you notice that?
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.100]   - What's that show, that gaming show?
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.580]   - I came--
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:21.420]   - Oh, God, mythic question.
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.260]   - Mythic question, yeah.
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.180]   - Oh, what a piece of crap.
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.620]   But even on the morning show, it's like,
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:25.940]   they would swear every five minutes,
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.700]   like it's as if to say, "See, we're edgy."
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.140]   Ooh, we say the F word.
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.100]   And it's like, no, you're not edgy, you're not.
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.660]   - So, but I thought that the, I think it's kind of
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.340]   see the music, it's one of those things that it's not,
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.980]   it's not, they didn't hit it out of the park.
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.940]   But it was a solid show, like it was about, you know,
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:46.300]   it hit, Mark, I think Mark Ronson takes you through
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.820]   this kind of weaving thing where he talks about,
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.860]   and he just got a lot of budget to do it.
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.340]   So it looks, it just looks really nice, you know,
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.420]   and they can go and talk to all the right people
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.500]   and pull all those stuff in.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.980]   And there's just a lot of things that will be very hard
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.460]   for a normal documentary in something that vertical.
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.420]   Hey, let's talk about synthesizers and auto tuning
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:09.260]   and, you know, sampling and distortion.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.460]   So for me, I was like, I can't believe I get a show
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:16.300]   produced at, you know, that level about something
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:17.180]   very vertical.
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.740]   So I was excited about that.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.180]   And I love Tiny World.
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.580]   I mean, I just think that they just took, you know,
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.060]   they just spent all the money on that thing.
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.980]   And so I enjoy the fact that there's not a lot of,
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.380]   there's not a lot of rough things to watch
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.660]   from an audio visual perspective.
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.300]   But I do agree with you that they don't hit it
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.140]   100%.
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.340]   Like it just doesn't, it doesn't close up, you know,
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.180]   for me.
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.500]   And I barely watched it.
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.460]   You know, like it's, it's like the Mark Ronson was,
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.980]   is really good, but it's not great.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.980]   You know, like it's a little, they're spending,
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.620]   like they're spending that a lot of millions,
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.140]   like billions and billions of dollars every year
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.180]   to make content.
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.460]   And you can see that.
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.300]   I have to say, season one of Ted Lasso,
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.140]   I 1000% enjoyed.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.220]   So I was on the hype train after I watched it.
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.860]   In fact, my, I've had friends who like the last thing
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.460]   that everyone to watch is a show about football soccer,
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.540]   depending on where you are.
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:13.020]   And loved season one, but I have just not,
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.220]   I feel like with season two, because of,
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.460]   as Andy was talking about, Ted Lasso, Ted Lasso,
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:21.660]   Ted Lasso, Ted Lasso, it feels sort of artificial now.
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.740]   It's like when you, when they, they take a,
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.420]   I don't even, this is not a very good comparison,
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.820]   but you take something and you guild it,
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.540]   and you just cover it in this like, just seepy gold,
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.980]   and you just, it's why.
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.620]   I, that's how this, there's, there's something in authentic
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.020]   I felt in the season, in season two
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.620]   that I didn't get in season one.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.100]   I don't know.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.820]   - It's, I think that they're in danger
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:46.420]   of trying to make people feel guilty for not loving it.
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.500]   And it's a, it's a terrific, it's a terrific show,
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.500]   but it's, it becomes a thing where God,
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.580]   could I hear a little bit, it's the same stuff
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:54.460]   that I get about a lot of the Disney stuff
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.380]   where the, it's the announcements are stuff
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:57.580]   that I'd be very, very interested in,
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.900]   but I can't not be hearing about the Easter eggs
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.100]   and the new What If series.
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.980]   And I kind of want, the last thing I want to do
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.140]   after a day of reading about stuff like that,
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.020]   my Twitter feed is to actually see more of it
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.300]   on actual Disney Plus.
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.780]   So maybe they could be in danger of too much success.
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:12.620]   Who knows?
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.860]   - It's just also hard to do really great stuff.
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.500]   I mean, it always has been, you can have lots of money,
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:18.660]   you can hire the best people.
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:19.500]   It's just hard to do.
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.060]   - And TikTok will always beat you.
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.540]   - Yeah, unfortunately.
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.740]   The funny thing is, is that, and the worst part
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.220]   is in my family, we're sitting there watching
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.460]   person of interest from season one.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:29.660]   And then we finished that and we're like,
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:30.740]   okay, now let's watch them TikTok.
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:31.580]   And then we go to sleep.
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.420]   You don't look like it's, that's kind of the evening.
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.500]   So we're barely even touching some of the new content
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.060]   unless it's really, really good.
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.740]   You know, and that's the, I think that's gonna be
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.620]   the challenge, is that I don't know how the middle
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:45.860]   of the road kind of content continues to survive
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:46.980]   because if it's not really good,
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.500]   I've got a whole back catalog of,
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:49.340]   - That's the problem.
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.100]   - From a whole bunch of services that I can just go to
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:54.540]   and just sit in that season for the next two months.
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:55.940]   - I don't know, I can't put my finger on it.
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.500]   There's just something constipated about the content.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:02.500]   As if Apple's like watching, you know?
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.780]   - Yes, it's like, it's just sort of a,
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.700]   - It just feels like they're, we can't really,
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.580]   they are starting to acquire more catalog content.
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.020]   In fact, maybe your kids will be happy to hear
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.820]   that they've acquired YoGabba Gabba.
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:17.860]   - I can throw a yarn for them.
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.420]   - Okay, I don't even know what it is,
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.940]   but they bought the catalog of classic episodes
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.500]   and are ordering a new series.
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:26.340]   - I don't know if they'll be happy because
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:28.060]   they don't get to see it as much
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:28.900]   because they have to have an eye.
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.220]   - Yeah, they took peanuts kind of away from all of us.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.780]   - Luckily they rolled that back after they got some blowback,
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.500]   but they were originally planning on keeping it
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:36.340]   kind of where it was.
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:40.140]   So, you know, I think that, here's the thing,
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:43.260]   obviously all of us who watch the shows that we watch
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.540]   and enjoy the things that we enjoy
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:48.180]   do not necessarily have our fingers on the pulse
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.220]   of what the everyday person likes
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:53.100]   because I do still see a lot of people talking about Ted Lasso
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.900]   and enjoying Ted Lasso.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.660]   But outside of Ted Lasso, I really haven't seen
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.220]   a whole lot of talk about the other shows
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.300]   that Apple has come out with.
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:05.620]   And it does make me worry if it's kind of like
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.740]   putting blinders on a horse,
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.780]   they're gonna focus so much on Ted Lasso
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.140]   and try to keep that going that all those shows
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.140]   just sort of go out.
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:13.980]   - Of course, of course.
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.020]   And we'll see what happens, but the big play,
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.060]   the all-in that they've done is foundation.
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.940]   Like which is gonna be spectacular.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:20.780]   - Oh yeah, all I worry about that.
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.180]   - It's spectacularly good or spectacularly bad,
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.580]   but I don't think it's gonna be somewhere in the middle.
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.460]   Like the thing that they spent all the money on.
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.860]   - They're probably, you know something.
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.140]   Everything's been not quite.
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:33.140]   So yeah, either fail spectacularly,
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.260]   if it's another dune, I'd be happy, right?
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.060]   Fail spectacularly.
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.500]   Not, well, I wouldn't be happy.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.500]   (laughing)
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.140]   The movie, David Lynch, the dude, all right.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.300]   I've heard some people like David Lynch's dune.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.900]   I'm not one of them.
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.340]   (laughing)
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.900]   But it's challenging 'cause like dune,
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:55.900]   you have this very big opus that has sweeping themes
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.700]   and the most challenging part is beloved.
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:00.780]   - That's yup.
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:01.740]   - Like group of people.
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:05.340]   It's not like, you know, Wheel of Time or even Game of Thrones
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:08.260]   where yes, they're fanatics, but it's not widely beloved.
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.860]   - But I think that, and I think foundation's a series, right?
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.180]   It's not just a single movie.
[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:15.460]   So this is the advantage.
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.060]   - Right, so but this is the advantage that we have today
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.220]   with subscription services that we didn't have before.
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:22.460]   And I think this is why we're gonna see this,
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.660]   continue to move the big products away from theaters
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:28.900]   and into subscription because it makes way more sense.
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.460]   You can flesh out all the characters.
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.300]   You can flesh out.
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.420]   You can like the Marvel thing is always like,
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.620]   we're gonna give you a great seat, a great number one.
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.780]   Number two is being pretty good.
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.220]   Three, four are gonna be horrible.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.140]   We didn't spend any money on those.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:44.220]   And then five and six, we build it back up so that you remember
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:46.260]   and then you wanna come back the next season.
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.100]   But it's like, but there's a whole arc
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.820]   that they just kind of work through things, you know?
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.940]   And so, but they're like the season, you know,
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.260]   three and four are always the character building
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.140]   for the season.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:57.620]   Like, it's not that exciting,
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:59.260]   but you need to know these things about these people.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:02.020]   And then we'll pull it out.
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.260]   But you can't do that in a movie.
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.100]   - No, I agree.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:04.940]   - You can't do that in two and a half hours.
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:08.860]   You can do that in six hours or seven hours or 20 hours.
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:09.700]   - I wonder what the budget,
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.380]   do we know what the budget was for foundation?
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.700]   - It's gotta be all of it, all of it.
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:14.540]   (laughing)
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:15.380]   - Like billions.
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:16.580]   - As an original effects person,
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.700]   I look at the background, I look at the behind the scenes,
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.500]   I look at the sets, I look at the visual effects.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.700]   I'm like, holy smokes.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:23.540]   They just flip the screen.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.380]   - You do it at Mandalorian style with the LCD screens?
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.220]   - I don't think so.
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.060]   - I don't think so.
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:29.860]   - These are more practical and...
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:30.980]   - Well, it's a mixture of it.
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:33.860]   - But you look at it, but the, I mean,
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.380]   I don't know how much they span,
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.340]   but I can tell you, just looking at the behind the scenes,
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.500]   you know, it's just an insane amount of money
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:45.060]   to do that production at that level for a series.
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.460]   So you have, what is that from?
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.020]   - So this is from Market Research, Silicon,
[00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.380]   but I've seen it in a few places.
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:56.380]   They interviewed David S. Goyer and asked him,
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.820]   oh, this was in the Hollywood Reporter talking about it.
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:02.780]   And he said two episodes cost as much as a movie does
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:03.700]   for foundation. - That's about right.
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.260]   So it's two hours.
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.100]   It's an hour.
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:06.940]   - What kind of movie?
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.100]   - Oh, that's a good question.
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:08.940]   (laughing)
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.540]   - That's a good question.
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.020]   - Like, it might be like, you know, pirates,
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.780]   two episodes of my class, the same as pirates, you know,
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.860]   or Star Wars, you know?
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:19.460]   Or does it, you know, so, yeah.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:20.700]   - Our water world.
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.860]   - Oh, I didn't know that he works on Sandman.
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.620]   - I have high hopes.
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.980]   And I also very nervous 'cause I love the novels.
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:31.740]   So, then they went to the watch.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.260]   And we had heard rumors at the watch.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.380]   There was something about the watch.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.620]   It was gonna make it hard to make in quantity.
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.380]   Perhaps the new screen.
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.860]   I guess that's the case because all Apple could say
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:46.100]   after selling us hard on the Apple Watch Series 7
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.020]   is available later this fall.
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.420]   - Show me a green watch and they don't let me buy it
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.260]   right away.
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.380]   - Damn, they're travesty.
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:57.340]   - I thought one of the stones hitting the watch,
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:58.660]   you close it. - What a great way to start.
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:36:59.500]   - Yeah.
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.220]   - And then the best part is right.
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.660]   It's cinematic and it's all hitting me exploring.
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:04.900]   And then it cuts to the outside.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:05.740]   He goes, boom.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:06.820]   - Yeah, just so quiet.
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.100]   That was so well done.
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.060]   - I owe him the best test proof.
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.460]   - Which is the highest level of a dust proof.
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:18.180]   So, of course, immediately, Lisa, I go say hi to my wife
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.300]   who's in the other room.
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.300]   She says, "Should I, do I need the watch?"
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.580]   - So popular.
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:23.860]   - She's got the Series 6.
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:24.860]   - Oh.
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.380]   - I mean, if you're on Series 3, it'd be great.
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.340]   If you're on Series 4 or 5, maybe.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.220]   Series 6, do I need the watch?
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.100]   - If you like to do the sleep tracking
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.580]   and the fitness tracking stuff,
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.900]   I think that you need this watch.
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.380]   And the reason why is because it offers 33% faster charging
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.860]   over the current model.
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.220]   So, if you want to do that sleep tracking,
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.420]   you'll get in those eight hours of sleep tracking.
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.140]   You pop it on the charger while you take your shower
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.100]   and you come out and it's ready to go.
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.100]   I think that's going to be a big thing for folks.
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.620]   Outside of that, I don't think so
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.740]   because I've found that the watch I have right now
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:59.460]   is really durable and I find myself hitting it
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.060]   against things already.
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:04.780]   So, I'm not the mountain biker who falls to the ground.
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.020]   - In front of his kids.
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.620]   - Oh, you may be.
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.260]   - Just brutal.
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.940]   - You probably all had a very good laugh at his expense.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.940]   - Yes. - Let's all admit it.
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.460]   But it did address something that a lot of people
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.740]   have been complaining about that if anything
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:22.860]   to make this device more durable and easier to resist,
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.420]   if they're encouraging people to be super, super active
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.820]   with this watch, then people are going to be super active
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:28.660]   with it.
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:29.500]   So, dust resistance.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.540]   They also mentioned, by the way, which was interesting,
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:36.220]   that they add that the screen is now more impact resistant
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.620]   and here I'm holding for, okay, what new screen,
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:41.460]   what new display material technology are you using?
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.740]   But they appear to be saying that because the display
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.380]   is now curved, the curve that's in that display
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:49.020]   is architecturally adding some strength to it.
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.500]   - That was interesting, yeah.
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.820]   - Well, we'll hear how they explain that in more detail later,
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:55.020]   but that's definitely, the fact there's a really,
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:58.900]   really big market for external cases for your Apple Watch,
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:01.820]   which I initially thought was just ludicrous,
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.060]   but now, yeah, I've seen too many people say,
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.740]   oh my God, thank God I had this $20 plastic case
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.340]   over my watch 'cause it just got absolutely destroyed.
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.460]   And my watch after three years is still absolutely perfect
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:13.900]   and three scratches.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.140]   - Well, we do know round is durable, right?
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.300]   The arches are, you know, that's an,
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:22.860]   there's a, you know, materials science element to that.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.300]   - I forgot the other thing that you reason
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.860]   why you might want this one is if you have a series six
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.500]   and you like the always on display,
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.020]   but you have trouble seeing it,
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:33.820]   it's a 70% brighter than the series six.
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.980]   - It was really cool 'cause they didn't even,
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.180]   there weren't even koya bod because they actually said,
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:41.620]   which makes it easier to surreptitiously see what time it is
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.220]   when your hand is like opening the table.
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:45.180]   - The arm is down, they use the word.
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.620]   - Let's face it, it's exactly what.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:48.500]   (laughing)
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:52.700]   They made a lot of, it doesn't seem like a huge leap forward,
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.820]   but they're, they, they, at least laid the groundwork
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.780]   for this larger display, being able to enable
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.260]   like a new watch complication that has two rather
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:03.060]   large data complications instead of just one
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:06.540]   that can put more larger tap targets for buttons
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.980]   that they also made highlighted.
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.300]   Hey, look how big this keyboard is.
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.380]   You can actually tap on the keyboard or swipe.
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.100]   - That remains to be seen, I would.
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.620]   - Exactly, yeah, I love it.
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.900]   - But they weren't just, they're, they're, they're at least
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.860]   saying that this isn't just, hey look,
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.420]   we just decided to do this for the hell of it.
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.780]   Here are ways that's going to make it materially better.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.060]   And of course, it's going to be up to independent reviewers
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:27.860]   and observers to see whether it actually delivers,
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.580]   but I'm glad that they didn't just say,
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:30.700]   hey look, just for the hell of it,
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.980]   we decided to make a 44 millimeter version
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:34.900]   that's incompatible with all existing bands.
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:35.740]   - Yes, thank you.
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.060]   - Just so you can flex on your--
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.700]   - No, that's good, I'm really glad.
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.100]   - Yeah, we didn't get that flat edged watch
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.300]   that we kept seeing in renders that I know have--
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.860]   - Rumors were just wrong on this.
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.180]   - They were very wrong.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:47.340]   - They always looked weird.
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.300]   Do you really want like a hard edge cutting into your wrist?
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.140]   Like that?
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.980]   In fact, it's quite the opposite, they made this softer.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:55.620]   - Yeah, they were really very clear about the smoothness.
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:59.300]   And then that refracted edge glass that makes it look like
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.820]   the text actually comes up to the edge.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.140]   - I kind of like that, especially without any face
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.700]   that they showed with the numbers where they get bigger.
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.900]   - That actually occurs around, can't wait for Renee
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.700]   to talk about the new Hermes, two new Hermes.
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:13.900]   - I saw that, yes, yes.
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:17.220]   One now leather links and another that's like a woven cloth
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:18.060]   sort of thing.
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.940]   We'll know how well Renee's doing depending on the number
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.980]   of those he buys.
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:27.220]   Still offering the series three and the series six
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:30.420]   and the SE, so actually no, that's not right.
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:33.300]   They'll still offer the three and the SE, I don't know why.
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.900]   - But the point is that I love that across a current theme,
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.660]   like you only see that little quick flash of a car
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:41.380]   that shows the entire iPhone lineup,
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:44.460]   the entire Apple Watch lineup.
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.700]   How many years I'm still saying I want,
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.540]   what I'm not thinking.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.180]   Now I'm saying that I'm right and Apple's wrong,
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:53.860]   but I love the fact that they are keeping the older hardware
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.580]   in the product lineup so that the minimum buy-in
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:00.140]   on an Apple Watch is $199 and that still gives you
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:04.140]   a watch that will at the minimum compete with any two
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:07.500]   to $300 fitness watch you'll find out there.
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.940]   And in many cases we'll just kick the butt of,
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:14.140]   nobody who is an iPhone owner who's considering
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:18.100]   a 150 or 160 dollar watch is not going to be seriously tempted
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:20.340]   to simply want to just spend $40 more
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:22.180]   and so getting a Garmin or Fitbit,
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.420]   I can get an actual Apple Watch
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:25.140]   that does so much more with my iPhone.
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:28.940]   So I'm glad that they're still allowing you to spend $399
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:33.100]   for an inexpensive iPhone, $329 for an inexpensive iPad.
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.580]   It's a turnaround from one of my complaints from five years ago.
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:40.260]   They're getting very close to the point where this is,
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:43.380]   anyone who complains that Apple only makes hardware
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:47.500]   for elitists, like it only makes hard for rich people
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.540]   is kind of antiquated, kind of like saying,
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.020]   oh well there's no software available for Macs, like dude,
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.700]   that hasn't been true since after the Clinton administration
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.220]   gets with the program.
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:01.020]   I think they spent some time selling
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:03.500]   probably the number one selling point for an Apple Watch
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:04.900]   which is Apple Fit.
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:06.580]   I was gonna say the number one at a time.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.580]   The timer, the timer.
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.100]   The timer is the most amazing.
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:10.940]   Yeah, I do.
[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:11.780]   That's so much.
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:12.620]   Really? Oh, okay.
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:15.340]   Timer, remind me, remind me, timer, remind me, remind me,
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:19.220]   timer, but I will say, I will say to go to Apple Fitness,
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.060]   it is the best.
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:23.780]   It is so good, it's so awesome.
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:25.300]   It has come of age.
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:26.940]   Leo and I are getting ready for snow season
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:28.300]   with the energy future.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.700]   Chris, it's really come of age.
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.300]   I think it is now a full offering.
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:37.740]   And the remote fitness companies like Peloton
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.620]   have done phenomenally well during quarantine.
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:43.020]   Even despite the safety issues they've had.
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:47.100]   Yeah, so I think this is a very good category
[00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.380]   for Apple to be in.
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.060]   And you can do it without an Apple Watch,
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.500]   but this sells watches.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:52.340]   I mean, it really does.
[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:53.740]   Can you do it without an Apple Watch?
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.300]   I thought you needed to register in an Apple Watch.
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.420]   I believe you can do it on the iPad
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.580]   without an Apple Watch.
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:01.580]   Do it on Apple TV.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.020]   I think you have to have an Apple Watch,
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.380]   but don't 100% quote me.
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:06.620]   Yeah, you can do it on the iPad without the Apple Watch,
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.620]   but the TV is a watch thing.
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:11.100]   One thing that I, now that having praised Apple
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:13.620]   for shedding its elitist ways, I will say that,
[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:15.420]   amongst my notes, are that, wow, they,
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:18.020]   so they have the video that happens after every one
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.220]   of these little sections about, here is how people
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.980]   are using this, and here's people happy
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:24.180]   in using Apple Fitness, and every single,
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.900]   and here's the homes that people are using it.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:30.420]   And these are all like $1.2 million condo, of course.
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:31.260]   Oh, yes, of course.
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.380]   Expensive faces, which is, okay, okay, okay,
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:35.900]   but the thing that guts me a little bit more
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.020]   is that somebody with a basket of laundry
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.660]   in the background too curious.
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.180]   Exactly, and a dog that wants to climb on his back
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.140]   because, oh look, we're having playtime.
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.660]   I can tell you, I can tell you one of the reasons
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:48.340]   we do that, because I didn't do this one,
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:50.260]   but I shoot a lot of stuff in people's houses,
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.540]   is because the expensive houses have more room
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:53.380]   for the gear.
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:54.540]   So you rent...
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.540]   Well, you just tell...
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:58.820]   That's why they shoot below deck on the figure.
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:44:59.820]   Yeah, it's exactly.
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:01.500]   When you shoot a lot of the stuff,
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:04.340]   you shoot a lot of times you shoot stuff,
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:06.780]   like we rented a keynote, another keynote,
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:10.940]   not Apple's, and we rented a $9 million house,
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:11.860]   because it was just big.
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.140]   It had big rooms that we could use.
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:14.780]   It's true in TV too.
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:17.060]   Every, you know, you watch these TV shows
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.740]   about some young person just starting out in New York City,
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:23.300]   and they've got a $14,000 a month flat in New York City.
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.980]   Yeah, sure, that's their flat.
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:26.820]   Because you need...
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:27.980]   That makes sense. You've explained it now.
[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:28.980]   You've got some...
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:31.700]   But now that you can shoot everything with an iPhone...
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:32.540]   Yeah, right.
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:33.380]   I don't need all that room.
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:34.220]   Come on.
[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.260]   But before we leave Apple Fitness,
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.740]   like one other thing that I was talking about,
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:40.740]   this a little bit on Twitter,
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.420]   and one thing that I noticed is that
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:43.820]   I wish that they had said,
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.700]   given that they are not just selling this towards people
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.620]   who already have super hot fitness model bodies,
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.700]   it would be nice if some of the instructors had non-tipical
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:54.260]   shoes, they had bigger instruments.
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.100]   Exactly.
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:56.740]   But they didn't really show them in the video.
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.740]   They only showed one person with a different body type
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:01.100]   actually using the product.
[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:02.780]   One thing that's more serious than that,
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:05.380]   this is via value feedback that I get on Twitter,
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:08.780]   is a Twitter follower of mine who has disabilities,
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:12.780]   who said one of the consistent and most annoying problems
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.940]   of Apple Fitness is that they still don't have fitness
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.580]   workouts for people with disabilities.
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:20.860]   There was a clip of somebody who was wearing a prosthetic
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:24.660]   leg, but I follow up, is that count as the sort of thing
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:25.500]   you talked about?
[00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:26.500]   He said, no, it does not.
[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:29.220]   So that's certainly something that I hope that Apple addresses.
[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.180]   If you want everybody to be healthy,
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:34.140]   you can't just start with the people who already have,
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:38.220]   you know, like a, this is Sparta type body type.
[00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:40.900]   You really have to go for people like me and people like me.
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.620]   My mom who's 88 does Apple Fitness,
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:48.100]   and there's enough chair workouts that she can do those.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:49.900]   Apple's been very aware, certainly,
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.340]   you've got wheelchair metrics on your Apple watch.
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:54.340]   So I would imagine at some point that,
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:57.780]   I was, for some reason, when I saw it, when they said,
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:01.100]   and we're dropping all these new sports and all I could think of
[00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:02.860]   was Apple Fitness Parkour.
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:05.220]   You want parkour?
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.060]   I want pickleball.
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:07.060]   Tell us, Keith.
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:09.180]   Let me say, look, it looks like you've fallen a great dish
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:10.540]   in short, I call 911.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:11.860]   (laughing)
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:13.060]   Parkour would be a steragal.
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:18.260]   Yeah, I, you know, it's just something to keep track of.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:19.100]   Yes.
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:21.660]   It's also, it's something like, there used to be,
[00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:24.460]   there, this used to be like a two yoga studio town,
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:26.300]   neighborhood, literally, like across the street,
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.820]   there was one yoga studio down the street,
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:29.660]   there was another one.
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:30.860]   The one that's down the street,
[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:33.340]   their Instagram was all about, hi,
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.460]   we're all beautiful people in skin-tight black leotards
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:38.500]   who look beautiful doing our yoga.
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.500]   The one across the street was, look,
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.740]   any body shape, any body type, come on in,
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:44.620]   yoga is for everybody, you won't,
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:46.740]   even if we have a mixture of people.
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:48.580]   And that was, and that was the yoga studio
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:49.900]   that I wanted to give a try to,
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.100]   because I knew that they wouldn't just say,
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:55.460]   "Oh, when we said four free lessons for $30
[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:58.220]   for initial people, we were referring to people
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.860]   we want in our studio.
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:03.100]   Maybe you wanna go to the other studio down the street."
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.900]   So I just think that it would be a very big positive thing
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.900]   if Apple really wants to reach out to everybody
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:10.260]   to not only make this findable stuff within the app,
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:12.820]   but also when they're making a two minute,
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:13.940]   two or three minute video,
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:16.100]   that they're showing to everybody as a highlight,
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.580]   if here's why Apple Fitness is great,
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.820]   they show that it's great for everybody, everybody's welcome,
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:22.820]   everybody will find something that is for their skill level,
[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.580]   their fitness level, and it's to help everybody.
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:26.900]   - Just more fat people.
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:31.060]   I think that it's pretty clear at this point,
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:33.460]   Apple feels like the success of the watch
[00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.300]   is all about health and fitness, yes?
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:36.140]   - Yeah.
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:37.860]   - There was a little bit about other stuff.
[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.780]   - They didn't mention time or single thing.
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.500]   - They didn't mention the time or some reason.
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.860]   The communication features, all that kind of stuff.
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.940]   - It's really a health and fitness device, right?
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.540]   - I think they feel like that's the sweet spot.
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:52.740]   They didn't show music, they didn't show phone calls.
[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:54.900]   - I don't know, no walkie talkie.
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:57.020]   - No, like I'm lackie talkie.
[00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:59.380]   - It's fitness.
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.460]   - Yeah, I mean, I actually find that the Apple Fitness,
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:05.380]   the hard part with the music is that if you play it,
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:07.580]   I constantly have trouble with my watch,
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:09.780]   you know, I'm setting timers for my workout.
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.580]   You know what, I'm not using the Apple Fitness,
[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:13.540]   and it's constantly interacting with my phone,
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:14.780]   it's talking to my headphones,
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:18.620]   and so you're, you know, it's problematic.
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:20.740]   - It also makes perfect sense because I think
[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:22.540]   that a couple of weeks ago, maybe a month ago,
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:25.660]   I saw a market analysis that said that Apple definitely
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:29.020]   owns like the wearable smartwatch market,
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:31.980]   but if you consider them as another entrance
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.820]   in the fitness wearable market,
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:36.300]   they're actually number two behind Jomi.
[00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:37.580]   - That's interesting.
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:38.420]   - Behind you?
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:40.460]   - But at Chinese manufacturers--
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:42.460]   - Oh, shall me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:45.180]   - But that started $50 and go up, so--
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:47.700]   - Yeah, but that's 'cause they have a billion users in China.
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.780]   I mean, I don't see a lot of Xiaomi watches around here.
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:52.940]   - But they're also people coming up from,
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:55.060]   again, Garmin watches are very nice.
[00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:56.660]   - No, if you're a real fitness buff,
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:57.500]   you're doing--
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:58.900]   - But you probably not wearing that watch.
[00:49:58.900 --> 00:49:59.740]   - You played the sprint right,
[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:01.340]   the hardcore fitness buffs are wearing other watches.
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:03.020]   - Well, people are buying, people are also part of the
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:04.540]   extreme success of this watch,
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:05.460]   is that people are buying them,
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:06.660]   even if they don't care about fitness,
[00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:08.900]   'cause it's just a cool watch and it's affordable.
[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:09.820]   So that's--
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:10.980]   - How does it know-- - The number of wins
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:13.300]   of this is-- - How fast your tennis serve is.
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.380]   - That is a really cool-- - Accelerometer.
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:18.140]   - The tennis serve, the golf swing, the--
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:20.780]   - And how does it know-- - I'm sure that the ball went.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:23.020]   - Well, the GPS, you walk to the ball,
[00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:24.980]   or they listen to, "When did you start cursing?"
[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:27.140]   And when did you swim? - Okay, I found it.
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.420]   - Shanked it. - Ping!
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:31.500]   - Yeah, but I can see, I mean, the tennis serve,
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.940]   how fast your serve was, that's pretty cool.
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:34.500]   - That was neat. - 90.
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:35.340]   - That's pretty cool. - Something--
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:36.180]   - Yeah, something that wasn't working.
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:37.020]   - That's really neat.
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:39.260]   - But yeah, that was, this is why I was taking so many notes
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:41.380]   and screenshots that they did spend a lot of time
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:46.260]   to highlight, here is a specific, blessed developer.
[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:48.500]   Epic Games was not included on this list
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:51.580]   that we were gonna show, like, again, here's the iPad mini
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:52.700]   that's doing ultrasounds.
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:54.940]   Here is the Apple Watch that is showing you--
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.020]   I loved that it was a funny segment 'cause they started off
[00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:59.820]   with a, "You know the connection between the body
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:02.900]   and the mind, whoa, how fast do you just hit that shot?"
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:04.340]   89, "Oh my God."
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:06.700]   Anyway, as we center ourselves, like,
[00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:10.580]   "You hit that ball, 279 yards? Wow!"
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.940]   So, again, integrating, also highlighting,
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.380]   it's not just, "We will sell you a watch,"
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:15.620]   but there's a whole bunch of developers
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.540]   with a whole bunch of apps that will support it,
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.700]   which is often the following point of, like,
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:21.540]   a Samsung Watch or one of these other watches
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:22.380]   that I've been mentioning.
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:23.660]   - Knox Harrington points out,
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:26.500]   the number one feature of the Apple Watch.
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.620]   Whenever I lose my iPhone, I just press this button.
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:29.460]   - I love it.
[00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:31.460]   (laughing)
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:34.620]   - And, pro tip, if you press and hold the button,
[00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.820]   it will make the LED on the back of the iPhone flash.
[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.500]   - Oh, wait a minute, I didn't know that.
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:39.460]   That's a good pro tip.
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:41.660]   I should watch iOS today more often.
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:45.420]   With Rosemary Orchard and Mike Osargent, that's a good tip.
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:47.900]   - The one and only time I ever left a phone behind
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:49.540]   at a airport security checkpoint,
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:53.340]   the Apple Watch saved my bacon and told me that,
[00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:54.860]   "Do you want to make your flight
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:56.620]   or do you want to go back and get your phone?"
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:57.460]   (laughing)
[00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:58.620]   "Damn it, I have to go back and get my phone."
[00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.860]   - Oh, please, I was gonna say, "Which did you choose?"
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:02.620]   - I would have, 'cause, honestly,
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:05.820]   I could have been in the air by the time I realized
[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:09.500]   I left my phone behind at that small feature.
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:11.860]   Actually, before I left Apple's phone behind,
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:13.780]   'cause I had a return about a month,
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:15.300]   so that would have been an awkward conversation.
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.820]   Actually, it's at the San Francisco area.
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:19.780]   Just go to the United Terminal.
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:22.700]   - This is that flight, yeah, you gotta definitely miss that flight.
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:23.540]   We're gonna take a little break.
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:25.060]   We're gonna come back to the star of the show, of course.
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:30.060]   The iPhone 13, Andy Anakos here, Rene Ritchie's not.
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:34.060]   He's probably getting briefed, I'm thinking.
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.300]   He always seems to miss these.
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:37.220]   - He's probably taking cinematic videos right now.
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:39.740]   - Yeah, right now, after the events.
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:41.500]   But I'm very pleased to say that
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:44.340]   Mike Asargin agreed to fill in this week from iOS today,
[00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:46.260]   and Tech News Weekly, great to have you,
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:47.220]   and of course, Alex Lindsey,
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.100]   and we're gonna be putting Alex on the spot
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.980]   because there is a lot of cinematic stuff
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:55.020]   in the new iPhone, and we wanna know what you think.
[00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.540]   But first, a word from our sponsor,
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:59.780]   my friend, Kevin Rose, and his new podcast,
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:02.860]   Modern Finance, I'm happy to plug this one.
[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:05.740]   This is a really informative show
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:08.780]   about the new world of finance.
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:11.580]   I'm talking cryptocurrency, NFTs,
[00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:14.220]   robo-investors, decentralized finance.
[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:17.300]   If any of those phrases make you glaze over,
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:19.580]   you gotta listen to Modern Finance.
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:22.340]   Kevin is an expert in this stuff, of course, you know,
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:24.740]   I mean, he seems to know a little bit about money
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:28.140]   after he found a dig, took some of the money he made from that,
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:29.860]   invested it in some other great companies
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:33.940]   like Milk and Pounce, and some little known companies
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:37.020]   like Twitter, and that we're just starting up,
[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:38.780]   and he's done quite well, and that listed
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:41.620]   as a top 25 angel investor by Bloomberg,
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:43.660]   one of the top 25 most influential people
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:44.900]   on the web time magazine.
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:47.860]   He's also at True Ventures, where he is currently,
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:49.460]   always got deal flow, man.
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:52.460]   He's always finding out about the latest and greatest stuff,
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.060]   and whenever I wanna know about something,
[00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:56.820]   I always ask, Kevin, what do you know about this,
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:00.140]   and he always knows, and that's why I love Modern Finance,
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:02.980]   the crypto show for the novice and expert alike.
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:05.140]   I have to say that, it's great to get your feet
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:08.900]   when I learn about this stuff, but if you're already all in
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:13.540]   on Ethereum and NFTs, you will love Modern Finance,
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:15.700]   'cause it keeps you up on all this stuff,
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:18.660]   completely explains it, introduces you
[00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:20.900]   to some of the most interesting people.
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.300]   Kevin interviews top tech experts, entrepreneurs,
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:24.580]   what they do is they do two shows.
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:27.620]   There's a consensus episode that explores the news,
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:30.220]   distills it into digestible information,
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:32.060]   and then the other episode of the week
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:35.500]   is deep interviews with crypto founders and NFT artists,
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:37.580]   the people who are actually on the cutting edge
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:39.580]   of this stuff.
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.140]   If you wanna know what's going on,
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:43.500]   if you hear these terms and you're saying,
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:46.820]   what does it mean, is it important for me to know about,
[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:50.580]   yes, it is, and this is the way to learn Modern Finance.
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:51.700]   You let it listen to it every week,
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:54.500]   you'll find it on every podcast platform,
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:57.980]   you can imagine, you can also go to Modern. Finance on the web,
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:54:59.260]   listen there.
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:01.700]   10 years ago, some people called cryptocurrency a scam,
[00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.020]   five years ago, people thought it was a fad,
[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:05.900]   now it's already a trillion dollar market
[00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:08.220]   and growing the Modern Finance podcast,
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:12.340]   helps you make sense of all the coins, the NFTs, the chaos,
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:15.900]   equip yourself with the knowledge of where things are going.
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:19.340]   It is not, I have to say, it is not easy to understand
[00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:21.460]   the financial landscape, part of the never to navigate,
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:22.540]   but you don't have to do it alone.
[00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:25.780]   Download and subscribe to Modern Finance
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:28.900]   wherever you listen to podcasts, Modern Finance,

[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:37.540]   listen to Modern Finance, get ahead of the future of Finance.
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:39.780]   I listened to episode one of Modern Finance
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.460]   and it was like a light went off,
[00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:43.100]   oh, I get it now, I understand.
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:45.700]   All right, let's thank you Kevin, by the way,
[00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:48.100]   for support in Mac Break Weekly, that's really nice,
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:49.820]   I really appreciate it.
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:52.820]   Let's talk about the iPhone.
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:56.180]   As expected, there are four models,
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:59.340]   the Mini did not go away, I thought that was maybe
[00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:02.100]   on the chopping block, the rumors were the Mini did not
[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:05.460]   sell well in the last year's model,
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:06.820]   but they're still offering it.
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:08.340]   I think if there is a problem with the Mini,
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:11.100]   that it's so close in price to the iPhone 13.
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:13.500]   - Yeah, you might as well go up for most people.
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:15.500]   - Yeah, or it's, well, it's for somebody
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:16.820]   who wants a little phone.
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:17.660]   - Yeah, but it's not that little.
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:18.500]   - But it's not that little.
[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:19.340]   - You only want that tiny phone.
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:20.860]   - Little phones that are less expensive.
[00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:24.180]   I don't know, I just, I think it might be a tough niche to fill.
[00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:29.600]   So the Mini and the 13 all share similar features.
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:33.100]   They've got True Tone, they've got very bright,
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:35.340]   1200 nits of brightness.
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:37.020]   They'll have, of course, the new processor,
[00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:38.900]   the A15 Pionic.
[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:42.460]   This is the five nanometer process, the TSMC,
[00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:43.940]   pioneered for them.
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:47.380]   They are increasing the number of cores.
[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:50.180]   It has, what is it, four efficiency
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:53.340]   and two high performance cores for a total of six.
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:57.260]   The GPU four core GPU, 16 core neural engine.
[00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:58.780]   Supercomputer in your pocket.
[00:56:58.780 --> 00:56:59.620]   - Exactly.
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:01.380]   - But that's always right every year.
[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:02.980]   Yeah, you gotta do that.
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:05.300]   How about the cameras on the 13?
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:07.460]   They're now diagonal and there's two of them.
[00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:08.300]   - Yes.
[00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:10.420]   - Anything to say about those?
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:14.020]   - They are, let's see, I'm trying to remember the size.
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:15.420]   So we've got, you've got your old slide.
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:19.460]   And you're wide together and they're supposed to be better.
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:20.300]   - Post 12 megapixel.
[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:21.660]   - Yes, exactly, getting more light.
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:25.900]   And oh, we did get actual optical image stabilization.
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:28.540]   - OIS now, which was only on the pros,
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:31.340]   is now gone down to the 13s, which is good.
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:33.580]   - Including the Mini, so they were able to pop that
[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:34.900]   into the Mini, which is pretty cool.
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:36.940]   - Don't ride your motorcycle.
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:39.500]   - Yeah, your little motorbike.
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:42.380]   - There was a weird announcement Apple put out last week
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:44.700]   that people who ride motorcycles,
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.060]   anything that vibrates a lot,
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:49.140]   probably should be careful with their phones
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.060]   'cause it destabilizes the OIS.
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:54.580]   - So anywhere in California, where there's light tremors
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:55.420]   all over the night.
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:56.580]   - Or if you live in Petaloma,
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:59.260]   where there's potholes on every street,
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:01.700]   you really don't wanna carry your iPhone with you.
[00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:05.300]   - That's interesting, now they think of it
[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:08.700]   because the big, like, hey, look how cool the camera is,
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:13.220]   video was a moped delivery driver.
[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:14.500]   - Oh, wasn't that a great video though?
[00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:15.860]   - I enjoy your potholes and so,
[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:17.500]   just from Gengen already vibration.
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:19.020]   Yeah, that was very cool.
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:22.180]   Although I did, yeah, that was, again, good demonstration.
[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.820]   - It's, Apple now has raised the bar
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:28.140]   and has to do great production and great ads
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:29.860]   and all of this stuff from there.
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:32.460]   They set the standard, I just saw a Windows 11 ad,
[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:34.580]   and halfway through I'm thinking this is an Apple ad,
[00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:36.700]   and then I realized, oh no, it's Windows.
[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:39.380]   Everybody is trying to aspire to Apple's level
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:41.300]   of production, that's amazing.
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:42.380]   - I think one of the,
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:43.900]   it's a lot to aspire to too.
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:44.900]   - It is.
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:47.100]   - It's a, it's a big, they're playing really hard.
[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:47.940]   - Yeah.
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:49.460]   - Remember that they've been hiring
[00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:51.660]   for real cinematographers and filmmakers
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:55.260]   as full-time Apple employees to shoot their own videos,
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:56.900]   partly to make these great videos,
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:00.140]   but also so they can advise all these engineering teams
[00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:01.940]   on how well this workflow works,
[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:04.260]   what's the sticking point, where the failure points are,
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:07.420]   so no wonder that they make these videos that are,
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:09.580]   that look as good as like, B-Unit footage
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:11.340]   from a Marvel movie because maybe,
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:12.740]   maybe one of the camera operators
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:15.300]   from that Marvel movie is now, has an Apple ad badge.
[00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:19.540]   - It's a pre-orders Friday for delivery
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:21.820]   if you get in there at 5 a.m.
[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:25.380]   Pacifica Friday, you'll have it the following Friday.
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:29.820]   Prices have not changed, same pricing structure.
[00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:32.140]   Couple of things, here's the delivery guy by the way,
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:33.380]   and we can watch that while I talk about it.
[00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:34.940]   - I guess that's not enough vibration
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:36.820]   to be an issue on that moped.
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:37.820]   (laughing)
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:38.660]   - I'm surprised they didn't,
[00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:40.540]   they didn't, you haven't put 'em on an electric.
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:42.420]   It looked, I didn't think it was an electric.
[00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:44.740]   - No, no, it's a Vespa, it looks like, yeah.
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:45.660]   - Yeah.
[00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:49.060]   - So, the biggest thing for me,
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:51.140]   and I think you commented in this too,
[00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:56.060]   like a battery life, like a lot better battery life, right?
[00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:58.460]   They're expanding the size of the battery.
[00:59:58.460 --> 00:59:59.700]   - They're expanding the size of the battery
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:02.740]   while shrinking the size of the notch on these devices.
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:05.140]   This is a 20% smaller for the true depth.
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:06.020]   They're getting better and better
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.940]   at that true depth technology.
[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:08.860]   - Which the best.
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:09.700]   - That's the best part.
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:10.540]   - By the way, that's the best part.
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.380]   - That's the best part.
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:12.740]   You and I both laughed at.
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:14.620]   - Oh yeah, a little tiny bump.
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:16.820]   - The guy, it looks like it's fast and furious.
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.940]   He's gonna be going over a very big bump
[01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:20.580]   and getting some air.
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:22.500]   No, it's just a little curve.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:25.060]   - And they did that a couple times
[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:26.700]   where they do this thing that's really cinematic
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.340]   and then they go, boom, boom, boom.
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:30.420]   And it was a really good touch.
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:31.260]   - It's self-mocking.
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.100]   - It's been created four times.
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:33.740]   - Which is important because when you do something
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:37.940]   this fancy, you don't want to be putting people off.
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:39.620]   - The pretension, remember?
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:41.380]   - The director was talking about how shooting
[01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:43.260]   with the iPhone is less pretentious.
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:44.100]   - Less pretentious.
[01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:45.620]   - They kind of seem to be going for that over.
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:47.260]   - Man, the camera quality.
[01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:49.860]   Night mode now in all three, well on the pro
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:52.100]   and in all two on the standard.
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:53.460]   Really, it really looks good.
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.420]   And no, it does not make your moped fly,
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:57.860]   but that's a little cinematic license.
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:58.700]   - That's a service.
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.380]   - Dress for the slide, not for the ride, man.
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:01.220]   - 39.99. - Let's do a vision.
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:02.460]   Did I mention that?
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:05.500]   - I did mention when we were watching these pictures
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.220]   that I always take it with a grain of salt
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:08.980]   'cause they use the best photographers.
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:12.780]   And I think they use studio lighting in these pictures.
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:16.300]   So it's not, well, that's fair play, I think.
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.100]   I think it's also fair that I don't know
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.860]   whether they did it in the iPhone 13,
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:23.420]   but they definitely did the iPhone Pro demos
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.140]   where not only are they showing you the pictures,
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:26.860]   but they're also showing you the capture data
[01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:28.140]   in a little box next to it.
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.900]   So you can see, well, what ISO did you choose?
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.780]   What was the-- - I love that.
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:32.620]   What was the-- - What was the--
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:33.460]   - Thank you for doing that.
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.460]   - Super small, so-- - It was MTV style.
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:36.980]   - But it's there.
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:37.820]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:39.460]   - We have a back and look at 'em.
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.580]   - The other thing that I think that we should all notice
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:44.380]   is that they did a really good job of,
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:46.500]   they didn't call any attention to it,
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.460]   but all of the demo photos were showing
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:51.220]   a really wide range of skin tones.
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:53.620]   That this has been historically a failure
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:56.300]   of the basic engineering of image processors
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:02:00.420]   and image sensor that the engineers who designed these
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:03.900]   were all white people and for decades, even for film,
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:06.820]   the test for how well does this film or does the sensor work
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:10.220]   has always been a test card with white people in it.
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:13.580]   So as a result, darker skin does not show up very, very well.
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:16.700]   So they did a very, very good job of quietly mentioning
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:18.220]   that, hey, look, we've got, we've got,
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:21.900]   we had one shot where it was like a tone map
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.980]   of four or five different people, different skin tones,
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:25.820]   so they would call good all these ones where,
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:28.020]   when they did the, I also noticed that,
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.260]   we haven't talked about cinematic mode,
[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:32.500]   we're definitely, when we turned the stage over to Alex,
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:35.020]   but the lead character in the murder mystery video
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:37.820]   had very, very dark skin, which was again,
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.460]   a way of demonstrating look how beautiful
[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:41.060]   and natural these skin tones are.
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:43.180]   And just quietly, the next time,
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.420]   if the Pixel 6 comes out and they're talking about
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:49.100]   how good their camera is, make sure that you take demo
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:51.900]   pictures with people who are not Conan O'Brien white.
[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.140]   I think how well they prefer.
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:56.780]   Google's been very, if that Google brought it up.
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:57.620]   Exactly.
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:00.220]   So I think this is, you know, Apple didn't mention it,
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:02.300]   but you're exactly right, I actually brought it up
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:03.300]   during this stream.
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:05.220]   There are a lot of people of color in their images.
[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:09.460]   This is the multi-cultural picture
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:11.300]   that you were talking about, I think Andy.
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:13.740]   And yeah, everybody looks great,
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.820]   and nobody looks scarily dark,
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:18.700]   which is the problem with film in the old days.
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:20.700]   So yeah, I think this is something that's been solved now,
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.060]   which is great.
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:23.500]   And it just keeps on getting better.
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.020]   I mean, we have that many engineers working on a camera.
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:28.340]   It is just insane how fast.
[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:29.180]   This is for us.
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:32.220]   You know, every time we move forward with all the cameras,
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:35.260]   you know, I would say, I mean, most of the top,
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:38.340]   both Android and iPhone, but it's just amazing what,
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:40.220]   I mean, there's times when I take pictures now
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:42.300]   that I just randomly take a photo with my camera,
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:47.220]   with my, I took some photos in the shore in Hatteras,
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:50.180]   and I was just stunned, you know,
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:51.780]   by what I was getting out of my phone.
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:53.940]   Well, at this point, especially if you get a pro,
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:56.340]   I'm feeling like you don't need to bring your camera kit
[01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:57.260]   anymore with you.
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:00.980]   I, you have, you have 77 millimeters zoom,
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:03.300]   you have a wide angle, I still bring it.
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:06.420]   I guess for some, for control.
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:09.300]   Yeah, I was going to say, I went on a 18 mile hike
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:11.340]   over the weekend and I thought about break,
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:14.140]   because of us to Alamere Falls, which is one of only
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:16.100]   two tide falls in all of North America,
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:19.460]   which is a waterfall that falls into the ocean directly.
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:23.860]   And the Alamere Falls hike at Point Reyes is like 18 miles,
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.980]   nine there, nine back.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:28.940]   And, you know, I thought I might want to bring my camera
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:31.940]   because I really want to capture some good photos of it.
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:33.940]   But when you're hiking 18 miles,
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:34.860]   you also don't have all that.
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:35.780]   That's right with you.
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:38.140]   So I just brought my iPhone 12 Pro Max
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:40.940]   and the photos and videos that I took with this thing,
[01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:42.580]   exceptional, they look awesome.
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:43.500]   I'm really happy with them.
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.460]   And I didn't have to pack that extra camera.
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:50.260]   This I'm super pumped because now I've got a macro photo.
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:51.540]   That was a big.
[01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:52.380]   I guess.
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:53.540]   Two centimeters.
[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:54.380]   Two centimeters.
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:55.220]   I love Max.
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:56.820]   Like on that, that's amazing.
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:59.820]   Just like the ultra wide opened up a whole range of photography
[01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:04.020]   that people were kind of accustomed to not being able to do.
[01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:06.700]   Like again, I'm in a beautiful,
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:10.300]   like a lot of the rooms at the Boston Public Library.
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:13.020]   There are murals that go all the way around
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.780]   and not having to choose, okay,
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:17.180]   which little part of this do I want to take a picture of?
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:18.300]   But if you have ultra wide,
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:19.900]   you can actually get a sense of the space.
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.060]   Also, you can get everybody in the picture
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:24.060]   when you're at a restaurant together.
[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:25.580]   This is the same thing that's going to happen
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:26.740]   with macro photography,
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:28.140]   that there are times when there's just,
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:30.180]   there is something that maybe you don't want to get,
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.740]   see what I color this CC fly has.
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:34.740]   Maybe you just want to take a close picture
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:36.780]   of somebody's engagement ring, you know?
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:37.620]   That seems so--
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:38.460]   - You're not even.
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:39.300]   - But no longer.
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:41.660]   - Remember, the market for this is not pros as much,
[01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:42.580]   even though they push it.
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:44.020]   It's for normal people.
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:45.900]   What do you think, Alex, about the styles?
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.300]   'Cause this feels like to me--
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:48.940]   - It's an Instagram filter.
[01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:50.380]   - Instagram filters.
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.260]   - But with dials.
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.180]   - With dials.
[01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:54.020]   - Yeah.
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:54.860]   - So the thing is that,
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:57.140]   I felt like when they did pro,
[01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:59.220]   they were grasping a little bit.
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:01.460]   So it was like, maybe, you know?
[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:03.020]   It was kind of like the pro is going to love this.
[01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:05.180]   I was like, well, maybe the pro might be entertained by it.
[01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:06.020]   But I was--
[01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:08.300]   - Well, up pros carry, historically pros
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:09.900]   have always carried a point and shoot or something.
[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:14.420]   Simple camera in addition to their Canon 1D.
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:16.060]   - Yeah, I didn't, there was like,
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:17.940]   when they say pros will love it,
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.020]   I think of like, Filmic Pro.
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:20.860]   I think about--
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:21.860]   - Yeah, that's a lot of--
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:23.700]   - Yeah, like there's a lot of control.
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:24.540]   - There's a lot of control.
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.740]   - So, yeah, so the thing is is that,
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:30.300]   but there's, what was really interesting was the fact
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:31.940]   that you can sit there and dial something in.
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:34.020]   This is the way I like my photos to look.
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:36.940]   And instead of having to process it every single time,
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:38.380]   you know, to look like that, you know,
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:39.260]   it'll just do it that way.
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:41.620]   But it's not just some built in like watercolor
[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:44.300]   or gray or silver or whatever.
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.180]   You get to design your look.
[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:47.900]   And I do think that they had a point there.
[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.420]   If you're putting stuff up on Instagram,
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:51.100]   if you're putting stuff up on Facebook
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:52.700]   or to your friends or whatever,
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:53.660]   and you have a certain look
[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:56.540]   and you are particular, you can set that.
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:58.100]   And then it just, you're just shooting things
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:06:59.140]   in the look that you like
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:00.940]   or the look that you want for that show.
[01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:03.420]   And I think that that's really powerful,
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:05.300]   especially when you think about shooting
[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:06.580]   and posting really fast
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:09.300]   and not having to do any kind of post-process.
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:11.020]   - And also, and also the, again,
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:12.060]   there's another one of those things
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:15.380]   where they said a lot of words that are syllables,
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:17.460]   definitely, they were definitely a string of syllables.
[01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:18.460]   We have to wait for a couple weeks
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:19.900]   to see what they actually meant.
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:21.500]   But they did mention that it's not like,
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:22.980]   it's not like an Instagram filter.
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:25.540]   They really are allowing you to have an influence
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:29.540]   on the actual pipeline inside the hardware
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:30.860]   for how it processes photos.
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:31.700]   And it's not just about,
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:33.220]   "Hey, I really, really want this to be,
[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.900]   "I want the blues to be really, really wacky,
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:37.820]   "and I want the highlights to be really, really weird."
[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:40.660]   Oftentimes, people, pro photographers,
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:42.300]   even when they're just taking snapshots
[01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:44.180]   like at a family wedding just for fun
[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:45.860]   or they're taking selfies of their own food,
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:47.980]   they still can't help but see the photos
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:49.580]   with their own professional lines.
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:50.820]   And so many times,
[01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:54.180]   when a professional photo blog reviews a phone,
[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.100]   they'll say, "My God, when will Apple stop
[01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:58.620]   "like over sharpening every single picture that comes out?"
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:07:59.620]   And now you'll be able to say,
[01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:01.220]   "Look, don't over sharpen it."
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:03.700]   Like, turn the sharpening down a little bit.
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:05.540]   And if you really do like the sort of
[01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.420]   Fuji versus Kodak look,
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:08.820]   you don't have to post process it.
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:10.140]   It will be part of the ProRes,
[01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:12.860]   part of the camera, part of the raw file
[01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:15.380]   that is going to be baked into every single backup
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:17.260]   you make of this photo for the next 10 years.
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.220]   It will be a little bit of focus.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.340]   It's not terribly sharp.
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:22.540]   The greens are not super, super punchy,
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:24.980]   but the blues are a little, little bit crispy.
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:26.220]   And if that's the way you like it,
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:27.100]   you can set that as a mode.
[01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:28.460]   And like I said, set it and forget it.
[01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:29.660]   You don't have to keep doing this over and over.
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:31.900]   - So these styles are kind of interesting
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:33.460]   'cause it is essentially filters,
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:37.940]   but they say it adjusts in the right area.
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:41.100]   So the skin tones don't get adjusted,
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:42.940]   but the background gets adjusted.
[01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:44.620]   And you can choose this and save it.
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.740]   And then you can see you have dials, as you said,
[01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:48.340]   so you can tune it.
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:50.260]   And then you can save it as your style.
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:51.260]   So you make your own personal style.
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:52.180]   - Which I think is interesting.
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:53.500]   - And then you can up it or down it.
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:54.340]   - Yeah.
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:55.180]   - I think about--
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:56.020]   - That's for amateurs.
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.020]   It's not for pros, but it's still interesting.
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:08:58.860]   - You think about--
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:00.180]   - But particular amateurs.
[01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:02.300]   You know, like, you know, and the thing is
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:03.780]   that one of the things I have is amateurs.
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:06.060]   - I was just talking to a friend of mine who's a colorist
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:06.900]   a couple of days ago,
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:08.060]   and that's what they're talking about,
[01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.060]   is get the skin tones right,
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:09.900]   and then everything else,
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:10.980]   people will put up with it just about anything
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:11.780]   you would do with the photo
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:14.140]   as long as the skin looks like it belongs there.
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:15.140]   - Right, right.
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:17.980]   - You get that even with infrared photography,
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:21.060]   where they've got the weird red trees and everything,
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:23.060]   but everybody looks okay in them.
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:23.900]   - Right.
[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:24.740]   - Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:25.580]   I hadn't considered that.
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.380]   I like this, I like the styles thing,
[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:29.820]   but I think like with what Leo said
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:31.540]   is how I tend to feel,
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:33.180]   I want that photo taken in raw
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:34.740]   so that I can make those adjustments later
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:36.060]   and capture that capturing what I want.
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:37.500]   - And you have halite too and things.
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:38.340]   So you have option--
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:39.180]   - You have option.
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:40.020]   - Option light room is a game changer.
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:43.300]   Light room, if you like things the way you like them,
[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:45.260]   the light room is going to give you what you like.
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:49.700]   - The front facing camera too has changed quite a bit.
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:52.540]   In fact, it's more and more powerful,
[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:54.580]   which I think is interesting to ask.
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:57.660]   Night mode selfies, smart HDR4.
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:00.580]   Deep fusion is in the front camera as well.
[01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:02.020]   - Yeah, I'm sorry,
[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:03.860]   that's something we didn't talk about with the iPads
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:04.700]   that I thought was interesting.
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:05.860]   They've really shifted from,
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:07.140]   hey, this is a selfie camera
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:08.740]   that you probably are gonna use too.
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:10.740]   No, this is now a really important part
[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:11.620]   of the whole experience
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:12.860]   because this is what you're gonna be using
[01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:14.460]   for video chats and for meetings.
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.740]   So we are giving you that ultra wide lens.
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:18.340]   - What do they call that feature?
[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:19.180]   - Sender stage.
[01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:21.820]   - I love that feature.
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:23.140]   I think people really like that feature.
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:24.260]   They really love to talk.
[01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:26.940]   That's like the Ted Lasso of camera features.
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:28.260]   (laughing)
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:29.420]   - I will say that I feel like
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:32.180]   the center stage does a little too much headroom.
[01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:33.020]   Like it's--
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:33.860]   - I agree with you.
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:34.700]   I've noticed that too.
[01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:36.780]   - It's like a grapple about that.
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:38.100]   (laughing)
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:38.940]   - It just drips the little--
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:39.860]   - It puts your eyes in the middle.
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:41.660]   No, no, I think it's literally putting your eyes
[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:43.220]   in the middle and it should put your eyes
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:44.460]   closer to the top.
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:46.660]   - Well, really, I think that the eye should be right at the--
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:47.980]   If you look at this,
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:50.260]   this is my top third.
[01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:52.820]   You know, the line right between the middle third
[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:55.060]   and the top third is where I want my eyes most of the time
[01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:55.900]   when I'm doing stuff.
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:58.020]   And I want my chest port center though.
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.460]   - Yeah, yeah, and so,
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:00.740]   but I think that that's where my--
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:04.460]   But I don't like using up a lot of the headroom there.
[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:05.780]   And I think that's the only complaint.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:06.940]   I've kind of stopped,
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:08.220]   I got really excited about center stage
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:09.060]   and I just stopped using it
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:10.700]   'cause I don't like the headroom.
[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.780]   - I just don't call people--
[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:14.300]   - I don't understand what--
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:17.780]   - I use it, so in office hours, we cook together.
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:19.780]   - Oh, that's perfect for this.
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:22.820]   - And so I put it up and it wasn't quite wide enough
[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:25.060]   and again, there's a lot of headroom.
[01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:26.380]   And so I, you know--
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:27.220]   - I use it with my mom.
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:28.540]   But I did notice that headroom thing,
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:30.420]   but maybe that's 'cause you and I, you know,
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:31.340]   if you look at broadcast--
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:32.180]   - We're gonna get you a second.
[01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:33.020]   - And we're a little bit above the center.
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:33.860]   - We're gonna get you a second.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:35.020]   - But that's kind of the sense now.
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:36.380]   And there's not that many people who,
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:38.380]   like if you look at the way you see things on YouTube
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:40.620]   or you see, you know, people would rather
[01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:42.340]   typically cut their head off
[01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.300]   than be too low in frame at this point.
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.140]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:45.980]   - But I think you look short.
[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:49.100]   - Think about the difficulty of like having,
[01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:52.620]   doing a live stream with your mom
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:55.260]   and your six or seven year old will not stay put.
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:56.700]   It's nice to have, it will know, okay,
[01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:57.780]   I'm gonna have to write it out.
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:59.820]   It doesn't care if you have an excellent point
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:03.020]   for people who really want great looking video.
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:04.940]   - I think people are aware of it, but it solves a problem
[01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:05.780]   that--
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:08.460]   - It's really such a forefront,
[01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:10.660]   it's such a foreground technology
[01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:11.740]   'cause you're on this call
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:13.820]   and all of a sudden it starts drifting around.
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:15.140]   So I think people are aware of it.
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:16.460]   I don't know if it's something that people
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:18.380]   are gonna go out and buy a new iPad.
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:19.220]   - Yeah, no.
[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:20.380]   - I just think it's a nice--
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:21.220]   - It's nice.
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:22.060]   - It's not, it's nice.
[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:24.140]   - When it activates you go, okay, this is great.
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:26.700]   - It's not a selling point, but it does create
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:28.180]   that connection with the device.
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:29.020]   - I agree.
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:30.860]   - It's just kind of, it's just one more thing.
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:31.700]   - It's the great thing that, yeah.
[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:35.340]   - Yep, it makes it feel like this costs more money
[01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:37.140]   than an Amazon fire tablet.
[01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:37.980]   - It's pretty much.
[01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:40.620]   - But it was, but it's doing so much more.
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:42.140]   That helps me out in so many situations
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:43.060]   than an Amazon fire tablet.
[01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:46.700]   - All the phones now start with 128 gigs of storage.
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:48.860]   Come on, long way from the eight gig iPhones
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:50.220]   and the 16 gig iPhone.
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:52.660]   I think, yeah, you're right, we need that.
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:53.780]   - It was far behind.
[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:54.620]   - That's probably, I would say,
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:56.620]   800-twigs for most people is probably enough,
[01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:58.340]   unless you're shooting a lot of 4K video.
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:59.620]   - It's nice that they're doing this along
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.420]   with the next version of iOS,
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:05.460]   which has a feature where if you don't have enough storage
[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.740]   on your phone when you make an update
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:09.460]   to the next version of iOS,
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:11.460]   instead of you having to go and find a computer somewhere
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:13.580]   to back up or do the update,
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:18.580]   Apple will give you, is it two months of iCloud storage?
[01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:21.660]   It's some amount of time.
[01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:22.500]   It's a short amount of time,
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:23.700]   but not a super short amount of time,
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:26.140]   but basically you get a chunk of iCloud storage
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:28.180]   that they will sort of keep your stuff on
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:29.340]   while you make the update,
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:30.580]   and then they give you enough time
[01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:33.100]   to where you can migrate back to your normal storage
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:34.180]   if you don't want to go up.
[01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:36.980]   So not only is that a moment where they can try to say,
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:38.060]   "Hey, maybe you just want to go ahead
[01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:39.260]   "and pay for this iCloud storage,"
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:40.660]   and you now you have more room.
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:43.900]   But I love this as a feature for folks
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:44.940]   who are trying to make that upgrade,
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:46.300]   but they can't afford,
[01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:48.300]   and so they are able to do that
[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:50.220]   without needing to go find a computer to plug into
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:51.060]   or what have you.
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.540]   - Parenthetically, I probably should mention
[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:56.340]   that there was a yesterday an iOS update to 1480.
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:58.100]   It's a security patch.
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:01.860]   You want to get this 14.8 on all of your devices
[01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:03.940]   'cause there's a zero day that they're fixing.
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.660]   - When the New York Times goes for a clickbake,
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:10.260]   yes, update your Apple OS right now.
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:11.580]   I mean now.
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:12.660]   - Okay.
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:13.900]   - It's probably worth mentioning.
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:16.140]   - Even though you know you're gonna get on the 20th,
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:18.340]   you're gonna be getting iOS 15.
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:19.860]   - No, you might want to, you know.
[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:20.700]   - Between now and then.
[01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:21.540]   - Between now and then.
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.420]   - Ah, so solve the old security holes
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:25.620]   before you install the new security holes this week.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:26.460]   - That's my belief.
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:29.620]   - The pro models come in 6.1 and 6.7 inches.
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:31.940]   I think that's exactly the same as before,
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:32.940]   but you get a little more screen
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:35.180]   'cause you have a little bit smaller notch.
[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:36.820]   I don't think any changes in the bezel.
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:38.940]   I really do wish they'd put that fingerprint,
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:42.260]   a touch ID reader in the switch there.
[01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:44.460]   - That's something I've been really thinking about,
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:46.060]   that how committed is Apple going to be
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:48.220]   to continuing Face ID?
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:50.300]   'Cause certainly people wearing masks
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:53.060]   through Apple for a loop just like everybody else.
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:55.020]   It made that feature a lot less useful
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:56.980]   than they thought it was gonna be a few years ago.
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:58.620]   And it looks like we're gonna be stuck with masks
[01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:00.500]   for a good long time.
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.300]   And also, if you took a poll of,
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:04.340]   now there's so many of us
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:06.540]   that have had the experience of having phones
[01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:09.900]   that do fingerprint ID and some that do Face ID
[01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:11.100]   on lots of different devices.
[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:14.060]   And I can't honestly say that I prefer the Face ID
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:16.500]   on my iPad Pro to a touch ID,
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:18.860]   I can't or anywhere else.
[01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:21.940]   It's nice, but if they decided to simply give back
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:24.100]   the screen real estate and put a fingerprint reader
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:25.780]   on the sleep wake button,
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:28.700]   I don't think I would be at all upset about it.
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:30.620]   - I think I'd like to see both.
[01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:34.300]   So, you can just choose one or the other.
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:36.260]   Or both and say, I wanna have,
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:38.260]   like I'm going overseas,
[01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:40.100]   I wanna just turn both of them on.
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:41.260]   And now it's like,
[01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:43.420]   - I use that on my Samsung flip phone,
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:44.660]   it has both finger and face,
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:46.620]   and I really like having finger
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:48.460]   because sometimes I'm wearing a mask
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:51.180]   or sometimes I'm at night and I'm sleeping in my head,
[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:53.100]   it's like this, and my face is almost crunched up.
[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:54.660]   And it says, "Who the hell are you?"
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:56.300]   And it's me, it's me.
[01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:57.940]   - It's me during winter glove season.
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:58.940]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:01.500]   - The new camera, yeah, it's good to have the option, I guess.
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.620]   And since Apple's shown they have this technology,
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:04.460]   they could do it.
[01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:05.300]   - Right.
[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:06.580]   - As soon as I saw it on the iPad, I was like,
[01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:08.580]   okay, why are we not getting this on the phone?
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:10.100]   - You know, yeah.
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:11.420]   - Boy, big apertures,
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:16.020]   they've really increased the apertures up to F1.5 now
[01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:19.460]   on the normal lens on the iPhone Pro Max, that's,
[01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:22.300]   or Pro, that's spectacular.
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:23.140]   - Yeah.
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:23.980]   - Improved.
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:24.820]   - They're really attacking
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:27.700]   one of the most persistent weaknesses of camera phones,
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:30.460]   which is okay, but what if the light isn't great?
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:32.580]   What if you aren't in a studio
[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.900]   that you use when you're shooting photo demos
[01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:36.340]   for the company?
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:37.900]   - And it's on every lens too.
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:40.260]   The wide used to be kind of the laggard
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:43.340]   in all of the super wide, but now it's got it as well.
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:46.740]   I like the idea of an ultra wide low light photo.
[01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:48.660]   - Well, we can put that up with the sky
[01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:51.460]   and you take that ultra wide night mode photo.
[01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:52.980]   Oh my God, that's gonna be gorgeous.
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:55.060]   - Plus the telephoto is now 77,
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:56.980]   which I think is finally we're getting
[01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:59.180]   in a focal length, Alex, you can say,
[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:00.220]   you have an A on this.
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:02.740]   We're finally getting into a portrait length, focal length.
[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:04.540]   I think that's a really good,
[01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:06.180]   I like to hit the longer length.
[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:08.100]   - Andy, is it gonna be good for squirrels?
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:08.940]   (laughing)
[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:09.780]   - Much better.
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:11.180]   - I haven't been back yet.
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:13.940]   I still have to go back to the bubble.
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:14.860]   - Are you telling me the squirrels
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:15.700]   I'm not joking.
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:16.540]   - I'm not joking.
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:19.260]   - I have a Ziploc bag full of almonds,
[01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:22.660]   not sunflower seeds, almonds waiting for my next.
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:27.500]   - I'd be happy though, if they added a 6X and a .25
[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.220]   and just had a bunch of like a little cluster
[01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:30.900]   of lenses up there and be totally fine for them.
[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:32.820]   - Well Samsung now has, it's not optical,
[01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:36.100]   but has a 100X zoom and it's actually surprisingly good.
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:36.940]   It's not optical.
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:38.140]   I don't know what their optical limit is,
[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:40.340]   but Samsung really has pushed that limit.
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:44.100]   I guess, you know, 3X optical is pretty darn good
[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:46.700]   for a lens that size and a body that size.
[01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:47.860]   - Yeah, more thing to be honest,
[01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:51.260]   I'm glad that Apple is embracing the camera bump
[01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:54.980]   'cause again, I remember the first Windows Nokia
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:57.100]   made this incredible camera phone
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:00.100]   with it had almost like half of an Oreo cookie
[01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:01.100]   on the side of it,
[01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:02.260]   to accommodate all the lenses
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:04.860]   and the actual strobe flash
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:09.860]   and got so much heat from like Apple design, you know,
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:12.780]   purists, but oh my God, Apple would never do something
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:14.380]   like that, but now we're in the position where,
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:16.460]   well actually if we give it a little bit of a bump,
[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:18.380]   we could do so much with the camera system.
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:21.420]   So maybe we will not, we will not like,
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:24.140]   we'll spend some time on our Victorian fading to couch
[01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:26.620]   about how the back is not a smooth piece of glass anymore,
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:28.500]   but after that, we're gonna take some awesome pictures
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:29.340]   with this.
[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:30.180]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:32.180]   - And you know, that's one of the number one things
[01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:33.020]   that you're buying a camera for.
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:35.020]   I'm ready for them to just add, you know,
[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:36.940]   you have the iPhone, you have the iPhone Pro,
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:38.380]   then you have the iPhone PL,
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:39.660]   which is the full PL mount,
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:41.540]   just the screw with this all in.
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:43.700]   But this is a standard, you just like pop it out.
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:45.820]   - For serious photographers, that's what was always missing
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:47.700]   and there were some things that were missing
[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:49.180]   in camera phones.
[01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:51.940]   First it was shutter lag, they solved that a long time ago,
[01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:53.780]   then it was a variety of focal lengths,
[01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:57.180]   they've got that now, and low light mode,
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:00.180]   wide wide apertures, they're getting more and wider.
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:03.100]   It's getting, a macro is another one that was missing.
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:05.220]   I mean, it's getting to the point where this phone now
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:08.460]   is gonna do a lot of what I wanna pro camera to do.
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:10.500]   - And I will admit, we were talking about this earlier,
[01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:13.220]   I take out my camera every once in a while,
[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:16.420]   my Canon every once in a while,
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:18.940]   and take great photos with it with zoom lenses.
[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:20.460]   I have a little zoom lens that take photos.
[01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:21.780]   - Wow, that's great.
[01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:23.180]   - They're still at a whole different level,
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:24.540]   what do I do on a day to day basis,
[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:25.660]   what do I do when we go to the beach,
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.140]   what do I do when we go out?
[01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:28.980]   I just take my phone, I'm all about that.
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:31.700]   - And I know how, just the SLR just feels like
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.420]   I gotta be serious about this,
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:36.900]   because I still do it, because it still takes better photos.
[01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:38.420]   - For me, it's, I will wait.
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:39.700]   - I will wait a 400 with a double or, you know,
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:40.540]   I can take really good photos.
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:43.020]   - For me, it comes down to control.
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:44.780]   It's not necessarily the images are better,
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:47.460]   but I have more control over the image,
[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:51.380]   I can modify the aperture, it's just more control.
[01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:54.900]   Any smartphone, even if you're shooting in the manual mode,
[01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:58.300]   you just don't have as much control as you do with a real camera.
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:01.660]   - But again, what I adore about the way that all engineers
[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:05.060]   who design smartphone cameras approach this,
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:07.380]   this is all about push one button
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:09.180]   and get the best image possible.
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:11.060]   This is, this was even occurring to me
[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:14.180]   when they were demonstrating the cinematic mode,
[01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:17.300]   where a lot of, I did have to tweet something snarky
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:20.180]   about this could become like the star wipe of amateur,
[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:22.300]   like iPhone videos, oh God, they're doing more,
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:25.780]   more focus pulls, like every time something happens.
[01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:28.220]   But in terms of, I just wanna shoot a picture,
[01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:31.300]   I just wanna shoot great video of my kids' birthday party
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:32.620]   or my kids' whatever.
[01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:35.260]   And the fact that it knows that, hey, there's something,
[01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:37.660]   it suspects there's something of interest in the foreground,
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:40.420]   so I'll keep the foreground sharp and blur the background.
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:43.260]   But as soon as somebody leaves the frame or turns around,
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:44.620]   hey, I'm gonna make sure that the background
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:46.700]   or whatever they're looking at is now in sharp focus.
[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:50.300]   That's something that they obviously highlighted
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:54.220]   how impressed professional cinematographers are for this,
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:56.340]   but it could be the sort of thing where, again,
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:58.780]   just the person who I just wanna tap one button to start,
[01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:00.420]   one button to stop and get a beautiful,
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:01.740]   get the best video possible.
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:02.780]   I'm not even gonna edit it,
[01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:05.300]   I'm just gonna be putting this into my social media
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:08.940]   or straight into an iMessage or FaceTime to somebody.
[01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:11.100]   - And I'm curious as to whether that's a live feed
[01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:12.940]   that can go out of the camera,
[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:14.980]   so you're something like Filming Pro,
[01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:17.020]   like that's your new webcam.
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:19.660]   Just stick it on there and watch it.
[01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:21.260]   So I think that it's a really interesting--
[01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:24.340]   - So Alex, let's talk about this cinematic mode,
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:26.300]   this pull focus mode.
[01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:30.060]   Here's Apple's demonstration of it on their webpage.
[01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:36.540]   One problem, of course, is that the camera
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:39.500]   is deciding what to focus on.
[01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:41.980]   Now there is a manual touch mode you can use,
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:43.500]   in fact, there's a tracking mode,
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:44.340]   which is kinda cool,
[01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:46.700]   you could touch somebody to say, track this face.
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:48.700]   But I have to say, I don't know,
[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:53.700]   wait to be seen how well that's gonna work.
[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:55.940]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that for someone who,
[01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:58.540]   an average person throwing together a movie
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:00.980]   for film school or for high school or--
[01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:03.340]   - It's gonna pull focus and you don't even know it.
[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:04.180]   - It could work really well,
[01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:05.740]   and you just be like, wow, this looks great.
[01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:08.220]   I think that there's also probably going to be APIs
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:10.620]   that we can use that people can have more control.
[01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:14.180]   Like what's happening here is we're giving the developers
[01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:16.100]   a whole bunch of new tools that they're gonna be able
[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:18.180]   to go in there and say, okay, well, and again--
[01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:19.180]   - But that comes back to that--
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:20.100]   - As a company like Filmic Pro,
[01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.020]   we'll take that and run with it.
[01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:24.380]   - That comes back to my point with control.
[01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:27.180]   Like I go to a pro camera 'cause then I choose.
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:30.340]   But an amateur may be racking focus
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:32.140]   and not even knowing it, right?
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:34.100]   It's just, wow, how'd you get a rack focus in there?
[01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:35.460]   What's that?
[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:36.940]   And so that's kinda cool.
[01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:39.940]   They said something else, and I wanna ask Alex
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:42.460]   about this one, the only smartphone that lets you edit
[01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:45.460]   the depth effect after you shoot.
[01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:47.500]   - Yeah, so when I saw it, I was like,
[01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:48.980]   I wonder if they're gonna give us that information?
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:51.540]   And then I saw it, I was like, oh, I have to buy this phone.
[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:52.620]   (laughing)
[01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:53.900]   Like it was done.
[01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:55.820]   So what they're doing is they're saving all that depth
[01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:58.100]   information in video format as well,
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:01.180]   so that you have all that data, so that you can go back later
[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:03.060]   and I haven't seen any.
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:06.660]   I mean, I have seen other technologies that do that,
[01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:08.020]   but never in a phone.
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:11.100]   - Is the phone recording multiple depths?
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:14.140]   - Kind of, it's like the old ray tracing or what it was
[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:15.780]   so close. - It's creating the,
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:18.900]   so it can calculate out that the depth of everything
[01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:20.100]   in front of it. - But is it blurring?
[01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:22.820]   So it's software blur than not.
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:25.820]   - Yeah, it's software blur, but it's pretty good.
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:27.940]   And the place that you're seeing it have trouble,
[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:29.780]   even if you look at the demos that they have there
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:32.140]   are the blonde hair, the white hair,
[01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:33.940]   the areas where there's not as much contrast,
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:38.140]   you'll see little blurry wisps that are still going on.
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:40.260]   So that's still happening just a little bit.
[01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:41.100]   - And that's what we've seen.
[01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:43.020]   - Yeah. - And that's really, really hard.
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:45.500]   I mean, that is the, and so that's why,
[01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.700]   in many cases you would not use this
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:50.460]   in a professional environment because it's not giving you
[01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:54.740]   that true depth of field that said in the right environments
[01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:59.740]   shot well, for the right things, it could work really well.
[01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:03.140]   And it could be really, really fun to shoot a lot of things.
[01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:05.780]   And again, it makes it so much more fun just to go out
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:07.500]   and take pictures, little movies with your kids.
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:09.660]   And again, TikToks and YouTubes
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:12.100]   and all kinds of other stuff that'll be a lot of fun.
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:14.660]   - Again, that's what I kept in.
[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:17.820]   I wouldn't say that my eyes glaze over when they talk
[01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:19.860]   during all these demos where year after year
[01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:23.300]   they show again, professional videographers who probably
[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:27.660]   have, they keep like a 48K red camera in the trunk
[01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:30.700]   of their car for just for giggles saying,
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:32.980]   oh no, of course, I'm gonna use this $1000 smartphone
[01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:35.180]   for these big, big cinematic projects I have.
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:36.980]   And maybe, again, maybe they do, maybe they don't.
[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:39.620]   I'm not very aware of that.
[01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:43.220]   But the fact that, again, somebody who's just shooting
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:46.380]   a birthday video that suddenly people don't,
[01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:49.740]   the people watching it either on their phones via FaceTime
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:53.180]   or like 10 years later, they don't know why it looks so good.
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:55.900]   They don't know why it has more of a filmic effect
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:57.980]   because, and the person who shot it has no idea
[01:24:57.980 --> 01:24:59.100]   why it looks that good.
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:00.980]   They just know that, well, all I did was I pushed
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:03.260]   this big red button and I just tried to keep my thumb
[01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:05.380]   over that big camera bump and that's all I did.
[01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:06.700]   And it absolutely worked.
[01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:10.260]   So Alex, when it's, when it's doing it live,
[01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:13.300]   is it still just doing blur or is it actually now
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:17.020]   doing changing the focus in camera?
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:17.900]   No, it's blurring.
[01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:19.340]   I mean, it's still a blur.
[01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:20.180]   It's stir a blur.
[01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:21.500]   It's a, it's like a blur.
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:22.980]   It's just like a portrait mode.
[01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:24.980]   Just like, it's portrait mode, but it,
[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:25.820]   that's what I think is.
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:28.940]   Portrait mode 30 frames a second, which is pretty impressive.
[01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:29.780]   Amazing.
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:33.260]   I mean, you know, just, it's just blurring.
[01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:36.420]   It's just blurring, like in real time, in 30 frames a second,
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:37.580]   it's adding that.
[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:40.620]   And the crazy one is that, you know, it's probably,
[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:43.260]   it's cropping in a little bit because it talks about
[01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:46.060]   when someone's out of frame, it knows they're coming
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:48.060]   into frame and it'll throw the focus to them.
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:49.780]   And I was like, what?
[01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:52.100]   So this is also example of machine learning
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:54.180]   because they're saying they're using the neural engine
[01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:55.020]   to do this.
[01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:59.700]   So it's been trained on a bunch of actual data,
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:02.820]   how to do this, what to look at.
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:05.380]   You can do it manually later or at the same,
[01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:07.820]   in real time with touching the screen.
[01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:10.660]   They also say that you needed the computational power
[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:11.940]   of an A15 to do this.
[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:13.580]   So that's why this is appearing now.
[01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:14.180]   Yeah.
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:17.100]   They also made a point of, again,
[01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:19.820]   underscoring how much power they get out of their hardware
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:23.380]   by making every single decision hardware software operating
[01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:25.140]   system when they're talking about how they're
[01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:29.660]   able to do ProRes recording like 4K 30 frames per second
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:31.580]   with whatever with HDR or whatever.
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:32.940]   They're also meant, they weren't just talking about,
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:34.020]   hey, look at our good camera system.
[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:34.780]   Hey, look at our sensor.
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:36.820]   They're also saying we have a file system that
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:38.900]   is designed to store stuff really fast.
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:41.660]   We have really, really fast storage hardware that
[01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:45.100]   can capture that really fast because it's not as though when
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:47.060]   you're sending a text message comes in.
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:49.900]   It needs that high performance storage for storing
[01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:53.020]   140-character text.
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:56.540]   It's for that, again, being able to capture as much data,
[01:26:56.540 --> 01:26:59.780]   as fast as possible, so that the CPU can then do what
[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:02.420]   needs to do about it, but first get that data on the device.
[01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:04.060]   So that's part of what--
[01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:06.340]   If the talking-- one of those consistent talking points
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:09.500]   of Apple is that, yes, you are getting less choice when you go
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:12.060]   with Apple, but because we do control everything,
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.380]   we can give you a better experience and often
[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:16.380]   for the same amount of money as you would
[01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:18.940]   get with a Samsung phone or a high-end Pixel phone.
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:20.860]   Speaking of ProRes, this is not something
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:22.420]   you're going to get right now, but Alex,
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:26.180]   explain to me what ProRes is and why this is a big game.
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:30.820]   Oh, what we don't know right now is what flavor of ProRes
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:31.380]   that they're--
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:32.620]   So I don't think they've got enough anywhere.
[01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:33.820]   ProRes format, right?
[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:37.420]   Yeah, so ProRes basically is a interframe format
[01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:39.300]   that basically allows you to have--
[01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:41.540]   it's what I use to do all my work.
[01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:42.780]   So everything gets converted.
[01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:44.260]   In fact, if you send me something that I'm
[01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:45.780]   going to run into an edit, I immediately
[01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:46.620]   convert it to ProRes.
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:49.820]   That's as opposed to MP5 or--
[01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:53.060]   MP4 or H.264 or HEVC or whatever.
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:54.420]   That's always going to get pushed into ProRes
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:57.380]   because it's not dealing with long gobs,
[01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:00.500]   so long group of frames, so it edits better.
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.140]   It also--
[01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:03.580]   Is that lots of more key frames?
[01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:04.380]   What is it?
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:05.740]   Yeah, there's essentially.
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:07.180]   Yeah, I mean--
[01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:10.860]   And then the other thing is take your phone out right now
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:15.260]   and with the HEVC record the trees,
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:18.740]   like a wide shot of the trees in 4K,
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:22.860]   and then zoom in on it and see how they look like little fractals
[01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:26.700]   because the HEVC just simply cannot describe
[01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:28.980]   the image in the way you want it to.
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:31.300]   ProRes, theoretically, depending on which version of ProRes
[01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:33.220]   they're using is going to look a lot better.
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:35.660]   Now, is that because it's shorter gobs?
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:37.460]   Or it's because of better compression?
[01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:42.100]   Yeah, it is a lot less compression, and a lot less--
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:43.300]   And so the issue is--
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:45.420]   That is one question, Mark, is how much compression?
[01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:46.540]   Is it 4.4 or is it?
[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:50.300]   Yeah, so there's a whole bunch of different flavors.
[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:52.620]   You have proxy, which we don't really use.
[01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:54.500]   But I'm afraid that that might end up being what's on the phone.
[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:56.500]   That's the super smart small flavor you
[01:28:56.500 --> 01:29:00.500]   use to create edit decision lists that you can ship over the internet.
[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:03.660]   Presuming somebody has the real high quality imagery.
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:07.500]   Right, no, no proxy will be a big jump from what we would have.
[01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:08.340]   No, the next one up is--
[01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:09.860]   Even then proxy's better than--
[01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:11.300]   Probably better than HEVC.
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:11.940]   I think so.
[01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:12.820]   I don't know for sure.
[01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:14.020]   I'd have to look at the two of them.
[01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:16.740]   It's a lot bigger.
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:18.820]   And they may have created a new ProRes as well.
[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:20.180]   So we don't even know that.
[01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:25.500]   But there's LT, there's 422, 422 HQ,
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.860]   and then there's 444 and then 444 HQ.
[01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:30.100]   And 444's have take alpha channels.
[01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:31.220]   And I'm not doing that.
[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:32.260]   But the big thing is--
[01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:33.260]   Because now the purpose is--
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:35.060]   Because the file size is so big.
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:36.420]   Well, that's going to be the thing.
[01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:38.740]   So the thing is is that if you start shooting with this,
[01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:42.380]   you can fill up a terabyte really fast.
[01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:45.060]   You know, I can--
[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:46.740]   And so I think that especially when
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:48.900]   I'm talking about doing it up to 4K 30.
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:52.740]   Now that mean-- but there's a lot of people, including me,
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:57.060]   that I'm quite willing to dump stuff off our camera more
[01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:59.020]   often so that we could shoot.
[01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:00.500]   I mean, the idea of being able to shoot ProRes
[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:02.300]   from your phone is really exciting.
[01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:03.380]   Yeah, but it's still now--
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:04.380]   Because you're now going to get--
[01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:05.340]   It's still going to be 10 minutes at a time before you
[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:06.340]   had to dump it that might be--
[01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:07.340]   It won't be 10 minutes.
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:09.300]   I mean, I can shoot.
[01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:11.460]   But it'll be-- you shoot a couple hours.
[01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:16.620]   And it's going to-- I mean, ProRes LT is about--
[01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:18.660]   I don't remember the exact thing.
[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:20.540]   But I can tell you that we calculate, oh,
[01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:24.500]   I can shoot four hours of LT, 1080p,
[01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:29.140]   or one hour of 4K in 250 megs.
[01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:31.340]   So you can shoot a lot of it there,
[01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:32.420]   but you will have to take it off.
[01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:33.700]   Like, ProRes is going to be something
[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:35.460]   that you're not going to leave on your phone
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:38.140]   like every other photo that you have.
[01:30:38.140 --> 01:30:39.540]   That is an interesting consideration.
[01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:40.980]   Every time that I'm always surprised
[01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:43.260]   that whenever a phone or another device claims that, hey,
[01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:46.180]   look, we now do 4K at 60 frames per second,
[01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:49.860]   it's then the first actual production hardware goes out
[01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:52.820]   and people goes, yeah, I got three and a half minutes in
[01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:54.340]   before the camera said, hey, I'm overheating,
[01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:55.940]   I'm shutting down right now.
[01:30:55.940 --> 01:31:01.460]   Or just that it's-- the fact that it has 4,000 pixels
[01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:03.100]   across or whatever doesn't mean-- what
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:05.220]   is the quality of those pixels?
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:07.940]   And so the ProRes theoretically has the potential
[01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:13.060]   to give a lot more quality per pixel, which is really exciting.
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:15.060]   These are the specs for the lenses.
[01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:16.740]   And it looks like the lens you're going to want to use
[01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:18.420]   most of the time is the wide, because that's
[01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:24.820]   the one with 100% focus pixels, the widest aperture, 1.5.
[01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:27.660]   OIS, sensor shift, OIS.
[01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:28.580]   But it's nice.
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:31.940]   You've got this telephoto, which is effective 77-millimeter
[01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:33.300]   focal length.
[01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:36.100]   That's going to be a nice thing to have.
[01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:40.580]   Do any of the modes combine data from all the lenses?
[01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:43.620]   Is there anything doing that?
[01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:47.140]   I think the pipeline is, does take into consideration
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:48.460]   pretty much everything.
[01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:51.620]   Even if you don't think that the super wide lens is going to--
[01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:53.500]   I've never taken super wide pictures,
[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:56.060]   it's still going to be able to, in a low light situation,
[01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:58.260]   take data from the super wide lenses
[01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:00.980]   to fill in some of the blanks that's having problems with.
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:05.300]   They didn't mention LiDAR, but I presume that that still--
[01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:06.700]   Is it on this or not?
[01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:08.100]   Yeah, they had it on the slide.
[01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:09.500]   It was on the slide.
[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:10.500]   OK.
[01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:13.780]   It is funny that it went from being the coolest thing ever
[01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:14.340]   to--
[01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:16.780]   You just don't think about it anymore.
[01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:20.220]   They did show, though, a lot of uses of LiDAR and AR.
[01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:22.820]   And they didn't show the IKEA app.
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:24.900]   For once.
[01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:26.260]   I mean, it was really some interesting--
[01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:27.100]   That's probably another app.
[01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:29.540]   Interesting uses of AR, where they--
[01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:31.620]   I don't even know if they even said AR.
[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:32.740]   But you could--
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:33.220]   Right?
[01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:35.340]   But they did a lot-- again, they
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:39.060]   referred to specific apps like a tennis training app
[01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:41.340]   that's using LiDAR and basically the entire camera
[01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:41.780]   subsystem system.
[01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:42.980]   That was interesting, yeah.
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:45.940]   To do ball tracking, to do online coaching,
[01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:47.940]   and not just simply, oh, here's a video I can stream it
[01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:50.060]   to a coach elsewhere.
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:52.020]   But no, it can actually see how you're moving.
[01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:54.100]   It understands spatial relationships
[01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:55.420]   and what's happening on the court.
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:59.860]   And no one's going to simply get by an iPhone, except for maybe
[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:01.060]   me, based on--
[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:02.220]   Hey, look, it has LiDAR.
[01:33:02.220 --> 01:33:05.020]   But if they say, hey, look, here is an app that will do this.
[01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:06.420]   And you love tennis.
[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:08.580]   Here's something amazing it can do for you.
[01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:10.380]   Just buy this app and it'll do it for you.
[01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:11.860]   That's what gets people to--
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:14.260]   who maybe still have a two or three-year-old phone that's
[01:33:14.260 --> 01:33:16.820]   working great for them to say, oh, but my phone doesn't have
[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:17.260]   LiDAR.
[01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:18.260]   Maybe I should get this.
[01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:20.660]   Or someone--
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:23.740]   I have to say, I was amusing about this in the break
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:27.100]   between the end of the keynote and the start of the show
[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:31.940]   that, man, I sort of had $1,000 e-mark for the Pixel 6 phone
[01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:34.020]   if I think it's really, really good.
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:37.940]   And I have to consider if I'm just generically saying,
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:40.140]   well, I've got $1,000 to spend on a phone upgrade
[01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:44.100]   for my Pixel 4a, which is a $350 phone that does great.
[01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:45.140]   I mean, I love it.
[01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:47.940]   But I have to start thinking, gee, will I get much--
[01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:50.220]   will I get more bang for the buck oddly enough
[01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:53.300]   by going with an iPhone Pro instead of with an Android phone?
[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:55.580]   And LiDAR is one of the distinguishing things
[01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:57.220]   that I can see so many things I would
[01:33:57.220 --> 01:34:00.180]   like to be able to do that I can do with a camera phone that
[01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:01.740]   has LiDAR over one that does not.
[01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:05.140]   Two other terms that were mentioned a lot last year
[01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:08.420]   and were much less so this year 5G.
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:10.980]   But like LiDAR, it's just like, yeah, you got it.
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:12.860]   You don't make a big deal.
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:15.660]   And privacy.
[01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:16.260]   Yeah, you got it.
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:19.100]   You don't have to worry about it.
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:19.580]   I guess--
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:21.900]   I think given the recent court appearances,
[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:22.580]   I think--
[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:24.180]   I would save that for the court.
[01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:31.700]   I think that because of the issues around searching the phone,
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:32.540]   I think that was something they--
[01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:34.020]   It did not come out slightly.
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:34.700]   Yeah.
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:38.300]   But I think that touching privacy-- this was kind of a sensitive time.
[01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:38.780]   Hot buts.
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:39.420]   The sensitive time.
[01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:40.020]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:41.220]   It looked like third rail.
[01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:42.220]   Yeah.
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:44.260]   They did mention when they were talking about disagree
[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:45.260]   about how don't record--
[01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:46.260]   It's on phone.
[01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:47.260]   Yeah.
[01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:48.260]   Yeah.
[01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:51.340]   I think the thing that's going to be happening more and more
[01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:53.300]   with Apple-- and I see it with this one--
[01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:56.540]   is these technologies are now getting so advanced
[01:34:56.540 --> 01:34:58.500]   that it's really hard to talk about them.
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:01.140]   You just say, advanced ISP takes noise reduction
[01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:02.420]   to marketing the next level.
[01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:03.900]   That's all you need to know.
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:06.500]   That's why they have a new nerd out button.
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:08.900]   You can press while you're on here on some things with--
[01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:09.540]   Nerd out.
[01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:11.140]   But even that's kind of soft.
[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:12.420]   Yeah, it does feel a little soft.
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:14.060]   Not as nerdy as I'd like it to be.
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:17.260]   But I think this is going to be a problem increasingly
[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:20.660]   for Apple that they are now operating at such a high level
[01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:22.980]   that it's just going to be more like take our word for it.
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:24.700]   Yeah, because with the Apple Watch especially,
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:25.500]   it's going to look good.
[01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.060]   It wasn't a lot they could really say,
[01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:30.380]   even if the new Apple Watch is better in this way and that way.
[01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:33.380]   Most of it is just about the processor
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:34.540]   and making it better in that sense.
[01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:36.340]   Is that going to be a marketing challenge for them?
[01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:39.220]   I mean, I guess they could just show more pictures.
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:41.780]   Look, looks good, doesn't it?
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:42.780]   You like it?
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:45.100]   It's got better 5G.
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:45.620]   Yeah.
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:49.420]   Well, someone said that a very, very, very smart woman
[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:53.060]   that I respect completely, who was saying that it doesn't give--
[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:55.260]   that iPhone 13 doesn't give iPhone 12 years
[01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:56.460]   is a reason to upgrade.
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:59.860]   And as I said earlier, I find it really weird
[01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:02.700]   if you upgrade phones every single year.
[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:04.420]   This is the-- they're not trying--
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:05.540]   I don't think they necessarily trying
[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:07.780]   to get people who bought iPhone last year.
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:10.380]   They're trying to get the person whose iPhone is not
[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:11.340]   a cracked screen.
[01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:12.900]   It's still doing perfectly well for them.
[01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:15.580]   The battery life is still great to start
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:18.460]   to get a little bit thirsty for upgrading new hardware.
[01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:20.860]   And for the people who absolutely do need an upgrade
[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:24.460]   to give them the most mind-blowing change of affairs
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:27.900]   that they can possibly have if they're going from an iPhone 8
[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:31.820]   or an iPhone 9 to say, my god, so much has changed.
[01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:32.820]   I'm now in the future.
[01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:33.900]   I love this new phone.
[01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:35.780]   I'm an Apple user for the rest of my life
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:38.460]   because this is the most incredible phone I've ever used now.
[01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:41.460]   Well, and to that point, they're giving more and more money
[01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:43.580]   on trade-ins.
[01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:47.540]   In fact, at this point now, AT&T is saying up to $1,000
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:52.660]   credit after trade-in, T-Mobile and Verizon are 700.
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:53.860]   I'm not sure why they're less.
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:56.460]   Maybe there's a bigger credit from AT&T
[01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:58.100]   because they want you as a customer.
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:36:59.540]   Please join us.
[01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:02.180]   But I find that interesting too.
[01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:03.780]   I think that's to your point exactly, Andy.
[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:06.580]   They know that this is not something you're going to do every year.
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:08.180]   They didn't really push, but they still
[01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:10.620]   have the program where you can get the upgrade every year
[01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:10.980]   for Apple.
[01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:12.140]   The iPhone upgrade program?
[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:13.060]   Yeah, did they mention that?
[01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:13.780]   I don't think so.
[01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:15.740]   But I guess when you come to the store,
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:19.620]   of all people, we are the ones who should be buying that.
[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:20.540]   Yeah.
[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:23.740]   That's a question that I haven't considered in a while.
[01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:27.060]   When Apple does these events, and maybe even just going forward,
[01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:30.660]   do they want to bring people into the Apple store,
[01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:33.500]   or do they want to drive people to the AT&T store
[01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:34.380]   or the Verizon store?
[01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:36.940]   I mean, obviously, they're going to have to sign up for a provider
[01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:37.980]   where they buy it from.
[01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:41.180]   But are they more interested in making their partners happy
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:42.540]   that, hey, look, we're driving sales,
[01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:44.740]   and we're driving customer retention?
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:46.980]   Or are they saying, actually, maybe when they're in here
[01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:49.380]   that we'll take a look at an iPad mini,
[01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:51.460]   maybe they'll look at an iPod Air and say, gee,
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:54.820]   why don't they round that up from $1,100 to an even $2,000
[01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:56.140]   and get a iPad Air?
[01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:57.020]   I can tell you that.
[01:37:57.020 --> 01:38:00.500]   I mean, I bought them in both the stores, and the Apple store,
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:05.460]   and AT&T and Verizon, the buy-in experience from Verizon,
[01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:08.500]   AT&T, are so painful that I would never go back.
[01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:09.820]   Like, it's just so--
[01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:10.780]   But you can still do it.
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:12.220]   I mean, I'm doing an Apple store.
[01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:12.860]   You sure can.
[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:14.620]   There's no reason that you have to go in and store it.
[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:15.260]   No, you don't.
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:16.860]   You don't say you can get it from Verizon.
[01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:18.340]   You can get it from AT&T.
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:20.620]   Just do it from the Apple site or do it from the Apple store.
[01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:22.860]   And get the appropriate carrier if you want
[01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:24.140]   or get the unlocked, I guess.
[01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:25.180]   I mean, if you want--
[01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:26.460]   It looks like you get a better trade,
[01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:29.700]   and if you get it through whether it's Apple store
[01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:32.780]   or at the AT&T store, if you get it through AT&T,
[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:34.340]   you seems like you can get a better deal.
[01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:37.020]   It's just-- and that's a valid point.
[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:38.460]   You might be able to get a better deal.
[01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:40.780]   It's just a matter of how much you value your time.
[01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:41.340]   And the--
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:42.540]   Well, like I said, you could do it in the Apple--
[01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:43.700]   It's like two or three hours.
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:45.020]   Online with the Apple, you don't have to.
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:45.860]   You can still do that.
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:46.740]   So that's good.
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:47.740]   That's good.
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:49.140]   It's just the stores themselves are disaster.
[01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:51.100]   So you're trading in an eligible-- how to get the deal?
[01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:52.980]   Trading an eligible smartphone,
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:54.940]   and I'm going to give them my 12 Pro Max.
[01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:57.620]   Select the AT&T installment plan, activate with AT&T.
[01:38:57.620 --> 01:38:59.420]   You don't have to go to the AT&T store to do it.
[01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:00.060]   No, that's good.
[01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:01.660]   I'm saying just don't do anything that requires you
[01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:04.220]   to go to the AT&T store, or the Verizon store.
[01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:05.900]   Because they got two needs.
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:08.180]   These days, nobody wants to go anywhere.
[01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:12.500]   So everything should be online, right?
[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:13.820]   All right.
[01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:16.300]   Anything else that we missed, there's
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:18.660]   so much to talk about.
[01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:20.980]   And Apple managed to get it in an hour and 15.
[01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:22.540]   We've got an hour at 38.
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:24.620]   How did we do that?
[01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:27.300]   Well, we go a little deeper, I think, into some of that.
[01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:29.580]   I mean, as we're watching the event, everybody's saying
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:31.580]   in the chat room, what does Alex think is cinematic?
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:33.740]   What does Alex think that this is?
[01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:35.220]   I thought it was great that Catherine Pickle had
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:37.620]   shoot a movie, I thought was in crap.
[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:39.180]   It's got to be a lot of fun if you're a director.
[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:40.820]   Like, hey, we're going to pay you a bunch of money.
[01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:41.900]   We're going to give you a huge budget.
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:43.860]   And all you got to do is shoot like 10 seconds.
[01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:46.140]   Like I just need 10 seconds of this.
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:47.940]   And everyone would say yes.
[01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:52.060]   I mean, it's an honor, I guess, right?
[01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:53.740]   As long as you're not in the middle of your own movie,
[01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:55.140]   that's part of the problem.
[01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:58.340]   But these days, probably everybody's kind of sitting
[01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:01.300]   on the beach waiting for things to change.
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:03.660]   I did like seeing the lighter color come to the pro model.
[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:06.100]   That Sierra Blue is lighter than they've ever done.
[01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:07.060]   So maybe this--
[01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:07.980]   Oh, I'm wondering.
[01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:11.100]   If you're buying an iPhone Pro, please get the Sierra Blue
[01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:14.580]   so that it tells Apple we like these lighter, brighter colors.
[01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:16.060]   You were very happy about the green.
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:17.420]   I'm very happy about the green.
[01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:19.140]   Yeah, the midnight green I miss.
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:21.940]   And I'm glad that the Apple Watch now comes in green.
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:24.180]   I'm really glad they brought back the gray and the black,
[01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:24.700]   myself.
[01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:25.200]   Yeah.
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:25.700]   It's a pro.
[01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:26.620]   That's why you're a pro.
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:29.620]   We know you guys have no taste, and you just
[01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:32.740]   want everything to be dark and scary and boring.
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:33.260]   That's OK.
[01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:34.060]   Dark like DC.
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:38.020]   Sorry, we're getting color reflection off your watch.
[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:41.100]   Could we give you one of the take off that garish product
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:41.300]   bread?
[01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:42.660]   I don't care for saving lives.
[01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:43.460]   Something matte black.
[01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:44.620]   Little matte black.
[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:45.100]   That'd be good.
[01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:48.700]   I like seeing Jaws on stage taking over for Phil Schiller
[01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:51.700]   as a chief marketing officer.
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:53.740]   They brought off Jeff Williams for the--
[01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:54.540]   Jeff Watch segment.
[01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:59.220]   Yeah, because he's still head of engineering for Apple Watch.
[01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:02.620]   Well, I think because Kevin Lynch has moved over to cars,
[01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:03.660]   it made sense now.
[01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:07.260]   Well, we probably should bring Jeff Williams, our COO,
[01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:09.260]   out to introduce the watch.
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:11.340]   I mean, we talked about this last week of the week before
[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:12.580]   about the--
[01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:16.180]   if there is a decided line of succession,
[01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:18.620]   if and when Tim decides that he wants to hang up
[01:41:18.620 --> 01:41:23.060]   his cleats, Ted Lasso reference, that maybe when
[01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:26.540]   they're motivated to make sure that every CEO--
[01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:28.780]   excuse me, every senior executive that has--
[01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:29.580]   Yes, on stage, yeah.
[01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:30.980]   --a credible choice, get some FaceTime.
[01:41:30.980 --> 01:41:33.700]   So this is what Jeff Williams looks like.
[01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:36.620]   I know that he's not your new dad, but perhaps--
[01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:38.300]   Does it make you queasy, Alex, when
[01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:41.620]   you're looking at Catherine Bigelow making a movie,
[01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:47.100]   and instead of a dolly shot, you got the DP holding iPhone
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:48.100]   running in.
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:50.100]   Yeah.
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:54.900]   You never know-- we've put iPhones on dollies themselves.
[01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:56.820]   So you can definitely do it as well.
[01:41:56.820 --> 01:42:00.100]   Here's Greg Frazier holding an iPhone running in.
[01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:01.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:02.980]   The question is that.
[01:42:02.980 --> 01:42:05.260]   I thought that was very, very honest.
[01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:07.420]   It's in a frame, of course, you can hold it better.
[01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:10.780]   But it's not as though they put it on the end of an $80,000--
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:13.780]   No, he didn't have all the fancy stuff.
[01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:14.980]   It was just-- yeah.
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:16.620]   And one of the things that's really cool about that
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:19.300]   is that you can get shots and get into places
[01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:21.700]   that you couldn't get with a right rig and everything else.
[01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:25.900]   And you can pull in there and really get an intimate shot
[01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:26.820]   that you can't get otherwise.
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:30.900]   What's the IP rating of a red camera, IPX?
[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:34.100]   He wouldn't want to go underwater with it, I would imagine.
[01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:34.900]   That's the thing.
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:36.020]   Can I get the Spanish even?
[01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:37.060]   In fact, you don't mind--
[01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:38.500]   it's a $1,200 phone.
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:39.980]   You don't mind if it's out in the mud,
[01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:42.940]   because they gave us 40.
[01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:45.220]   And more than anything else, a phone like this
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:49.060]   revolutionizes the time-honored practice of shooting them
[01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:50.620]   in the city without a permit.
[01:42:50.620 --> 01:42:51.620]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:53.420]   Oh, no, I'm just not a serious crew.
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:54.660]   It's just a phone.
[01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:57.060]   What we tend to call stealing shots.
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:42:57.060]   Yeah.
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:42:58.820]   The stealing shots is when you don't get a permit
[01:42:58.820 --> 01:43:00.460]   and you just go and you just don't drop.
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:03.100]   And sometimes you drop sticks, you just drop really fast.
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:04.220]   I mean, look at this.
[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:05.340]   Here he is.
[01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:10.460]   He's holding-- he's holding an iPhone up to the poor actor
[01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:14.700]   who's thinking, what did my agent sign me up for?
[01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:16.340]   I thought this was a major motion picture
[01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:18.460]   that guy's shooting at with the phone.
[01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:19.580]   He probably said, well, that's fine.
[01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:23.300]   You're going to be directed by two-time Academy Award
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:26.860]   winning director, Catherine Pickle, and it's an Apple
[01:43:26.860 --> 01:43:27.860]   production.
[01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:29.740]   Oh my god, I'm going to be the new Tom Hanks
[01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:30.540]   moving on Apple TV.
[01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:32.780]   He said, no, you were going to throw you through a window
[01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:34.660]   for a free video that we're going to make.
[01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:37.780]   We can't tell you anything, and you can't look at the phone
[01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:38.420]   at all.
[01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:39.340]   Just don't look at it.
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:41.220]   It's not there.
[01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:41.980]   It's fascinating.
[01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:43.220]   I mean, I really think--
[01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:44.220]   There's hidden cameras.
[01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:44.720]   Yeah.
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:45.420]   It's a good selling.
[01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:47.140]   It's a really good selling point to do,
[01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:49.660]   to shoot this stuff like this on a phone.
[01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:51.780]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:54.180]   All right, I think we have--
[01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:56.060]   We have covered the topic.
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:57.500]   The last thing I was going to say
[01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:59.020]   is that what Apple really should do next
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:02.780]   is a million dollar prize for the best iPhone short film,
[01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:03.540]   like five minutes.
[01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:04.460]   Oh, that'd be amazing.
[01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:06.140]   You know, they should put out a million dollars
[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:07.140]   to do that because they would get--
[01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:08.460]   I think they kind of did that under the covers.
[01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:10.060]   Because remember when the--
[01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:12.140]   a couple of editions came out, there
[01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:14.780]   were a couple of movies shot on iPhone.
[01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:15.620]   Remember that?
[01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:18.020]   You know, Apple subsidize those, right?
[01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:19.500]   But I think that you could get it.
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.620]   If you just build a really big pot,
[01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:23.740]   you get a lot of people with their iPhones out there.
[01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:24.940]   That would be really neat.
[01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:27.980]   I'll shoot a movie with my iPhone.
[01:44:27.980 --> 01:44:30.500]   It'll be "Rack Focus All the Time."
[01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:32.660]   Though it's actually the movie's called "Rack Focus."
[01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:33.380]   "Rack Focus."
[01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:36.340]   It's a great concept in film.
[01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:36.940]   I love it.
[01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:40.180]   My new movie "Rack Focus" coming out in the fall.
[01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:41.780]   You're having me along with the Apple Chairs.
[01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:43.700]   I mean, when you start up with that.
[01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:45.020]   Turn around.
[01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:46.020]   Dang.
[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:46.860]   Focus.
[01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:48.260]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:49.420]   Come back, Rems leg.
[01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:51.180]   I have a new-- I have a new job for you.
[01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:52.980]   We still have picks of the week.
[01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:54.300]   We have an abandoned those.
[01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:57.620]   I hope you guys prepared some.
[01:44:57.620 --> 01:44:59.420]   Leo's pick "Rack Focus."
[01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:01.020]   "Rack Focus."
[01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:03.220]   It's now the name of the show, "Rack Focus."
[01:45:03.220 --> 01:45:06.500]   I did buy, coincidentally, a drying rack for my dishes.
[01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:07.180]   That's close.
[01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:07.860]   Focus on that.
[01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:08.540]   Yeah, obviously.
[01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:08.980]   Let us on.
[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:12.020]   And you could call it "Rack Focus."
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:13.380]   "Rack Focus."
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:14.260]   Our show today--
[01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:15.100]   Worth a million bucks to us.
[01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:19.300]   Brought to you by the people we love so much at AT&T.
[01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:20.460]   Actually, it's perfect timing.
[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:22.020]   This podcast supported by AT&T.
[01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:24.900]   If there are friends and family members,
[01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:27.140]   you haven't talked to in a while.
[01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:27.860]   Do not worry.
[01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:30.940]   It's never too late to reconnect and to help AT&T
[01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:32.980]   is offering deals on the latest smartphones.
[01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:33.940]   We're just talking about them.
[01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:35.260]   It's not complicated.
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:37.300]   Everybody deserves something new.
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:40.820]   So AT&T is giving new and existing customers
[01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:43.620]   their best deals on every smartphone,
[01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:44.980]   even the latest ones.
[01:45:44.980 --> 01:45:51.300]   Restrictions and exceptions may apply visit att.com for details.
[01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:54.580]   And it is now time for a picks of the week.
[01:45:54.580 --> 01:45:58.980]   We'll kick you off Andy and not go to start.
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:01.500]   I have a free one and one that's kind of expensive,
[01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:03.300]   but cool.
[01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:06.620]   The Metropolitan Opera had their first ticketed event
[01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:09.860]   inside the Opera House with the orchestra, with the chorus,
[01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:12.940]   with soloists, with everything for the 20th anniversary
[01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:13.820]   of 9/11.
[01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:15.660]   They did Verdi's work, Riam.
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:18.180]   Oh, that's one of my most favorite pieces of music.
[01:46:18.180 --> 01:46:19.180]   Oh, my God.
[01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:19.820]   That's beautiful.
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:21.140]   It's absolutely stunning.
[01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:23.900]   And this is what I was so excited about.
[01:46:23.900 --> 01:46:26.260]   They streamed it live on PBS and on the radio.
[01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:28.540]   It is on the PBS Great Performance's website.
[01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:29.700]   So you can still stream it for free.
[01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:32.900]   If you have Downey, maybe you want to help PBS and the Met
[01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:35.740]   by making a backup in case their server goes down.
[01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:36.580]   Who knows?
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:39.940]   But even if you're not interested in classical music or opera--
[01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:41.700]   Oh, this is one of the most beautiful pieces
[01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:42.700]   I've ever made.
[01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:44.140]   It's just stunning.
[01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:47.580]   And also, this is the applause that the chorus got
[01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:49.740]   when they first took the stage from an audience that
[01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:52.900]   realized that they've been off stage for a year and a half.
[01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:55.740]   And it was just so great to see everybody still back.
[01:46:55.740 --> 01:46:58.380]   And also, just like you're not necessarily a basketball fan
[01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:00.180]   or a football fan or a baseball fan,
[01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:03.180]   but there's something about the level of play in the postseason
[01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:05.820]   where everybody on that field understands
[01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:08.100]   this is a very, very unique moment
[01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:10.500]   and allows them to drive their game up to another level.
[01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:12.540]   So there's a live audience that's true.
[01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:16.620]   Live paid audience, 120 people on stage,
[01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:19.820]   full chorus, full orchestra.
[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:20.660]   Well, I have a lot of--
[01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:21.580]   It's not an opera we should say.
[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:22.860]   It's really an orchestra piece.
[01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:25.420]   It is one of the most beautiful pieces ever.
[01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:25.980]   It's right.
[01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:27.900]   And it's subtitled so you know what they're talking about.
[01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:30.700]   But you almost think that the conductor is--
[01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:32.580]   he must have lost 10 pounds of water
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:34.380]   weight with the effort he's putting into
[01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:37.580]   because everyone is definitely fully invested in this.
[01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:39.980]   And like I said, before it goes off of PBS,
[01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:42.020]   definitely take a look at it because you'll enjoy it.
[01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:47.380]   But back on the nerdy track, this is kind of spandy.
[01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:52.780]   But there is a designer, a 3D printer guy on Etsy,
[01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:55.860]   selling under net shelf, nut shelf cases
[01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:59.620]   that makes two amazing Apple oriented cases
[01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:01.220]   for the Raspberry Pi computer.
[01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:05.980]   They make a Raspberry Pi case that looks like an Apple II
[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:08.340]   CI like it's perfect frog design.
[01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:12.380]   And he makes a perfect knockoff of the original Apple mouse.
[01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:13.860]   And I'm saying it's not just, oh well,
[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:15.500]   it's a box with an Apple logo on it.
[01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:18.220]   It has the frog design seams and shadow lines.
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:20.220]   It has the square LED.
[01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:24.380]   It has as close an approximation of the Apple logo.
[01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:27.660]   It's an acorn with a rainbow acorn with a bite out of it.
[01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:28.340]   Good luck.
[01:48:28.340 --> 01:48:30.820]   I hope that you mentioned to sell out
[01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:33.340]   all of the things you've prided before you get sued.
[01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:35.420]   But it's so beautifully done.
[01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:38.020]   It is pricey at 160 bucks.
[01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:40.380]   Like three times more expensive than a Raspberry Pi
[01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:41.540]   or at least a cheap one.
[01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:44.020]   But this is, I kind of want, I really want one
[01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:47.020]   because I have an Raspberry Pi on my desk to do things.
[01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:50.620]   And I've always, it is so perfectly tuned in
[01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:54.180]   to what I want because I love frog design, Max.
[01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:56.100]   I think I do have an Apple II CI on the shelf.
[01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:58.420]   Just this is the cutest computer ever made.
[01:48:58.420 --> 01:48:59.100]   I want them.
[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:01.620]   I want them with the Apple II CI case.
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:03.020]   That's real.
[01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:06.220]   And it's not nothing like a really good design case.
[01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:08.820]   It also includes a fan, which you don't get with a Raspberry Pi.
[01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:11.380]   So it also has a power button to power the LED.
[01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:13.660]   So again, I'm not saying the 160 bucks
[01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:15.020]   is not a small amount of money.
[01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:19.020]   But again, this is a made-by-made-to-order one person
[01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:21.020]   driving their 3D printers and assembling
[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:22.060]   these things themselves.
[01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:25.580]   I don't believe he's just sent CAD files to Zashenzhen
[01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:27.340]   and having them mailed back to him.
[01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:29.620]   Sometimes he has to close up a shop
[01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:31.300]   because he'll look like I got too many orders.
[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:35.260]   I have to start breathing PLA for the next two weeks
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:36.260]   and everything done.
[01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:39.140]   But he just reopened orders the other day.
[01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:41.940]   So this is something that I definitely have bookmarked
[01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:44.940]   for when I feel as though, gosh,
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:47.260]   I was going to spend $1,000 for a new phone,
[01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:49.100]   but I actually now don't like either of them.
[01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:51.860]   So I guess I have money for this $160 really cool.
[01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:53.140]   That's pretty pointless.
[01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:54.940]   It's really cute.
[01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:56.980]   Oh, don't buy it yet, everybody.
[01:49:56.980 --> 01:49:58.260]   I want to buy it first.
[01:49:58.260 --> 01:50:01.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:04.260]   [SINGING]
[01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:05.260]   [SINGING]
[01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:06.420]   I'm not a robot.
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:07.180]   I am a man.
[01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:08.180]   Oh, crap.
[01:50:08.180 --> 01:50:10.500]   Well, don't you hate it when this happens?
[01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:11.540]   Well, Leo's looking in.
[01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:12.340]   I can do my pick.
[01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:13.660]   Do your pick, would you, please?
[01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:15.900]   Yeah, so I'm actually choosing a pick directly
[01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:18.380]   from the show today that I wish I would have known about
[01:50:18.380 --> 01:50:20.820]   before because, as I said, I want hiking.
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:25.100]   And they showed this app called Peak Visor on stage.
[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:27.220]   And it's this really cool application
[01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:30.940]   that involves AR along with all of these different hiking
[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:32.220]   trails that you can do.
[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:33.900]   So I can pop in here.
[01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:35.860]   And I sent it to--
[01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:37.260]   I'm still clicking captions.
[01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:37.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:39.180]   Crying out loud.
[01:50:39.180 --> 01:50:42.220]   How many times do I have to help Google self-driving be?
[01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:43.940]   They just want to make sure you really want the fun.
[01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:45.540]   Oh, my freaking god.
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:48.820]   This is the seventh or eighth capture.
[01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:51.300]   Did I answer it because I'm getting them wrong?
[01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:51.820]   Oh.
[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:52.300]   Oh.
[01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:53.820]   There's a stop sign behind the wall.
[01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:54.820]   You failed.
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:56.300]   I hate you, Google.
[01:50:56.300 --> 01:50:57.780]   I hate you.
[01:50:57.780 --> 01:50:58.780]   Don't say that out loud.
[01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:01.900]   Their retribution will be swift and terrible.
[01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:02.980]   It took so long.
[01:51:02.980 --> 01:51:04.220]   OK, go back to your pick.
[01:51:04.220 --> 01:51:05.140]   Oh, did you get in that time?
[01:51:05.140 --> 01:51:06.100]   I finally got it.
[01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:08.100]   It literally took nine dashes.
[01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:12.220]   So here you can see me zooming into the coast to actually see--
[01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:12.740]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:13.780]   Stewart Point.
[01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:15.380]   You can see the different trails that are--
[01:51:15.380 --> 01:51:16.300]   You did this way.
[01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:17.100]   Just now?
[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:18.900]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:20.860]   And so there are all the different lakes that
[01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:23.420]   are available on the edge here and the different heights.
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:23.900]   I'm impressed.
[01:51:23.900 --> 01:51:26.460]   Like all of it is available for you to see.
[01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:30.220]   And what I like is that-- let me go back
[01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:32.100]   to one of the options.
[01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:34.380]   We'll do another destination.
[01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:37.020]   And let's do Yosemite, just so you
[01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:39.260]   can see the level of detail that's available.
[01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:40.900]   OK, I got the case.
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:42.420]   Now you can all get it yourself.
[01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:42.740]   Go ahead.
[01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:43.940]   Yeah, now everybody else is able to.
[01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:45.580]   Now you're all everywhere.
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:49.700]   And then if you zoom in on this, once again,
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:52.220]   Yosemite Village will say, it starts to download
[01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:54.940]   the information like, this is rich, rich, rich map detail.
[01:51:54.940 --> 01:51:58.300]   So 131 megabytes of data that you can download ahead of time.
[01:51:58.300 --> 01:52:01.380]   And then it will use GPS to help figure out where you are.
[01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:03.340]   And then as you're walking through that area,
[01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:05.540]   you can start to see, OK, this is the trail
[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:06.980]   that they've got in the database.
[01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:08.060]   I can go down this way.
[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:09.180]   I can go up that way.
[01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:11.340]   Unfortunately, this is taking a while to load.
[01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:14.900]   I'm buying everything that you guys mentioned.
[01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:18.340]   I just-- I didn't know that this existed until we
[01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:19.220]   watched the show today.
[01:52:19.220 --> 01:52:20.380]   Well, we got that seed cap.
[01:52:20.380 --> 01:52:21.420]   You got the other one, yeah.
[01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:22.420]   Yeah.
[01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:24.780]   The plant they used to identify a redwood tree.
[01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:26.100]   And I wish I would have had that too,
[01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:27.820]   because there were a lot of times where I'm going,
[01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:29.900]   I'm going to talk next to this leafy bush.
[01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:32.780]   Or is it going to make me turn red and itchy all over?
[01:52:32.780 --> 01:52:33.740]   Well, I'm not used to--
[01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:35.380]   Because I know that Micah is a human.
[01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:36.180]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:36.980]   So that's good.
[01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:39.380]   Is this the type of bear I'm supposed to fight against?
[01:52:39.380 --> 01:52:41.660]   Or is this type of bear I'm supposed to play dead with?
[01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:43.020]   No, no, don't connect to the internet.
[01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:44.100]   I need an answer right now.
[01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:45.620]   Quick.
[01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:46.140]   Very nice.
[01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:47.180]   What's the name of your app again?
[01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:50.700]   This is called Peak Visor, P-E-A-K Visor.
[01:52:50.700 --> 01:52:52.100]   For people who go high.
[01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:53.540]   Hiking trails.
[01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:54.500]   And I love that.
[01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:55.300]   Look at that.
[01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:56.300]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:57.300]   You know, so many--
[01:52:57.300 --> 01:52:58.300]   Which you're getting into.
[01:52:58.300 --> 01:52:59.300]   That's perfect.
[01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:03.140]   Wait, just take a moment to just realize,
[01:53:03.140 --> 01:53:04.900]   what an amazing world we live in.
[01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:06.780]   Serious, absolutely.
[01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:08.140]   It's phenomenal.
[01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:10.060]   It's just phenomenal.
[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:14.300]   I also got my pick of the week from the event.
[01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:16.580]   This is the future of ultrasound.
[01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:19.460]   You might want to buy this, Alex.
[01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:21.460]   He's so one-one.
[01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:25.540]   Well, it's a little expensive, $25.99.
[01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:28.060]   But, well, with an Alex's price right now.
[01:53:28.060 --> 01:53:31.180]   Also, they are on a slow website, $23.99.
[01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:32.180]   Do you want to come with lightning?
[01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:33.340]   Or you guys can see?
[01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:37.540]   I think it's also $420 a year for this subscription.
[01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:39.260]   Oh, they don't mention that.
[01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:40.260]   Yeah.
[01:53:40.260 --> 01:53:42.780]   OK, but honestly, when you think about how many times
[01:53:42.780 --> 01:53:45.980]   you accidentally swallow one of your airpons.
[01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:50.180]   OK, Andy, I did just call it one of those things.
[01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:52.140]   He'll pay for it's often about six months.
[01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:55.500]   I'm interested that it says, "Butterfly Q+ Human."
[01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:56.500]   I'm wondering what else--
[01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:57.500]   Oh, they're not a dog one.
[01:53:57.500 --> 01:53:58.500]   They might have a dog one.
[01:53:58.500 --> 01:53:59.500]   They have a dog one, you think?
[01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:02.500]   And why do you need a different one for your dog?
[01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:03.500]   I don't know.
[01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:04.500]   Maybe ultrasound.
[01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:05.500]   I have no idea.
[01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:06.500]   I'm just kidding.
[01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:07.500]   I'm joking.
[01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:08.500]   We'll all go in one together.
[01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:09.500]   Yeah, maybe we can share.
[01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:10.500]   We can pass it around.
[01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:11.500]   Yeah.
[01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:16.500]   Now, if your wife's pregnant, you can do it there and tell jokes, see if they get them.
[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:17.500]   Yeah.
[01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:18.500]   Try to figure things out.
[01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:20.500]   Honey, can I have the ultrasound this weekend?
[01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:22.500]   I'm going to Bob's house.
[01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:23.500]   What's wrong with the baby?
[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:24.500]   He's really standoffish.
[01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:26.500]   I'm giving him a tight five minutes set here.
[01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:27.500]   They do have a vent model.
[01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:29.500]   My best tight five.
[01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:30.500]   That's wild.
[01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:32.500]   There's also an enterprise model.
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:34.500]   I don't know what that means.
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:36.500]   So you can look into it for your life.
[01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:40.500]   IQly is for a complete veterinary ultrasound.
[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:41.500]   Wow.
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:42.500]   Look at the turtle.
[01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:43.500]   Oh, the turtle.
[01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:44.500]   Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:46.500]   I got to get one for Henry and Missy.
[01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:48.500]   What's in there?
[01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:50.500]   It's fire season here in California.
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:52.500]   Yes, we noticed.
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:58.500]   So whether there's a fire or not, we were probably going to lose our power often.
[01:54:58.500 --> 01:54:59.500]   And we're used to it.
[01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:00.500]   We've gotten used to it.
[01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:05.140]   But one of the things that's important is a UPS, which we've had a lot of detailed discussions
[01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:09.500]   about in office hours recently, which wants to get and how to get them.
[01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:14.020]   The one that I buy, and we've been buying these for years.
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:18.340]   So it's kind of what we consider kind of the entry level.
[01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:21.500]   It will be a little bit more expensive, but this is the APC UPS.
[01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:23.500]   And I believe it's a 1500 VA.
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:26.500]   Now, it may seem like a lot.
[01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:33.500]   If you hook up your modem, by the way, I have one of these batteries dedicated only to my
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:36.500]   router, my modem, my Wi-Fi, everything else is there.
[01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:38.500]   And it will last six hours.
[01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:40.500]   Just sitting there without any power.
[01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:43.500]   This is pretty affordable too, because it is.
[01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:44.500]   That's the whole thing.
[01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:46.500]   It's cost effective, but here's a couple things about it.
[01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:48.500]   You can page through how much power am I using?
[01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:50.500]   How much time will I get at this power?
[01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:52.500]   So there's more to it.
[01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:56.500]   When you buy the less expensive ones, it's not just that you have less time.
[01:55:56.500 --> 01:55:57.500]   You have less information.
[01:55:57.500 --> 01:55:59.500]   Also, the battery inside of it is replaceable.
[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:03.500]   You can flip it open, pull it out, reverse it if you're shipping it or something like that.
[01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:06.500]   But you can also swap that battery out, which you can't do with other ones.
[01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:09.500]   So when they're done, you throw them away.
[01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:13.500]   Or dispose of them responsibly, I guess, is the better way to say it.
[01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:17.500]   But with this one, you can actually replace the batteries with it.
[01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:24.500]   And if you are in a Northern California, it was going to say in a fire prone area, but
[01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:25.500]   it was in Northern California.
[01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:31.500]   You need to have, you know, like I, we had a power go out a couple times.
[01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:34.500]   I don't know what it was, a couple weeks ago.
[01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:37.500]   And, you know, I wasn't, I didn't have everything all set up.
[01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:39.500]   Now I have everything all set up and the power went out again.
[01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:42.500]   And I could hear things, I could hear them beeping, but I was still working.
[01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:46.500]   You know, and I was like, well, I got 20 minutes, so now I can save my files and I can put things
[01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:50.500]   away and I can, you know, and in that case, it came back on with it in 20 minutes.
[01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:53.500]   But I was just kind of like, do, do, do, rather than it being like, oh, I just lost whatever
[01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:55.500]   I was writing or whatever I was doing.
[01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:59.500]   I might have thumped my hard drive because it was, it was writing something big to it
[01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:01.500]   while it was right, you know, all those things.
[01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:02.500]   So it's really worth it.
[01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:05.500]   It's not that much money and will do you a lot of good.
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:12.500]   You know, apcc.com has a UPS selector that you can go through and configure it by
[01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:16.500]   device or by load and figure out what you needed for how long you wanted to run.
[01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:17.500]   But get way more than you need.
[01:57:17.500 --> 01:57:19.500]   Get way more than you need.
[01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:24.500]   And the other thing is if you do suffer power outage, it can recharge your phone, you can
[01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:29.500]   recharge your tablets, you can do, it's not just for keeping things up for 20 or 30 minutes,
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:31.500]   you can shut down your server.
[01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:36.500]   And the number of times, the number of times where there's kind of a windstorm, I have,
[01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:40.500]   I'm watching TV or I'm working and the lights aren't flicking or anything, but I hear my UPS
[01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:42.500]   popping going click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
[01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:47.500]   Knowing that there's something going on that the power grid does not like not that enough
[01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:52.500]   to interfere with the products or anything, but good enough that a sufficiently twitchy,
[01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:54.500]   emergency piece of equipment is now worried.
[01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:56.500]   So that's, we had very fruitful.
[01:57:56.500 --> 01:58:02.500]   We had an entire building in the UK and the XL, one of the theaters in the XL center in London.
[01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:06.500]   The theater lost power while there was everybody in it during the show.
[01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:09.500]   And the only thing that was on when you look in the back, in the back of behind it, all you can see
[01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:12.500]   is our monitors and we had a, we'll be right backslide up.
[01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:13.500]   Oh, good for you.
[01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:18.500]   You can just hear our little, and they were all this model, just a bunch of them.
[01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:22.500]   It's all a beep, beep, beep, beep, but we're just sitting there just streaming out.
[01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:28.500]   And if you take them apart and take out the beep, you can light little LED panels in the
[01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:29.500]   White House.
[01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:32.500]   So, so anyway, so it's the overall support.
[01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:34.500]   I don't want to ask you how you know that.
[01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:37.500]   APC, yeah, very good stuff.
[01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:40.500]   The backups, the backups pro.
[01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:43.500]   And you actually put it up on Amazon.
[01:58:43.500 --> 01:58:46.500]   Let me close through all the other things I bought.
[01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:49.500]   And there is, there's a 165 bucks on Amazon.
[01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:50.500]   I have to admit the reason.
[01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:53.500]   We have the idea to buy everything we recommend, we call it a perfect game.
[01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:54.500]   Yeah, it's a hat trick.
[01:58:54.500 --> 01:58:56.500]   We have to get the buy drinks for everybody.
[01:58:56.500 --> 01:59:02.500]   Well, the, the, the Amazon, the easiest way for me to figure out which one I got was to go to Amazon.
[01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:05.500]   Yeah, that's exactly what I, which one did I, I had to scroll way back.
[01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:06.500]   Like when, when did I order this?
[01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:08.500]   That's not why I did that all the time.
[01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:09.500]   Yeah.
[01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:10.500]   Same.
[01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:14.500]   I just, my 13 year old toaster oven died last week and I'm like, okay, I want the exact same one.
[01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:15.500]   Like, okay.
[01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:19.500]   So it told, it told me that it was a, it told me what it was and also told me that they stopped making those.
[01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:24.500]   Oh, I'm just annoyed that Amazon is, you know, doesn't give me the default to search everything.
[01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:26.500]   I have to go year by year, which is really true.
[01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:28.500]   You have to remember what year you bought it.
[01:59:28.500 --> 01:59:29.500]   Really?
[01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:30.500]   No, I, online it does.
[01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:31.500]   I search a mine.
[01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:32.500]   It does.
[01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:33.500]   They're A/B testing him.
[01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:34.500]   Oh, maybe I'm getting.
[01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:36.500]   So you go to your orders.
[01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:38.500]   I can't search all orders.
[01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:39.500]   Oh, okay.
[01:59:39.500 --> 01:59:40.500]   Oh, okay.
[01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:46.500]   So, so no, I was looking at the, the, the, the, by the listing you can only get by year.
[01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:51.500]   But if I search UPS, yeah, but anyway.
[01:59:51.500 --> 01:59:52.500]   All right.
[01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:53.500]   Very good.
[01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:54.500]   What a good show.
[01:59:54.500 --> 01:59:55.500]   Thank you guys.
[01:59:55.500 --> 01:59:56.500]   I appreciate it.
[01:59:56.500 --> 01:59:59.500]   We didn't get to any of the other topics that we might have covered, including the Apple versus Epic.
[01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:02.500]   We'll save those for next week when Renee is back.
[02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:05.500]   Renee Enaco, when are you going to be on WGBH next?
[02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:10.500]   Friday at 1PM, Stream it Live or Stream it Later at WGBH News.org.
[02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:11.500]   Very good.
[02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:13.500]   Very, very good.
[02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:17.500]   Mr. Alex Lindsey is at office hours.global.
[02:00:17.500 --> 02:00:20.500]   What are you talking about these days?
[02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:22.500]   Oh, just so many things.
[02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:24.500]   Oh, it's, it's, it's open.
[02:00:24.500 --> 02:00:26.500]   It's, it's, it's, you know, it's 21 hours a day now.
[02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:29.500]   Like I got up and I'm trying to figure something out for, I had a show.
[02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:31.500]   I have a show that's coming up.
[02:00:31.500 --> 02:00:36.140]   I have a concert I got to shoot on the weekend and I couldn't figure out how to set up some
[02:00:36.140 --> 02:00:37.140]   mics.
[02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:38.140]   I was trying to think of it.
[02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:42.020]   11.30 at night I get up there and, and I start, we start talking about what mics should I
[02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:44.500]   use for, for this and we, we got, and I got it all sorted out.
[02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:48.900]   Can you tell me this city you're shooting in this weekend because that might tell me if
[02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:50.900]   I'm going to be at the same concert that you're at?
[02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:52.900]   Well, I'm not going to say.
[02:00:52.900 --> 02:00:53.900]   Oh, darn.
[02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:54.900]   California.
[02:00:54.900 --> 02:00:55.900]   Well, I'll do it off the air.
[02:00:55.900 --> 02:00:56.900]   Yeah.
[02:00:56.900 --> 02:00:57.900]   I'm so curious.
[02:00:57.900 --> 02:00:58.900]   I'll do it off the air.
[02:00:58.900 --> 02:00:59.900]   Yeah.
[02:00:59.900 --> 02:01:00.900]   So yeah.
[02:01:00.900 --> 02:01:03.900]   No, you've got to prove your vaccination with a car.
[02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:05.780]   Yeah, we went to a concert the other.
[02:01:05.780 --> 02:01:08.380]   For Billy Eidle, we proved our vaccination.
[02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:09.380]   Yeah.
[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:12.420]   The, the, this Friday though, will be pretty, pretty cool.
[02:01:12.420 --> 02:01:16.260]   Andy Carlucio from Lemanal is going to, we're, we're building a whole new way to do
[02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:21.780]   an online show where you have 20 panelists and how do we build an automated system that
[02:01:21.780 --> 02:01:25.100]   builds all the super sources automatically based on who's going to answer the next question
[02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:26.420]   and how they're going to put it all together.
[02:01:26.420 --> 02:01:30.460]   And he's going to be tearing that all apart, you know, and showing everybody how that's
[02:01:30.460 --> 02:01:31.460]   all we're putting it together.
[02:01:31.460 --> 02:01:36.380]   It's, it's pretty slick, you know, because basically, you know, when people raise their
[02:01:36.380 --> 02:01:38.500]   hands, we accept them.
[02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:43.700]   And then it tells the, it tells our switcher who to put into the boxes and what lower thirds
[02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:48.100]   and all that other stuff is all done, you know, automatically based on their setups.
[02:01:48.100 --> 02:01:49.100]   So it's cool.
[02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:50.100]   Lovely.
[02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:51.100]   So you're going to show how that works.
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:57.300]   Officehours.global, if you want to hire Alex for your next concert, White House Address
[02:01:57.300 --> 02:02:03.220]   or whatever in between just 090.media.
[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:05.660]   And we thank you so much for being here.
[02:02:05.660 --> 02:02:08.180]   Good from Tech News Weekly iPad today.
[02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:09.180]   It's iOS today.
[02:02:09.180 --> 02:02:13.700]   It was really great to have you, Micah, filling in on the, on the stream and then doing the
[02:02:13.700 --> 02:02:14.700]   show with us today.
[02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:15.700]   Thank you so much.
[02:02:15.700 --> 02:02:16.780]   Yeah, this was fun.
[02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:19.300]   Of course you do other podcasts on other stations.
[02:02:19.300 --> 02:02:24.380]   Yeah, if you had to chihuahua.coffee, CHI, HOA, HOA.coffee, you'll find links to the
[02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:26.020]   places I'm most active online.
[02:02:26.020 --> 02:02:28.220]   You said that like a chihuahua would say that.
[02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:29.220]   CHI, HOA, HOA, HOA.
[02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:30.220]   I've said it so many times.
[02:02:30.220 --> 02:02:31.220]   What's up, coffee?
[02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:32.220]   I mean, chihuahua.
[02:02:32.220 --> 02:02:33.220]   Never mind.
[02:02:33.220 --> 02:02:35.940]   Chihuahua is drinking coffee.
[02:02:35.940 --> 02:02:37.380]   Do say it that way.
[02:02:37.380 --> 02:02:38.380]   Exactly.
[02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:40.380]   So all this stuff is in here.
[02:02:40.380 --> 02:02:45.940]   All the podcasts you do, stuff you used to do, pictures of Henry and Mizzie.
[02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:46.940]   Yeah.
[02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:47.940]   All there.
[02:02:47.940 --> 02:02:50.180]   Aw, I did cute chihuahua.coffee.
[02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:51.700]   Thank you very much for coming in.
[02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:55.020]   Micah, it's been nice to have somebody in studio with me.
[02:02:55.020 --> 02:02:56.020]   Yeah.
[02:02:56.020 --> 02:02:57.900]   Take a couple of hats on your way.
[02:02:57.900 --> 02:02:58.900]   Exactly.
[02:02:58.900 --> 02:02:59.900]   Yeah.
[02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:02.220]   Gonna replenish my stock.
[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:04.140]   We did Mac Break Weekly on a Tuesday.
[02:03:04.140 --> 02:03:07.620]   This time was a little late because we had, I don't know, some Apple thing going on.
[02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:12.100]   But normally we start around 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern, 1800 UTC.
[02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:15.900]   If you want to watch us do it live, we have a live stream, audio and video of everything
[02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:19.020]   we do available at twit.tv/live.
[02:03:19.020 --> 02:03:20.860]   People watching live like to chat live.
[02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:22.620]   There are a couple of places you can do that.
[02:03:22.620 --> 02:03:29.260]   And of course our IRC is open to all at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:03:29.260 --> 02:03:32.180]   Now newly endowed for another year.
[02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:37.460]   We also have, if you're a member of Club Twit, a wonderful Discord server where people are
[02:03:37.460 --> 02:03:42.700]   throwing up all sorts of crazy animated gifts and more and conversation is great in there.

[02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:35.620]   Now get back to work cause it's time to buy another iPhone.
[02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:40.780]   So you got yourself the brand new latest and greatest iPhone or Samsung smartphone because
[02:04:40.780 --> 02:04:44.820]   you heard about all of the beautiful photography those things can create.
[02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:50.900]   For some reason, you're just not quite getting it done when you try to make your photos.
[02:04:50.900 --> 02:04:55.100]   Or you got yourself a brand new camera because you were interested in getting started in
[02:04:55.100 --> 02:05:01.900]   photography but your little new inexpensive camera still isn't quite cutting it.
[02:05:01.900 --> 02:05:07.180]   Well, you need to check out my show Hands on Photography here on Twit.
[02:05:07.180 --> 02:05:11.620]   I'm going to show you how to be a better photographer and a better post processor.
[02:05:11.620 --> 02:05:16.220]   And quite frankly, just help you get the most out of that new camera that's either on your
[02:05:16.220 --> 02:05:22.060]   phone or the brand new one that you just got for your birthday or gifts or what have you.
[02:05:22.060 --> 02:05:23.780]   And it's going to be a lot of fun.
[02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:26.900]   So head on over to twit.tv/hop.
