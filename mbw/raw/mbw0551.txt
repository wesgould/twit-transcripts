[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.320]   I just stand at the border and stare Americans in their guns back south
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.200]   This is a really important day actually to have the A team with us
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.400]   So I'm glad you're here and I'm really thrilled to welcome from loop insight calm the loop Jim Dal Rimple

[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.160]   Nice to some of Tim bits Tim bits
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.360]   Practically Tim bits
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.520]   And I was a but it closed
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.240]   Oh, wow just over the border. I yeah, I was told not to call them Tim's bits
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.080]   No
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.120]   Especially not a Quebec we don't like the apostrophe
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.920]   Alright, so Apple did us it did us a good
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:33.680]   Favorite today by releasing news about its new products before the show instead of waiting till later in the day or tomorrow
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:42.700]   That's why they did it. Yep. Yeah, very soon since you and invited me on this week. I really some new products. You're welcome
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.280]   Now and I'm actually happy because we did they didn't come out on Monday afternoon
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.880]   Which makes my life miserable for getting to bits out. Oh, right? Oh good, but now but now you're a week late. So it's
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.760]   Time to think about it
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.120]   so
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.680]   They announced okay, so let's let me see how I'm gonna structure this I guess what I'll say is
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.360]   They announced a new product red iPhone. We thought that might happen double the iPhone SE storage
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.960]   Did an iPad mini for
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.320]   iPad Air 3 in an iPad which is an iPad Air 3 what yeah, it's not a mini
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.120]   It's not a mini it's the it's it's like an iPad Air 3, but it's just called iPad. It's technically iPad 5th generation
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.200]   Oh, I'm sorry. I'm reading the wrong headline because then I'm seeing iPad mini for discontinued. So
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:36.920]   No 32 I'm never mind iPad 4 mini with 128 gigs of storage now starts at 399 just a price drop
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.840]   Okay
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.120]   And then they debuted a new 9.7 inch iPad a 9 chip to replace the iPad Air 2
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.640]   It's the new low-end iPad. Yeah, so we'll go into detail on all of that, but the and watch bands Leo. Don't forget the watch band
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.480]   cases
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.320]   Case colors color match to the watch bands
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:02.040]   Renee's gonna spend his next like 10 paychecks on on Apple watch bands given the exchange rate. I only need eight
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:10.680]   So there are there are new striped woven nylon bands Nike sport bands
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.320]   Hermes bands
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.320]   And some new looks like some new leather bands
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.960]   So what is Camellia? It's a color
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.000]   Which one is Camellia
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.120]   Her mes relationship is so bizarre because they do not translate the name of the colors
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.560]   But they translate the name of the buckles so no one knows what the colors are
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:39.800]   But then the all the horologists are super like Apple says single deployment instead of De Proyon and horologist like how dare you Apple
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.800]   It's clearly a De Proyon, but then the color is and nobody knows it. That just means fire
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:52.560]   It's it's confusing for no reason for well the promise Camellia's come in a variety of colors including white so we don't know
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.880]   What color Camellia band is I'm sure they're trademarked by her meds at some point
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.560]   Lord what is the pictures of the get real here so
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.600]   I guess it's a good thing. They didn't have an event because if this is what they had to say
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.160]   Wouldn't be really worth try trip to Cupertino for anybody on the a team
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.400]   By the way that spelled EH
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:27.400]   Should we have an event he said I'm kind of busy that day
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.200]   Does but here's the real question. I think everybody's wondering
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.720]   Does this mean no new max this spring?
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.600]   No, nor does it mean no new iPad pros doesn't mean I think they're just clear just clearing the clearing the stuff out
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   So they're doing the little stuff
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.960]   So there may be an event later or maybe just another press release in a month or what yeah
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:59.480]   I don't I don't know that this is this can be classified as clearing stuff owed. I mean that that iPad
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.640]   That replaces the iPad 2 is is very nice entry level iPad
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:12.160]   And why would you announce this by itself if you have other iPad announcements when you just do this as part of the iPad
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160]   Announcements, it's not so if you say these are all in your iPad pros
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.640]   Oh, and by the way, we have this new entry level iPad for
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.760]   329 it's kind of just clutters up your message and if yeah, but this background and yeah, yeah
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.560]   I mean the pro people are
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.120]   going to
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.920]   Gravitate towards that iPad 9.7 pro and the the larger one
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.560]   but you know, there are a lot of people out there that want some kind of a
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.320]   replacement for either an older iPad or maybe a
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:49.680]   Computer and this is perfect for them. Yeah Apple needs a relatively low priced. Yeah iPad
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.440]   This is rate 29 for 32 gigs for 29 for 128 gigs
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:03.480]   It's their new entry level model and the biggest thing is a little smaller than the old iPad 2 and it's a little brighter display
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:09.360]   I've had air - I should say and not laminated though. It's an a 9 chip not laminated right by the way
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.840]   If you if you look at who this is going for
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:19.840]   Having the true-dome display and and things like that are that's not necessarily what they're looking for for features
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:25.720]   If that's what they want there's an iPad pro right that they can get that with but I think this is a pretty
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.120]   significant
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.800]   release now
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:35.400]   Maybe not significant and in specs if you compare it to a pro version but they weren't looking to release a pro version
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.400]   They're looking to release something that
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.880]   Everybody can use
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:46.040]   So the line now is the two iPad pros 9.7 and 12.9 inch respectively
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.040]   the iPad mini 4 is still around and
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:55.520]   Then this new iPad replaces their former low-end the iPad Air 2 and it's not it's by the way
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.520]   It's iPad yes
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.200]   So confused like what do you call the iPad non pro?
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:08.800]   It's gonna be so just the iPad plane plane iPad and this I would guess is what Apple expects most people to buy when they go in the store
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.120]   They're gonna say give me an iPad and that's what they're gonna get a work pressure
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:18.320]   And it's a replacement for people there's so many people who bought an iPad 2 or an iPad 3 and iPad 4 and or original iPad mini
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.640]   And it was just good enough it did everything they needed to but now it's getting a little bit old
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.720]   And they don't want to get a pro because it's another five hundred six hundred seven hundred dollars
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.120]   But at this price if the original iPads the iPads were five hundred dollars for a long time entry level
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.120]   And this is 329 entry level
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:37.160]   So the you know the this is the lowest priced iPad and even a mini 4
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:44.040]   Well, they don't sell a 32 gig if they did maybe it would be cheaper, but they sell 128 gig and that's 399
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:51.040]   Thirty bucks for 29 size. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, and if you went to if you went to a pro the 32 gig
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.600]   Would be considerably more be 270 bucks more so
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.080]   You have to consider Leo that
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:04.960]   Nobody in Canada actually needs the pro with the true tone display because the Sun doesn't shine
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:11.560]   Quickly they change sides in the snow team a
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.120]   Now you're on team
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:24.120]   Sunshine what does it mean? It's not what does it mean? It's not laminated. What should I care about that?
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.280]   What does that mean?
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.640]   Lamination removes the air gap in between it and it leads to less glare and it's just it's a higher end feature that Apple
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.640]   Introduced in iPhones and then an iPad sort of make them a better
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.640]   This is the Canadian iPad
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:43.560]   I am outnumbered with general want to show this is I never thought this would happen
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.840]   Well, I mean come on you and Adam, you know
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:55.240]   Same pixels per inch as the pros
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:02.400]   It's literally an iPad Air 3 they just got rid of the air 3 moniker got it. Yeah, they got it got it
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.120]   Yeah, did the I was gonna say I don't remember to the air pit
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:13.600]   I the the iPad Air 2 have the laminated display and all that I don't think so no one the original air did not the
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.600]   Air 2 got it and then this one
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:24.000]   Okay, right. Yeah, so you're not gonna get the laminated display the anti reflective coating the wide gamut the p3 gamut and the true tone display
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.160]   But as you point out no one go I mean if you need that you'll know and you'll ask for the right thing
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160]   Everybody else is just buying an iPad they don't
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.760]   They're not one series of kids are gonna complain about DCI p3 and if they do
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.640]   You sir, yeah, right?
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.320]   Processor is it a 999 a 9x does that make a big difference?
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:50.480]   It's gonna make a little bit of a difference, but I again you you have to consider who this is for
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:58.560]   You know, so will it make a big difference for people upgrading from an iPad Air 2? Yes huge
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:05.760]   Is it something for the pros? Probably not, but it's it's the difference
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.000]   What you do
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.360]   I guess from you know, I have an iPad Air 2 and actually I got it
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.480]   We had to we were doing a book about the iPad where I needed to buy it
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.480]   I was sort of a little unhappy about the time I bought it
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.720]   so I was pretty sure Apple was gonna replace it and
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:25.520]   It's lasted obviously forever. I mean it's been in it's been the top of the line non pro iPad for ages now
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.240]   And um, and I don't know I don't think I would upgrade it. They just I don't see any need
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:36.560]   And obviously if you have an iPad or an iPad 1 it's not even you know, not even close the iPad 2
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.080]   You know, not a real problem 3 4 starting to you know starting to be still still useful
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.360]   But once you've done to the iPad air, I really wonder if this people would upgrade from that
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.680]   Just doesn't seem like they would
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.280]   Pro app to do that
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.280]   Sorry, Adam Tim needs
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.920]   Needs a new car. So you gotta go
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:01.520]   I think Tim can buy a new car with changey finds is in the couch
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:08.320]   Daily cars they come with the iPhone the Apple watch no, but there's like there are pro apps that will peg that processor and things like prisma
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:13.440]   You're doing like high level filters. Maybe we'll yeah an a 9 but for most people there's there's very little they can do that
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:19.840]   We'll peg that processor right right now you see the difference in like video recording. I can't do 4k video recording
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:26.560]   But it doesn't also have the camera it has it you know, the can't neither can the 12 12 point 9. I can't either right yeah
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.880]   It's I think just a little bit of what the iPad has had problems with honestly
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.520]   I mean, I mean we've been seeing the the the growth you know sales growth slowing and that's because
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.160]   They're pretty good. You know, you know
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:43.840]   You need just buy a new iPad every year every year or two like you do with an iPhone that you can hold on to them for a long time
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.200]   I mean I have we say we have a one two three and air iPad air two and
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.720]   You know the the one in the two yeah pretty much not anymore, but even the three still pretty functional
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.520]   So, you know, it's if I was worried about how much money I was spending
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.640]   Yeah, I hold on to that thing for years and I just you know, I think that's you know the case for a lot of people
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.360]   You remember Steven Sanosquilio. I do
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:13.920]   I love this tweet today. He was in charge of windows 8 and then left with his tail between his leg
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.880]   I just I just have to have to know um
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:26.720]   He was my wife tanya's residence advisor residence hall advisor at corna. Oh wow wow he was her RA
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.040]   That's amazing former president of windows division his tweet today
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:39.760]   Yeah, fun facts on 2016 quote. I guess anemic iPad sales 43 million more than all del computers sold about the same as business laptop sold
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.280]   Wow
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:46.400]   So they're doing terribly so do wow he's actually quoting tom warren who is a windows journalist
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.200]   uh for the verge so
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.920]   Yeah, there was a couple like bloomberg had a hot take today that apples, you know run out of steam on their ipads as well
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.880]   So, yeah, I just think sometimes we lack context when we do these yeah
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.680]   Well, it's the same thing with the iphone people say oh peak iphone and yet it's you know, they sold
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.040]   An ungodly number. Um on Everest is a high
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.800]   I forget who said it, but someone today said just stay quiet and let him make you money
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.680]   Yeah
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.320]   Uh, but they must have apple must have sensed
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:19.440]   Uh in the market they needed a new kind of updated low end
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:25.200]   iPad and there would be the fact that it's called ipad first of all by by air no more errors
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:33.200]   The fact that it's called ipad kind of tells me that this is what apple thinks is the sweet spot for sales going forward
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.320]   The mainstream is the bulk thing is what everyone in education
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.840]   Yeah, who's not your own book and people in business we want to have a you know a tablet that they can take around to do pdf writing and
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.800]   Storage but this grid is is
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:52.640]   Is only for now because in a couple of weeks or whatever they announced the next generation ipad pros this is going to change right this
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.200]   so
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.200]   We're speaking a little bit in a vacuum here
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:05.040]   Well, I do think that I mean the big things obviously are the difference with the ipad pro being the smart connector and the apple pencil
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.320]   And that you know so you get the smart keyboard and the apple pencil and things like that
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:14.000]   Where they're really doing different features the laminated display and all that that feels like you know
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.240]   Details right uh, it's it's really it's really about you know the 12.9 inch obviously much bigger screen
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:26.160]   um apple pencil providing an entirely different interaction mechanism smart keyboard
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:33.120]   Being a pretty good keyboard for people who like the the feel of it that kind of thing. I mean, I know there's a clear differentiator is what you're saying
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:39.360]   Yeah, right so it feels like it feels like those are really different and and that and that's good and that's nice to see the price
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.200]   reflecting that now
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.440]   Yeah, this steve jobs famous quadrant grid apply here
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.280]   There are four products, right?
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.960]   Um, yeah, you can't really say two for business two for home
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:58.480]   They're all portable. So I guess but it is four products, which maybe is an important number
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.720]   Where do you fit in new ipads?
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:07.760]   Into this is uh, they replace the two pros and then if they do the ole edge to edge one that goes on top of everything
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.240]   So there might be a fifth the next gen
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.120]   the super pro
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:19.280]   Okay, so in other words, we're still waiting for the other shoe to drop on that
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.520]   Yeah, well, I I think that they if you look at the 12.9
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.480]   Uh, it can't do 4k video and it can't do
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:34.000]   Um, it doesn't have the the true color display and things like that stuff that I I think that they'll bring to that
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.160]   um
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.160]   You know in the in the next revision
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.760]   but
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.600]   You know the the ipad pro
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.680]   97 is very powerful. It's got the best
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.440]   uh
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.280]   screen technology
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.760]   So it's my favorite one right now
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:59.360]   I'm actually really looking forward and I hope that this is true to a 10.5 inch and it would be gravy if it were or ole
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.240]   I I really I think that will
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.960]   You know it'll happen when you you said it. It's the future ipad
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.200]   When you look at this line
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.240]   And then you go in the store and this there's that and then there's this other one
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.840]   It will stand out in a way that I think you will say oh, that's the future of ipad
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.280]   I wish I could afford that but instead I'm just gonna get this one
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:24.240]   I mean that's the thing like some people are super upset that they don't just put the new technology in at the current price points
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.480]   But sometimes that technology is incredibly expensive like just the components for the yield rates are low
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.560]   And either their choice is not to do it or to wait a couple of years and do it and if they can do it now
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.880]   I mean, I think it just pulls us off before yeah. Yeah
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.840]   All right, let's take a break then we're gonna get red
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.160]   That's not it's nice to have the a team here
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.760]   a
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:48.160]   How could I say that to distinguish it from the letter a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.320]   What are you talking about you?
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.000]   You got to look at Jim's shirt there. I have to say
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:59.200]   I know it's like it looks like it's american flag and black and white and you've got the bear republic with the stars
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.200]   It's like the california flag
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:06.400]   I don't know what else. What are you saying with that? Is that says probably a heavy metal band of some kind
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:13.440]   Is there a conflict between the bearded like is the beards day in canadian and it's sort of the passive aggressively angry at jim
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:20.000]   Sweep the beard aside so that we could see that I think it's a historic landmark. I'm not sure jim's allowed to change
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.600]   It tried to strangle me last night
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:31.520]   The fifth head on mount rushmore so so I had to go go go retro on my shirt too. They wouldn't recognize this one
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.480]   Pull down his lower third so we can see it. Oh, yeah, sorry
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:41.040]   Okay, I see a shopping cart a screwdriver and apple and what's that on the all the way on the right
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.400]   the apple cookie cookie cart screw apple
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:51.120]   Am I right?
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:56.080]   Let's see. I don't know if you can see the back stand up stand up get up a little higher. Oh, you're already standing up. That's the problem
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.000]   Think different really different
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.040]   This was the the shirt apple released when they announced the apple store in in november
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.520]   1997 wow
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:14.320]   20 years old that is a valuable item. I wouldn't be wearing that. I would save that in uh nitrogen
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.040]   that is uh
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:21.040]   It's it's it's in the collection, but uh, yeah, I was looking around for something to put on I like oh
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.080]   Apple just announced new products. I'll find the apple store shirt
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:29.200]   Was he that or mac the knife? So curtis be correct me. He says not mount rushmore leo
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.600]   Jim will be on mount beard more along with two thirds of zizi top
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:40.240]   It's actually this bath an island and then the beard they're they're usually sitting together, but mount beard more
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:46.720]   Wow, I so that shirt. I've never seen that shirt that would that is a special, but what is okay, so cookie
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:52.880]   Cart screwdriver and apple. It's not a reebis. It's not supposed to make a sentence
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.360]   It's just no, I don't think so. I think it was just uh, you need I mean
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:02.240]   This was 1997 when cookies were a big deal on the web and you needed the cookies to maintain state shopping cart obviously
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:08.800]   At the screwdriver, I think meant um, you could build your own maybe they met maybe they were gonna do like have free have chocolate
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.280]   Chip cookies like those hotels do in the lobby
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:17.200]   When you come in the apple store you did not get a cookie when you're this is you know the online store you did not get a cookie
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.440]   When you've ordered your whole thing. I said the retail store. This is their online store
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.640]   For the first online store course 97. Yeah, they didn't have retail
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.480]   This was a really big deal because I think del had started
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.960]   Selling stuff online before and then apple was fairly short close after them
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:39.680]   And obviously it became an absolutely huge deal, you know, we used they used to announce how much they'd sold for you know in the online store
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.720]   The way they sort of talk about how much came through apple retail now
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.480]   I think you're wearing an $800 shirt there that is
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:53.040]   I make sure Drake doesn't try to buy it from you. Can you offer Leo? Is that what i'm here?
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.640]   Well, i'm just looking on ebay to see what they're going for here. I uh
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.480]   I don't see anybody with that. That is a that is a collector's item
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:09.680]   I wait a minute. Here's a bad finger 1982 tour t-shirt. I have the the uh, the the apple new york one from apple
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.760]   I don't I don't see anything

[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.360]   He's no just buyer
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:42.480]   It is pretty it goes to charity. There's a justification. Yes. Uh, so this is a product red phone
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:47.040]   Yep, that means uh goes to uh bono's uh
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.160]   uh charity to fight aides
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:55.920]   Uh, you don't pay more for the phone though, right? I think it's a hundred dollars more. Oh, it is
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.760]   Yeah, okay. So that does that extra hundred go to uh?
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:06.480]   I believe so. Yeah, I mean like they'll have to wait till they do their full disclosure, but they've that's how they do 130 million to date
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:14.640]   To yeah, it's not amazing. They are the largest corporate donor 130 million dollar. That is really neat
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:22.000]   And they are handing them out. Uh or at least giving briefings. I saw joanna stern of the wall street journal
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.640]   Uh has one or is holding one. Marcus brownlee is holding one
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.720]   Um
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.560]   It's very pretty
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.720]   It is not a piano black it is
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:40.480]   Aluminum, right? It's kind of a matte finish. Is that right? It's it's an anodized aluminum and anodized aluminum and it has a white face
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.160]   Which I am not sure i'm thrilled about neither was joanna
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.720]   She says sadly the red does not extend to the front least canadian haters
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:54.160]   I mean the flag of st. George the canadian flag the swedish flag the swiss flag
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.560]   It does so many countries are celebrating today. Yeah
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:04.400]   It is pretty black. It is pretty. I have to say now it's the apple is black. It's not shiny. It's map black. It looks like
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:10.560]   I like it. I think it looks gorgeous. Yeah, I really do. I agree. Yeah
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:17.920]   Does it matter? This is a product red. Uh, I I pod touch from a while ago and it looks almost the same. Isn't it very similar?
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.280]   Yeah, yeah, does it in fact almost identical
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:26.960]   Uh, except that the apple is more of a cutout now. This is but yeah, this is before they did the embedded
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:31.520]   Right stainless steel look doesn't matter though really because doesn't everybody put it in a case
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:36.480]   I'm not I have not put my jet black in a case. I really because I just hate to it's too pretty. I know
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.080]   I just I have to because they're too slippery like to the jet black I hear is not a slippery but I have a
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:48.160]   I went over the space gray. I guess. So this this will be like the uh, uh, uh,
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.920]   I think it'll be like the space gray space gray. Yeah, it'll be yeah
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.880]   A little more sleep and notice that they can color match the antenna lines on red but not on rose gold or gold
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:03.680]   Oh, you're right. No antenna lines. They're there. They're just color matched. Oh
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.480]   There's no british racing stripes on this model
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.800]   Oh
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.080]   Well, uh, I don't know what more to say about it. Uh, when will it be in stores?
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.560]   I think you can order on friday day after tomorrow. Yeah, yeah a couple of days after
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:21.440]   And uh, and then you'll get it the following week or will you get it right away or what's the
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.800]   Uh, they usually pretty
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.880]   But I would get it immediately like if you want it they're also very good at getting so i don't say yeah
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.880]   They don't say how limited it is
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.600]   Yeah, there was a quote from greg jaz. We act uh, basically saying we made a bunch
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.240]   So
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:41.280]   Wow, I love apples account
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.800]   Yeah, we made a bunch of money. We made a bunch more than a scoosh
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:52.000]   They if you can't afford a red phone you can't at least get the new product red case
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.160]   Yeah, the black red case already existed. This is a berry red case. I believe
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.880]   Okay berry berry. I think it's so there so blue is called azure
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:04.400]   Yeah, the red is camellia and the gray is pebble
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:09.600]   There's also a barrier in the leather though the blue that's the silicone in the leather
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:16.560]   The blue is sapphire the gray is taupe and the red is berry and it is kind of more of a berry than a red
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.160]   Then it so oh, man. This is the product red
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:25.360]   Previous product red silicone case and it's much redder. Yeah, I like that one and that one has a bump
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:32.240]   Was this the battery version but there's a version without the battery there is also uh for the iphone se and I think this is quite attractive
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:39.280]   A saddle let brown leather case. So yeah, there is there is a product that red leather case
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:44.080]   That's not one of these that's not one of those. Okay, that's it. That's an entirely different thing
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:48.880]   I'm so yeah, that's the berry is not there's not the same thing. I don't use cases
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.960]   You don't either
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:56.480]   I don't use cases at all. Yeah, I don't like it too. I stick it in in here and
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:05.280]   He's got a fur case. The only time I've ever I've ever used a case is
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:11.600]   during the the iphone five days when I would put a mophie on it
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:16.960]   but with the uh six plus um and seven plus
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:21.120]   I don't need one the the battery last ring. Yep
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.720]   And I I just love the feel of the phone the way that it is
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.360]   I hate to when you have something and it's been it's been frustrating because
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:35.040]   uh previous iphones I have felt like I had to put it in the case, but this one I just for some reason it's just so beautiful
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.400]   I don't want to
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.240]   Put it in the case and it's held up. You know I have those micro abrasions that they talked about
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.240]   So it's looks like I use like a money on falcon. Yeah
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:51.040]   That that would be like putting me in a case. I mean I'm beautiful the way I am. There's no need to put me
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.200]   No need to put Jim in the case. That's for sure. That's why he put in the ball without a helmet
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.120]   I think I think the red leather case would be good for you, Jim
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.000]   Well, you know you never know
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.680]   So I'm I guess off to go to the uh, here it is. Here's no, that's the phone
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.800]   This they call that the special edition
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.600]   So that is the case uh
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.280]   I can send you the URL. It's uh, it's in the apple store at least. Yeah
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.080]   Okay new
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:25.840]   Azure. Oh, well. Oh, yeah. Here's a bright red one. Look at that. Here's a product red one. It's bright red
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:32.160]   Yeah, that's one that that Renny just showed us, isn't it? It's like it. It's silicone
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.200]   Yeah, except mine's the bump
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:38.080]   But he has the bump. This was this is the bump free order by five pm delivers tomorrow
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.160]   So you can get the case right now
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.320]   Yeah, and either silicone or or leather
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.920]   There and it's the same price for the case 35 bucks
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:50.000]   For whatever color you get I think I got a lot of colors now
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.320]   That's yeah, and they again they match the watch band so you can be totally like fashionable
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.320]   Have a case for every occasion
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.000]   Yeah, I like some people talk about my mom loves it
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.080]   When the spring comes she puts on her yellow iphone case and her yellow watch band and then she changes
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.520]   And she likes matching them and changing them up because it goes with the change of seasons for her
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:11.760]   And I'm sure there's a lot of people I have a friend who changes his watch band to match his shirt every day
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.760]   So what does she get white and black?
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:20.880]   No yellow, but we need some color here to stand out. I think she is blue in the winter yellow in the spring
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.680]   Product red puts on once in a while
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.680]   Uh
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.640]   We also have a new se in town
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:35.680]   The price so what's new about the se it's the price is double memory double memory
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:39.040]   Yeah
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.800]   And that's that's going to be huge that was the the main complaint
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.920]   Of story
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:51.680]   Yeah, no, no, so they started 32 now. Yeah now that's that's huge. I mean
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:58.720]   It's funny that apple went to a larger phone and then people were complaining and wanted a smaller phone
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:03.440]   They gave them a smaller phone, but the the main complaint was that the capacity wasn't there
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:08.880]   399 for 32 now it is 499 for 128 gigs
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:13.120]   And that would be surprised if the memory chips are just cheaper in those capacities now that they are
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.200]   16 right and it goes on sale friday
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.240]   Otherwise exactly the same as a 5s
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.640]   with the inter externally and internally as a 6s
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:31.040]   I I think this is uh for a lot of people not just price saver. They want a five inch phone and this is uh, this is a good choice for them
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:35.600]   I love it. Great. I use it as a pocket camera. Do you use an AC? Oh interesting
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.720]   Well, you have if you take see the whole conceit is if you take instagram pictures of apple products you need a second camera
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:47.280]   Let's take the photos of and it has the 6s camera though. Not the 7 camera, right? Yeah, the 6s camera. Okay
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.080]   Which is still a pretty good camera
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:56.560]   I'm gonna start checking the uh the metadata on your on your pictures that you posted the site because if they're done with the sam's song then
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.880]   I'm gonna call you ever
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.760]   iPhone iPhone 7 plus sir
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:09.440]   He wants portraits you can tell because the blacks aren't aren't overly crushed and the sat's not boosted
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.560]   Wow, is that the case with the sam's songs?
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.320]   See it's really weird because apple usually doesn't want you to have to make your own choices
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.280]   They want to make those choices for you, but in the camera app for apple
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:24.240]   They just want to give you a natural picture and let you modify it where sam's song knows rightly that people
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:27.920]   Mostly just want to crush the blacks and booths to sats. It would for you
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.120]   But I like doing it for myself. So it all depends on your preference. Right
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:38.480]   Well, there you have it. That's the uh, those were all kind of slipstreamed announcements today with the press releases
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.440]   We mentioned the bands. We mentioned the cases
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.240]   The i-clip the new app quips
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.440]   Ah, which you can't get till next month
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.320]   No, unless you're laurin good
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:54.800]   Yeah, laurin had a very extensive review of it. I guess she got a briefing
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.520]   uh of clips
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.240]   um, it is
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.400]   How do you how do you it's a social app without the social?
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.960]   It's they say it's like um
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.560]   Prisma, it's like a front end for social sharing so you take your photos
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:14.640]   You make them the way you look like you want it and then you send it to instagram where it's snapchat or something from there
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.120]   And is the sharing just kind of built in?
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:24.800]   I'm almost certain to use a share sheets which is as long as i just standard live titles let you easily create animated captions
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.880]   Just by talking as you record
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.440]   It's photobooth too
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:35.920]   It is but you know don't knock photobooth because that is the sleeper app on macotages. It's the like the
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:39.200]   Really? I'm not sure i've launched it
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:43.040]   You don't have you do have kids people in apple stores. I mean, I just
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.600]   Anybody in an apple store
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.360]   Uh, oh man, you know, you get if you want to show off a mac
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.880]   You just fire up photobooth and that's in walk away for a while
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:58.080]   And then people start lip syncing and dancing and so these filters do look that looks like Prisma a lot
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:02.400]   Yeah, you can drop in emoji apply overlays like speech bubbles and arrows
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.480]   Set the mood with music that automatically adjust to the length of your video
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.520]   So yeah, this is kind of cool
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.760]   It's kind of apple saying well, you know, we we're not going to bring back a social network
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.080]   Ping wasn't such a socket
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:20.320]   And it's not tied to iMessage like the previous social like
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:24.800]   You could draw and do stuff on iMessage previously, but this is its own thing and you can use it anywhere
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.880]   Oh, this is interesting clip recognizes who is in your videos
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:32.160]   And then makes smart suggestions for sharing
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.840]   Just tap a name to send your video using messages
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.560]   Or post to your favorite platforms
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.040]   That's interesting
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:46.880]   I think it's going to be very popular if it's really easy if it's just as easy as taking a picture within instagram
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:52.800]   To post to instagram for instance, then I think why wouldn't you use clips, right? Right, right?
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:58.800]   What's it going to do when it sees people in the background of your video?
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:03.600]   You don't know this guy, but you don't know this guy, but you should really share with us on tinder
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.800]   Swipe left to share to him
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.280]   Or no, you swipe right if it's good, right?
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.920]   You'll photo bomb everybody
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.400]   weird bomb
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:19.840]   I'm intrigued by this thing that you can it will take
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.520]   a
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.480]   It will title it based on what you're saying
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:29.440]   Yeah, I think the review said that that was really hard to kind of to actually do
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.280]   Okay
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.280]   Yeah, it doesn't do it well or
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:36.400]   I think it was just one of those things where maybe you get used to it
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.600]   Maybe it's a skill you learn
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:44.880]   But the fact is is that this is not something that most people are really used to doing because this sounds like you would film yourself
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.880]   and talk
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.480]   and then it would
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:54.400]   Take it as dictation and fit as much as it can on the screen with it one shot and then do another shot the new nut like it would
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.720]   Automatically caption it. It's like captioning
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:01.760]   That this sounds like a really lame problem, but there are a lot of people who once instagram stories launched
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.960]   They have huge followings on instagram, but they also want to keep their snapchat audience
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:08.720]   So they were trying to save the clip and then reupload it to one of them and snapchat would box it
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.800]   So you look like a like an instagram refugee and instagram would make it like a little bit goofy
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:16.000]   And if you could just create everything in one place and send it to all the different
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.760]   We've talked about this before this just there's new social networks every week and we have the same
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:26.560]   Capacity to tend them so some of them go fallow and some of them are like overgrown and we have to run around to twitter and facebook and instagram and
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.880]   Snapchat and just if you can make one place
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:35.600]   That's just more time effective to maintain all these things. This reminds me of the tv app in apple tv
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:41.600]   Uh, which became the home page when apple tv updated and the idea was it didn't work by the way
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.920]   but the idea was
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:49.120]   If you know all of your shows here and so go through apple to get the apple will intermediate
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:52.560]   To get you to what you want and the only reason didn't work is because it didn't have netflix
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.520]   So it not being complete. It's not really useful
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.920]   But if this is like has complete social networks, this could be the front end of a social network for apple
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.240]   It's an interesting play. It's like saying
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:07.520]   You know, it's kind of like sneaking in in between mediating. Yeah, inter mediating. Yeah
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:13.440]   It's a very interesting play, but there's a it's a risky play as apple learned with with apple tv
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:17.440]   If if it isn't good then people just gonna turn it off and never use it and i never use it
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:22.800]   I've in fact it really annoyed me that it became the home screen you heard we we had explained to Andy how to make it not be your
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.120]   your home button
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.200]   I mean we still hasn't launched outside the u.s. So it's a pain that I sympathize with that haven't felt
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.920]   Oh, you don't you haven't felt the pain you will you'll know you still have the videos app go what the hell happened to my what
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.880]   Um, oh the videos app man that they trash that too. I mean they because
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:44.480]   It because you have to load the tv app has to load everything
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:49.920]   From the internet that's available. You can't get to your videos until you know, you're gonna wait
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:58.080]   It's very frustrating. They killed the videos app and then replaced it with something that's much slower and more sluggish. See that's the risk
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:03.920]   Don't don't mediate if you don't do it better. You have to make it a better experience
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:11.040]   All right clips coming sometime next month at lorrin good had a very
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.200]   extensive
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:18.480]   Kind of feature review. I think other did others or just would just lorrin somehow get only solorrin
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:22.800]   But I don't know others did as well lorrin got lorrin got the goods as they say
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:27.680]   Very funny good for her
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:34.960]   Clips tells me apple one wants to be relevant in social messaging two still believes in the value of local and private
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:40.720]   Three sees messages as social. Yeah, the fact that it goes right to messages is kind of interesting
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:46.080]   Um, yeah, I mean in another I would not have been surprised if they didn't launch this app
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.200]   We just saw this as new features blended into the messages app and IOS 11
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:56.080]   They could have they could have right. Why did that? Yeah, that's interesting. This is a smarter way to go though. You think so? Yeah
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:03.600]   All right, we should set the set the reminder and the calendar for a year from now and see where we're at
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.440]   Yep
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.440]   Remember
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:13.760]   These things yeah year later. Hey, where'd that go is clips the next cards?
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.120]   Mm-hmm. Yeah, remember cards
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.520]   Remember Texas hold them
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.640]   You know, uh, actually Andy Hertzfeld told me that
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.520]   Not Andy Hertzfeld bill Atkinson told me he was not happy about cards
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.400]   Because of course he has a photocard app
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:35.280]   And apparently he shortly before apple came out with cards. He showed Steve jobs
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.920]   the photocard app
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:42.800]   And jobs was very very interested in then if like six months later apple does these this card's app
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.760]   And he was a little miffed
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.480]   uh, he got uh
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.800]   What are they what do they call that when you get?
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.240]   Sherlock Sherlock Sherlock. Yes. Yeah
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.360]   You got Sherlock. Oh, you know
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:01.120]   Go ahead if you're good. You can more yardie them right back like
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:07.120]   You got more yachtyed
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.760]   uh apple does apple price fix
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.760]   I
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:18.000]   Know the context for the question
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:26.080]   Russia says they do so, uh, you'd be hard pressed to find an apple product at a at a discounted price
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.440]   Maybe five bucks, but never much more than that in the us
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:36.720]   Russia says that's exactly what apple does in Russia last august they opened an investigation and
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:42.320]   This week russia's federal anti monopoly service found apple guilty of price fixing
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.600]   They says because because they don't discount
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:52.000]   Well, not apple, but the re but the channels right so apple controls channel pricing too. You're not supposed to
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.960]   Well specifically apple apparently instructed 16 retailers in russia
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:03.280]   To set the price at a certain amount if a retailer was found to be selling the iphone at a quote unsuitable price
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.920]   apple would contact them in order to change
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.000]   Order them to change the price or risk having the sales agreement terminated
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   I mean they've been successful. So that must be what happens in the us
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.960]   Right. Yeah, so they have a perceived value thing
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.400]   But they don't like the idea of apple stuff being on sale because it makes it seem cheap to them
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:24.480]   But they're not entirely successful like companies like walmart and best buy and others have sales all the time
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.840]   It used to be more rare
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:30.560]   But now it's become far more common because the products have become more mainstream and the markets become more contentious
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:36.000]   And i'm sure apple hates that that happens because to them it sounds like a bogo deal at verizon get two iphones free
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:42.480]   And it just makes our brand sound cheap, but you know they they are not always successful in getting what they want kind of a sad state with
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:49.840]   But but for the most part apple is just trying to control its brand and and how that brand is perceived
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:53.600]   I mean if you have uh, you know a sale every other week
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:44:01.680]   Like you know samsung or or some of these other companies do where you buy one get 15 free for all your neighbors and family and friends
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.160]   Then you know the worth of that
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.320]   brand goes down
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.680]   if you sell your products for the price that they are
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:17.200]   Then you know apple is is uh, I I think that apple's products are are fairly priced
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.840]   So
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.840]   You know you want them or you don't
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:26.640]   Well, it's gonna be like those emails where they are could
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:29.920]   Including the way that the government found with amazon then they'll have a problem
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.920]   But if it's just they get super angry
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.080]   From a fit. I will say that apple plays plays hardball with the channels
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:38.880]   So if you're an individual
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.240]   Apple really controls
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:49.520]   The horizontal and the vertical and you don't earn a whole lot from selling an iphone or a mac or something like that
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.800]   I would submit it keeps prices artificially high because
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.760]   You can't discount
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.040]   And if a retailer says i'm going to give up 50% of my profit
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:04.800]   Because i'd like to get more sales they should be able to do so that benefits us as the consumer
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.840]   But it sometimes the perception
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:14.640]   Sorry apple is itself the main purvey. I mean the main sales channel. So that's one of the awkward things
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.640]   So undercut apple's own stores
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:23.840]   Right. And so I think that's part of where they're coming from a little bit more so than other companies is they really want to make sure that they're not
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:26.480]   Uh cutting the prices on themselves
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:31.360]   It's just a sad state when the russia does a better job protecting consumers than
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.560]   We do
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:40.800]   I mean if there's a russian pad that goes against the ipad. I mean, there's let's not get into the dynamics of the russian
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.040]   All right, all right
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:48.800]   I get you know, I'm obviously if apple were violating the law in the us they would there would be something going on and apparently it's not
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.080]   It's so for you thrush. I don't know where's we see the russian. I mean like we see it
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:55.680]   We don't see the right we see the sales in the us. I mean despite you know what apple would probably prefer
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:00.800]   We see discounts at walmart and radiate and uh, I'm gonna say radiate. Wow best buy in costco
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:06.880]   Radio shack remember that we have deals all the time now for like apple watches and yeah and everything
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:11.280]   It's just a question of apple won't give them extra discounts for extra incentives away some companies do it
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.000]   Which makes it harder for them to do those sales, but they can still do them
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:20.880]   Let's take a break augmented reality in the news. I'm worried. I might have to buy dinner for robert scoble in paris
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:24.560]   You're gonna have to protect me here
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.520]   Uh, I have a bet
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:33.120]   Is it your bet involving the clear iphone or any form of augmented? Well, I you know what I wish we're gonna have to go to the tape
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.560]   Yes
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:40.400]   Fortunately, it's recorded, but I stopped the record and we went pretty sure I said clearly
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:45.920]   No, no, I don't mean like you can look through the camera like pokémon go and see what's out there
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:51.920]   I'm he said there will be a clear iphone and I said you can strap to your face and walk around there is a clear iphone
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.920]   I will buy you dinner at the restaurant of your choice. He said paris
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:06.160]   I don't think he meant paris texas. So, uh, anyway take a break. We'll talk about augmented reality. There's uh, there's news
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:11.120]   But first a word from tracker. Do you lose things? I lose things
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:16.320]   I lose my keys mostly remotes. Oh, yeah, I've lost some luggage. I've lost
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.680]   My wall and I've lost my
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.440]   average american according to uh, newsweek spends 55 minutes a day
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:29.520]   Searching for stuff. They know they have but they can't find you got a tracker good man
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:33.520]   One of our audience members has a tracker. I put this on my keys
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:40.320]   This is the tracker. It is a coin sized like a quarter sized, uh, bluetooth tracker
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:45.040]   It's weighs less than a quarter. It's very light because it's anodized aluminum. You can engrave it
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:50.080]   This one's got our mac break weekly album art printed on it with using their uv led printing
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:56.880]   Which gives you a really nice permanent colorful image on it. But more importantly what it does
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:00.080]   So you pair this to your phone
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:06.320]   And a few things happen you can customize uh two-way separation alerts, which I love
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:12.880]   Uh, because very often, you know, the best thing to not lose your keys is to get a warning the minute you get out of range
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:17.680]   So when as long as you're uh, you know, as soon as you go more than 100 feet away from your keys your phone goes, hey
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.760]   You left your keys. Hey
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.520]   And vice versa
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.760]   In fact, there's even a button on the tracker you can press that will make your phone make noise so you can find it quickly
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:28.000]   but
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.880]   The tracker also has the world's largest crowd gps network. See trackers sold
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:35.760]   Four and a half million devices now
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:41.360]   That means there are tracker users all over the world and whenever a tracker users
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   apps spots your tracker
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:49.120]   It will send you an alert saying hey your keys they're an asher by john
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:54.640]   How they get there don't know, but that's where they are all over the world
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:57.680]   So here's the deal
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:00.960]   Tracker is available with a 30 a money back guarantee
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:06.080]   One of the reasons I really like it is because you can replace the batteries some of these bluetooth trackers
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:10.480]   You cannot you have to throw it out, which I think is wasteful not the tracker
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:15.840]   inexpensive, you know those quarter size batteries that you get at the drugstore you just pop a new one in
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:19.200]   And it's good to go because of bluetooth lee can last up to a year
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:25.360]   Between changes stop losing your stuff today. Go to the tracker.com actually the hardest thing to find
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:30.480]   In all of this will be the site because they spell it weird t h e t r a c k r

[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:17.120]   Our guests are adam angst from the great tidbits one of the world. I think the oldest longest running apple newsletter in existence
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:20.000]   Been going on when did you start?
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.040]   nayprol of 1990 coming up on 27 years older even than the online store
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:31.120]   But yeah, i was gonna say i've got the shirt to prove it. What was the mac in 1990?
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:33.520]   Was it a mac classic?
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:41.280]   Classics were available to see eyes to se 30s 2 effects. Oh, yeah, the seether oh the 2 effects
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.840]   Which stands for too freaking expensive
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:48.320]   John the league essay told us wicked fast. I have a
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:55.040]   2fx motherboard framed to fx motherboard here somebody gave to find by john lewy i should get it
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:57.280]   I should get john lewy to sign it. That's a great idea
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:01.600]   Um, yeah, that was the was that the first mac was slots. I think it was
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:06.960]   Well, it was the mac 2. I mean it was it was in the mac 2. That's right. The two effects was that it was the two
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:12.080]   Was right? Yeah, I came a little bit the two ci was that what's that the cut down one and that's like actually a bunch a bunch of
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:17.440]   A bunch of really good macs that that uh, that is the 30s. One of my favorites. Oh the se30 remember that
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:23.600]   Man and then had a fast hard drive and man that that thing was like that was a real computer finally
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:28.640]   And there was one slot so we had an external monitor uh an apple rgb
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:34.000]   13 inch color monitor plugged into a little it on a little like a little tiny slot
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.920]   Yeah, you could get one slot one thing and then later in ethernet card remember the day
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:44.080]   And it was it was it the se30 because it was a 68 thousand 30 processor. Yeah. Yeah, the 030
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:46.880]   From the running at a
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:51.920]   Amazing 16 megahertz ladies and gentlemen not gigahertz
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.240]   megahertz
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.400]   But it still boots faster than a modern day mac
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.200]   Hahahaha
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:02.560]   Hey, what before we get before we get to the augmented reality what
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:11.040]   I think there are uh, I saw a lot of tweets this morning people just going oh crap apple's just done with the mac
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:13.680]   Is apple out of the computer business?
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:19.860]   No, we last year they did the iOS devices first and then later they did the they did a press release and they put out the updated kv
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:23.520]   Sorry was it not kv like it was skylake version of the mac book. So i'm anticipating
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:26.560]   We'll just don't you feel like though as a mac lover, which I am
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:30.000]   Uh, we're just keep getting blows to the head
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.960]   No, it depends on what mac
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:38.800]   Uh, you want and they've updated their uh, their laptops mac books macbook pros
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:44.560]   Um, you know that stuff has been updated. Oh, but those macbook pros. I'm sorry. You know what I ended up doing
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:46.640]   I traded in my touch bar 15
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:50.560]   with the with the piece of toast sized trackpad
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:54.000]   for the lower end function key
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:01.760]   13 and not this is a classic mac. This is like this feels like the like a great mac
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:07.440]   And it feels like to me like the last great mac. It's not as fast. I know doesn't have as many thunderbolt ports
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.200]   Just two instead of four
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:14.960]   But this is like this is like the old school mac and this is still giant the trackpad but not as giant
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:21.040]   Uh, I don't know. I love I was really glad I traded in the 15 touch bar for the function key
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:24.240]   13 this is I have one of each I have a
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:27.680]   15 touch bar and I have a 13
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:30.000]   Uh function key
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.200]   And I don't hug I don't hug mine like you do yours
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:36.400]   Uh, but you know, I'm not judging. I'm not judging
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.840]   You could be hugging it out of the beard. We wouldn't know
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:43.760]   But there is something to be said for the lack of
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:49.840]   A pro desktop machine four years my friend for years. You cannot ignore
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.800]   that that there's
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.880]   I don't know what's going on there. But
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:54:01.760]   To say that apple is ignoring the mac. I I think is is a pit misleading because they're not ignoring the mac
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.840]   There it's certainly ignoring the pro
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:08.240]   Yeah, I mean they've updated the iMacs as you point out too. So yeah
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:14.560]   We are too we are due for an iMac update and a mac mini update that that may be gone right the mini
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.920]   Yeah, that was a switcher machine
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:20.320]   Nobody's switching anymore longer than the age of speaking. Yeah
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:26.240]   This is what I get when I go to the mac apple.com/mac-pro. I get a blank screen
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:34.400]   Well, you're on a surface. I mean an apple defense. It says you're using a windows machine. Uh, you don't really what is going on?
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:41.280]   What is this? It's so it's supposed to happen. It's supposed to ah there it comes here. It comes your windows machine is just too slow
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.640]   It's too slow
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:46.320]   I wonder do they still mention aperture at the bottom here? I'm sure they did
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.840]   Oh lord
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:52.160]   So they haven't not only have they not updated the mac pro in years they haven't updated the website in years
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:55.920]   Still apple computers on just kidding
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:00.160]   So I don't want them to do a new trash can mac
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:04.480]   I want them to do a return to the cheese grater mac
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:09.600]   Or a cheese grater 2.0 cheese grater 2.0. Yeah, I want an expandable mac
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:16.800]   But anyway, what I want doesn't seem to I think a lot of pros would would certainly agree with you. Yeah
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:23.600]   Yeah, I have to say that as someone who was always buying mac pros and power macs before that the
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:28.320]   27 inch retin iMac is just a great machine. It is a great. It's what I have. It is
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:31.520]   I mean now it's my desktop. Yeah, and that was in front
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:36.720]   You know the first one that really drew me away because well there wasn't anything new and with the longest time
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:39.520]   And as long as I can get a second monitor on it
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:46.640]   Uh as you can with the with the 27 inch iMac i'm happy. So I mean, yeah, it's a 27 inch thunderbolt, which isn't retinun
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:52.160]   You know, etc, etc. It's not the same height. So I can't put it up in a book so that it matches my
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:54.160]   That's what I do
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:56:00.080]   But but other than that, you know, that's that's 20. I have to say I can't complain too much about the 27 inch retina
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:03.120]   Hey, you know what I think they've taken the aperture references out
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:07.600]   Yeah, I was just I just went look they they did I can't find it
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:13.760]   I have instead they have a pixel-made or reference, which is a little photography. Nope. They finally took it out. Okay
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.400]   So there have been improvements to the mac pro
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:20.560]   websites updated it no longer runs aperture
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:30.000]   Too in in their defense the zion e5 processor in this mac pro is not particularly out of date
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:35.840]   Um, but the graphics cards if they're gonna solder the graphics cars the AMD fire pro gpu
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:39.120]   Yeah, it should be updating those, you know twice the early
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:45.280]   Well and because they yes because they didn't give you the ability to put a new card in if they had just done the cheese grater
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.280]   And we could put it in a car that would be fine
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:50.240]   But you can't
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:56.080]   So anyway apple. I hope you're listening wouldn't it be what they can't do just like
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:00.960]   It wouldn't be too much of a repudiation to say yeah, we're going back to the cheese grater
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:04.640]   They'll have that when they did that with a buttonless shuffle. They did that with the fatty nano
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:12.000]   Yeah, so it just well turns out our customers really want but with this I can sort of feel this because there's always like
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.480]   Yeah, I have to clean up the spare room and I know it's this huge job and oh, but I have this
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.720]   It just feels like apples procrastinating at this point
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.840]   Like they know that there's something about it, but they just don't want to face it
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:26.800]   So there's just like another year has gone by we'll really fix it this year. Okay. Oh, it's December damn
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:29.280]   We shipped the knife on though. Everything's good. Don't look over here
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:32.560]   And there's this really big campus now. We've got that
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:37.600]   Yeah, thank you for acknowledging that rene. I appreciate it because it does feel like that
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:41.440]   Do it
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.440]   Go ahead. Uh, Adam. I'm sorry
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:48.560]   It was just as like with a with a number of people apple has really you couldn't find someone go grab some interns
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.640]   It's like you're on the mac pro now
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:52.640]   You know, just do something
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:56.320]   It's sort of like the apple tv where they went like four years between apple tv
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:01.200]   It's not that they weren't working on it's that at first they were trying all these different things and it's possible that
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:07.520]   They were trying the cheese grater 2.0. They're trying an updated version of this can and they're sort of stuck like paralysis by analysis
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:11.040]   They're stuck not chipping a product because they're not sure what product they should ship now
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:14.720]   And they have to make maybe they still have to make it in the us and call me
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:21.360]   I'll tell you what by analysis. That sounds like a uh, you know an alternative band name. I like it
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:23.760]   One shot of one shot of auto by
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:26.000]   I thought I like it. I like it
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.320]   uh, so
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:30.320]   but
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.320]   we
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:35.200]   Just because we had an announcement today does not preclude
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:40.240]   Uh, something coming in the next month. No, I don't know
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:45.200]   And and do you think there will be something in that i've seen zit zero zip
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:48.560]   Zilch not rumors about max at all
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:54.640]   Well, the mat is there came you like updates all it is it's got a processor. Yeah, they've got a new processor
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:58.240]   They could update to and we've got a 5k display and it's dcip 3
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:02.640]   It's still one of the best displays in the industry. It is very little and they're not going to change the design of the iMac this year
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:06.080]   So there's really lots to do besides changing the processor and the graphics card
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:12.880]   And update the Mac pro, but you know, they're they're in there in this this situation where
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:20.000]   Uh, if they release an update to any of the max and they upgrade the graphics card and and you know, maybe
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:25.680]   Memory or something like that then people complain that oh, that's it. That's all you did
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:30.320]   But if they don't update it then people say well, you're ignoring it the mac is dead
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:34.160]   So they're in kind of a tough situation to to try and update it
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:40.400]   So typically what apple is has done is wait until that there's something significant
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:44.000]   Especially since they're four years into a mac pro
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:49.920]   Uh, they want something significant so that you know, people don't see a new mac pro and say really
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.160]   That's it
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:57.040]   So, you know, we waited four years for this so if they do update it it has to be
[00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:02.560]   A significant update and it's like ranny said, you know, they they want to i'm sure that they want to
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:10.400]   But you know as as the years passed, I think damn missed it again, you know, I so we'll just have to see you there
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.360]   You see you there mac pro you're looking at me. We see you stop running
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:21.840]   So niel seibard had an interesting take and is that about above abalone the blog saying that actually the air pods
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:29.120]   At $159 are under priced yeah that the apple watch at $269 is under priced
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:35.840]   So people look at the air pods and they think it's about sound but it's not it's about those chipsets and the radio technology and then that's the expensive part
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.480]   Because people say $149 for that crappy audio and it's like well
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.880]   You've got a computer chip in each one and you've got a lot of radio technology and sensors in each one
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.680]   And that's what increases a price and if apple could have sold them for less
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.040]   They would because that's the best thing you can do when you want to take away people's headphone jacks
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:52.320]   And he makes a good case when he lists the other bluetooth, you know
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:58.880]   Wireless headphones, they they are more expensive that this I guess it's an expensive thing to make
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.520]   What what people need to understand about
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:08.400]   The air pods is it's about convenience audio files are not going to like the air pods
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:15.840]   99 of the world will love the air pods because they're so convenient you take them out of the case you pop them in your ear
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:22.400]   And they just work, you know, do they sound as good as you know a thousand dollar pair of headphones?
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:27.120]   No, is that what you're looking for if you get air pods? No
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:34.960]   So for 150 bucks, I I buy those all day long. Yeah, if I really want to pair the beard
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:40.960]   If I really want to uh to listen to my
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:48.480]   My music and in you know pristine audio then first of all you you shouldn't be listening to
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.320]   10p three files
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.520]   Uh, you know, there's a lot of different things besides the headphones, but
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:59.360]   Even if I want to listen to the best audio that I can through headphones. I'll get my future sonics
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.880]   I'll listen to them through those and it'll be beautiful
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:10.560]   But if i'm just going outside to you know walk around i'll probably just take the air pods pop them in and it's perfect
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:14.240]   And I think frankly if i'm going to do phone calls, I'll use the air pods
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.880]   Yes all the time. I really like them as a bluetooth headset for phone calls
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:24.880]   I will say after I mentioned the the tiny little chinese uh knock off earbuds. No, they don't say knock off
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.880]   But they're the super duper cheap
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:31.120]   Chinese single ear earbuds. I mentioned them on the january third show
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:38.480]   And uh, I got a ton of people asking me for details because they're they're hard to find in terms of not knowing what to search on
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:45.120]   And uh, you know, yeah, they're nowhere near as good as the air pod's but they cost somewhere between five and fifteen dollars
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:53.840]   So that's a good if you're if you're really not concerned about quality, which i'm not if i'm listening to a podcast while i'm doing yard work
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:03:00.800]   Um, they're they're a really easy option and I said i've heard from a bunch of people who are actually not happy about their air pods
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.760]   Just taking them places because they're afraid they'll lose them
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:07.360]   They're too, you know, too small they can fall out that kind of stuff and for a
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:12.400]   $60 they don't want to take that risk. I mean, yeah, the other ones may be 300
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:17.040]   They wouldn't take those either it's still 160 bucks as opposed to you know 12
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:24.000]   Did you we reviewed uh this week on the new screensavers, Jason howl reviewed these out as the
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.560]   I signs which have a lightning connector their their mfi
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:34.880]   They're planar magnetic there they start at 399. I think this is the 599 i sign 20
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:40.480]   Uh first any year planar magnetic is anybody listen to these I didn't get a chance to i've Jason
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:44.560]   I didn't but uh, they'll be lost on me. I love planar magnetic
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:50.320]   Over the ear headphones. I have a pair of high-five mands. He said they really sound good
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:56.960]   Um and they're and they're made they even have an app they're they're they have built-in dsp
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:00.000]   And an enlightening connector
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:06.240]   So you're getting digital out of the phone and then doing the uh conversion to analog in the headphone
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:13.120]   There's a couple of earbuds that i'm blanking on the names right now, which I actually think are more interesting yet
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:16.480]   Uh, and they're a bit more expensive than the airpods obviously
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:20.960]   But they do that the kind of thing that they you know, they go in your ears and then you have an app that will
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:27.440]   Deal with ambient noise and deal with directionality and filter certain certain frequencies and things like that
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:32.400]   And I think that's where the interesting stuff is going to be happening because we live in very loud environments
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.880]   And if we can start to control that via
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:40.800]   An earbud as well, then there's more going on than just playing audio from a source and trying to
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:45.360]   Right play it louder than the truck outside or the airplane or whatever it is
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:49.760]   Uh, all right. Let's talk about augmented reality
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:56.160]   Um, why are you laughing? It's the next big thing didn't you see the article in bloomberg?
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.120]   Watch it. I don't need to do it on
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:02.160]   You don't need german to tell you it's the next big thing
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:10.400]   Uh apple is betting on augmented reality. We've known that I mean tim cook keep saying augmented reality in interviews. So that's tim signaling
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:14.000]   but uh, is it i guess the the
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.280]   leak is that this is going to be in the next iphone
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:21.120]   and that uh, there will be
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:26.000]   I don't know what it's not going to be a clique. Is it going to be a
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:29.920]   Clear eye. The thing is the thing is that uh, the camera is the biggest seller
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:35.120]   We saw that with the iphone seven plus anything apple can do to the camera to make people want it is what drives sales for the iphone
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.520]   And it's unclear. You know, you've done a lot of dslr stuff
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:41.920]   They've got the depth of field stuff now. They've got the analog zoom stuff now
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:46.880]   What else do you do with the camera ar starts to become super interesting if you can put sensors in there that make people think that camera
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:50.400]   Is even better and can do even cooler stuff like spatial mapping and all yeah
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.200]   They're complaining comparing it to google's project tango
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:58.320]   Which does that so that you can hold up your phone in a store and you'd see where everything is
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:02.080]   Yeah, but google's is made by a bunch of engineers and apple's going to be driven by a bunch of designers
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:08.080]   So it's kind of a different sort of real world use game apple has according to german hired a number of people
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:15.040]   Uh to do this including a couple of years ago mike rockwell who ran the hardware and new technologies groups at dolby
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:21.120]   Uh rockwell also advised meta small firm that makes a $950 pair of ar glasses
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:26.000]   The the the leaks seem to indicate that apple will at some point do glasses
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.160]   But that this year they'll put ar in the iphone
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:34.480]   Everything I could think of and you know, this is where apple really blows your mind
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:41.200]   Right everything I could think of right now is kind of incremental on existing augmented reality stuff kind of pokemon go
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:48.480]   Rit law lens or yeah, uh in fact they have people from the holland's group from the google glass group
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:51.120]   um somebody from
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.320]   Amazon's virtual reality platform
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:59.680]   Forget how it was but there's a third party helmet that lets you put an iphone in that makes it work like a holland's and they were just they could
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:07.520]   Not stop saying how on we had them on and it was awesome and it was better than holland lens because they're the silicon and apple's phones are so great
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:14.560]   Right. It's always so powerful. Yeah, he we did this on the new screensaver's about a month ago. He demonstrated
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:22.000]   You know, we were we were in augmented reality here in this studio and you know, there was you could put stuff on a table
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.600]   And then you look over to the right and there's a brick wall over here
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:31.200]   And a hole opened up in the wall and you could step into a bookstore and become suddenly virtual reality
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.600]   It was a very impressive demo
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:40.400]   And if you think about what pegs in a 10 processor, it's the uh depth of field and sometimes the filters that you use for photos
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:43.840]   But very little else really pegs that and apple is still increasing the power of those processors
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:49.040]   So they're gonna want to use that for something and that a art makes a great use case apple has also opened an office
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:54.640]   In new Wellington, New Zealand and lured employees from wetter digital, which is of course a special effects
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:59.120]   Company that that worked on the hobbit and king kong and avatar
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:02.720]   They acquired metayo, which was an ar software company
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:06.800]   Uh and their former cio now works with apple
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:11.760]   Uh fly by media last year, which makes an ar related camera program
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.680]   And tim cook visited magically last summer
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:22.880]   So uh, which is of course the the secret super secret ar play that everybody's time sense
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:32.160]   Yeah prime sense the the israeli company that did the next for uh, yeah, microsoft. They've got people from uh, the oculus team
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:37.840]   So that you know, this is what apple can certainly do they they've spent a lot of money pulling a lot of people together
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.320]   This is what they did before the apple watch came out
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:46.080]   Uh, but but i'm just curious mostly because i'm worried about having to buy dinner in paris
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:50.960]   I'm just curious what you think we'll see this year
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:09:00.240]   Yeah, hard to know i i do think that apple is going to be
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:04.320]   Trying to bring more into this space, but
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:09.440]   you know, unless we've we're taking clip as an example of uh, uh,
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.760]   how far they're going it's
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:16.480]   It's just hard to predict right apple always wants to, um
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:20.400]   To excel when it comes out with a new technology and
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:23.040]   You know, we have to consider
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:29.040]   What are they going to have to do to bring ar to the masses because that's what's going to make it huge
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:34.080]   That's what's going to make it a blockbuster product when the masses can just use this stuff
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:39.520]   Right, that's what happened with, you know, iphone and and ipad as much as people like to talk about
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.480]   Uh sales of ipad it's still hugely popular
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:46.000]   So are they going to be able to take a technology?
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.280]   Like ar and bring it to the masses or are they going to bring it out slowly?
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:58.400]   Which kind of tips their hand, you know of where they're going right so you know, it's a it's a tough thing
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:03.680]   They're in it during a tough spot with this. There's a super interesting apple doesn't do chipsets
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:07.920]   They do feature sets like they never did nfc they did apple pay and they didn't do two cameras
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:11.360]   They did a camera system that has happens to have two lenses that gives you depth of field and
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:15.680]   Uh manual, sorry and analog zoom and this is the same thing
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:19.280]   I think to cook even said this out loud that ar to them is not a product
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:22.400]   It's a core technology the way that like led is to display
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:26.240]   And I wouldn't be surprised if apple decides on a certain key feature
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:31.600]   Like they want to have the ability for you to change focus points after you've taken a photo or they want you to have the ability to rotate
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.520]   An image after you've taken it or maybe live photo suddenly becomes way more dynamic
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:39.520]   And they'll pick whatever they think are the one or two marquee features that'll make a great product
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.640]   And we'll see ar start coming out that way and then they'll start building out
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.080]   I don't think we'll see ar goggles this year that sounds like a still a little ways out
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:52.320]   Especially to make an apple style product out of them that has decent battery life and this light enough and is casual enough that you could wear it without
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.160]   You know freaking people out
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:58.880]   But I think we'll absolutely see those features and whatever the iphone 8 camera has and iphone 9 beyond that
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:04.800]   What would you imagine this year though apple would do would it just be an ar app
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.720]   Would they change springboard to include ar in it?
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:11.360]   Oh god, it's like pluck on go, but with springboard
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:18.400]   It's real. We're trying to catch icons as there was a gene monster. Who was it that was talking about this christine is famous for
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:21.360]   promoting apple doing a television set
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.040]   For years they did they just they used to go to johnny. I was house to use it
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.280]   Yeah
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:33.520]   He told cn tv with johnny he told cnbc that apple's next iphone will lead to a big paradigm shift
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:38.080]   Uh an augmented reality will be the key
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:44.000]   Laying the foundation for the next computing paradigm. Wow
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.120]   um
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:51.760]   But what I don't know what could what could it be what would be how would this look?
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:54.400]   So, I mean look it's clear that apple's
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:59.840]   Going in big on this and i'm asking you to predict something that traditionally is a very difficult thing apple
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:05.200]   You know, we all knew apple is making a smart yeah, obviously in hindsight. We all knew apple was making a smartphone
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.840]   We had no idea what the iphone really was going to mean
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:10.480]   um
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.800]   What what do you think this is going to look like this year
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:22.800]   What what's difficult is is that we don't know how far along apple is right? That's the difficult part
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:27.840]   Uh, you know, they could be ready to release right now and they're they're going to put it in the next iphone
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:34.960]   Or they could be you know a year before they're even ready for that. But what would it be would it be uh, well?
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:41.360]   It's not going to be a clear phone. I don't even think that makes sense. I mean nobody wants the battery wouldn't be clear, right?
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:46.160]   So you can't believe the battery maybe a little bit on the top would be I don't know what would be clear
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:49.360]   So I I mean I think i'm safe on that bit
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:55.600]   Uh, but it might appear to be clear because if you hold it up and you've got your camera showing what you're looking at
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:01.120]   It might look like you're looking. Shall we did that right? Well, we've seen that that's what pokemon go does too
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:04.800]   I mean that's not oh, but when you have the bezel is like I think shalmy did that picture
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:07.680]   We have the bezel is phone with the with the throughput camera
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:11.440]   And if you just hold it up and it looks like there's no almost like a very thin outline of a phone
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:14.480]   Because the camera is placing what was on the screen and the screen goes edge-to-edge
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.840]   I know that scoble is going to say that's what I meant when that comes out in case
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.480]   I know he's gonna do that
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.880]   He said robert. I couldn't understand you over the shower
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:28.560]   Well, he's I mean of all of the analysts. He's the most
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:34.800]   Aggressive about how far apple's gonna take it this year like this is gonna blow your minds
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:41.840]   I mean they're they're big wealthy resource intensive company and they have a conservative and an ano
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.760]   was the other word the
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:44.880]   Anadacious
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:49.920]   prototypes and sometimes they can't now here's something here's something I'd like to see which is
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:56.320]   Holding your iPhone up to you know, just you know, just having it be it's in a sense seeing someone's face
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.800]   And then identifying them
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:04.160]   Because one of the problems that you know when you when you know lots of people or you see someone very infrequently
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.760]   You're like, yeah, I recognize who you are. I just can't for the life of me pick out your name
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:12.080]   But in reality that would tell you man. No, no, no, don't tell me your name. I want to AR you
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.880]   No, no, no, my name is don't say it. They are in you. Oh, I just think
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:18.960]   Are you Jonathan?
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:20.880]   So close
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:26.720]   Well, here's here's a concept from a guy named gabor bal bala you have you show your
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.320]   Daughter
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:33.440]   And then the phone says sandras calm and seems fine her heart rate is 72 beats per minute
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:39.600]   Her body temp is 98.8 her breathing is 24 breaths per minute. We've now synced with health. Is that doable?
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.120]   That's kind of creepy
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.240]   I think so
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:49.600]   Would you want it to I mean like like enter like put the phone down and talk to your daughter
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.800]   Yeah, I'd be turned I'd be turning those things off
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:59.360]   She she looked at me. I want you can you imagine what my heart rate would be if I walked by a heineken display
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.040]   Do you know if I go say so be telling you if you held the camera up to him like that
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.960]   Your son is incredibly pissed right now, Jim. He wants to listen to mega death
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:11.600]   You put the camera down but on the other hand holding the phone up and doing what you were saying Renee
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.920]   That's oh, that's Renee Richie used to work with him
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:19.920]   That kind of thing would be very useful especially as we get older especially if you have ear pods and you can do it
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:22.000]   So airpods. Yeah, civilly
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.040]   You do it from down low. I mean you're pointing the iPhone up from your waist. I'm like, who is that person?
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:30.080]   I'm just I'm not identifying
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:32.720]   And the airpods are saying a little to the left. I can't say
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:35.600]   Yeah
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:36.800]   Renee
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.320]   Yeah
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.320]   Analyzing
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.480]   Resolve
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:46.560]   Hundreds of engineers are working on whatever it is
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:49.280]   I mean, this is the kind of exciting
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.680]   I mean, we hear hundreds of engineers in augmented reality and how many we're kind of Mac Pro right?
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.360]   100 or on cars
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.720]   Yeah
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:59.280]   Could you just put five on a Mac Pro? I think that'd be enough
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:03.040]   I mean, they're they're they're they're really different engineers though. It's not like
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.840]   you're right
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:09.360]   It's not like oh, I wanted the car, but now they gave me the Mac Pro. Where do the wheels go?
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:12.720]   I could see glasses glasses makes sense
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:17.520]   I don't know what you do with the iPhone this year that makes it anything more than just glorified Pokemon go
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:22.240]   But then that lack of vision is you know, maybe just what makes means odd
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:25.520]   Never do it, but I'll have to see apple, you know selling this
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:30.800]   Yeah, I think people would revolt. I think people say that one over already looking at her phones too much
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:33.840]   We don't want that that here's that's exactly the point
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:39.600]   We don't know where they are with this or what it is that they plan to bring it to the masses
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:45.680]   Right could they do something with the cameras so that you could hold the phone in a much more sort of normal way
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:48.080]   You know, like sort of like can't can I get in the picture here?
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:50.480]   You know, so that you're you're you're looking at it
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:54.160]   You know kind of flat, but the camera is seeing straight ahead
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.440]   right
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:59.360]   Because that's the problem I mean you walk around in a city and people are sitting there looking at their iPhones
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:02.080]   They're not holding them straight up in front of their faces
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:06.080]   They're holding them flat and so you sort of need a camera for you can always tell one
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:11.520]   So I was playing Pokemon go because they are holding it in a way that they can see the sidewalk
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:13.520]   I apologize for that
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:19.360]   I
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.360]   I should also point out that
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:26.560]   One has to presume that apple isn't light years ahead of everybody else in this space
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:29.840]   Microsoft's been working on this for a while and the hollow lens
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:35.680]   Is very limited in terms of field of view because it's a standalone pair of glasses that has its own battery
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.080]   CPU operating system
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:44.240]   It don't you know, you know, it is it is a very limited developer edition and maybe Microsoft says
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.680]   It's two years before we're gonna have the first consumer
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:50.320]   version hollow lens 3.0
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:55.040]   We're gonna in fact because we want to get that out sooner. We're skipping the intermediate version
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:02.960]   So I can't imagine I may be apple is light years ahead of where Microsoft is and Microsoft is two years away from
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:07.200]   A wearable set of annual resinos hollow lens and it was funny because he had skype running
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:11.760]   And I didn't know it then I turned around I felt like Skype was you know that game when kids stand behind you and you try to turn and they turn with you
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.160]   So you can't oh I hate that that's what it felt like like where's right?
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:21.680]   Well, that's the other risk. I mean that if apple's working in a vacuum
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:30.160]   There's also the risk there make something that consumers are gonna say hmm. No, thanks. No, thank you 3d 3d 3d
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:32.880]   I would even submit that vr is not
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:36.400]   Killing it in the way that I would agree some people thought
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:41.600]   And that's why apple didn't go into it. They didn't see the market there. Okay. All right fair enough
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:46.800]   We were talking about it. They did the same thing with uh with nfc
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:52.000]   They were very clear that they were not going to do anything in nfc because they didn't see a market there and they were right
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.680]   I
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:59.040]   Might argue with you on that one. Well, no, they were they were right at the time years ago when people were
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:01.440]   Were putting nfc in devices
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:08.000]   But there was nothing for nfc to actually do it. Yeah that that dopey idea of tapping things too
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.600]   Yeah, so it was kind of like a checklist item. Well, we have nfc
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:17.040]   You can't do anything with it, but we have it so um, yeah, that that's kind of what I was
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:21.680]   I was looking at was a disadvantage though that apple maybe as a result is a little behind an nfc
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:25.200]   I mean you could do a lot more with the nfc in an android device than you can in an iphone
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:32.160]   No, I I don't I think apple went exactly the way that they wanted to go with with that stuff. So
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:39.440]   Yeah, I think it's a matter of use if you look at what apple pay can do. I mean that's something that that we use I know
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:46.960]   Well, I use I use the nfc on my android devices all the time to pair to my camera. It's a much easier process to tap the
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:53.680]   Phone to the camera copy photos over from my cannon my like and my sony all three have nfc on the side
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:57.360]   Can't do it with an iphone because apple won't let you get access to the nfc chip
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:02.080]   I mean there are you there are I think very useful as things you probably not use cases
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:07.200]   I think would sell it was cost everything for apple is like will it will people not buy large so that iphones if we don't include this
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:11.680]   Uh, you know apple's got the courage to do a lot of things including
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:15.040]   Now here's something they could do with augmented reality
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:20.640]   Which is a really really small easy thing to do is they can build automated qr code scanning into the camera app
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:24.720]   While it's already got it. It's just very specific to certain things
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.920]   But isn't isn't you know qr codes?
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:33.520]   You know every every boarding pass every you know, they're they're using a lot of places
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:37.360]   But a lot of it is that apple never build it in so you've got to get it out. That's a problem
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:39.360]   I would give current seal like back up in the market at him
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:47.040]   As I said, you know if you look every boarding pass in the world is a qr code now qr codes are out there
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:53.280]   They're just used in very specific fields and because they never were able to get the chicken and egg mass market problem
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:56.320]   As soon as you have a specific spot, that's where that's what they're replacing
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.800]   It's like ambient care meeting you're just walking down a
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:02.720]   Call like an aisle in a store and it's scanning around you as you're walking
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.760]   Well, is this count on tomato can super easy
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:11.440]   That'd be great. It could it could scan the shelves with i'm walking and tell me that the tomato soup that I like is on sale
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:17.840]   All right, well, we'll find out, you know, this is this is where apple
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.440]   You know it has in the past blown people's minds
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:27.200]   By by taking a product others were doing and putting apples unique
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:30.960]   User friendly spin on and making it a real deal
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:33.520]   It mainstream it it means
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:36.240]   They haven't done it in a while
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.240]   but uh
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:40.240]   This could be the one
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:45.120]   You can sense my my my skepticism, I guess
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:51.680]   I wish we were talking about color wear and how they do those paint jobs for your airpods. I want this one
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:53.680]   It's a little pricey
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:55.680]   I know 1899
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:58.960]   A little expensive it turns your eye
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.120]   Plus into a vintage mac and tosh
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:04.080]   It's a custom painted retro edition
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:09.520]   Designed to look like a mac from the 80s. Maybe that mac se you were talking about adam
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:12.800]   I think that mac it costs more than the mac se
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:15.280]   Yeah, i was gonna say what's the price on the se
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:19.200]   I think this includes the phone though. So that's the difference
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:27.040]   They're buying black models and giving them a custom paint job. So in effect, it's $930 for the paint job
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:30.800]   What I do when I do want to set to those purple
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:32.960]   Airpods
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:37.440]   Aren't they pretty? Yeah, they are. Yeah, those are expensive 100. What was it 100?
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:41.360]   You you have to send in your own airpods because they don't have any more
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:45.040]   So you send them in and you lose them for three to four weeks and then it's like a 160 bucks
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.040]   Six weeks to get them from apple and then yeah
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:49.120]   Oh fair
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:53.440]   So i'm just waiting for i'm just waiting for adam to buy us all pair
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:57.280]   And that tidbit's really
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:58.560]   Yeah, right
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:01.600]   $100 for an se so it's still cheaper than an se
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:04.880]   Okay, good for less than lse
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:09.280]   The iphones $5,000 for a mac too man remember the day
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:15.440]   Wow, jeez you'd get it three weeks. Oh, it got attempted. It's off
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:18.880]   Wait
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:21.120]   The red one was hard to justify but this one
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:23.200]   You get a
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:25.200]   It's a 256 gig storage
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:29.200]   The first 25 had a number of authenticity those are sold out
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:33.440]   It's the a 1661 which is their sim free unlocked phone
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:37.040]   You include the airbuds
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:41.200]   Uh, I wonder what the I wish they'd show the front
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:42.800]   Let's see if we could see what the front looks like
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:48.080]   For 15 90 15 bucks at leo you could get that elago apple watch stand that makes it look like
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:50.080]   I have that I already have that
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:52.880]   That's cheap and I love that i put my apple watch in that
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:55.760]   In fact, I don't even want to take my apple watch off the nightstand because I have a little
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.240]   Tiny teeny weenie macintosh
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:04.080]   It's so cute. I want to see the front but every time I click this arrow nothing happens again
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:06.080]   I think they know I'm on a windows machine
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:09.280]   That's too bad because this really um, I mean
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.480]   Boy, that's tempting
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:16.400]   Seems like a lot to pay though a thousand bucks. They must hand they must do this by hand
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:24.720]   Delicate little tiny fingers. I don't know how they do it, but I want it. I'm not that I want those airpods. Okay
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.440]   Oh, okay
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:29.600]   uh apple
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.880]   Let's see is opening a big chinese office with a
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:38.960]   A lot of engineers that's probably just to make the chinese government happy, right
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:45.920]   Two additional rnd centers in china. They plan to spend at least half a billion dollars on research
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:48.720]   Uh
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:50.320]   in china
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.320]   There's a lot of talent there too
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.480]   absolutely and uh, but but
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.080]   Uh
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:59.440]   Would you make a chinese specific phone maybe at this place or
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:02.960]   I told you to you
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:08.640]   Playgrounds got five additional languages including simplified chinese. Oh interesting
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:12.960]   Yeah, there's a lot of work being done just to make the chinese experience better for the chinese customer
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:18.960]   They want that market badly. Oh, yeah, well, it's huge. Yeah, they have to have it. Yeah, it's huge
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:23.840]   They're going to build uh research facilities in shanghai and shujo
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:27.120]   Uh as well as Beijing and chunjun
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:30.320]   And it's uh, they said they're going to spend
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:33.120]   $507 million on these
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:36.560]   That's a lot of money
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.640]   a lot of renminbi
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.200]   a lot of renminbi it's a 3.5 billion
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.600]   renminbi
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.600]   to be specific
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:49.840]   Do not charge your iphone in the bathtub
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.680]   Oh god, I felt so bad
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:57.520]   So he um
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:04.320]   What he had a extension cord he plugged his charger into an extension cord from the hallway
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:09.520]   And rested on his chest so he could use his iphone in the bathtub
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:13.040]   The charger touched the water and zapped him
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.560]   So don't
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.760]   Why would you don't
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.080]   Yes
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:24.080]   the mind boggles
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:31.360]   It wasn't the uh charger that did it. It was the extension cord extension cord. Yeah, the charge is only, you know, five volts
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.520]   So it wouldn't kill you you'd feel it, but he wouldn't
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:37.040]   But the but he plugged it into the mains
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:45.440]   And that's 230 volts. Yeah, that's a significant difference. All right. Yep. I almost didn't even want to say it's such a sad story
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:52.320]   How about a hack anything don't put the public surf to it. So don't use your hairdryer in the bathtub. Don't
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:54.880]   Don't yeah
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.880]   Put a fan on the edge or
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:02.960]   I remember a james bond movie ages ago where you know he's getting attacked at his hotel room
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:07.040]   The guy falls in the bathtub. He throws the fan in there and it kills him and he says shocking
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:10.320]   Shocking
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:13.280]   How about turning your apple watch into a game boy color
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:17.840]   There's a good use for an apple watch gabriel afraerti chan
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:24.560]   He uh, he has figured out how to he put in a game boy emulator
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:27.600]   known as javani
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:30.240]   on his uh apple watch
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:34.720]   And he even got controls on the screen
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:41.760]   Love the stuff that's crazy. Yeah, it's like having to do it's like it's like having doom on your touch bar. Yeah
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:46.320]   And by the way, uh, it's an open source project on github
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:52.560]   So I was pretty I mean i'm not a big, uh, you know game boy
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:58.160]   User but I was pretty impressed with with what he did you have to be impressed with that. Oh, yeah
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:00.960]   Look at that
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:07.600]   You know he can't do everything but it's uh, it's as a little bit sluggish and unresponsive. He says
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:11.840]   But it just proves that it is possible. Look he's playing pikachu
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.960]   playing pokemon
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:17.840]   Wow
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.840]   Uh, and he's got the best name ever
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:25.440]   Gabriel aflarti chan he's from toronto of course
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:33.440]   Uh, i'm just getting all the little bits out of the way so we can get to your picks of the week
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:37.760]   Anything else that we uh, we missed here
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.480]   There's actually a lot of uh, little
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:45.520]   apple music ambassador program offers twitter promoters three free months for pushing streaming service
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:52.480]   Drake's more life shatters streaming records with 89.9 million streams on the apple's music in 24 hours
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:55.920]   Was that a uh, was that an apple? Uh music exclusive
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:29:01.440]   No spotify headed as well. Huh? It just shows you 89.9 million streams
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:08.320]   Chance the rapper's new album is an apple music exclusive and chance has leaked out that apple paid him half a million dollars
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:11.840]   for two weeks of exclusively
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:15.600]   apple music, uh
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:20.720]   89.9 million streams for more life drakes latest project compared to spotify's
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:25.120]   61.3 million so music lovers at least drake lovers
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:27.920]   love
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:29.920]   apple music
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:34.240]   I've actually run into a something that apple music does significantly better than spotify recently
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:35.920]   Which is I had no idea
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:40.080]   App spotify doesn't talk about this, but they have a 10,000 track limit
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:45.600]   So you have more than 10,000 tracks you get a little message that says epic collection friend
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:48.160]   You delete some if you want to add more you're done
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:50.960]   Yes, right. I didn't know that
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:56.080]   Yeah, I was like really 10,000 limiting if you go to the there's a support thread about this
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:01.840]   Which I made the mistake of subscribing to and now I get like 10 messages a day of people who run into this and are mad
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:04.880]   So does that what is your example of a limit at all or?
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.280]   I think a hundred thousand hundred thousand
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:10.160]   I choose but match apple match used to be
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:11.760]   25,000
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:12.640]   25
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:16.720]   Right 10,000 just seems low though. I mean lots of people music collections
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:17.920]   than that
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:19.440]   Yeah, particularly
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:22.400]   Jim's uh, Jim's bootleg collection is bigger than that
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:27.920]   Uh
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:35.280]   iOS 11 is on its way and it will be 64 bit only which means that a lot of apps will no longer work
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.200]   Or my bank apple finally update from iOS 4
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:46.640]   Uh, according to a company called sensor tower about 8% of all the titles in the app store are not 64 bit
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:49.040]   And will not work with iOS 11
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:53.280]   That's that but 8% is a lot that's 187,000 apps
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:57.600]   I thought they would do that last year. I'm surprised they wait until this year and those aren't yeah maintain you
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:01.120]   You know, yeah, they're mostly fart apps and flashlight apps. It's not
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:06.080]   There's a lot a lot of games and little things that people aren't aren't updating for one reason or another
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:08.880]   I'm actually we've been hearing people about talk about this in our mailing list
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:14.160]   If it's talk where people are saying that they are probably not gonna upgrade to iOS 11 right away because just for that
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:17.680]   They're apps they still use and they're just mad. They don't want to they don't want to lose their app
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:22.080]   Just because and you know if they get the they get the warning now this app may slow down your iPhone
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:26.080]   Which is is that what that warning means because I do see that that means is a 32 bit app
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:29.760]   Yeah, and it's not true as far as anyone can tell. No, it doesn't slow it down
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:35.040]   Yeah, well the ironic thing is Zen Garden remember they use that as a demo for how fast the
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:40.960]   The iPad was that's one of the apps that says it'll yeah, you're this is too old just gonna slow you
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:42.960]   Those n Garden 2 I believe works
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:46.480]   But I don't see a slowdown right now
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:50.880]   Uh
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:54.640]   Apple will now sell you apple care
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:58.080]   on your iPhone even as much as a year
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:01.040]   After you buy it
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:03.120]   Apple care plus I should say
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:07.280]   That's good. Although presumably you can't buy it after you break break it
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:11.680]   So, you know, you still probably want to get it before you break your iPhone
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:15.520]   Yeah, and I don't believe they give it to you for like if you wait a year and then get it
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:18.800]   I don't believe you get to add that extra year of cover. No, okay, right?
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:20.160]   Right
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:24.000]   But that's not new they used to do that with apple care for max and stuff you had a year
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000]   Yeah, yeah, it's this is just new for the apple care post for our iPhone. Okay
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:33.200]   Okay, and then get what do you get with apple care plus two years of expert telephone
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:37.840]   One year plus an extra two years. Okay, and you can have two incidents of accidental damage
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.760]   Although read carefully because like the two years
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:43.680]   Yeah, yeah, the accidental damage you still have to pay and
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:46.800]   Yeah
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.800]   I probably should get that for my daughter though
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:55.840]   I'm just I don't think they'll fix her after she breaks. Oh, you can't get apple care on your kids. Hey, what's the deal?
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:59.760]   All right, let's take $130 complete teeth replacement

[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:38.720]   Our picks of the week let us start
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:43.760]   With you Renee, Ritchie. I kind of gave I kind of gave your pick away already
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:44.800]   No, it's fine
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:49.760]   So one of the things that I saw I've never apple introduced as a product people who have the previous product get kind of a little bit
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:53.840]   Really angry because they didn't get the new product back when they bought the original product
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:58.960]   So today especially on social media, I'm seeing some angry people saying I had to settle for a crappy jet black
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:04.480]   iPhone and I would have gotten a red iPhone if only apple had made it available originally I hate everything or
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:06.960]   Yeah, or how how am I going to afford a red eye?
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:12.160]   So the thing is this is again the battery version, but you can get a product red case that looks really spiffy
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:14.320]   And you could put it on any color iphone

[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:53.280]   That's a good one seal the deal is my favorite. All right. Let's go down to seal the deal here
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:57.600]   Oh, maybe you have to buy the album to get that one. Oh, there it is
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:00.640]   Rock and roll

[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:10.720]   I don't know what's going on. I don't know what's going on. I'm probably turning the sound off
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:12.720]   It's the audio card
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:16.800]   You go down to settings like three or four layers down. You'll see the old network icon
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:19.760]   Oh, there it is
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:23.920]   Oh, it's got a nice boogie

[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:44.480]   Uh, it's not uh, you know, like death metal or anything. It's just no, it's a nice boogie straight
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:54.320]   I love this
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:40:05.840]   That's good. Adam. You're not dancing

[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:18.880]   Uh
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:23.120]   Volbeat v o l b e a t and they are online
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:28.400]   Adam angst from tidbits.com your pick of the well follow that one. Yeah
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:31.680]   Boogie to what you got
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:36.160]   Yeah, I'm I'm almost embarrassed now because this is for no
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:40.880]   So, um, this is a little bit self promotional, but joe kissle
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:46.240]   His most recent book take control of your digital legacy. Um, this is something that
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:51.520]   It really is for adults. It's for people who actually are thinking about the future because
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:57.120]   People know about wills and all that but what about all your digital photos? What about your facebook page?
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:00.960]   I mean, I don't know if you talked about tom nogrino dying. Um, recently
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:04.880]   We didn't mention that in effect. We probably should mention that. Yeah, we could talk more about that
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:09.280]   But yeah, but any event but we all grow up in the digital world now. Um, you know, we have
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:12.240]   a huge amounts of our lives online
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:13.840]   And
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:19.360]   What this book does is it helps you figure out how to deal with all that because it's not just as simple as saying
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:22.880]   Oh, I want my photos to go to my kids. Well, do they know how to get into your mac?
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:28.240]   Do they have to log into your iCloud account to be able to deal with stuff? Do they how are they going to get
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:32.480]   Access to your email to turn off uh subscriptions to things
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:35.760]   So there's all sorts of these things you have to think about and
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:39.120]   Either you're doing it for yourself because you're thinking ahead or
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:42.640]   A lot of us frankly are need to talk to our parents
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:44.560]   who also still have
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:47.920]   iPhones and iCloud accounts and email and facebook pages and
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:56.160]   Twitter accounts and photos and videos and just all that stuff that used to be kind of easy to hand down to your kids
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:42:01.840]   And now it's not nearly as straightforward. You can't just say here's the box of grandma's stuff
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:08.400]   Now you have to say here's 17 accounts and if you want to keep the custom domain name for the family
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:12.480]   You're gonna have to pay up, you know, to so-and-so in a year and all these different things
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:15.920]   So that's what joe goes through in take control of your digital legacy
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:18.160]   And it's well worth reading as that I
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:25.040]   It's not nearly as fun as a red case or a hard rock band, but but it will make your life easier
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:27.840]   Yeah, you know, I got a call
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:30.480]   on the radio show on sunday
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:32.800]   Oh, it broke my heart
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:34.880]   father who'd lost his son
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:39.600]   And uh, he had access to some of his stuff, but he had his son's phone
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:42.320]   And he wanted to get into his iPhone
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:47.600]   Uh, because he thought there might be pictures there and others other memorabilia. He was he was wondering how he could
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:50.240]   get into the phone
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:55.040]   This is absolutely the thing you have to do and this is one of the reasons why it's not just oh, you know
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:43:00.640]   I'm thinking about my my will in my estate whatnot. This is the you could be in a car accident tomorrow
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:08.000]   Would you are spouse or your family members or whatnot be able to get into your iPhone be able to get into your online accounts
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.880]   And that could be I mean, let's say you're a business owner
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:17.680]   Um, that could be the end of your business if people can't access the bank accounts and all of that kind of stuff
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:24.880]   So you really got a plan for we call it the hit by a bus problem, but uh, you know, it can happen anyone doesn't take that much
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:27.440]   So really think ahead a little folks
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:34.560]   I agree. I use last pass last pass has a really nice emergency access feature that lets you share your passwords
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:37.680]   Posthumously with uh
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:44.640]   family members or an executor of your estate or an attorney and it's a something to look into but I think you just get this whole tech control thing
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:47.120]   Because it's more than just doing that. I think that's really absolutely
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:49.440]   And you know, we're saying thing one password has a family
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:54.400]   Membership, but that's you know again for sharing those because you need to be able to get into this stuff
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:56.400]   But there's a lot of stuff to think about. I mean
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:58.960]   Those photos for instance, how are they going to?
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:05.440]   Stick around, you know, what kind of media you put them on how are how are the people who are who the person is going to be your digital executor
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:09.520]   How are they going to get that and how are they going to preserve those photos going into the future because
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:14.400]   It's not as simple as just having the box of photos or the albums anymore
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:18.160]   You want to pass that stuff down? You got to think about how it's going to live into the future
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:22.880]   Uh, it was Annie, uh, naka who first mentioned uh, tom nagrino's passing
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:25.760]   Um, do you anybody want to say I did not know him do not work with him?
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:30.960]   But uh, I think a lot of us have seen his books his articles in mac world and
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:32.800]   I knew tom
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:35.600]   moderately well, I won't say you know, he wasn't a super close friend
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:41.760]   But we certainly you know interacted for years and years and years in the industry side each other all the mac world expose
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:49.360]   And tom was a great guy a fabulous mac writer. Um, he he was a pro for 30 years
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:53.040]   I mean he did he wrote 50 plus books
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:59.680]   I had thousands and thousands of articles I think and he was he was smart. He was capable
[01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:05.600]   Uh, uh, you know, he always he always really knew how to hone in and find the right piece of thing
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:07.840]   You know the thing you needed to point out an article
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:09.760]   Um, which was great
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:12.960]   And what a lot of people didn't know is tom was born with spina bifida
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:18.400]   And so he always you know walked with a cane was you know kind of hunched over and whatnot and
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:23.120]   My understanding from reading what he had written light on he never talked about this in person
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:32.560]   Um, but uh, my understanding from what he wrote about later is that he was in constant pain because of that and actually even surviving spina bifida as an infant is unusual
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:39.680]   And just thing after thing after thing. I mean he had a heart attack. He he got cancer in 2010
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:43.280]   It came back in 2014 one of the medications gave him a stroke
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:47.680]   uh, it was just heart-rending but uh, he he was uh
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:51.440]   he he he dealt with it
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:54.160]   um
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:56.960]   As well as kind of as I think uh, you
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:02.320]   Would want to be able to and in the end as you can read from a lot of the online stuff
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:11.920]   He took advantage of california's end of life, uh option act and actually ended his own life. Um, at the you know before uh, uh, uh
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:14.800]   The cancer did it for him. However slowly and horribly
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:20.960]   That yeah, and that's I'm right. I'm really glad we have, uh, that uh, that rule
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:23.360]   I think that's really important to have that control
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:28.800]   Of how you get he is uh, go he has memorialized on his facebook page now
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:33.840]   Um, so if you want to leave, uh, some thoughts or uh, anything
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:39.040]   Uh, you can do that at facebook.com/nogrino any g r i n o
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:45.360]   Uh, I hate to end on sad note, but sorry. I'm really glad no, you know,
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:50.000]   I almost forgotten and he had tweeted about it and I almost forgot to mention it, uh, and he by the way
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:55.200]   He's not dead. He's just under the weather. He'll be back next week. He's merely finding for the fjords
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:59.440]   He's pining for the fjords. I bet he is right about now. He had to skip
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:02.160]   Coco connie was gonna be in Yosemite this week
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:05.360]   Uh, we didn't expect to have him because we thought he'd be in Yosemite
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:09.600]   So that's gotta just that's gotta hurt. He heard georgia dal is gonna be there and he just bale
