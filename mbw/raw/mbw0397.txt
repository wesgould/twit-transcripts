[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.520]   I'm here with Andy Inako Renee Ritchie.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.340]   We'll talk about the upcoming World Wide Developers Conference
[00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.640]   and what we know about iOS 8 and OS 10 10.10.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.680]   Coming out at WWDC perhaps.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.960]   We'll also talk about new iPhone designs,
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.280]   those surprising memos coming out of the Apple Samsung trials
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.080]   and a long awaited iPad app is finally released.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.080]   And no, it's not Microsoft Office.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.480]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.480]   Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.600]   It's time for our Mac Break Weekly to show that covers
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.440]   your Apple news, everything going on in Cuportino,
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.880]   with two of the best experts on the subject, Renee Ritchie,
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.800]   from imore.com, and his secret lair in beautiful Quebec.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.920]   I was at the airport this morning, Leo, getting my Nexus
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.120]   interview, and they took four shots of my Retinas.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.160]   So I'm hoping they just recorded the pictures
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.680]   and didn't inject stuff.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.160]   Nexus, we should explain, is Canada's name not for a phone,
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.520]   but for the ability to quickly come and go across the border.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.800]   It's harmonized with global entries.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.240]   Global entries, what we call it here.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.560]   Do you get, then, to avoid things like taking off your shoes
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.560]   and the security line?
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.200]   I think so.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.520]   They gave me that they were very careful.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.680]   I said, most people misunderstand what Nexus is.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.760]   We have to explain it to you.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.080]   You can't bring friends.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.560]   You can't bring fruit.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.520]   If you update anything, you have to tell us,
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.160]   or we'll lock you away in a little room.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.840]   Now bring fruit.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.280]   No, there's a long list of things you cannot do
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.840]   when you lose it forever.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.720]   But I'm glad to hear that you are considered
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.520]   by the Canadian government to be non-hostile.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.440]   Nexus worthy.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.000]   Andy and Akka is also here.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   He is Nexus worthy as well from the Chicago Sun times.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.120]   But hey, are you guys coming out for a WWDC?
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.760]   I don't know yet.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.640]   It depends on what they're doing for the keynote.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.680]   I certainly didn't even bother entering the lottery
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.000]   this year, because, like we said before,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.240]   there's not much point to me being there,
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.640]   learning things that I can't talk about,
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.440]   and also preventing me from talking about things
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.600]   I might learn elsewhere after that.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.440]   And also, it's gotten--
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.360]   I kind of dropped that as even an option a few years ago,
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.480]   because now every single slot at WWDC,
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.920]   if it's taken up by somebody who does not have a plan
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.080]   to write an app or create a product,
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.960]   I personally feel a bit guilty about that.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.000]   It's perfectly OK for anybody to do that.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.880]   I just like, OK, I don't--
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.480]   I'll be going there just to have the environment,
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.640]   and I wouldn't be making-- I wouldn't be losing any money
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.640]   if I didn't go.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.520]   So, WWDC kicks off June 2nd.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.200]   There will be the usual keynote at Moscone West
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.560]   in San Francisco.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.040]   Everything happens at Moscone West.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.880]   It's like-- it's almost as if, like, if I do--
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.040]   if I go to a keynote there, I almost
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.600]   want to hide a go bag and suspend its ceiling
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.040]   above the bathroom, because that way, I'll just fly to San
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.520]   Francisco with no baggage, go to whatever keynote for Google
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.240]   or Microsoft, just grab this bag that has my laptop, my iPad,
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.160]   a tie and a jacket, and my chain to shoes, and I'm done.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.880]   I'm here.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.960]   I'm back.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.440]   Yeah, in fact, if you-- I think I
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.920]   got to put a plaque up there.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.080]   If you think what was announced there--
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.560]   Because we had GDC one week, Macworld the next week,
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.360]   although that ended up being at North, not West,
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.120]   and then build the next week.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.960]   And we could have just swapped bags for the weeks.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.880]   Google's announcements are there.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.200]   Apple's going back.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.480]   I mean, many as Steve Jobs, keynote at Moscone West,
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.320]   I think the 2007 iPhone announcement was there.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.720]   Yep.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.080]   It's a big haul.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.640]   Anyway, Apple set up a lottery, as you mentioned.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.960]   This is what everybody's doing now.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.920]   Google did the same thing.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.080]   For years, they were both kind of saying, yeah,
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.800]   we sold it out in two minutes.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.160]   We sold it out in a minute and a half.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.200]   We sold it out in 30 seconds.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.600]   We sold it out in one second.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.720]   So finally, they set up in both--
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.240]   I don't feel there was a call.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.080]   Can we end this now?
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.120]   And just have a lottery.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.080]   OK.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.200]   Because who needs the bragging rights?
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.560]   And then Monday, they sent out invitations
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.360]   to randomly selected developers.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.880]   So if you won the lottery, you will have received an email.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.680]   But you have to, April 14, to execute.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.280]   And then your ticket goes to the next person in line.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.360]   And I know a lot of people who had just everybody
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.720]   on their team enter because they were never sure who was going--
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.160]   they wanted as many possibilities as possible.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.440]   And they got two or three and they're
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.440]   going to release one or two of them back to the pool
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.160]   because they only really need to get one or two people in there.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.320]   So to do this is to do as a favor, it's some one person.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.760]   Like any said.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.800]   And what's even better this year is they announced in the press
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.120]   release, they're going to be streaming state of the union
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.280]   and the Apple Design Awards live.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.600]   And they're also getting almost every session up
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.480]   on the same day.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.200]   So unless you need the labs, if you
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.680]   have to go there and talk to somebody about a framework
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.880]   or get a design review, almost everybody
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.600]   can be well served without a ticket this year,
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.640]   which is fantastic.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.720]   And because it's a live stream, we will be covering it.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.800]   Well, even if it weren't, we'd be covering it on the end.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.040]   It's really becoming a little bit like Ted now,
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.200]   where there are people who spend a lot of money
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.880]   and go to a lot of trouble to go there.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.200]   But the purpose of that show isn't to serve the people
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.800]   at that show.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.600]   It's to create the library of content
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.840]   that many more people are going to be able to take advantage
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.800]   of after the show is over.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.920]   It's exciting.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.240]   I look forward to it.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.480]   Now, there are usually-- and they have been the past
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.640]   September and October product announcements.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.120]   But this is the one scheduled one ahead of time.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.080]   This is-- they're talking to developers.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.280]   It seems to me this is a fairly important one.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.400]   The first one of this year, will there be announcements?
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.840]   Will there be product announcements?
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.840]   Two years ago, we got the first Retina MacBook Pro,
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.920]   15-inch at WWDC.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.720]   Last year, we got the new Haswell MacBook Airs.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.040]   And we got a preview of the new Mac Pro.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.000]   So this year, if there is a Retina MacBook Air,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.400]   or just new MacBook Airs, or 4K displays to go with that--
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.840]   as long as they're fairly new products,
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.520]   evolutionarily new products, I think there's
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.000]   a good chance we'll see them.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.120]   I wonder, though.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.160]   Remember that-- I know we just got iOS 7,
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.960]   but iOS 8 is a presumably in development.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.440]   We've seen a leaked health book, which would presumably
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.800]   go with a wearable that Apple is maybe coming up with sometime
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.360]   this year or early next.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.440]   Wouldn't this be the WWDC where you go to developers?
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.280]   And maybe you do it in private and say, develop for this?
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.440]   Yes, but you can do that without necessarily saying,
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.400]   here is how to support the new health ban that we're
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.040]   going to be shipping in September.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.440]   You can do that by simply saying, we've
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.960]   created a new set of APIs for real world integration solutions.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.720]   So if you want to monitor a certain field of real world
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.200]   sensor input, here's how you open that channel,
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.000]   here's how you communicate with that device,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.120]   here's how that data will be delivered to you.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:16.040]   I'm sure that as soon as people start leaking about--
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.480]   there's always the schedule of events that is posted,
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.000]   and a lot of those boxes are left blank saying,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.960]   we are not going to give you the name of this
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.960]   until we actually start this thing up.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.240]   And that's usually when you start
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.040]   to decode the fortune cookie about saying, well,
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.080]   if they are really doing a sensor suite of--
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.680]   their only thing they could possibly be doing that for
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.960]   is if they are actually going to be doing a fitness band
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.000]   or something like that.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.680]   So I'm not sure if it'll be explicitly showing their cards
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.720]   so much as showing the technology is going to power
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.320]   whatever it is that they really--
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.480]   And they're going to say, read between the lines.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.240]   But you guys are smart.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.120]   I don't think they need developers specifically
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.960]   for an eye watch or an eye band, because the way
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.000]   that health book is set up, you'll probably
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.560]   have health kit underneath it, which
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.760]   will tie into a ton of different peripherals.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.320]   Apple's not going to be able to do everything,
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.040]   especially not in the first generation.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.960]   So they can announce health book--
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.080]   we'll almost certainly get iOS 10, 10.10, at least
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.320]   the betas at WWDC.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.080]   And that will probably have all the stuff
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.560]   to integrate into a wide range of health stuff,
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.640]   because first generation product won't do everything.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.240]   They'll need to have the Nike fuel band,
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.120]   or the blood pressure reader, or the sleep monitor,
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.600]   or whatever else they want to be able to house in that system
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.400]   all work with it.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.680]   So they could announce the API and everything
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.280]   without ever mentioning the watch or the band,
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.760]   unless they're actually ready to sell it.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.920]   And that's usually what they'll--
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.480]   at the point in which they'll announce it.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.920]   Right.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.440]   So--
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.040]   The reason I ask all this, I'm wondering
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.120]   if we're going to get any tea leaves to read on June 2nd.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.120]   Absolutely.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.200]   OK.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.000]   But realize that there are tea leaves
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.280]   at the bottom of every cup of tea,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.640]   and you're welcome to see whatever you want to see them.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.640]   So yes, we can look forward to that.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.400]   And to your earlier point, Apple absolutely
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.720]   does go to developers behind the scenes and say,
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.600]   we're working on this, sign all these NDAs.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.760]   It's going to come to your house.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.600]   Those people were not--
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.120]   Just on a table.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.360]   Yeah, they're not going to leak those people.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.840]   Yeah, and they've done that for both products.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.840]   They've announced, like the iPad and for SDKs
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.760]   they haven't yet announced.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.800]   So it's also no indication of whether it'll come or how soon
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.560]   it'll come.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.760]   But if there are back deals, having everyone at Moscone Center
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.080]   is a great time to talk about it.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.000]   Remember that they're really, really good at getting people
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.800]   to maintain a secret.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.720]   All those product launches in which, oddly enough,
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.320]   someone seemed to have had this product two weeks ago,
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.080]   and enough time to put together a really good game demo.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.600]   So yeah, if they want to have some cool stuff, third party
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.080]   at launch, that those people are going to be getting
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.120]   a lot of hand holding and that overture might start.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.320]   The first time they actually get to look at this thing
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.960]   encased in two feet of leucide and with all kinds of random
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.960]   patterns printed into it so that a cell phone picture of it
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.400]   can be traced back to that one meeting at that one suite.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.000]   That's where it's going to happen.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.320]   I want--
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.440]   Mike, you all can listen up because I want--
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.280]   here's what I want.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.640]   I want a story.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.360]   I think all of these big companies--
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.880]   Apple, certainly Apple and Google have security, big time.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.640]   We know Apple's security could be scary because of the Gizmodo
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.760]   iPhone incident.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.920]   And we know Google.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.920]   I just kind of got an insight into that
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.120]   because we talked to Kevin Rose on Sunday
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.120]   about the people protesting outside his house saying
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.760]   he's a parasite and all that.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.440]   And he said, no, Google security's on it.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.440]   I said, well, what did you do?
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.160]   Did you call the cops?
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.920]   He said, no, we got Google security.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.080]   And I'm just kind of chilled me a little bit.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.000]   Like Robocop.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.400]   Yeah, I'm thinking both Google and Apple.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.880]   I would love to see a story behind the scenes,
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.840]   revealing the secrets of the--
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.720]   they must have their own police departments in effect, right?
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.480]   Like heavy duty stuff.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.120]   You don't want to run a foul of Apple security.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.640]   I just want to make Avronica Mars reference here.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.160]   I'm just talking to myself from doing it.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.520]   Good, thank you.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.120]   I want to go with-- and he's the night,
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.960]   so I'm your worst nightmare.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.960]   I'm heard with a badge.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.680]   A nude with a badge.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.280]   To your SDK though, point of view,
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.400]   if they are working on new Apple TV hardware,
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.880]   and if that Apple TV hardware happens
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.320]   to have a game store or app store,
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.200]   WWDC would also be an interesting place
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.320]   to start talking to developers about developing
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.480]   for the 10-foot interface on the big screen.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.480]   Mark Gurman did a nice roundup of everything we know so far
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.440]   about iOS 8 and OS 10, 10, 10.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.240]   Well, I like that 10, 10, 10.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:29.240]   Codename for iOS 8 is Okamo, or is it Okimo?
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.280]   Okimo, I think.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.120]   Okimo.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.120]   Like the song.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.240]   It's a song?
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:38.320]   No, but Apple likes ski resorts for all of their iOS betas.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.280]   They're always named after ski resorts.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.600]   So, Isochi was 7.1.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.800]   You're kidding, really.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.920]   So that's to give the developers the illusion
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.680]   that they're actually able to get away and have fun.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.640]   Well, it's the way they can talk about it in internal emails
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.960]   about having to name specific products.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.320]   So, the only thing we have, I guess, is that image,
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.080]   those images from HealthBook.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.680]   And we've seen a lot of that.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.040]   We've talked about that before, the Activity Monitor,
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.760]   the Emergency Card, and so forth.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:15.520]   We've heard that there will be updates in Maps.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.960]   Mark says, same UI as iOS 7, but better data,
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.280]   better clarity, important new features.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.080]   And in fact, Apple has been on an acquisition spree
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:30.040]   buying not one, but they bought two commute databases.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.640]   Was it hot?
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.600]   What was one of the top?
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.000]   Hot, hot, hot, hot.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.960]   Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.480]   But they also just hired the guy from Amazon very recently.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.680]   Yeah, isn't that interesting?
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:47.880]   Yeah, the guy who did A9 in Amazon, which was Amazon's attempt
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.560]   to create a web search engine that was sitting on top of Amazon.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.440]   It's very interesting.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.200]   His name is Benoit.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.120]   Benoit DuPae.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:00.840]   Or something like that.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.360]   DuPae.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:01.880]   DuPae.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.800]   DuPae.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.160]   DuPae.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.080]   DuPae.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.800]   And yeah, so they're clearly gearing up for this.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.640]   So they have transit.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.520]   They've bought two transit specialists.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.880]   They'll add that.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.800]   Apparently iTunes Radio will be broken out.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.920]   This needs to happen.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.960]   We've mentioned this before.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.160]   It's really good.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.160]   But I was shocked to see it because I never
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.240]   launched the iTunes app on my iPad.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.760]   And the iTunes Radio, it doesn't get-- I think
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.800]   the traction it deserves.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.680]   So as they did with podcasts, they're
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.600]   going to separate that out of the standalone application.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.160]   It's their version of Pandora or whatever.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.040]   Another significant addition, according to 9 to 5 Mac,
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.560]   being considered for iOS 8, is voice over LTE.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.960]   Now, this is carrier--
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.480]   obviously, carrier specific.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:58.600]   All the carriers are moving away from CDMA, GSM, to LTE.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.720]   But not just for data.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:04.480]   The plan is eventually for all traffic to go over LTE, voice
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.400]   and data.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.840]   VOLTE will be transmitted over the same kind of network
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.160]   that the LTE data is transmitted.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.400]   Improved call, call, call.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.560]   Yeah, I presume it's kind of like VoIP, right?
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.400]   It's exactly VoIP.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.160]   It goes over IP packets.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.000]   And it opens up all that bandwidth.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.640]   It's currently being consumed by voice,
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.360]   which is an old technology to pure data.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.440]   So T-Mobile supports Volt.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.840]   That's, I guess, that's what we call it.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.240]   Volt E?
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.160]   Volt E?
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:30.920]   Yeah, Volt E.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:31.960]   I like Volt.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.360]   All right, Volt E.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.280]   Volt E sounds like an evil villain.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.240]   It might well be.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.320]   Verizon and AT&T are testing it for real out later this year.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.520]   Interestingly, that's probably when an iPhone 6 would come out.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.480]   Is iOS 8 going to wait till iPhone 6?
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:49.920]   Yes.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.680]   OK.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.960]   So it's 4 iPhone 6?
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.240]   Yeah, I mean, it'll be backwards compatible with probably
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.200]   down to the iPhone 5.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.280]   It's not the 4S, but it'll come out almost always.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.800]   It comes out a couple days before the new phone launches.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.400]   And you only get this in the Apple world.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.840]   Here's a bulletin.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.920]   Apple is said to be considering adding the ability
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:13.800]   for messages threads in iOS 8 to automatically be deleted.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.800]   It's a big problem, though.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.840]   I mean, it's funny, but there's this huge problem
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.120]   because people will buy a 16 gigabyte or a 32 gigabyte iPhone.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.680]   And they'll do a ton of picture and video messaging.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.960]   And because there's no easy way to delete those,
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.040]   they just accumulate inside the Messages app.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.000]   And because the Message app is backed up to iCloud,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.400]   they accumulate in iCloud.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.520]   And then if you save them out, you now have a copy in the camera
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.360]   role as well and a copy in iCloud.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.960]   And it just eats away tons of storage.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.000]   So we have people with three gigs of stuff in iMessage.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.560]   All you have to do is look at your usage in your iOS.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.480]   And other is that.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.600]   It's the cached messages among other things.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.800]   But I think that's the biggest culprit for a ballooning other.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.720]   Also, it's just a good idea to make that into an explicit part
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.400]   of the user interface, given the privacy of the personal nature
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.240]   of these messages.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.080]   That's a really good user forward feature.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.480]   The other reason I say is kind of typical that people make--
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.560]   this is built into every other phone operating system I've
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.640]   ever used after six months, after three months,
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.080]   whatever it deletes them.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.880]   The auto deletion is optional.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.280]   So you don't have to worry about disappearing threads.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.200]   It does underscore that Apple is really
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.920]   like one development team without the ability
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.280]   to focus on everything at once.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.280]   It's like they can only put the spotlight on one thing.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.080]   And so there are a lot of these little features
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.960]   that just keep getting postponed and postponed and postponed,
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.120]   not because they don't think it's important or they don't care,
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.160]   but because their focus is now on getting 7.0 off the door.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.920]   Now it's on 7.1 off the door.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.440]   Now it's on making sure that iCloud works with iWork.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.200]   And that really distracts them from these little fine point
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.360]   features that a lot of us really, really have been wanting
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.960]   for years.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.440]   According to Mark, again, a notification center
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.480]   may be simplified, apparently.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.560]   His sources say Apple's considering
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.800]   reducing the notification panel to include today
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.920]   and notifications only.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.720]   No more missed notifications.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.320]   No more all notifications.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.680]   Just today and notifications.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.280]   Notifications, the new one would combine all notifications
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.040]   with missed notifications.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.960]   It's simpler and less redundant because the current system
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.480]   is a little bit complex and a little bit redundant.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:22.680]   And he says, because they acquired Q, the app Q last year,
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.120]   he thinks that some of those features from Q
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.040]   will be incorporated into the-- what is Q
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.840]   in the notification center?
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.000]   I don't remember Q.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.960]   Don't remember either.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.400]   I looked at it when it happened, but I don't remember it all.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.800]   Apple is developing versions of preview and text edit.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.400]   Everybody on the Mac attached familiar with those,
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.480]   optimized for the iPhone iPad and the iPad.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.800]   This is where I start to get really frustrated.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.640]   So the problem they have right now is iCloud is in app jail.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.280]   So if you make a document in preview
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.040]   or you make a document in text edit,
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.920]   you can't edit them in iOS because there's no equivalent.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.200]   So it seems what they're going to do is put those apps there.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.600]   So you can open something in preview
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.960]   that you saved on the Mac.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.760]   But then to edit it, you'll have to go to iBooks.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.520]   Or to edit the one in text edit, you'll have to go to pages.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.360]   A far better-- it reminds me of those things
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.080]   where you don't want a setting screen
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.920]   and you end up making an app eight times more complicated
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.920]   just to avoid having a setting screen.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.000]   Because in an ideal world for me,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.320]   we would have files.app, like we have a Photos.app
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.840]   and a Documents Picker, the way we have Image Picker,
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.440]   and then any app that can open a text file
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.760]   could just open that picker.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.560]   And we could choose a text file from any app.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.960]   But right now, if I write something in AI writer,
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.960]   then I find out that some other text editor is better
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.040]   and deleted, I can never get those files back.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.320]   I have to go and remember what app I wrote them in,
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.960]   download it again, copy and paste them laboriously
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:40.800]   over to the new app.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.080]   And it's just not tenable.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.040]   Yeah, I agree completely.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.280]   Apple continues to--
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.800]   iOS continues to bump its head on file interoperability,
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.680]   where it's fine so long as people continue
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:58.320]   to use iPads and iPhones within the limitations of,
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.800]   for lack of a better word, big phone type apps.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.080]   But as they keep making better and better iPads,
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.120]   and developers keep making stronger and stronger apps
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.160]   for them, people really are going to be trying to use them
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:13.640]   as notebooks, and deciding why do I buy a $500 tablet plus $1,000
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.920]   notebook when this tablet is so much better at everything,
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.120]   and it does everything for me.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.120]   And so this is where you just find the limitations.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.520]   Things that are so easy to do on a device that
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.720]   has an open file system, or at least a more liberal idea
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.280]   of what to do with the user data that's on the device.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:34.080]   It's-- I think that this is sort of a storm cloud that's forming
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.280]   that is going to require a more aggressive solution than just
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.880]   saying, we will take the two cheapest, most free,
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.280]   and least useful image editor and text editor
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.840]   that we've ever produced for any computer ever
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.440]   and make a version of it that doesn't really make much sense
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.520]   for a phone, but which now we've sort of boxed ourselves
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.520]   in a corner where we have to make them.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.080]   Brian Elliott in our chat room says,
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.800]   we need a finder for the iPhones.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.120]   See, I couldn't disagree more.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.080]   I don't think you want to turn an app, the iPad,
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.400]   or the phone into a desktop computer.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.920]   This is why it's a challenge, because app interoperability,
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.200]   you have to do it without suddenly giving the user access
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.400]   to a file system.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.320]   So you don't want to do it kind of universally.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.920]   You don't want to have documents on the desktop.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.640]   You got to do it judiciously.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.320]   That's why I mentioned the image picker,
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.920]   because they solved this problem already.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.480]   They just restricted it to media files.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.520]   And if they let you put TXT files, CSV files, and whatever,
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.040]   and then they'll know what the app can read.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.640]   The app can declare what kind of files it works with.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.720]   And then that picker service can just provide those files.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.520]   And that way you maintain security, you maintain the sandbox,
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.040]   but your files can move around as they will in the system.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.760]   And I think that you don't have the file system,
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.520]   but you still have the elegance.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.800]   Yeah, also Apple's done a pretty good job
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.240]   of making a very simple but elegant system of just simply
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:54.160]   sharing a file out when it's been exposed by an app that
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.680]   rationally has a reason to be able to deal with files,
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.120]   like mail attachments, like documents inside of a documents
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.440]   drawer for a word processor app.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.040]   The ability to simply say, take this file
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.000]   and do something useful with it.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.560]   That's a useful structure.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.800]   I don't think that it would be a big step backward
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.000]   if Apple did something that was similar to the Finder.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.040]   However, if they were to create something that
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.200]   was like a system level file picker,
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.920]   that might solve a lot of problems.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.560]   Meaning we have something that has the authority
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.960]   of only that only an app created by Apple would have
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:29.280]   to simply look into the stores of every single app that's
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.120]   on there, give you an overview of here's the data
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.200]   that you have on your device on a discrete file by file level.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.160]   And then the ability to simply select a file
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.560]   and do something useful with it.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:43.480]   Even if it was just as useful as I'm going to drag this word
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.680]   processing file out of the word folder-- excuse me--
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.560]   out of word space and drag it into pages of space.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.680]   And then trust these two apps know how to negotiate
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.880]   and how to do that securely and successfully.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:00.080]   We get some of that now with a third party file management
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.160]   apps where you can just put things into its own file--
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.120]   the file store of this app specifically.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.360]   And then that Apple then handles the rerouting for you.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.920]   But this is, again, a problem that's
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.840]   going to have to be solved.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.240]   And something like a file manager
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.360]   might actually be a good job of doing that.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.240]   It's actually interesting because in some ways
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.200]   they're going in this direction with Game Center.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.120]   There are rumors.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.960]   Now they're conflicting rumors because recently
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.620]   the screenshots, according to German,
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:24.960]   showed the Game Center icon.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.760]   But there have been rumors up to now
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.760]   that Game Center was going to go away
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.960]   and that the functionality would just be inside the game.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.960]   And that's kind of like the same thing, which is you
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.240]   know how to talk to Game Center.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.960]   We don't need a separate standalone Game Center app.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.840]   It's kind of the same idea.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.440]   We don't need a text edit app.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.720]   Just anything they can edit text
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.720]   should be able to see the iCloud and see text files.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.480]   Also one of the things I consistently
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.120]   love about Apple's thinking is that the obvious thing
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.360]   would be to have a file manager app that handles it.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.760]   But the more sophisticated thing to do
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.880]   is to figure out what are users missing?
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.200]   What are they really asking?
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.520]   They're not asking for an app.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.560]   They're asking for us to solve a problem for them.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.120]   And can we solve that problem in a way
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.240]   that they haven't thought of?
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.400]   That's a lot simpler and a lot more direct.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.640]   Let's see what else.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.640]   Voice memos.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.080]   I don't know.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.280]   People use voice memos, I guess.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:14.760]   I guess they do.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.640]   This guy's got a bad UI.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.360]   They're going to fix it.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:16.960]   OK.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.600]   Bad UI.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.760]   We're going to fix it.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:19.920]   Performance.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.680]   Now, we're seeing more and more how powerful
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:27.560]   that a7 chip is in all the new mobile devices from Apple.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.920]   It would be really nice to take advantage of all of that.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:36.120]   And while we know apps don't, Apple certainly should.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.080]   Improvements in CarPlay.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:43.040]   So I presume this fall, there will be cars that do it.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.720]   Well, the thing is, CarPlay is an extension of AirPlay,
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.520]   but right now it's bound to the lightning adapter
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.680]   for a variety of reasons.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.040]   And the next generation one would
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.920]   could go back to being Wi-Fi capable,
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.920]   as long as soon as cars are getting Wi-Fi hotspots
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.960]   in them more frequently.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.640]   Yeah, my car has a Wi-Fi hotspot.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.600]   A lot of fords do.
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.080]   Inter-AP communication.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:01.440]   Aha.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.480]   This is what we were talking about.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.880]   Apple is said to be working on a testing functionality
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.160]   that will allow apps in the app store to better communicate.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.000]   This is known as an XPC service.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.360]   They're developing an API for apps to share data,
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.800]   a future photo editing app might have the ability
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.360]   to push the content for upload via the Instagram app.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.800]   Right now, you can kind of do it in a backwards way.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:28.240]   You can share it out to Instagram, Instagram opens.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.000]   But then Instagram has access to the photo, right?
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.560]   Yeah, they have URL schemes and they have X callback.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.640]   Apple actually ported XPC from the Mac over to iOS,
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.960]   I think in iOS 5 or iOS 6.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.280]   And they broke Springboard into Springboard and Backboard,
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.360]   which would enable it to do things like Headless apps
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.360]   and stuff like that.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.000]   But they never pushed it out to developers.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.560]   And iOS 7, it was hinted that it would be there
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.040]   based on some of their early betas,
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.080]   but they didn't ship it either.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.120]   So it looks like something they've spent a couple years
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.120]   working on.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.040]   iOS 7 did give us Inter-AP audio.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.600]   So you can now push audio files between different apps.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.520]   But nothing beyond that.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.000]   So hopefully this would be an extension where almost any kind
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.040]   of format could do similar things to intents on Android
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.520]   or contracts on Windows Phone.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.400]   A couple of you on the chat room have been saying
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.360]   that what the Apple's done with audio, they've done right.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.440]   So extend that.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.240]   Yep.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.040]   That's the right way to do it.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.240]   And about time.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.680]   Yeah, it really is interesting how
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.120]   Apple completely owns the audio segment.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.840]   That's one area where Android just has nothing as good
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:33.120]   in terms of synthesizers, in terms of all the music-making
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.000]   stuff that's on iPad.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.880]   Musicians, it's just a natural.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.800]   And I just don't see that on Android.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:40.800]   I mean, there's two things.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.080]   One is itself selecting that a lot of artists like Apple
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:43.640]   Tegan with.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.600]   So they want to make the tools that they use.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.480]   But also, one of the biggest strengths of iOS--
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.400]   and we see it over and over again-- is the frameworks
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.160]   that Apple provides.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.760]   It's just incredibly simple.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.680]   Not simple, but it saves you a ton of work
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.400]   to use core audio, core animation, core graphics.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.520]   And people can make these apps faster and better
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.800]   than they can in other platforms.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.300]   Right.
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.840]   All right.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.400]   Let's take a break.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.640]   We'll come back and talk about what we think we know about OS
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.600]   10.10.10.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.520]   Sera.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.280]   Sera.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.320]   That's a wine, not a beach.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.360]   But that would not be the public name or--
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.880]   No, so what happened was they originally
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.000]   had the big cat names.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.960]   And then Apple marketing started using those.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.520]   And then the development team were like,
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.880]   well, you're using our code names.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.400]   We'll come up with new secret code names.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.600]   And they switched to wines.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.120]   All right.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.280]   So they've been wine for a while.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.880]   What was Mavericks?
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.520]   I forget one wish, Chubbly, one wish, Chubbly.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.400]   They've had a whole-- I'll pull them up.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.400]   All right.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.640]   Think for yourself, like, which would you rather
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.400]   do make your cat's tacked deductible or make all your wines
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.560]   tacked?
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.560]   I have to try wines.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.560]   We're looking for a code name.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:51.160]   My wine seller is a resource for code names.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:51.400]   All right.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.520]   So the iOS Mavericks was--
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.240]   He's looking it up.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:57.760]   All right.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:58.320]   So here they are.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.600]   So 10.10 is Sera.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.840]   Mavericks was Cabernet.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.960]   Lion was-- Mountain Lion was Infandel.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.360]   Lion was Barlow.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.480]   Snow Leopard was Snow Leopard.
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.320]   They didn't have time to make up anything else.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.960]   And Leopard was Chubbly.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.560]   Tiger Intel was Chardonnay.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.320]   Tiger-- Power PC was Merlot.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.000]   Oh, it really goes way back.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.720]   First one was-- yeah, Panther was the first one.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.600]   Pino.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.600]   Pino.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.080]   Wow, it goes way back.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:25.680]   So Sera 10.10, we don't know what the official release name
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.120]   will be.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.480]   We'll talk about some of the features you might expect
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.680]   in just a little bit.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.960]   Are we going to see a Mac mini soon?
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.480]   I hope so.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.560]   I hope that will be the BDC.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.640]   Somebody called on the radio show this weekend and said,
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.000]   I really want to get a Mac mini.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.880]   I have an old Mac.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.840]   And I have the monitor.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.920]   I have the mess of the keyboard.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:46.840]   Why should I get anything but a Mac mini?
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.760]   I'm also curious to see if the Mac pro styling translates
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.240]   downward to other desktops.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:52.720]   Right.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.160]   If we're going to see some nice--
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.760]   not necessarily a flat disk as the Mac mini,
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.280]   but at least some of the same material is the same color
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.640]   and some of the same design.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.160]   Don't--
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.280]   Don't--
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.080]   I would like a donut computer.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.720]   A computer and a batting ring.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.200]   Oh, nuts.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.040]   Are you--
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.720]   A batting range?
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.200]   Badding ring.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.280]   You drop it onto the bat.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.200]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.760]   For warmups, yeah.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.440]   That's where you go when you hear the word donut?
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.080]   You are a baseball fan.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:25.640]   There you go.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.720]   It's Fenway America, World Series Champion Red Sox.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.720]   We are still a good team at least for the next week,
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.600]   so please let me revel in.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.400]   Do you see Big Poppy's selfie?
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.960]   Yes.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.440]   With the president, the Red Sox-- why
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.640]   were the Red Sox at the White House?
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.960]   Oh, because they won the World Series.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.240]   And so they're there at the White House,
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.280]   and they're giving the president his own Red Sox jersey,
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.000]   which looked big enough-- the right size for Big Poppy,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.360]   but I think it might be a--
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.960]   He might fit the entire Obama family.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.360]   You get the whole-- the kids, everything in there.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:02.560]   And then Big Poppy says, hey, let's take a picture,
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.600]   a press, and they go like this.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.880]   And it says Samsung Galaxy Note 3.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.520]   A sponsor?
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.040]   A sponsor.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.440]   It turns out, yeah.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.800]   So the White House says, we don't want Samsung
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.200]   to use that picture in their promotional materials.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.120]   That's not OK.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.680]   But the picture that got distributed
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.960]   was not the selfie, but the picture of the selfie being
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.880]   taken just as it was with the Ellen DeGeneres Academy
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.560]   Awards selfie.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.960]   It's all about getting that Samsung Galaxy Note 3
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.320]   under pressure.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.640]   Samsung has an advertising budget,
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.200]   but the White House has first strike capability.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.120]   Yes, I'm sure they'll work in a--
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.120]   Don't forget who carries the football.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.320]   But don't you love that like Romulan scale thinking?
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.640]   People realize that people are taking selfies now.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.720]   A lot of these people are famous,
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.360]   and people will be having their picture taken taken selfies.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.400]   Let's put free phones into as many famous people's hands
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.000]   as part of it.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:53.800]   Well done.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.080]   Now, apparently, according to the New York Post,
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.640]   which is not exactly a journal of record,
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.960]   the president is considering banning all selfies
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.200]   at the White House.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.640]   My secretary had a statement yesterday,
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:10.200]   so I'm doing a standup last night and saying, yeah, we're--
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.520]   also, this is the problem of they don't want to encourage
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.440]   people to simply put their arm around the president
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.400]   and pull it close to--
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.200]   I think exactly.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.160]   And anybody on that stage has probably been vetted,
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.440]   but that's probably something that makes people nervous.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.920]   I don't think Brock looked pretty happy there.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.000]   He'd be posing with Ortiz.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.720]   It didn't seem like he was unhappy.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.160]   Bobby, why don't a picture taken with me?
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.800]   I would be very happy about the two.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.040]   So it never happened with CJ Craig still in office.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.560]   Talking about the West Wing now.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.720]   It was a West Wing reference.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.840]   No selfies back then.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.760]   They didn't have selfies.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.440]   They didn't have camera phones.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.080]   And now the internet.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.160]   And it didn't present Obama to a selfie
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:52.200]   with the fairly lovely Prime Minister of Denmark
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.680]   and David Blair of England, who is less than lovely.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.920]   Is that called a Prezi?
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:56.960]   It's a Prezi.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.920]   Not a Prezi.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:00.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.360]   OK.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.840]   Immediately after Ortiz took the picture, someone later
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.840]   believed to be Ortiz yelled, cha-ching.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.320]   OK.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.480]   That's going a little too far.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.720]   That's selling at the office.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.640]   Aisip really gave it away.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.040]   Cha-ching?
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:20.920]   Really?
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.320]   Really big puppy.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.280]   But he make the cha-ching hand movement too, because that
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.440]   would have--
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.200]   I'm calling Samsung.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.840]   That's got to be worth--
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.520]   worth two tests.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.920]   He has the least.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.280]   That's fine, because there was a story in the Herald
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.360]   the other day about how pop--
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.960]   not his bigger yacht, but a smaller yacht.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.400]   The helicopter on that yacht needs to be refurbished.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.840]   So he's kind of hurting for money.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.480]   So you've got to do what you've got to do.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.560]   And it makes perfect sense to me.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.040]   Our show today brought to you by Audible.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:52.800]   Not calm.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.640]   We love Audible.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:58.560]   We are big Audible fanatics here every time we get together.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.840]   We talk about, oh, what are you listening to right now?
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.520]   What's your book?
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.240]   I was mentioning fact right before the show.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.880]   I'm listening to Dogfight.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.400]   Fred Vogelstein's amazing story of Apple and Google,
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.560]   the creation of the iPhone.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:13.120]   You probably saw the excerpt in Wired Magazine of the iPhone
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.600]   demo from the point of view of the radio engineer,
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.040]   the guy who did the radios in it.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.360]   And oh my gosh, it's such a good book.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.960]   There's so many great books.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:26.000]   Whether it's fiction or nonfiction,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.480]   classics, scary books, funny books, Philip K. Dick books,
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.080]   it's all at Audible.com.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.880]   Actually, science fiction at Audible is incredible.
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.640]   And much of it, they are producing themselves
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.440]   with their Audible Frontiers program.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.640]   I just downloaded Flash Boys, the new Michael Lewis book.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.240]   I'm going to tell you how you can get a free book.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:51.680]   But before I do, why don't we ask Mr. Andy Ennaco,
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.440]   what his current choice is?
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.520]   Oh, I have two recommendations this week,
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.200]   both in honor of Letterman announcing his retirement
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.360]   last week.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:05.400]   One of my-- I admit that I have no knowledge of how TV works.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.440]   I have no understanding of it.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.440]   But boy, is it interesting to read a well-written book
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:14.280]   about how a big decision like replacing Leno
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:17.160]   with the-- what a No Brian works,
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.800]   and how the ripple effects go, and how
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.120]   dealing with an underperforming tonight show,
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.120]   and swapping out Leno back into place, how that works.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:29.520]   Bill Carter wrote a great book called The War for Late Night.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.360]   That's available on Audible.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:35.760]   That man, he talks to everybody who works in late night
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.160]   about, really, how did that happen?
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:41.040]   How was it allowed--
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.640]   why were they so-- why was NBC so sure
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:46.400]   they needed to get rid of Leno at the top of his game
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.680]   and replace him with Conan?
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.360]   How did Conan O'Brien's people somehow
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.520]   manage to create a contract that said that you're not
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.600]   guaranteed 11.30 start time?
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.560]   We just have to call the show the Tonight Show.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.840]   He's talking to Seinfeld.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.840]   He's talking to Letterman's people.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.960]   It's such a complete picture of how one interesting industry
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.440]   works, and the people who, at the end, despite their fact,
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.400]   they're gambling with hundreds of millions of dollars,
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.440]   just simply have to make the best decision.
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:18.200]   They know how to do, and then trust that everything will work out OK.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.240]   So it's just a really wonderful drama.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.600]   And also it just teaches you a little bit about how
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.200]   a different industry works.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:28.240]   The other one is a book called I'm Dying Up Here, Heartbreak
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.160]   and High Times in Stand Up Comedy's Golden Era.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.040]   This is a book about-- written by a stand up comic
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.640]   who is very active in the comedy store in LA during the '70s.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.280]   And he writes this memoir about what the comedy store was
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.800]   like during the '70s when Letterman was a daily fixer,
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.400]   Leno was a regular fixer.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:50.040]   All these huge name-brand people were going out to LA
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.040]   to try to figure out the next step of their comedy careers,
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.360]   which was, of course, going to probably wind up
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:59.800]   going through the guest chair of the Tonight Show at some point.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.000]   It's less about the business and more about the personalities
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.600]   and the drive of certain people.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.000]   And it's also really, really interesting
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.600]   to see the Letterman personality and the Leno personality
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.720]   and where they were in the mid to late '70s
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.200]   and what they thought of each other and what their kind of work
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.840]   style and approaches were like.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.520]   Look at Leno's hair.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.720]   Wow.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.560]   There's Andy Kaufman.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.680]   I can't wait to read this.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.800]   Gosh darn you, Andy Inako.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.000]   Every time you come on this show, I use up a credit.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.080]   And I am down to no credits.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.640]   Fortunately, those of you listening
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.360]   can get this book for free right now.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.200]   I'm going to give you credit.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.480]   All you've got to do is go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.120]   You'll be signing up for the gold account.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.880]   That's the book of the month account.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.280]   This is the most affordable way to get audible books
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.000]   is to have a subscription.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.040]   You get the book or credit toward a book every month.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.960]   And by the way, each-- there are two credit books.
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.600]   99.5% of all the books and there are 150,000 books
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:58.640]   or a single credit.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.480]   But I want to warn you, if you want to go there, for instance,
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.360]   to read Game of Thrones, which you should be doing,
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.880]   many of those are two credits because they're so long.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.480]   This one's not.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.800]   And you can get it for free.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:09.880]   Subscribe.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.600]   You don't pay anything for the first 30 days.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.000]   You cancel on that time.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.640]   Pay nothing and keep the book.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.760]   You also get the daily digest of the New York Times
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.440]   or the Wall Street Journal as part of your subscription.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.760]   Another good reason is subscribe.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.120]   I am a big fan.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.600]   And he's a big fan Paul Therat Chad.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:31.920]   We were talking the other day about audible.audible.com/macbreak.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.600]   You know what?
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.960]   They don't look like they have the night shift.
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:41.080]   Wasn't that the book about the Leno Letterman?
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.840]   I think it was actually on the late shift.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.640]   Late shift.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.880]   Maybe they have that.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:51.520]   If you search the wrong name, the late shift was the previous one.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.080]   And the letterman was involved.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:55.360]   I hope they have it.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.320]   No, no, wait a minute.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.040]   Yeah, they do have it.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:58.560]   Is this it?
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.600]   No, that's not it.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.280]   That's-- I think they don't have it.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.840]   I don't think--
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.760]   I just look for a couple of things.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.880]   They have the nudist on the late shift.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:12.200]   That's Pope Bronson's very funny book about Silicon Valley.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.200]   Which I hadn't thought about in years.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.200]   Wow.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.200]   So anyway, audible.com/macbreak.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.200]   The late shift.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:26.200]   Yeah, I read that in paper years ago.
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.200]   What a story.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.200]   I love that.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.200]   And I'm so sad about Letterman.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:33.200]   Did you see Keith Olbermann's beautiful tribute to David Letterman?
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   Yeah, and it's not often that someone gets to hear their own eulogy.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:43.720]   And boy, what was like Thursday and Friday was everybody's like their tributes to Letterman
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.200]   and his legacy and the history and their personal connection to them.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:52.040]   For honest to God, when I first saw that he was a trending topic and saw some of these
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.040]   things like, oh God.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.040]   Oh, what's happened?
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.640]   But no, just retiring.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.800]   I can't imagine what Letterman will do with that.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.800]   That pulpit everything.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.280]   I'm like Carson.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.280]   He has a wife.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.280]   He has a kid.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.000]   He has hobbies that are-- that connect with other people.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   So--
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.400]   And plus he has a half a billion dollars.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:16.280]   David, if you want to do podcasting, I can't guarantee you money, but I can guarantee
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.280]   you happiness.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.920]   He'll just follow the Grand Preserkin.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.920]   Just fly city to city.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.440]   Apparently, that's what I learned from Olbermann's stories that he's a big F1 fan.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.440]   Didn't know that.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.320]   You're a part owner of Letterman Ray Hall racing team.
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:32.880]   You won the Indianapolis 500 like six, seven, eight years ago.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.860]   And if you ever have this idea that like Dave has just become this grumpy old fan, get
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:41.580]   video of him like after his racing team has won the Indianapolis 500.
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.980]   That was like his-- the top of his head was almost about to come off because his smile
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:45.980]   was meeting in the back.
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:47.660]   Well, he did grow up in Indianapolis.
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:52.100]   I guess it's not unusual that you might get a little passion for motor sports in that
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.540]   city.
[00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:55.340]   Moving on to Sarah.
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:58.820]   OS 1010.
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:00.300]   They should release it on October 10th.
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.300]   I'm just saying.
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.300]   Double 10 days.
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.660]   I want to be thrilled.
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:08.780]   It will be the successor to Mavericks, obviously.
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:10.580]   I've lost track of the TikTok cycle.
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:13.620]   Mavericks is a big release, right?
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:16.220]   So we would expect a smaller release on this one.
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:20.340]   I don't think it works that way anymore just because the year by year schedule is brutal.
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:25.860]   And also when you add iOS 7 into the mix, it took so many resources away from them that
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:29.180]   I think they just focus on whatever features that they want to deliver now and they'll
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.020]   all be roughly similar.
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:37.100]   Well, if you thought iOS or iOS, as they say, 7 was controversial.
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:45.020]   So, raw, Johnny Ive has been leading a significant design overhaul for OS 10.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:48.820]   And the new design will be the operating system's cornerstone new feature.
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:53.980]   We don't know what it's going to look like, but Johnny's got his hand in it.
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.740]   That rumor worries me a little bit.
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:57.180]   That's the hell out of me.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:02.220]   Well, because, I mean, look how much Microsoft doesn't like Apple, but look how much failure
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:05.580]   they have had to get people to accept Windows 8.
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:10.500]   Last week at Bill, mostly in Office about Windows 8, we're about how, okay, we are rolling
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:14.380]   back about a third of the things that a couple of years ago we told you were the signature
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:18.060]   features of Windows 8.
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:21.500]   Windows users are a lot more intractable than Mac users.
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:22.980]   Mac users are more open to change.
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:29.380]   Nonetheless, if you look, remember how bad the lot of people reacted to iOS 7 and they
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:33.260]   really didn't have a choice but to upgrade and they had to go up an upgrade and people
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.460]   are still not really, a lot of people are still not very happy with it.
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:41.540]   So if you take the operating system that people know and love and rely on and if you
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:48.660]   make changes that aren't immediately tactile as an improvement of what went before, you're
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:52.780]   going to have a lot of people who might be looking at Windows 8 now and saying that, well,
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.620]   look, if I'm going to have to switch to something that I don't really like, I'm not really familiar
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.180]   with, I may as well go for something that I don't really like, not familiar with, that
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:03.980]   costs $500 less in a laptop form.
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:09.220]   I'm not predicting Doom, I'm just saying that it's an interesting gutsy thing for them
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:12.900]   to do to really severely monkey with the Mac operating system if that's what they're
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:13.900]   doing.
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:17.340]   There was a big Bruhaha over 7.
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:18.900]   I always said.
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:22.620]   My understanding is that this was always in the cards, it's just again, they had so much
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:25.020]   to do with iOS 7, they couldn't do it at the same time.
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:29.180]   Otherwise, we would have seen them, you know, the redesigns happen simultaneously.
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.420]   But there's a couple of things to remember.
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:31.780]   One is that it's a big halo product.
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:36.620]   So people go from iOS to OS 10 and Apple spent a lot of years trying to make it not identical
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:40.460]   but at least familiar to people who make that switch and they're going to want to keep
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:42.540]   maybe a little bit of that familiarity.
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:46.900]   I think we can all take solace that Apple really understands that OS 10 and iOS are separate
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.740]   things with separate requirements.
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:54.300]   But I think we'll see large principles like the deference, the clarity and the depth sort
[00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:55.300]   of play through.
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:43:00.180]   A friend of mine, Dave Whisk is an article from Macworld saying iCloud.com could be a
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.900]   hint as to where they go.
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:07.300]   But I think what we'll really see is a version not of iOS 7 but of that same vision applied
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.540]   to the realities of the Mac.
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:15.300]   Am I correct that 10.10 is binary for 10?
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:16.300]   I think it is.
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:23.500]   I will say that if they released 10.10 on 10.10, then 10.10 would be 42.
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.100]   The answer goes yes.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:26.100]   Question.
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:29.340]   I think 1.0 is 10 and binary.
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:30.340]   How time is 15?
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:31.340]   Is this listening?
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:32.340]   Am I wrong?
[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:33.340]   No, I'm wrong.
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.340]   That's wrong.
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:39.740]   I do agree with what Renee is saying about the general attitude towards a streamlining and
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:43.460]   fixing Mac OS 10.
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:47.980]   The nature of my concern is that my personal preference is that I think that they kind
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:52.820]   of sistine-chappled iOS with iOS 7.
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:56.020]   They did a little bit too much scrubbing and a little bit too much cleaning and they left
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:44:03.220]   something that really isn't as clear as what they took away.
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:09.940]   If they were to take a device that I use with a really big screen, 13 inches minimum,
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:16.140]   25 inches, 24 inches sometimes and they simply are going to be removing what they see as
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.460]   superfluous interface and gloss.
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:22.780]   As a result, they make it harder for me to set this up the way I like it and to navigate
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:23.780]   my way around it.
[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:25.940]   I'm sorry, just visually anchor myself.
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:26.940]   Here's the task I'm doing.
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:31.620]   Here are things that are not so important but they're still in my frame of perception.
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.020]   That could be a problem.
[00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:37.220]   It would be a much longer adaptation process than it was probably with 7.
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.220]   But they're still felt there, Andy.
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:40.060]   They have to get rid of that felt.
[00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:41.060]   No more felt.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:42.060]   No more stitching.
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:43.780]   Damn it, that's my desk blotter, Jody.
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:44.780]   Put it back.
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:47.540]   If it's on the computer, you can mess with it.
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:49.540]   If it's in my house, leave it alone.
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:52.740]   Yeah, they didn't have time for Game Center last year, much to many people's chigrin.
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:53.740]   Still there.
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:54.740]   That's for that note.
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:55.740]   You're right.
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:56.740]   It is a couple of days past the expiration date.
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:00.740]   You can throw that away, but give me my desk blotter.
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:03.340]   Apparently they've been testing features like Siri on the desktop.
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:05.140]   That's good.
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:10.860]   It's compatibility between airdrop and the desktop and airdrop on the iOS.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:13.860]   Seems like that should have just been there.
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:14.860]   No.
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:19.940]   The thing with airdrop and it's an interesting story is that they did it and Steve Jobs said
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:20.940]   too complicated.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:21.940]   Not going to ship this.
[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:22.940]   Did it again?
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:24.140]   Scott Forest all said too complicated.
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.140]   Not going to ship this.
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.540]   They went back and they made an entirely new version of airdrop that would satisfy the
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:32.380]   simplicity requirements, but it was no longer compatible with the Mac version with the
[00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:39.580]   theory being that now they have to go back and rejigger them for compatibility.
[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:40.820]   But they gave him the same name to us.
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:43.700]   So it's future compatible, but it's confusing in the present.
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:46.300]   Hey, Bluetooth file transfer still works.
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:50.740]   You kind of wonder how many people were bit by that.
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:55.380]   I knew this because I think you told me this is a Renee some time ago, but how many people
[00:45:55.380 --> 00:46:00.740]   have tried to share to an iPhone using airdrop from a desktop and going, well, it just won't
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:01.740]   work on our scene.
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:02.740]   Okay, bring them closer.
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:03.740]   Tap them.
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:04.740]   Tap them.
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:05.740]   Thank you so much.
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:07.780]   Wasted time.
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:08.780]   There is.
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:12.620]   And it's the most frustrating type of feature because this is something that I was going through
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:18.980]   just last week when I was using Fire TV where it's like, okay, so now let's try streaming
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:20.740]   the my Amazon Music Library.
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:21.940]   Okay, I don't see an app for it.
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:22.940]   Okay, it must be on the app store.
[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.940]   There's no app for it.
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:28.540]   There must be a settings for it because it's such an obvious feature.
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:31.780]   You will not believe that this feature does not exist.
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.300]   You just assume, oh, I must be any edit.
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.300]   I just can't find it.
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:38.860]   And then you find out that no, it is not possible to use this banner feature that would
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:43.060]   be so useful between these two devices, but no, it's not ready yet.
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.660]   Well, this is worse because Steve said, let's make it simpler.
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:51.700]   It's too complicated, but what could be more complicated than having two feet incompatible
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:54.500]   features with exactly the same name.
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:57.460]   And the thing, the debate was that if they change the name later, it's confusing.
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:00.540]   But you know, these people in the present would be not confused.
[00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:03.780]   And I would bet that that's killed Airdrop because enough people try to, it didn't work,
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.820]   they go, well, Airdrop doesn't work.
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:06.820]   And that's it.
[00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:10.740]   Although, I mean, there's the amount of iOS devices versus the amount of Mac device.
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:13.500]   That's a smaller subset of their users who get that problem.
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.340]   That's what's depressing really.
[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:21.060]   Okay, so, hardware.
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:25.540]   Apple seems to be readying, according to some rumors, a 12 inch MacBook Air.
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:29.220]   We talked about that last week, thinner and lighter.
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:35.580]   As you mentioned, Renee Apple has unveiled laptops at WWDC.
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:37.540]   So perhaps we'll see something there.
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:40.340]   Mate, you think we might see a mini?
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:41.340]   Adona?
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:42.340]   It's about time.
[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:43.900]   I mean, the Haswell is there.
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:48.060]   If they have enough chips, they had to redesign it because it was based on the previous generation
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:49.900]   MacBook, not the current generation MacBook.
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.420]   But I would love to see that.
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:56.380]   I'd love to see it have the same kind of PCI based memory and storage that the new Mac
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.140]   Pros and the new MacBook Pros have.
[00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:01.180]   The Mac could be an amazing little machine if they just modernize it.
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:02.180]   Yeah.
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:05.620]   And does anybody want to take any bets that it will not be available with spending hard
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:06.620]   drives yet?
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:07.620]   Yeah.
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:14.740]   They're going to try to make something more like an Apple TV in profile and an unassuming
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:15.740]   presentation.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:19.540]   Or a fusion drive, maybe?
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:20.540]   I don't know.
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:29.580]   It's like sometimes you just worry about-- you think about how much of Apple's game plan
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:32.380]   is that this is a feature that people want and people need.
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:36.500]   And we also have to make this price point because the Mac mini is the most affordable
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.540]   way to get into the Mac ecosystem.
[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:43.260]   On the other hand, they really are very driven by their own philosophy, which is not-- it's
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:44.260]   not arrogance.
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:46.740]   They simply have a belief that this is the way you should make computers and that they're
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:51.780]   willing to sort of shuck off a certain percentage of users, I think, if it means that they're
[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:56.060]   going to be making a better, stronger product that makes more sense for them.
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:49:03.020]   And if they could make a Mac mini that doesn't seem like the boring $500, $600, $700 headless
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:10.140]   Mac and looks like the super sexy hot plate of creativity.
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:14.060]   To get that sort of low profile means that we are going to make it just thick enough
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:18.260]   to accept an Ethernet adapter but not much more than that.
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:25.180]   Then I believe that the argument of sticking strictly to solid-state storage would win
[00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:26.180]   the day.
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:27.180]   Yeah.
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:29.540]   I want to do-- and I mentioned this before I'm serious-- if they come out with a new Mac
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:34.980]   mini, we're going to do a blindfold A/B comparison between the Mac Pro and the Mac mini.
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:39.060]   And if I can't tell the difference, then one of our editors gets the Mac Pro and I sit there
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:40.060]   with a Mac mini.
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:41.060]   Nice.
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:44.620]   But you know how I'll know the difference because the Mac mini doesn't reboot spontaneously
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:47.380]   every few hours.
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:48.580]   You don't know that yet, Leo.
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:49.580]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:50.580]   That's a feature.
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.780]   Maybe that's a new feature that is designed.
[00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:53.780]   A feature.
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:54.940]   I get a call apple.
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:50:00.860]   They don't want to get those the same problems you get by sitting at an airline seat for
[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:02.260]   three or four or five hours.
[00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:06.180]   By forcing this machine to reboot once every couple hours, it forces you to get up, walk
[00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:07.180]   around.
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.180]   Walk around.
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:09.180]   That's exactly what I do.
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.180]   I ask things like that.
[00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:13.420]   They're your throat by yelling.
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.100]   Yeah, and I get a call apple.
[00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:17.020]   But you know, it's one of those things where you don't really-- you kind of keep hoping
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:19.660]   all it's just-- it's probably-- oh, I remember it last week.
[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:23.340]   I said, oh, it's probably just the relay switch when you remove this.
[00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:26.980]   Maybe I just-- I keep thinking, oh, because I know it's intermittent and I'm going to
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:29.740]   take it to the store and they're going to say, well, it works fine for me.
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:31.620]   And I'm going to take it home and it's going to do it again.
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:32.620]   But I did it yesterday.
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:36.100]   I am just doing stuff, normal stuff, not heavy duty stuff.
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:40.220]   And the thing goes, boom, boom.
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:42.780]   It shuts down, bong, boops.
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:43.780]   And it's happening.
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:45.220]   And it's just-- and I replaced the ram.
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:46.540]   Remember we thought it was a ramstick?
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:48.180]   I don't know what it is now.
[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:49.180]   I think it's a--
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:50.180]   Apple store.
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:55.500]   Yeah, but you know, I'm going to go there and they're not going to have it happen to
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:56.500]   them.
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:57.500]   10.3.
[00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:00.700]   They're going to blame me.
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:04.100]   You just wish there were something like a flight recorder on these things.
[00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:05.100]   I know.
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:06.620]   Just talk about the console logs.
[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:10.660]   I'm talking about separate things, separate CPU that just simply records your string of
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:12.540]   curses and the noises and smells that.
[00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:16.900]   I do send every time, you know, it says you had a crash, would you like me to report?
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:19.980]   And then I type in the comment, it doesn't really laugh.
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:23.380]   But I don't know if anybody reads that.
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:26.260]   They use that just for internal fixing their own problems.
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:30.020]   It's not for-- I mean, it'd be great if there was some way that if there was-- as soon as
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:35.500]   there's that the crash reports reach a certain threshold, you get a sort of Samaritan phone
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:39.260]   call from your local store saying, "Hi, it turns out it looks like we've been getting
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:43.180]   19 John Mulp crash reports a day for the past four.
[00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:46.300]   You want to come in and we'll give you a cup of coffee and we'll take a look at what's
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:47.300]   going on."
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:52.060]   We promise that if it doesn't happen while it's in the store, we will believe you by
[00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:55.140]   the veins that are still pulsating out of your forehead, I'm sure.
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:58.500]   Well, and then, you know, I don't-- it's just me, but I know they're going to say, "Well,
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:01.020]   maybe your power isn't clean.
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:03.020]   We want to test that."
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:06.580]   I think Solarometer has determined that you're hitting the keyboard really hard in this crash
[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:07.580]   log report.
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:08.580]   We'd like to use it if you don't need it.
[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:09.580]   It interconnects.
[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:12.380]   You know, they said, "Well, our use-- because the last time I called them I said, "Well,
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:14.460]   are you using a powered hub?"
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:15.460]   Yeah.
[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:17.660]   "Well, it's-- oh, well, you better disconnect that."
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:18.660]   So I did.
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:20.380]   Still happens.
[00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:21.540]   Are you doing that?
[00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:27.380]   So here is a from Cult of Mac in Polish, a suggestion for the new Mac mini.
[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:28.740]   Make it look like an Apple TV.
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:29.740]   Just thicker.
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:30.740]   Thicker rear.
[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:33.940]   There's a tiny donut mock-up somewhere, too.
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:35.860]   Is there-- so the donut, you weren't making that up.
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:36.860]   There actually is.
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:40.780]   No, someone mocked up a Mac Pro if you cut it down to Mac mini size and it looks like
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:42.780]   a little black donut.
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:46.660]   Darth Vader's, uh, parade.
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:49.900]   The difficulties that you can't-- you can't stiff people on connectors.
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:52.860]   So one of the greatest things-- one of the nice things about the Mac mini is that you
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:55.980]   don't necessarily have to buy a hub because it has so many USB ports.
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:57.740]   It has the full-sized ethernet.
[00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:59.420]   You don't have to buy a dongle for it.
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:03.740]   I think that if they decided to get that aggressive about it, they can make the, "Oh,
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:05.540]   well, we've given you two Lightning connectors."
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.020]   You don't really need any other ports.
[00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:08.940]   You just simply buy a dongle for whatever you need.
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:11.220]   I'm sure they know they couldn't make that fly.
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:13.100]   And I don't think they'd want to make that fly.
[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:16.460]   Because, again, if you're walking-- if you're walking to the Apple Store with $700 to spend
[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:20.860]   on a Mac mini, you don't want to have to come back and spend another $200 or $300 tomorrow.
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:24.260]   You're looking for something like a conventional desktop computer that looks like an Apple
[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:25.260]   product.
[00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:28.580]   And it's got HDMI, which a lot of people love, too.
[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:34.940]   Apple's future Senior Vice President-charged retail sales is now a Dame by which-- and
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:36.980]   that is not a sexist comment, my friends.
[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:44.660]   Angela Arance has become a Dame of the British Empire today for her work at Burberry, where
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:48.740]   she revitalized that classic British brand.
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.380]   Can you show this?
[00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:52.540]   Royal Totten.
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:55.700]   She made Totten Cool again.
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:54:02.060]   Unfortunately, the Queen will not be in attendance at that-- or was not in attendance at that
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:04.020]   event, which was yesterday.
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:07.700]   Instead, the government business secretary Vince Cable--
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:08.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:11.620]   OK, didn't even get a royal-- a little of the royal family.
[00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:12.620]   That is the worst.
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:13.620]   The court of--
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:14.620]   Bill Gates got the Queen.
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:16.100]   "Mom, I've got good news.
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:17.340]   I'm a Dame of the British Empire.
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:18.340]   Here's the bad news.
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:21.220]   They're not going to put a sword on my shoulder.
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:22.220]   Give me a crown."
[00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:25.140]   The Queen's not going to kiss me and put a thing around my neck.
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:27.660]   Vince Cable is going to shake my hand.
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.660]   The government's business secretary--
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:30.660]   Come on down.
[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:34.580]   The Vince Cable, Priyone Honda, right off the 121.
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:37.140]   Just look for the guy with a snake on his face.
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:39.340]   Open until late on Thursday.
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:42.940]   You're going to be a Dame, but yes, minister is going to give it to you.
[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:44.420]   And that's another thing.
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:50.580]   If you become an OBE as a man, you get to be a sir.
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:57.860]   And then they call you Sir John Henry or Sir Johnny Ive.
[00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:00.140]   She has to be Dame Angela and Aaron.
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:02.460]   That does not sound good.
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:04.540]   I'm a Dame.
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:06.700]   They need to come up with a better name.
[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:08.180]   Dame Judy Dench.
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:09.180]   Dame Judy.
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:10.180]   If you--
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:14.380]   She'd be on the same hotel, sweet lobbies, as a Dame Dench.
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:15.380]   I think you're pretty good.
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:16.380]   Surrey.
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:17.380]   Dame Dench.
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:18.380]   All right.
[00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:19.380]   All right.
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:20.380]   You're right.
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:23.820]   We don't know when Aaron's will leave Burberry to take over the helm at retail sales at
[00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:24.820]   Apple.
[00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:30.660]   They said this spring, the Daily Mail says this month, but we don't know.
[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.660]   Apple has to ship something in the spring.
[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:33.660]   Yeah.
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:39.420]   That's in the first big meeting in which Johnny and I just have to sit there icy as she sits
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:42.420]   across the table from someone who's wearing plads and patterns.
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:44.420]   Oh my God.
[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:45.420]   That's a good point.
[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:48.660]   They have their own nights table at Apple or they won't sit with the commoners.
[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:49.660]   That's right.
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:50.900]   They've got a Dame Annoisseur.
[00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:51.900]   Yeah.
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:54.460]   We nights are going to sit over here.
[00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:58.620]   I understand that Johnny parks his horse in the handicap spot, doesn't even care.
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:55:59.660]   That's not licensed.
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:02.500]   He gets a new horse every six months.
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:07.820]   Our show today, we're going to talk a little bit about the Samsung Apple lawsuit, Round
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:11.700]   2, and some juicy stuff in it.
[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:16.460]   But before we do, let's talk a little bit about Squarespace, the greatest place to start
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:18.460]   your next website.
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:19.780]   We love Squarespace.
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:22.540]   I know we talk about it all the time.
[00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:26.540]   I feel very close to the guys that have been out there many times.
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:29.540]   I just think that really do a great product.
[00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:36.180]   If you're looking for a website that is beautifully designed, stay to the yard.
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:37.180]   It's hard to tell.
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:39.420]   When you go to squarespace.com, click the Get Started button.
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:41.380]   You'll see 25 templates.
[00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:44.100]   You might say, "That's just the beginning.
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:46.780]   Those templates are merely a starting point."
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:51.780]   In fact, if you select one, you'll see a list of sites that use that template.
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:52.780]   They all look different.
[00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:54.060]   That's the beauty of it.
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:57.620]   You don't have to be a web designer.
[00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:01.060]   Somebody said, "You know, I went to Squarespace and those templates.
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:02.260]   They all have pictures in them.
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:03.260]   They're so visual.
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:04.420]   I don't like it."
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:06.540]   You know what?
[00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:07.540]   This is modern.
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:08.820]   This is what people do on websites now.
[00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:09.820]   They put pictures.
[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:11.660]   It's an amazing thing.
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:12.860]   They're all mobile responsive.
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:14.500]   Yeah, they look different.
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:17.900]   Every time I squeeze the screen, the site went to a different site.
[00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:20.020]   Yes, it automatically responds.
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:25.420]   When you upload an image, they upload it and create nine thumbnail images for you.
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:28.380]   Just gorgeous stuff.
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:31.180]   By the way, all the templates are e-commerce enabled.
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:32.180]   That's nice.
[00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:35.140]   They're all mobile responsive, so they look good at any size.
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:36.740]   You've got great support.
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:37.820]   It's very easy to use.
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:40.860]   You won't need to be a coder to use it all.
[00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:44.420]   They do have a good beautiful developer's platform.
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:49.620]   If you need help, they've got a 24/7 help right out of their New York office's live chat
[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:51.460]   and email support.
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:55.100]   Plus the newly designed customer help site has easier access to self-help articles,
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:56.100]   video workshops.
[00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:57.620]   They're always getting better.
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:03.020]   Always improving things like that logo creator tool, which is so sweet.
[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:06.260]   It all starts at just $8 a month and that includes a free domain name when you sign up
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.780]   for a year.
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:11.460]   Those mobile apps like the Squarespace metric app for the iPhone and the iPad, which allows
[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:16.220]   you to check your site stats page, use unique visitors, social media followers, the blog
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:23.620]   app, which lets you update posts, but also monitor comments on the go, even change layouts
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:25.780]   from within the app.
[00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:28.580]   They're so good.
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:29.940]   Squarespace.com, here's what you do.
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:33.660]   You go to squarespace.com, click the Get Started button and play with it.
[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:36.460]   Import your content from your existing sites.
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:37.460]   Mess around with it.
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:39.900]   It's a sense of what it can do for you.
[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:41.100]   You don't need to give them a credit card.
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:44.460]   You're going to give them an email address in case you forget the password that's about
[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:45.820]   it.
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:49.660]   If you decide to buy, do use our offer code MACBreak and you'll get 10% off and they'll
[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:51.980]   know you heard about it on MACBreak Weekly.
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:53.900]   $8 a month.
[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:55.180]   That's amazing.
[00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:56.820]   Squarespace.
[00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:58.180]   Better Web awaits.
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:04.420]   It starts with your site at squarespace.com.
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:11.460]   We had Liz Gaines on Sunday on Twitch and we were talking about the new Apple Samsung
[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:12.460]   trial.
[00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:16.540]   The previous trial was what about trade dress hardware.
[00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:22.620]   The new trial is about five software patents that Apple says Samsung has violated.
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:24.300]   It's the same ones.
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:29.420]   It's to be able to click a link in a messenger or an email that would style the phone or
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:30.860]   go to a website.
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:35.500]   I don't know how you could patent it because our patent system is broken.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:38.220]   Swipe to unlock, things like that.
[00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:43.580]   Apple is going after Samsung and really by proxy after Android, after Google.
[00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:50.100]   One of the things that's fun about these is the discovery which we're in right now.
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:54.780]   That's where both sides get to ask the other side for documents unless the judge seals
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:55.780]   those documents.
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:57.780]   They're public.
[00:59:57.780 --> 01:00:07.220]   It's a Liz Ron article, the six juiciest documents from this week's Apple Samsung trial.
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:12.420]   There's the Super Bowl email.
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:21.780]   Steve Jobs laid out strategy bullet points including a holy war with Google.
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:32.740]   The plan for the future, Phil Schiller's email during the Super Bowl in which he says, "I
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:35.740]   watched the Samsung Super Bowl ad that launched today."
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:38.420]   This was from the 2013 from last year's Super Bowl.
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:43.620]   It's pretty good but I can't help but think these guys are feeling it like an athlete
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:47.820]   who can't miss because they're in his own while we struggle to nail a compelling brief
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:52.820]   on an iPhone.
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:59.540]   That whole exchange is just terrifying to read because you see the ad company's response
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:00.700]   to it and you read it.
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:01.700]   Oh, don't say that.
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.700]   Oh my God, don't say that.
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.700]   Oh God, what did you say?
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:06.700]   You say.
[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:07.700]   Oh dear.
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:16.340]   Essentially, the ad agency's response was not essentially was not written carefully enough
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:21.300]   to eliminate the possibility that he would read that and think that they're saying, "Well,
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:26.500]   Apple's in the same sort of hole they were in in 1997, creatively speaking, that you
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.300]   guys need to do a better job of making better products."
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:30.300]   Ooh, ow.
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:31.300]   Yeah.
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:36.660]   It wasn't that explicit but it was a long, long, long bullet point thing.
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:42.660]   They literally compared it to Apple in 1997 and Phil just very coldly replies that the
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:45.780]   situation is by no means different.
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:46.940]   We didn't have a strategy.
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.380]   We didn't have compelling products.
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:52.100]   We had pretty much nothing and we were six months away from bankruptcy and you could
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:56.500]   just see him like, I see that with one hand while with the other hand, pick up the phone
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.420]   and talk to other ad agencies.
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:01:59.420]   Oh, shocking.
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:01.260]   It was shocking.
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:05.700]   Steve Jobs in an email which says, by the way, at the top of it, do not forward but Phil
[01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:14.900]   Chiller forwards to Michael Chow at Apple.
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:18.460]   Holy war with Google.
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:21.660]   We know Steve was pissed about Google but I think he considered a holy war.
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:22.660]   I think that's interesting.
[01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:26.820]   It's fun to read this stuff and I think this is something to keep in mind that when you
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:31.340]   do these lawsuits that there will be this discovery and some of this stuff will be dragged
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:32.340]   up.
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:35.660]   It's sad but the iPhone is probably one of the most culturally significant.
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:39.900]   There's developments in our recent history but for these lawsuits, Apple would have kept
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:40.900]   it entirely secret.
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:42.060]   We wouldn't know how it was developed.
[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:46.020]   We wouldn't know anything nearly as much about it but because of these patent lawsuits,
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:49.340]   we have all the early design documents, all these early memos.
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:53.820]   I feel really sad that it took this lawsuit but I'm really happy just as a sort of secret
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:56.940]   history of the universe thing that we were finding all this stuff out.
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:57.940]   That's true.
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:01.500]   It's the same reason why you hope that every single president or every single important
[01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:06.980]   presidential aide takes the time to write a memoir or even just speak into a recorder
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:10.660]   for three months about every detail of what it was like to be in there.
[01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:14.580]   Even if you then put in a safety deposit box with lawyer instructions that this is not
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:21.060]   to be released until 50 years after my death, I think that Apple is a unique company that
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:25.220]   they have people who don't do things simply because they're chasing aftermarket.
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:28.940]   They do things because they legitimately believe in what they're doing and they're pursuing
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:31.220]   a point of view that is unique to them.
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:36.500]   So I think that if these stories just are never recorded, never told, I think that it's
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:42.780]   I think of the people who are in the next five, 10, 15, even 20 years who are going to be
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:48.340]   in engineering schools or going to be in design schools who would love to see that inspirational
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.980]   treasure trove of what it was like to develop these things.
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:54.980]   And now all they know is that, well, they decided they want to get into the phone market
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:58.900]   and here is the launch video and here is Steve Jobs keynote.
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:03:59.900]   Oh, well.
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:08.460]   This is from a 2013 planning off site for the iPhone, which was in Cal Stoga just up the
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.460]   road a piece.
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:17.380]   And apparently Apple is a little worried about growth rates are slowing.
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:20.020]   So what is going on?
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:27.020]   The strongest demand is coming from less expensive and larger screen smartphones than our own.
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:31.980]   Plus carriers are getting a little unhappy that the iPhone has such high market share
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:33.860]   costs so much.
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:37.780]   It's unfriendly and competitors have drastically improved their hardware.
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:38.980]   In some cases, their ecosystem.
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:43.100]   Now, I have to say, when you have these kinds of off sites planning, it's often good to
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:47.300]   say, you know, to challenge people and say, Hey, you know what, you may think we're doing
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:53.740]   great and we are, but there's a threat consumers want, but we don't have, which is big screen
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:58.820]   phones, big screen phones.
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:02.820]   So somebody at Apple is a little worried and maybe this is the kind of stuff that will
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:04.900]   lead to a larger iPhone.
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:05.900]   It's a little subtle.
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:10.620]   I mean, the point here is that Apple and the analogy again is to the iPhone on AT&T.
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:14.300]   They'll come a point where anyone who wants one or can have one will have it and the only
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:17.700]   growth will come from going somewhere beyond that like to Verizon.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:24.020]   So now Apple in the last year went from 65% to 85% of the premium smartphone market.
[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.660]   And that's pretty much anybody who wants a four inch smartphone or less.
[01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:30.700]   And if they want to go above 85%, they have to go over after the people who are buying
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:35.060]   premium Android handsets primarily for the larger screens.
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:38.460]   Now, there's also Samsung documents.
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:44.060]   Samsung apparently felt that their UI was just too robotic, not emotional enough.
[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:48.300]   So they had a planning meeting in 2009 in which they went mia.
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:51.580]   It doesn't mean better in French.
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:52.980]   What does that mean in French?
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:54.780]   Better, yeah, better.
[01:05:54.780 --> 01:06:01.020]   Mia, which they say stands for make it an emotional user experience, creating a more
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:03.820]   intuitive and emotional Samsung mobile interface.
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:09.260]   Why are Nokia and iPhone known to be easier to use in Samsung?
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:14.380]   It's because they're not as Samsung's, they're not as fun to use.
[01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:18.340]   They just have to hire Pacific Helm or somebody to redo their interface, just throw money
[01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:20.220]   at one of those awesome companies.
[01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:25.660]   If their interface is anything related to their slides, there's a certain lack of these
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:28.500]   are black and white.
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:33.060]   There's no images vary these slides.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:35.340]   You never get to see this.
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:37.180]   This is such a, this is the one good thing.
[01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:38.180]   It's great to see this.
[01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:39.180]   I agree.
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:41.860]   Because you don't hear companies criticize themselves.
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:45.420]   I mean, of course that always happens, but it gives you a sense of where they think their
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:46.420]   own products are.
[01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:50.300]   There was also another one the bombshell documents from, I think it was last week of
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:55.540]   the week before it might have been last week was Steve Jobs is a draft outline of one of
[01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:59.180]   his all hands meetings in which he talks about it, which there are a couple of line
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:04.460]   items that are about here, your areas in which Android has actually surpassed us like notifications
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:10.220]   and I think interrupting communications is also one of those things where you, again,
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:14.140]   it's nice to see that this is, these are the problems that they have on their own radar
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:18.340]   too because unfortunately at this sort of scale, you don't, you can't afford to have
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:22.580]   Nokia particularly say things like here is where Windows Phone has been falling down
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:25.780]   for us and here's where we failed and here are things we need to fix.
[01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:29.580]   And also honestly, here are things that other companies are doing that we wish we did as
[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:30.580]   well.
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:35.220]   You can't get the kind of honesty at a, at a, no, they'll never say this in public.
[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:39.180]   At a school bake sale at a loan, a big tech company, but that's the only way you're going
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.180]   to see the sort of communication.
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:42.740]   And again, it's inspirational as well.
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:46.300]   This slide deck is for 2008 from Samsung.
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:47.300]   Samsung strengths.
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:48.300]   Now this is in 2008.
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:51.220]   Do not translate well to touch.
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:55.100]   They show all the Samsung phones and then they show the beautiful iPhone icons.
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:08:00.020]   They say software is the new value driver focusing on hardware is a losing proposition.
[01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:02.780]   What makes the iPhone unique is software and services.
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:05.700]   Beautiful hardware is just a bonus.
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:10.460]   Now that's in 2008, but I think they're not far wrong.
[01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:17.220]   They did compete on hardware, but in fact, Samsung software still is not as elegant as
[01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:18.220]   apples.
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:22.460]   It's interesting too is people could accuse Apple of being a loof or oblivious to this
[01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:25.020]   kind of information, but it turns out they just keep internally.
[01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.540]   Yeah, I'll talk about it, but they're well aware.
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:28.540]   Sure.
[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:33.020]   If you've ever worked for a big company, things like competitive research are a very important
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:36.020]   part of what you do.
[01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:37.020]   What are they?
[01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:40.460]   Apple says, in fact, you said this, Andy Apple doesn't care what the other guys are
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:41.460]   doing.
[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:42.460]   Of course they do.
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:43.460]   They may not.
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:45.660]   It may not be a driver, but they pay attention.
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:47.060]   I never said they don't pay attention to that.
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:51.980]   I'm saying that the fact that the fact that the fact that three other major manufacturers
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:55.940]   are coming up with a smartwatch is not going to influence their decision to make a smart
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:56.940]   watch this year.
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:00.740]   It's certainly not even, it's really like an influence their design of a smartwatch.
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:05.180]   The only thing that will really turn their head is if Samsung comes out with a new watch
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:10.780]   or there's a new Google watch or this new pebble or this teeth, this spot watch for
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:15.820]   Microsoft from eight years ago, if it starts selling in numbers that it indicates to them,
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:18.340]   oh, we thought that people didn't really want this.
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:20.340]   It turns out they're very eager for this.
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:21.740]   Okay, we will.
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:22.740]   That is valuable data.
[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:23.740]   We'll move up our timetable.
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:25.260]   They're definitely aware of it.
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:30.940]   I think they're even in the launch interviews for the iPhone, they were talking about how
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:34.980]   they were using every single smartphone out there and taking very, very careful note of
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:36.740]   what worked and what didn't.
[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:40.620]   So last year, Apple won a billion dollars in their lawsuit.
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:44.500]   Now this new lawsuit, they're asking for two billion dollars.
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:51.100]   The five patents are addresses, dates, phone numbers and times appearing as links in text
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:52.100]   message.
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:53.100]   That's very convenient.
[01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:56.860]   So you can click on a link in the text message and it can, for instance, open a calendar
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:58.380]   entry.
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:01.460]   They have a patent called System and Method for Performing in Action on a Structure and
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:03.540]   Computer-generated Data.
[01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:08.460]   Back in 1999, background data-sinking, Apple says, "We own that."
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:14.300]   Universal search, the idea that when you do a search on an iPhone, you can narrow it down.
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:18.620]   You'll get Search Web, you know, you'll get the app that you're searching for, the song
[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:21.540]   you're searching for, but you can also search Wikipedia.
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:25.220]   Universal interface for retrieval of information in a computer system, that's their patent from
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:29.260]   2005 and slide to unlock.
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:32.140]   They say they own that.
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:35.020]   And finally, auto-completion.
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:38.580]   Apple has a patent for method system and graphical user interface for providing word
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:41.780]   recommendations or auto-complete.
[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:43.260]   They say they own that as well.
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:48.740]   Can I say, doesn't this feel a lot like a high-profile divorce case where when you,
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:53.540]   when this first hit the news headlines, you felt as though, you know what, that guy was
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.700]   cheating around and also flattening it.
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:58.180]   I'm glad that this marriage is ending.
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:02.260]   And after three or four years of one side doing something to the other side, the other
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:05.460]   side responding to the other way that doesn't seem like a proportional response, you've
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:09.380]   forgotten who you've decided to root for and you just want this to be over with.
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:10.380]   Yeah, I do.
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:11.700]   That's my take on that.
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:12.700]   Yeah.
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:15.060]   We're the kids in this scenario.
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:17.420]   They're fighting for custody of a Sandy.
[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:20.220]   They're not buying us toys to make up for emotional peace.
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:21.220]   I want candy.
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:22.220]   I want candy.
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:23.220]   Why am I a factor?
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:27.740]   Isn't he real with our new iPads?
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:30.020]   Do you want to talk about security patches and bugs?
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:36.140]   Apple fixes the Safari Pwned Own vulnerability and two-design other critical bugs.
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:37.140]   Yay.
[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:38.140]   Yay.
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:42.620]   You know, I don't even know if this is news anymore.
[01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:49.220]   This is if you're on version 6, 6.1.3, wait a minute, is this really?
[01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:52.220]   Oh, I see.
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:56.140]   Safari 6, 6.1.3 and Safari 7, 7.0.3.
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:57.140]   How do you get that?
[01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:58.140]   You just get it by an app.
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:11:59.140]   It's an app update.
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:02.500]   You can go to the apple.com and get it too, but it's easier to get it from software update.
[01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:03.580]   So just run software update.
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:06.380]   If you haven't done it, you probably want to do that.
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:14.620]   Pwned Own is that yearly Vancouver event where hackers all year save their favorite hacks
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:21.780]   because there is a huge, huge payoff if you are the first to hack a platform and they
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.260]   take all the major platforms.
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:30.460]   And in fact, a French vulnerability seller, it's like an arms merchant.
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:34.460]   That's not a thing you want to tell your kid the eyes of vulnerabilities.
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:42.420]   They set a team to Pwn Own and they hacked Chrome, Adobe Reader and Adobe Flash Internet
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:44.620]   Explorer, $1,400,000.
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:47.660]   Three o'clock.
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:50.820]   I think this is not a I like Pwned Own.
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:53.220]   I like the idea, but there is so much money now.
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:57.700]   There was a total of price fund of $850,000 that I think a lot of exploits.
[01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:01.420]   A lot of these groups are looking for exploits and then don't reveal them so they can make
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:05.100]   money at Pwned Own.
[01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:06.540]   As long as they're revealing them.
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:10.100]   But not revealing them until my daddy's about two, zero days.
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:11.860]   How many of your daddy?
[01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:18.220]   I mean, I think that the people who are white hat enough and have a purity of purpose enough
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:21.060]   to simply say that it is enough that I've uncovered this and I need to get this out
[01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:24.220]   as soon as possible are not going to be the sort of people who would be swayed.
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:27.420]   I'm going to wait for eight months to try to win Pwned Own.
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:31.780]   The people who are going to be swayed to do that are the people who might not have been
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:36.060]   terribly motivated to do the right thing of looking for and documenting a bug anyway.
[01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:37.780]   So I don't know.
[01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.500]   I share your concern.
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.740]   You would like to simply be able.
[01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:44.860]   You would like to live in this sort of world where everybody is saying that we could make
[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:48.580]   the internet and individual apps secure and more public.
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:56.260]   Yeah, and not hold on until Cansack West so we can win $850,000.
[01:13:56.260 --> 01:14:01.380]   What if they were to change the rules and simply say they could create, they could put something
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:04.900]   in escrow and simply say we're going to publish that.
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:08.300]   We can be we have basically filed a copyright claim.
[01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:10.300]   We have filed a claim.
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:13.660]   We've documented it and that gives us the ability to show it to the offended party as
[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:14.660]   well.
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:15.660]   We should win.
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:16.660]   I don't know.
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:21.900]   I just I the difficulty is that this is like saving up all of your all of your favorite
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:28.300]   and most gory Russian dash cam videos so you can have one event we show nothing but gory
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:33.700]   videos as opposed to simply saying that well what why are we saving this one event to show
[01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:37.860]   all the vulnerabilities out at once that are affecting everybody in the world.
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:43.100]   Why isn't enough to simply reveal that okay this team won this this team won that and also
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:48.380]   it also you know they would also in added incentive to say that I was the first person
[01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:54.140]   to file a claim against this and so I'm the first person to document this and share publicly.
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:58.140]   Here's a bug I don't know I think about maybe you you can straighten us out here Renee from
[01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:03.300]   nine to five Mac Mike Beasley and iOS seven bug that allows anyone to disable find my
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:08.540]   iPhone and bypass activation lock even if they don't have a password.
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:12.340]   Yeah I mean it's a bad bug Apple has to fix it.
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:16.420]   The good news is if you have either touch ID or a passcode on your iPhone you're safe
[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:20.060]   because part of the bug requires you to reboot the phone and when you reboot the phone the
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:23.500]   passcode come up so they have to have physical access to your phone they have to be able to
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:27.940]   get to the settings they have to be able to do a couple you know a couple moves then reboot
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:32.660]   it and then do some more things so as long as the reboot brings up the lock you're fine.
[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:37.260]   So it's for not for a 5s if touch IDs turned on.
[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:40.980]   Yeah so it basically touch ID forces the passcode so as long as you have the passcode
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:46.260]   right set up right so in fact the video that they show is for an iPhone 4 and 4s only.
[01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:48.660]   Yeah and again if you lock those with passcode you're also fine.
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:54.660]   Okay so you so you're saying is it is the four digit code enough or does it have to
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:55.660]   be won't okay.
[01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:58.620]   I mean they could they could brute force it if they have physical access to your phone
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:00.140]   but it would take a while.
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:03.900]   The key thing is that it requires a reboot to work so if you can stop them from getting
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:06.300]   access after the reboot you have much less to worry about.
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:09.940]   Okay yay.
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:12.780]   Nothing in other words it's not really a serious issue.
[01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:17.620]   So yeah it depends how value a target you high value a target you are.
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:20.340]   Every single time there's been a security excuse me almost every time there's been a
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:24.620]   security exploit against an iPhone it has always been about if I know you and I know
[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:30.060]   that your phone is very valuable and I'm very motivated then yes I can distract you
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:33.580]   long enough to get your my hands on it and make life very bad for you.
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:39.220]   Most people just worried about well I went to this website and now and now my now my
[01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:43.860]   girlfriend is getting junk mail from some sort of bill distributor.
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:52.620]   Some updates earlier this week for I work which is good this is I work on the iPad right.
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:56.860]   Oh no for all of them that's right because now they're in sync aren't they.
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:59.580]   They have Apple script back and I know it's ready called well at Mac world said there's
[01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:03.020]   a ton of great new stuff in pages especially if you make ebooks.
[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:06.180]   There was story a lot of the functionality that was sacrificed when they ported the
[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:08.260]   iOS engines over to Mac right.
[01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:09.260]   Yeah.
[01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:12.980]   Another reminder not to freak out too much if Apple makes a big revision to something
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:14.740]   and a lot of your favorite features are gone.
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:17.940]   It's possible that they didn't they didn't rule them out they're just simply again didn't
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:20.620]   get to them and they'll be coming up back in a future update.
[01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:25.060]   Yeah but that's a little frustrating because basically you did a very quote update that
[01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:30.300]   downgraded but my worry is that a lot of people who might have been extremely happy with pages
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:34.380]   but then decided she does do Apple script now I should now ban on that I don't have to
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:38.500]   ban it and start learning something else new if they were able to deal with it for a few
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:42.540]   months you might want to sit it out until least the next dot dot release to see if something
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:46.260]   comes back right.
[01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:50.140]   Former Apple executive Andy Miller is out at Leap Motion.
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:54.700]   I have the Leap Motion we played with it I was not overwhelmed by it.
[01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:58.140]   It's a great idea and maybe in later generations it'll be more useful but it was that little
[01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:02.620]   puck you put in front of your computer and then you can wave at it and do things Miller
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:10.500]   was the president and chief operating officer he no longer has a day to day role there.
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.140]   Cool demo what does it do?
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:14.140]   Yeah cool demo.
[01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:19.180]   Isis well I don't know what's going on a person familiar with Leap Motion according
[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:24.660]   to recode described tension and big clashes at the company between Miller and the other
[01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:33.780]   co-founders in the context of a parallel crazy next generation interface product like Oculus
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:37.740]   Rift gaining steam and eventually being bought for two billion dollars by Facebook while
[01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:42.980]   Leap Motion faced lays in less than a stellar launch well you had less than a stellar product.
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:46.380]   What can I say?
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:52.020]   But that's what happens isn't it the dog start fighting over the bones.
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:59.660]   After all that we mentioned that Benoit DuPois is a former vice president of search technology
[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:05.940]   at Amazon has moved over to Apple.
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:10.100]   What do we know about his job at Apple?
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:14.900]   I think Mark I think nine to five Mac had a piece on it earlier where they or maybe it
[01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:17.540]   was German's piece where it's speculated he was going to be working on some of those new
[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:18.540]   IOSA technology.
[01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:20.340]   German says maps.
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:25.020]   Yeah, which is great because the biggest problem with maps is when they swapped out the Google
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:28.180]   data and they brought in the Tom Tom and ways and all the other data is they just didn't
[01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:30.860]   do good data aggregation data cleansing and data sanity.
[01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:35.580]   So you had all different phone formats and conflicting locations and if they get someone
[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:39.500]   who's really smart about making the data really really clean and that instantly improves
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:40.540]   everything else.
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:42.060]   Right.
[01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:45.860]   Apple has apparently done some acquisitions.
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:52.540]   They purchased Nuvara or Nuvara's which is a speech recognition company.
[01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:54.940]   The team now working on Siri.
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:55.940]   That's good.
[01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:58.940]   Goodness.
[01:19:58.940 --> 01:19:59.940]   Yeah.
[01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:03.900]   Nuvara's came out of Dragon systems and of course people are thinking familiar with Dragon
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:07.580]   and Dragon naturally speaking.
[01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:13.540]   Apple has purchased them probably an act higher but who knows.
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:17.500]   It's a really hard thing because Nuvara's is incredibly litigious and they own most
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:20.780]   of the intellectual property around the speech stuff.
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:23.740]   Google managed to get one of the co-founders who actually owned a lot of his own intellectual
[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:24.740]   properties.
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:25.740]   Yeah, he's good.
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:26.740]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:28.420]   And so they can do almost anything that they want.
[01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:30.900]   Well, Apple has to license Nuvara's.
[01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:35.380]   So however much Apple can actually bring this in house, it'll be better for us because we'll
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:39.660]   get better performance on board stuff and it'll just move the technology forward so much
[01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:41.740]   faster for us.
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:49.500]   Apple's looking to buy a Japanese chip maker, Renes Sess, Renes Ass, Renes Ass, I think
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:50.580]   is how you pronounce that.
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:53.620]   It's not for sale.
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:54.620]   RE and E.
[01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:56.380]   It's a good price is down by the bidoff.
[01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:58.340]   RE and E S A S.
[01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:02.260]   Need what's up money before you start talking.
[01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:07.340]   Apple said it'd be seeking a 55% stake for almost half a billion dollars.
[01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:13.300]   240 employees in Japan expected to stay on after the transfer, which Apple aims to complete
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:14.300]   by summer.
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:21.220]   They're the world's largest producer of drivers and controllers for mid-size LCDs.
[01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:27.900]   They have about a 30% market share.
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:32.780]   These chips determine to displace quality and performance as well as overall energy
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:34.980]   efficiency.
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:41.220]   If you look at your battery use, you can't do it on an iPhone but if you look at an Android,
[01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:43.540]   screen is everything.
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:47.900]   The screen will suck your battery dread, Dad.
[01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:54.860]   This would be, I would guess, attempt to get a lower power screen on the iPhone.
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:58.020]   They bought Intricity, they own a share of PowerVR.
[01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:01.380]   They like to have skin in the game when it comes to their chip stuff.
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:02.380]   You betcha.
[01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:08.540]   I think that's pretty much the story, Morning Glory.
[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:09.540]   Let's take a break.
[01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:13.900]   When we come back, your picks of the week, gentlemen, our show today brought to you by

[01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:24.820]   We just did our great hoodies.
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:26.780]   I think that's over now.
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:29.300]   But we've got a new t-shirt, which was also...
[01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:31.860]   What we did is we did a contest for the hoodie and we got five great...
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:33.100]   We got so many good designs.
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:34.780]   We bought five of them.
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:36.980]   They started as low as $199 bucks, by the way.
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:40.500]   So we bought five of them and we're just going to make a variety of things.
[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:42.700]   The new t-shirt is also from 99designs and it's great.
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:43.900]   I love it.

[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:45.900]   We're going to put it...
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:46.900]   Or is it this week?
[01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:47.900]   Maybe it's this week.
[01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:48.900]   We're going to put it on sale.
[01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:49.900]   Prices started $199.

[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:21.780]   We thank 99designs for their great designs and for supporting Mac Break Weekly.
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:23.340]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:26.220]   Let's start with Andy and not co.
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:31.660]   Ryan is a really fun app or really useful app for 3D development.
[01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:32.740]   It's called Rhinoceros.
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:36.220]   It's a very popular app for Windows and they've created a...
[01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:38.820]   They're working on a version for Mac.
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:41.900]   And while they're developing for the Mac, they are basically saying the Mac version is
[01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:43.260]   free while it's under development.
[01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:46.860]   You can just go to the site, just go to mcmcmel.com/rhino.
[01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:48.860]   I think I got the wrong.
[01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:51.740]   You are a Rhino3D.com/Mac.
[01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:55.220]   I had a different page up here for checking up on a fact.
[01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:57.420]   You can just download it for free every couple of weeks.
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:24:58.980]   They're releasing a new development build.
[01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:00.580]   The old one expires.
[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:02.740]   The new one will replace it.
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:04.580]   And it is a very full feature.
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:05.580]   Oh, wow.
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:07.620]   Auditing and an output program.
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:11.180]   I like it even if it weren't a free for now app.
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:15.660]   It's the first 3D app that I've tried that I really seem to be able to understand.
[01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:17.380]   The exception may be of SketchUp.
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:22.500]   But SketchUp for me has always been about more of architectural sort of drawings.
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:25.180]   That you can define as here is a plane.
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:26.820]   I'm going to make this plane thick now.
[01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:31.380]   And I'm going to make another plane that joins it like this for actually wanting to
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:33.620]   design a more complex shape than that.
[01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:37.700]   Or even trying to visualize something that's in your head that you would like, you would
[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:42.180]   do with clay if you wanted to deal with clay.
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:44.140]   This really has a lot of that potential.
[01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:47.740]   I first started playing with it because, as you know, I've been starting to get into
[01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:49.660]   3D printing over the past few months.
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:52.700]   And I wanted to do things that are a little bit more complicated than what I could do with
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:53.700]   other stuff.
[01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:57.180]   But also it's just fun to be able to just make models now.
[01:25:57.180 --> 01:26:00.700]   And I totally stink at it, which is why I don't have anything to show you.
[01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:07.060]   But it feels as though there is not much of a barrier between how I want to use this app
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:09.500]   and this app letting me do that stuff.
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:14.140]   This app is really very for development development app.
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:15.300]   It is rock solid.
[01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:16.300]   I have not gotten it.
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:20.740]   I'm not doing really complicated things with it, but I've never gotten to crash or screw
[01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:21.980]   up on me once.
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:26.620]   It's most of us limitations are things like extended plug-in support, which are things
[01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:29.340]   would be important to you if you're a Windows user of this product.
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:32.340]   There's no documentation, obviously, so you have to sort of fumble through it on your
[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:33.340]   own.
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:35.100]   But there are enough tool tips in this interface.
[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:38.260]   The interface is clean enough that you can pretty much work your way through it.
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:40.620]   They have about seven hours of video on the site too, though.
[01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:43.260]   So you can get some help on how to use it for sure.
[01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:48.180]   So whether you have a real purpose for this app or whether you just want to start playing
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:54.380]   with designing things in 3D and then outputting them, this is really, really great app to have.
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:55.380]   And it exports in.
[01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:59.500]   Again, there are no limitations on what this app can do even though it's a developer release.
[01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:02.940]   So you can export your 3D model in pretty much any format you want.
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:06.620]   So if you want to spit it out for a 3D printer, it will give you an STL file.
[01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:11.620]   If you want to export it as an object, so then you can then use it in a Photoshop project.
[01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:17.140]   If you need for a graphic that you're producing, you need to produce something to that in 3D
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:19.340]   that will match whatever is in the current scene, no problem.
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:22.860]   You can output it, then put into Photoshop and work with it that way.
[01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:27.140]   Long, long list of which three quarters of these file types I don't recognize.
[01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:29.940]   So that's how I know that I'm really impressed with a 3D product.
[01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:33.620]   If it's mostly file formats, I don't recognize.
[01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:37.340]   It's not what there's commercial and non-commerce.
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:40.460]   What's the, how is it free?
[01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:41.460]   It's just free.
[01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:42.460]   You just click download link.
[01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:49.260]   Go to, if you're at rhino3d.com/mac, go to 3D and you will just simply run it for under
[01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:50.260]   a little bit of a deal.
[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:53.100]   I guess if you want to use it for commercial purposes, you have to pay for it, something
[01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:56.100]   like that.
[01:27:56.100 --> 01:28:02.060]   It seems like there's a, like when I click the link that says buy, I see money.
[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:06.460]   Here, you see the download, the most, current work in progress version is available here.
[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:07.460]   Yeah.
[01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:08.460]   And click that.
[01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:09.460]   Yeah.
[01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:10.460]   Oh, okay.
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:17.180]   90 days after 90 days, saving a plug and stop working on the Windows side anyway.
[01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:18.860]   I don't know how the Mac is different.
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:21.300]   Again, this is, it works.
[01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:24.900]   It expires when they have a new development version out, but that means that there's a
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:26.460]   new development version.
[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:27.460]   Cool.
[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:31.220]   So, so obviously there is going to be a point at which you're, the final development build
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:35.300]   will not work anymore at which point you wish that you will be happy that you have
[01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:36.300]   exported your files.
[01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:40.460]   But it's not as though that's going to be a shock surprise that, oh my God, my world
[01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:42.180]   has suddenly collapsed around me.
[01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:46.420]   But again, the difficult, the great difficulty, I think with 3D apps like this is that they
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:52.140]   are so hard to develop and so expensive development that you can't really sell a 20 or $30 trial
[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:53.700]   version of the sort of stuff.
[01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:57.900]   So it's really hard to really experiment with this stuff on a prolonged basis.
[01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:01.980]   So this is a really good opportunity if you've ever wanted, again, wanted to experiment
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:02.980]   with this sort of stuff.
[01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:08.420]   I would love to be able to fix this photo or create this image.
[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:13.260]   All I need to do is create a green screen image that has a fake background on it that
[01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:14.820]   can drop somebody into.
[01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:19.020]   You can just create this, knock this out and run Osterus and have a lot of fun doing it.
[01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:24.340]   And then when we run Osterus code names are small towns in Wisconsin.
[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:26.540]   This is code named Wenachi 5.0.
[01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:29.020]   So there you go.
[01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:30.980]   Renee Richie, you're pick of the week.
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:34.580]   I have two because anyone listening to the beginning of the show knew that we were sort
[01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:35.900]   of all picking the same thing.
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:38.380]   So like Andy, I came up with a spare.
[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:40.580]   So the first one is called understudy.
[01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:43.020]   It's an app for the iPad.
[01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:46.020]   It's made by Ken Ferry and I'm blanking on his partner's name.
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:47.020]   So I apologize.
[01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:48.620]   But they were both Apple engineers.
[01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:53.260]   Ken worked on CoreOS and then he worked on Auto Layout and then Passbook.
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:56.220]   So he's got a really good pedigree to him.
[01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:59.860]   And he left because he wanted to start focusing on educational apps.
[01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:03.740]   And what this does, it's so clever, is it's basically mentoring for your iPad.
[01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:07.260]   So what you do is you sign up for an account and there's two books available now.
[01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:08.260]   There might be more.
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:11.860]   One is drawing on the right side of the brain and the other one is the MIT computer sciences
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:13.100]   program.
[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:16.900]   And you start reading the book and then once a week you're matching up with someone, it's
[01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:17.900]   fantastic.
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:21.700]   You're matched up with someone who's further ahead in that book, either an expert or just
[01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:25.780]   you know, up to one fifth of the way through the book and they help you understand what
[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:27.380]   it is you've been reading.
[01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:30.900]   And then as you progress, you're matched up with someone who's just beginning the book
[01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:31.900]   and you help them.
[01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:33.900]   Oh, that's so cool.
[01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:34.900]   It is really nice.
[01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:38.940]   It's got a full FaceTime like video chatting service embedded in it so you can talk with
[01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:40.460]   the person you're mentoring.
[01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:41.700]   It's got a shared whiteboard.
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:46.380]   So as you draw notes and things, it's in real time between the both of you.
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:50.340]   And it's just an excellent, I saw a bunch of nerds on Twitter really excited about this
[01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:53.980]   because they've been dying to learn these skills for a long time but needed the peer
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:57.860]   pressure, the encouragement, the tutoring, you know, to go along with it.
[01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:00.340]   And this app just provides all of that.
[01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:03.900]   So just a little bit about the two books that that comes with, of course, drawing on the
[01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:08.780]   right side of the brain is widely considered the classic on learning to draw just a must
[01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:13.300]   have both of these books have been around for many decades.
[01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:15.980]   And so if you're interested in learning how to draw, what a great book.
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:19.460]   And then the structure and interpretation of computer programming is a book I've recommended
[01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:25.340]   for years as the one and only best book to use to learn how to program.
[01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:27.980]   You'll be learning in a list variant called scheme.
[01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:34.420]   And don't let that put you off because the point of this is to learn computer programming
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:39.940]   not as something pre professional like I've got to get a learn a language that can help
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:44.020]   me get a job but is really learning about algorithms, the expression of algorithms,
[01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:50.540]   the deep fundamental underlying principles of representing a problem and solving it in
[01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:51.900]   a syntax.
[01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:57.740]   And it's just a classic brilliant book, but which it's long and hard and as is I mean,
[01:31:57.740 --> 01:32:01.540]   it's difficult, it's challenging having somebody to kind of mentor your way through it would
[01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:03.140]   be great.
[01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:04.140]   This is a great idea.
[01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:07.380]   And I really like the choice of books that they've made here.
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:08.900]   Now it's a version 1.0 app.
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:12.620]   So there are there are just a few books when you start also there's the network has to be
[01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:14.820]   built out, but the model is really interesting.
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:16.620]   It's free.
[01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:22.060]   It's free to try and you get up to two, I think it's two hours of voice communications a month
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:23.060]   with it.
[01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:24.060]   It might be a week, but I think it's a month.
[01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:26.260]   If you pay just five bucks, it's unlimited.
[01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:31.100]   So five bucks a month gets you unlimited use of the audio video sort of mentoring system
[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:32.420]   as well as all the other stuff.
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:34.940]   So free to try, easy to get into.
[01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:38.700]   I had the great pleasure of spending some time with Ken on it.
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:40.620]   He's also the guest on this next week's debucks.
[01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:44.820]   We'll be explaining all about the app and how he built it and for the tech nerds who
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.900]   are really interested in it.
[01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:50.820]   So it's for me it was just a really interesting app and I'm hoping people will teach me better
[01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:51.820]   math with it.
[01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:52.820]   Yeah.
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.620]   So lovely idea.
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:57.660]   I mean, you already have this.
[01:32:57.660 --> 01:33:00.420]   I mean, both of these books you can get you can download for free.
[01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:01.420]   They're out there.
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:02.420]   You're going to have kind of this startup.
[01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:08.100]   I can get a MIT level computer science education on my own, but what you're missing is that
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:12.980]   thing you get at a college, which is some mentorship, you know, somebody to kind of
[01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:14.820]   talk with about it.
[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:16.140]   This adds that and it's so great.
[01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:17.140]   I really like this.
[01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:18.140]   Wow.
[01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:20.780]   And it's sort of very Asian in a way like my grandfather learned in a trade school in
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:24.740]   Germany and a mentor relationship and in China, you know, you, the juniors and the seniors
[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:26.180]   is always everybody's a teacher.
[01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:29.340]   You're learning from everybody and we've lost a lot of that in North America.
[01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:30.820]   So outside the tutoring system.
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:33.620]   So it's nice to see that sort of becoming digital.
[01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:34.620]   Wow.
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:37.860]   Chat roulette for programmers and artists.
[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:38.860]   Sort of.
[01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:39.860]   Yeah.
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:40.860]   You're responsible.
[01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:41.860]   I drew Batman right away.
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:43.860]   That's where my mind goes.
[01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:45.700]   And you both have picked the other one.
[01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:46.700]   Yeah.
[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:52.620]   Monument Valley, which is just the most it's an SRS universe where it's a SRS universe
[01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:58.180]   where you just you're you're you're wonderful little character just wonders around these
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:03.420]   dimensionally brain twisting constructs trying to find your way to the end and you manipulate
[01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:04.980]   those environments to help get out of there.
[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:10.340]   And it's just the best looking, most beautiful sounding iPad game I've played in a long time.
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:13.820]   Yes, Sarah made it her pick of the week on iPad today on our last time.
[01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:18.220]   It's most it's contemplative as a game and the music is beautiful.
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:22.660]   It's just I can't I cannot get the music to play on my iPad.
[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:23.660]   What?
[01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:25.740]   I'm getting no sound whatsoever.
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:26.740]   That's weird.
[01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:28.940]   Stick in the earphones because it sounds so much better with the earphones.
[01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:29.940]   Yeah.
[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:30.940]   It does.
[01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:31.940]   Yeah.
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:32.940]   It's a puzzle game.
[01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:35.060]   It's a special special puzzle game.
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:39.780]   Some people think it's really short, but if you it's upfront price, no in-app purchases,
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:42.700]   no subscription required, and it's delightful for as long as it lasts.
[01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:48.660]   It reminds me a little bit of is that amazing indie game for the PlayStation 3 called Journey,
[01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:51.820]   which was gorgeous had beautiful music that you don't kill anybody.
[01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:54.460]   It's just beautiful.
[01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:59.100]   And it's like there are the part that's a really great point because there are parts
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:04.660]   of this game that involve sort of moving walkways and revolving them sometimes vertically.
[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:08.900]   And the thing is like if your character is on one of those walkways as rotatable, the
[01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:12.940]   handles that you push to make them rotate retract as it's going to go.
[01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:17.700]   No, you cannot rotate this while your person is on it and make her fall and die.
[01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:21.220]   There are other like little like spy versus spy characters that are getting in your way.
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:25.060]   You also can't do anything to hurt these people by manipulating the environment.
[01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:27.780]   It really is just a meditative sort of game.
[01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:29.700]   I'm just really real.
[01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:34.020]   It was responsible for me like I thought I was going to be leaving the house at 11.
[01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:38.460]   I downloaded this thing at 10.30 and I wound up leaving the house at about noon.
[01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:39.460]   It's really upset.
[01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:40.460]   I lost sleep.
[01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:42.140]   It cost me some sleep.
[01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:44.220]   So I'm very pleased.
[01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:51.500]   I was both excited and a little depressed late last night when I saw Adobe release, the
[01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:56.940]   press release that they have finally put out Lightroom on the iPad.
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:00.380]   And by the way, I had to fight to get this my pick because both Andy and Renee wanted
[01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:02.140]   to pick it obviously.
[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:07.180]   The reason I was a little bummed is because we just completed two iPad today yesterday
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:11.460]   and didn't mention it in either of them even though this is a program we've all been waiting
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:12.900]   for for a long time.
[01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:19.140]   So I spent a lot of time in bed last night playing with Lightroom for the iPad and it
[01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:21.660]   is great now.
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:26.860]   It's free but you have to have a copy of Lightroom and you need also to have a subscription
[01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:30.100]   to Lightroom because it uses the creative cloud to sync.
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:34.980]   So you'll have Lightroom on your desktop and what you'll do is make collections.
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:38.380]   If you haven't been using Lightroom's collections features, you're going to have to learn about
[01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:39.380]   it.
[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:44.100]   You do have to update to Lightroom 5.4 but you'll create collections of photos and then in the
[01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:48.020]   process of creating collections or after the fact, you can sync them.
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:51.340]   I gather and maybe one of you guys can help me with this.
[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:58.260]   It uploads a smaller version to the cloud which you can then download to your iPad.
[01:36:58.260 --> 01:37:03.220]   So you've got the picture on your iPad but here's what's interesting.
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:07.100]   There are a lot of gestures by the way that you'll have to learn like the double tap and
[01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:08.620]   the triple tap.
[01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:12.940]   The double tap changes what you see in the view and you can have a histogram of the image.
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:17.340]   You can have the ex-if information of the image and you can have the image itself.
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:20.420]   And it's a good enough, I have to say it's a good enough quality than on a retina iPad.
[01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:24.020]   You don't feel like you're losing anything.
[01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:27.060]   And then you can do things.
[01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:31.020]   So a swipe up flags it, makes it a pick.
[01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:34.580]   A swipe down, rejects it, says don't pick it.
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:38.940]   And that syncs back to your desktop which means you can then have them deleted from your
[01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:42.020]   collection if you want, deleted from your Lightroom if you want.
[01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:43.860]   You can also make changes.
[01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:47.580]   So many of the Lightroom adjustments are here.
[01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:49.220]   A lot of them are here.
[01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:55.460]   I always turn up clarity on my images a little bit so all you have to do is slide the slide.
[01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:57.620]   Oops, let's not reject this photo.
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:38:00.100]   Slide the slider here.
[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:03.740]   And what will happen is I turn up Vibrance often a little bit, give it a little more of
[01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:04.740]   that.
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:06.300]   You can desaturate or saturate.
[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:12.100]   But you also have all the plugins, all the presets or many of the presets that you might
[01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:13.100]   have.
[01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:15.220]   So let's say I want to try this in black and white.
[01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:17.180]   I can do that very easily.
[01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:19.780]   And these will be synced back to desktop.
[01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:22.980]   Oops, that's a little force crash there.
[01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:27.260]   So I'm not going to send the data of that right now.
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:29.660]   But you see it goes right back to where you were.
[01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:37.540]   I have to say I am really excited about this because I think one of the chief ways people
[01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:43.460]   are going to use this, certainly I'm going to use this, is as a way of kind of lean back,
[01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:48.020]   looking at your photos from the day or the week or the trip, rejecting and picking the
[01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:53.460]   ones you want, making the kind of basic modifications you would be making anyway, maybe in something
[01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:55.300]   more serious.
[01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:59.140]   You can, okay, once you do this, you can share these out.
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:03.940]   There's the usual Apple share button.
[01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:09.780]   You can also, if you wish, and it's rather large, they don't recommend it, download full
[01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:12.500]   copies of these images onto your iPad.
[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:16.300]   Then you can do a little slideshow of your images as well.
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:21.460]   And there are slideshow options, so you can set how long the slideshow lasts for the
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:22.980]   kind of transition.
[01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:27.460]   So also a great way, and I think a lot of photographers would use this to show a portfolio
[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:32.060]   to a client or just your slideshow to family and friends.
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:36.100]   I mean, it really is, they've done an, I think, a bang up job of this.
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:37.100]   This is Lightroom.
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:38.820]   It's free for the iPad.
[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:42.260]   Now since you both were going to pick this, I'm sure there are features you'd like to
[01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:45.060]   highlight that I haven't mentioned.
[01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:47.060]   What do you think?
[01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:48.260]   I like it a lot.
[01:39:48.260 --> 01:39:52.700]   The thing I love the most about it is just the simple act of triage, which for me always
[01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:55.260]   works better on an iPad than it does on a desktop.
[01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:56.940]   I don't really know why that is.
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:40:01.740]   But I think it's because, instinctively, I'm just looking this as a beautiful 8x10 style
[01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:04.580]   print, and it either hits me or it does not hit me.
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:08.260]   It's so easy to simply swipe to say, yes, no, no, no, yes, no, no.
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:10.660]   That's exactly what I was doing, and it's so nice.
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:11.660]   Yeah.
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:16.060]   I'm at the point yet where I make adjustments and trust that that's going to be, it's going
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:19.860]   to turn out exactly the way that I anticipate it's going to turn out.
[01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:24.260]   But again, as simply as a way to have some of the power of Lightroom, particularly the
[01:40:24.260 --> 01:40:30.620]   power of having raw files available and editable and just mess around with the bowl.
[01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:35.620]   I was even importing from into iPhoto to the JPEGs just so I could do some of this.
[01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:39.220]   Now you're really working with a synced up Lightroom.
[01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:41.620]   Lightroom is just phenomenal.
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:45.460]   It does also pay off some of the faith that you had by saying, oh man, I can't believe
[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:50.700]   Adobe is not allowing me to own their apps anymore and I have to subscribe to them.
[01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:53.340]   Well, it's kind of OK if the price is right.
[01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:56.740]   Every now and then, oh, by the way, because you've subscribed, here's something beautiful
[01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:57.900]   and it's absolutely free.
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:40:59.500]   Or excuse me, no extra charge.
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:02.180]   I think they've really done a nice job with this.
[01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:03.180]   You're right.
[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:05.140]   There's a there are things that you can do in Lightroom.
[01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:06.140]   You can't do.
[01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:07.140]   You are on a different screen.
[01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:12.500]   And although Apple's taken great care to make the iPad screens pretty accurate, so I think
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:14.780]   you could do some trustworthy editing on here.
[01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:17.780]   They do seem to sync back to the desktop quite well.
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:19.700]   Renee, what was your experience been?
[01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:21.220]   I loved the interface.
[01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:22.220]   I got a chance for them.
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:24.900]   I got a walk through from Adobe on this and I just look.
[01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:27.100]   I didn't like the Photoshop for iOS.
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:28.100]   No, no, that was terrible.
[01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:29.900]   The iPad interface, I thought it was a terrible.
[01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:30.900]   Yeah.
[01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:34.020]   I thought this one, yes, the gestures are, you need to discover the gestures, but once
[01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:36.420]   you do, they're fairly intuitive.
[01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:40.980]   They managed to, I think, very smartly pick the features they moved over to mobile, just
[01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:42.980]   for exactly what you and Andy said.
[01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:45.140]   This is the thing that you're going to do the triage on.
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:49.260]   I've many times had a photo that I needed to use for something, couldn't get to my MacBook
[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:50.660]   or didn't have it with me.
[01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:54.220]   I really would have loved to have been able to do it in Lightroom as opposed to.
[01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:57.860]   I mean, they're a good photo editing programs, but if I can round trip it with Lightroom,
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:00.420]   it saves me so much work.
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:02.820]   And I'm also, I'm a big fan of Creative Cloud.
[01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:03.740]   I have a subscription to it.
[01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:04.740]   I think it's terrific.
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:11.420]   I believe they still have a $9.99 Photoshop in Lightroom subscription, which is a really
[01:42:11.420 --> 01:42:14.180]   great value for photographers.
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:16.860]   And I like that they're becoming very clear Adobe.
[01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:20.540]   For example, Photoshop is going to be focused on designers going forward.
[01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:22.060]   They're really clear about that.
[01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:25.380]   And a lot of the photography heavy lifting is moving to Lightroom and they're making
[01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:26.900]   these companion apps.
[01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:31.940]   And they're really trying to not just service the agenda of Adobe corporate, but make things
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:35.860]   that are better for photographers, designers and other visual professionals.
[01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:36.860]   Yeah.
[01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:39.940]   This is, I mean, it's really nice.
[01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:41.860]   Very elegant, straightforward UI.
[01:42:41.860 --> 01:42:43.740]   I'm extremely happy.
[01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:47.300]   And they say that the low res versions that go to the cloud and go to your iPad will,
[01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:50.260]   the high res versions of your desktop will maintain every single change you made.
[01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:51.260]   Right.
[01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:52.260]   And my experience, that's absolutely true.
[01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:53.260]   Right.
[01:42:53.260 --> 01:42:57.940]   So really what you're sending is a, it's not a bad, and these are all raw images from
[01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:00.260]   my Lightroom DNGs.
[01:43:00.260 --> 01:43:05.540]   But so these are raw images that I don't know if I'm sure I'm working on a JPEG of it.
[01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:06.540]   It's a JPEG.
[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:07.540]   Yeah.
[01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:13.540]   But because of the way Lightroom works, the changes you make are saved separately from
[01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:14.780]   the image.
[01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:19.140]   And so they can be reapplied to the raw image on your desktop once you get it round-tripped.
[01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:21.540]   I think this is just so happy with this.
[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:25.220]   It also clears out the annoying thing where I've done things like Renaissance, where you're
[01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:28.580]   at an event, you need to shoot things and post them immediately.
[01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:30.940]   But you also are collecting images.
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:31.940]   And now, okay, great.
[01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:33.380]   So I've got one copy of this on the card.
[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:35.380]   I've got one copy of this on the iPad.
[01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:37.820]   I think I imported from the card.
[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:40.660]   Now I don't know what copy is the truth of this image.
[01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:45.300]   The ability to simply have it is all on one cloud system and just one expression of it
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:46.300]   at such a life changer.
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:49.740]   I just got, I tell you, I'm going to get through my photos and get them processed a
[01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:51.860]   lot faster than I did before.
[01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:54.660]   I mean, it's just really nice to have this capability.
[01:43:54.660 --> 01:43:56.660]   These are all images from last October.
[01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:59.260]   Then I had never processed.
[01:43:59.260 --> 01:44:02.300]   I'm only catching up, finally going to have a chance to catch up.
[01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:03.820]   So I'm just very happy.
[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:06.940]   Free, but you do have to be a subscriber to the Creative Cloud.
[01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:10.180]   Lightroom and Photoshop together, I think, what, 10 bucks a month?
[01:44:10.180 --> 01:44:11.180]   Yeah, that's fair.
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:12.180]   That's a little bit of...
[01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:14.500]   It's good for a year after that.
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:18.700]   The price goes back up to whatever the current going price is at the time, which you're out
[01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:19.700]   for as far as...
[01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:21.860]   Yeah, I signed up for exactly that reason.
[01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:22.860]   It was not...
[01:44:22.860 --> 01:44:26.500]   When it was first offered, it was a little bit too expensive for a hobbyist like me, but
[01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:30.500]   it was just for 10 bucks for him, I would say.
[01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:31.500]   And Chad has a pick.
[01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:33.500]   Yeah, I was actually going to...
[01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:35.820]   I don't usually mention Mac Heist, but go ahead.
[01:44:35.820 --> 01:44:37.780]   I'm going to let you do it.
[01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:43.260]   The big reason that I wanted to bring up Mac Heist is there's a few very expensive apps
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:46.620]   in here, especially in ScreenFlow is something that I kind of want.
[01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:49.140]   So far, to me, kind of wants us to get up.
[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:50.140]   Love ScreenFlow.
[01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:53.820]   Yeah, so the idea behind Mac Heist is it's very similar to Humble Bundle.
[01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:59.620]   You pay one price and then you get a bundle of apps.
[01:44:59.620 --> 01:45:01.860]   Unlike Humble Bundle, you don't get to choose your own price.
[01:45:01.860 --> 01:45:06.020]   You do have to spend $20, but then you get...
[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:07.020]   What is this?
[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:08.580]   Eight apps, absolutely.
[01:45:08.580 --> 01:45:13.260]   And then there's a ninth app that will be unlocked if enough people get the...
[01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:14.260]   It's only 20 bucks.
[01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:15.260]   It's only $20.
[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:16.260]   It's only $20.
[01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:19.220]   My experience has been I bought a couple of these.
[01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:20.660]   Sometimes you get older versions.
[01:45:20.660 --> 01:45:23.300]   Sometimes you don't have the rights that you would have had if you bought the version.
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:27.260]   Buyer beware a little bit.
[01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:29.300]   These are just controversial when it came out.
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:30.300]   I don't know.
[01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:32.460]   What do you think Renee and Andy, is it all right now?
[01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:35.540]   I have developer friends who absolutely love this idea and I have developer friends who
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:37.300]   absolutely hate this idea.
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:39.860]   There's no agreement that I can find in the market for this.
[01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:41.660]   MacHeist.com.
[01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:42.660]   It is a good deal.
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:43.860]   It's only coming off for eight hours.
[01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:51.100]   And the reason Chad is mentioning is he really wants ScreenFlow and they still need 2,000
[01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:53.900]   people to buy the bundle to unlock it.
[01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:54.900]   Right.
[01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:56.460]   That's your real reason.
[01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:57.460]   It's a selfish reason.
[01:45:57.460 --> 01:45:58.460]   I'm not going to lie.
[01:45:58.460 --> 01:45:59.460]   That's fair.
[01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:02.500]   No, ScreenFlow is great and well worth it from Telestream.
[01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:03.740]   But normally $99.
[01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:06.980]   So I think getting it for 20 bucks would be a good deal.
[01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:08.940]   MacHeist.com.
[01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:11.260]   That's it for Mac Break Weekly.
[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:13.820]   I thank you all for being here, Andy Inaco.
[01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:17.020]   The Chicago Sun Times, Inaco.com.
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:19.100]   Always a pleasure.
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:20.100]   He's muted.
[01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:22.940]   Are you muted?
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:23.940]   Did you mute yourself, Andy?
[01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:24.940]   Did you mute?
[01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:25.940]   There you go.
[01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:26.940]   Sorry.
[01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:27.940]   Sorry.
[01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:28.940]   I just want to mention 4% off.
[01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:33.260]   This week is the conference on World Affairs at the University of Colorado Boulder.
[01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:34.460]   I started on Monday.
[01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:38.260]   I had to stay in town for some family stuff.
[01:46:38.260 --> 01:46:44.260]   I am boarding a plane at 5 a.m. Wednesday morning so I could be at the University of
[01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:47.780]   Colorado at like 10 or 11 a.m. and start doing my panels.
[01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:52.460]   All these panels are really fun, really interesting with some people who are way smarter and more
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:54.100]   articulate than I am.
[01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:55.660]   And it's all open for free to the public.
[01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:59.380]   So if you're in the Boulder area, by all means come by, go to Colorado.edu/cwa.
[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:08.500]   And you'll be able to see the complete lineup of people and the lineup of people.
[01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:12.940]   If you're a comic book fan, C. Willow Wilson, who writes that wonderful Ms. Marvel book,
[01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:13.940]   is also one of the speakers.
[01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:17.060]   I'm doing a panel with her tomorrow late in the afternoon, if they can have another one
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:18.060]   on Thursday.
[01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:22.140]   So the range of people they get for this is just amazing.
[01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:24.540]   Give my best to Henry, my son's there.
[01:47:24.540 --> 01:47:26.580]   And I want to go next year.
[01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:28.860]   Tell him I'm going to go next year.
[01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:30.660]   Your name has been more than put forward.
[01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:32.220]   It's been aggressively promoted as...
[01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:33.220]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:47:33.220 --> 01:47:35.780]   ...would be a valuable addition to the lineup.
[01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:39.660]   Henry said, "If you only spoke there, I would really be cool with my friends."
[01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:42.420]   I'll say, "Andy speaks there.
[01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:43.900]   Tell him you know Andy."
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:45.980]   Boy, that case, forget it.
[01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:47.980]   Rene Ritchie, imore.com.
[01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:49.540]   Great to see you.
[01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:52.540]   I'm sure you'll be here in June for a WWDC.
[01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:53.540]   We'll see you there.
[01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:54.660]   I will absolutely be at WWDC.
[01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:58.340]   And I think most of the stuff that we recorded at Macworld is now finally online.
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:47:59.340]   Oh, good.
[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:05.340]   So if you go to imore.com/macworld2014, we have Don Melton and Matt Drans talking about
[01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:07.300]   a lot of the stuff from the early days of Apple.
[01:48:07.300 --> 01:48:12.100]   We have Pacific Helm Sebastian DeWitt talking about iOS 7, 6 months later.
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:15.580]   And a lot of their hatred has turned into love, which was fantastic to see.
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:17.180]   There was a whole bunch of stuff up there for people to enjoy.
[01:48:17.180 --> 01:48:19.940]   I love it when hatred turns to love.
[01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:20.940]   Thank you, Rene.
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:21.940]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:22.940]   Thank you for being here.
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:25.500]   We do Mac Break Weekly 11am Tuesdays at specific time.
[01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:30.300]   That would be 2pm Eastern Time 1800 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:34.460]   We love it if you watch live, but if you can't, on demand audio and video, always available
[01:48:34.460 --> 01:48:40.020]   after the fact at twit.tv/mbw or wherever you can get your favorite net casts.
[01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:43.180]   We also have Open Studio and we've got four people here, which is nice.
[01:48:43.180 --> 01:48:44.540]   It's great to have you guys.
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:48.500]   If you want to come and watch, you can always be here for almost any of our shows simply
[01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:51.500]   by emailing tickets at twit.tv.
[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:53.860]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:54.860]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:48:54.860 --> 01:48:55.860]   We'll see you next time.
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:57.780]   Now get back to work because break time's over.
[01:48:57.780 --> 01:49:08.620]   [Music]
