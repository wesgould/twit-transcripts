title=MacBreak Weekly 64: Hello Leopard
date=2007

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.920]   From people you trust.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.800]   This is Twit.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.440]   Ban with for Mac Break Weekly is provided by CashFly@CACHEFLY.com.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.000]   This is Mac Break Weekly, Episode 64 for October 30, 2007.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.160]   Hello, Leopard.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.040]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the Leopard Power Edition, and you know I was just thinking
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.880]   that our show notes guy suggested this, that we should probably begin Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:53.160]   As we ended last week with the last speech synthesis from Tiger, we began this week,
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.000]   you guys didn't get a chance to hear it.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.640]   With Alex, he's the guy who did the CashFly announcement.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.040]   Man that synthesizer sounds good.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.520]   Ladies and gentlemen, Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.240]   Hello Andy.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.000]   It's a good day to be in New England sports fan Leo.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.960]   Bad day to think that you can teach the Ross and Red Sox, the Mighty Boss and Red Sox.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.000]   Anything about this great August sport of baseball.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.840]   Well I have to say, I thought you were supposed to wait 80 years between World Series, but
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.840]   I guess okay.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.080]   Well we're doing some deficit spending.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.640]   We're okay with spending the next 160 years without a championship.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.560]   Well that's not bad.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.560]   It's not so awful.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.560]   Anyway, congratulations.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.680]   I still have a little, bleed a little red and white.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.320]   I'm a Red Sox fan from Wayback.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.440]   Let's say I also to Scott Borne, who is of course at the Apple phone show and Girls Gone
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.440]   Geek.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.440]   Scott, good to talk to you.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.440]   I'm still pulling from the Cincinnati Reds.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.440]   I will pull on.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.440]   How'd they do?
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.440]   I'll pull on dude.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.320]   I said Johnny Penn has that sort of fudge hitting technique that will bring us through
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.840]   the National League.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.680]   And I believe on the line with this right now, John Syracuse from ours Technica.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.680]   Hi John.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.680]   Hey, how you doing?
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.680]   It's good to talk to you.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.680]   You too.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.040]   So who were you written for in the World Series?
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.680]   The Yankees.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.680]   He's in New York.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.080]   Yeah, well not the World Series obviously, but I pretty much stopped watching when they
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.080]   lost.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.880]   No Red Sox fan, I suspect there.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.120]   No transplant, I grew up in New York.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.120]   Oh well.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.200]   Yeah, I'm so glad you could join us.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.200]   We haven't met before.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   In fact, we're meeting for the first time right now because I just, John, just a phone
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.360]   and I just sent him an urgent email saying, yes, please call.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.160]   So John did an amazing 4,000 page review of Leopard in ours Technica, the first most detailed
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.800]   review given that Leopard's only been out a few days.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.080]   I don't know when you found time to write that.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.080]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.080]   Over a couple of months.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.880]   I mean, you can write a lot, but the developers just have to frantically revise it when the
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.880]   Gold Master comes out.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.760]   Yeah, you and Andy Inaco both had played with the developer seed and Scott and I eschewed
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.560]   the betas and went right to the release version.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.000]   I, you know, I have to say after listening to Andy and all the troubles he had with the
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.040]   beta, I was expecting lots of problems with Leopard.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.920]   Andy, were you surprised at how smoothly and easily Leopard installed and how well its
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.120]   worked?
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.080]   I was surprised on the two of the three Macs in which it worked great.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.760]   I was not surprised on the one machine that suddenly developed power manager issues.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.120]   But that's sort of par for the course.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.200]   I was just excited that so many bits of the OS that either was, we're just barely starting
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.520]   to work for me a few weeks ago.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.920]   I mean, it's like the blind could see the lame could walk on that other cool test stuff.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.960]   So yeah, I was very, I really was worried about this because usually the OS settles down considerably
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.520]   within like a month, a month and a half, two months before the release.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.080]   With this one, I was still having really big issues just weeks beforehand.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.360]   So I was wondering if they were just going to hold their nose and ship it and then deal
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.520]   with it later.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.440]   But no, it seems as though it seems as though they knew what the problems were and they
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.680]   knew how to fix them and they fixed most of them or most of them that I was having problems
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680]   with that.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.440]   Was that your experience, Sean, having long, long, I actually wrote about that in the review.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.200]   I mean, right up to the very last developer feed, it was like, this is the mess.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   You can't ship this.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   It's horrible.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.520]   And very last developer feed before GM suddenly fixed like everything, you know, at least on
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.520]   my hardware.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.120]   It just, I was, it arrived, I installed it and I said, this could be GM.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.120]   There's nothing wrong with it.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.720]   I mean, it was still only about a couple of weeks before release.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.120]   But you know, right up to that point, it was pretty scary.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.280]   I don't know if the developers he'd be lagging what they were doing inside Apple or they
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.600]   just fixed everything all at once, you know.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.040]   I think they realized that it was going to be shipping the same day that saw for was
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.040]   going to be released.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.640]   It's that or the saw.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.760]   Well now Scott and I had probably partly because of Andy avoided the beta.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.920]   I didn't want to deal with it.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.000]   Scott, you said you didn't want to deal with it.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.440]   We had too many production machines in play to take that chance.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.440]   I sat down.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.320]   I got it from Apple on Thursday, installed it on my MacBook, my MacBook Pro, my new iMac,
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.680]   and my Mac Pro.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.680]   No problems.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.000]   Of course, I wasn't running any hacksies.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.840]   I think the application enhancer from Haxes from Insanity was part of the problem for
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.840]   a lot of people.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.320]   But I was running a lot of software.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.840]   It all works.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.400]   You know, of course my mail act on is no longer working.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.880]   Some of my mail plugins don't work anymore.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.520]   But I'm stunned.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.960]   I mean, this is the smoothest upgrade I've ever done of any operating system.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.160]   And it works flawlessly.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.880]   How's your experience been, Scott?
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.480]   We just put it on one machine, a test machine, which we're going to do some screencast on
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.520]   and all that sort of thing.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.760]   And I will say, Greg Martin, my assistant put it on.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.640]   He said it was absolutely flawless.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.640]   There was no issues.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.080]   Everything that was on the computer continues to work.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.880]   And we've been playing with it a little bit today.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.720]   And it's pretty.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   Playing with it.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.040]   Don't you kind of now feel like, gosh, I really want to put it on the rest of them?
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.160]   No, because see, the problem is we do too much pro audio and video here and the software
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.360]   that we use on the pro side, you have to wait for, you know, like people like Digit Design
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.440]   to give you permission to upgrade.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.440]   If you don't, your stuff literally doesn't work.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.040]   Oh, I have to say, I am so happy with it.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:22.480]   To me, this is a massive improvement, much more so than I even expected.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.040]   John, you wrote, I don't know what, 24 pages?
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.040]   How many?
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.320]   I don't really pages because on the web, it's like one screen full.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.040]   If you were to change it to PDF, I don't know how many pages it would be, but it's
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.040]   like 30,000 words.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.040]   30,000 words.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.040]   That's a pretty long review.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.520]   They've either by the word over there, do they?
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.520]   I wish.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.520]   There's a lot to say.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.200]   I mean, I think there are different schools of thought on leopard and I think maybe that's
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.840]   changed now that it's out, but a lot of people said, "Oh, you know, this is going to be an
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.840]   incremental upgrade."
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.440]   I remember the mac-a-lope saying, "You know, don't get your hopes up so high, guys.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.880]   This is the off-year upgrade that's not going to be such a big deal."
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.520]   I'm not sure that's quite true.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.400]   Can you summarize, John, your feeling about this?
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.200]   Is this a must-have upgrade, a major upgrade?
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.520]   Well, I mean, it's not how I think it was going to be incremental because it's been
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.880]   two and a half years, the longest gap between versions.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.880]   So obviously it's going to be something big.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.520]   Just as it turns out, the big stuff is all kind of under the covers.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.800]   There's not a part of the system underneath that hasn't been revived, added to improved
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   and so on.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.120]   Of course, what you see is the pictures on the back of the box, time machine, the windows
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.600]   look a little bit different, crazy doc stuff, translucent menus, but that's really surface
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.600]   stuff.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.440]   The real upgrade of the operating system happened under the covers and it's going to provide
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.680]   for the ability to make better, more interesting applications with less code.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.280]   I think that's the reason to upgrade.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.400]   The reason to upgrade is because soon you want to be able to run all this leopard-only
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.320]   software that will be coming out because it's so much nicer to write applications for a
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.320]   leopard.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.960]   Yeah, your reviews start, you know, really the bulk of your review is the kernel 64-bit
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.880]   FS events, core animation, core GL, core UI.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.880]   I mean, it really is about all of this new stuff.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.600]   Is it all cocoa now?
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.520]   No, the carbon is still there.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.960]   You know, the carbon is basically been end of life to saying we're not going to bring
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.360]   carbon into 64-bit, which is a nice way of saying say goodbye to carbon eventually,
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.480]   obviously, it's going to be a long, long time before every single application is 64-bit,
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.880]   but by not bringing carbon along and saying we're not going to add more features to carbon
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.840]   anymore, just we're going to support it, we'll fix bugs in it, but it's not growing anymore,
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.960]   flying our carbon.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.840]   And Finder is now, is Finder now all cocoa all 64-bit?
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.840]   No, no, still carbon.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.840]   Still 32-bit.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.880]   It does feel snappier.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.880]   Maybe that's just...
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.400]   They improved it, but still, I mean, carbon's going to be around for a long time.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.960]   It's just kind of one of these long-term decisions where the signal to developers, you know.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:43.600]   Andy, Enoco, your kind of overall feelings?
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.080]   Is this the major upgrade that John's saying or incremental?
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.400]   Well, no, I definitely agree that most of the real octane in this OS is under the hood.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.200]   It's going to be seen next year when everybody, all the developers start taking advantage
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.240]   of all these new frameworks and all these new technologies that are in leopard.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:08.600]   In terms of individual features that users are going to get their hands on, I don't think
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:13.720]   there are a whole lot of really holistic, system-wide things that are really, really
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.720]   awesome.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.240]   It's more like a theme park where, so long as there are two or three rides that you absolutely
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.440]   love, it doesn't matter that you don't care about the spinning teacups as long as you
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.200]   have the Matterhorn to go to.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.640]   And I think for everybody, I mean, for me, the things they've done to the Finder with
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:33.160]   Quick Look and Cover Flow, I really want to see, so many things I agree with John.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:38.360]   Page after page, my reaction kept pinging between my God, I had no idea it worked that
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.200]   way and my God, he's absolutely right.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.600]   I have agreed with that since day one.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:50.920]   And so the way that the totally lost my train of thought because I wanted to compliment
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.160]   John on this absolutely wonderful kickass too.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.160]   I'm an idiot.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.160]   You fool.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.160]   I think we're waiting.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.160]   We're waiting.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.160]   We're waiting.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:06.240]   I think where I was going with this is that I really wish that Cover Flow were available
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.920]   in every single standard open and closed dialogue box.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:14.080]   I really wish that Quick Look were available everywhere, not just in selected places because
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:22.160]   it is so natural and so correct and so right that every application that I use in Leppard,
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:27.080]   I find myself just naturally looking for a button that says, "Where's my preview?"
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.080]   Exactly.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.080]   Like, is this a document I want?
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.440]   Well, I can just simply click on this button and preview it.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.680]   It does work remarkably well.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.480]   I do wish that they had a column view underneath instead of the list view or at least you got
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.960]   the choice of what you had underneath it.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.960]   And I agree with you, it should be in the file browser.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.960]   Oh, no, I remember.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:44.960]   Now, I remember.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:50.200]   I remember I was going to say, I really have been waiting for the Finder is ripe for revolution.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.120]   The Finder is the last Tsar.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.680]   The Finder is Marie Antoinette.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.240]   It is just sitting there waiting for peasants to come and boot them out and replace with
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.160]   something that will let them stay here right now.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.160]   It won't die.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.000]   Yeah, I mean, he Mephelia.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   I forgot.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.720]   I think the carbon and fiber is the hemophilia in this bloodline.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.720]   Right.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.360]   But so I was hoping for something revolutionary, but I'll take the few little tweaks they've
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.160]   given it because they are just so big and so wonderful.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.880]   And also back to my Mac, I've that was the there was only one feature in throughout the
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.040]   only one feature that I really, really wish I could use in every single computer that
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.040]   I own.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.400]   And that's just the simple idea of, look, I know that there are tubes connecting this
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.400]   computer with every other computer.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.840]   Surely, Mr. Internet, you're smarter than I am.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.600]   You can figure out where my computer is in this world and you can find a way to connect
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.800]   where I am right now to where that computer is.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.400]   And now Apple has done that for me.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.400]   Awesome.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.800]   So the little quibbles about back to my Mac, that's what you're talking about, of course,
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:58.080]   is first of all, you have to turn on universal plug and play on your router or that the router
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:03.200]   has to support that PMP, both of which are potential security issues.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.080]   They make me a little bit nervous.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:12.400]   On the other hand, you know, you do get this amazing, easy to use connection between computers.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.480]   And I'm very impressed with the speed of the desktop sharing.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.480]   It really works well.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:23.520]   I played with my kids because the first time I used this, I had the Mac and the living room
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.840]   set up and I was in the bedroom on my Mac and I took control of the Mac in the living
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.360]   room and had Alex start saying things like, "Who am I?
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.880]   What am I doing here?
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.520]   I am suddenly awake."
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.560]   And it fooled them for about three seconds.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.360]   And then they started typing back, "Dad, you're a nerd.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.360]   Stop."
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.360]   But it was fun.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.480]   Leah, one thing I want to know, though, is, you know, there's a lot of excitement right
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.480]   after the iPhone.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.480]   Then the bloom came off the rose and people started picking it apart.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.800]   How long before we see that here when people start saying, "Well, this doesn't really
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.160]   go there like it should."
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:00.800]   And I mean, I see a lot of hoopla today, but I think that the comment I heard so far
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.680]   that it makes me, that resonates with me the most, is that we'll see more of the value
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.760]   of Leopard next year once we start to see apps that really take advantage of all this.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.720]   And there are little things that I start to notice that, you know, that have changed
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.720]   that I miss.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:20.920]   But I can't figure out why they took the info panel out of iCal.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.480]   It just baffles me.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.040]   It really is a mistake as far as I could tell.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.080]   You have to hit Command-i on an appointment to see the details of it.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.880]   They took out the transitions in front row.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.760]   That's not the end of the world, but it's odd that they removed some of these things.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:40.640]   On the plus side, Apple told me that the quick look functionality is easily extensible.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.440]   So in a way, it's like a spotlight extension.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:49.520]   So when a developer writes a new file format, they can release a plugin for Quick Look that
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.520]   will make it work.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.160]   So it's pretty much ensured that you'll be able to quick look into almost any kind of
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.840]   document, which is, I think, really great.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.480]   Hit that spacebar when you're in the Finder to look at the thing.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.800]   Some people don't know that you can do that.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.800]   It's just really cool.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.240]   I do think it's curious, though.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.960]   I'm wondering if there was a technical reason why they just didn't simply amend the standard
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:15.120]   open-filed dialog box to just put that button inside every single dialog box.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.840]   Why they didn't click look in every box.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.160]   That's the age-old question of should open-save dialog box even exist?
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.520]   Or should it simply be like the Finder in another incarnation?
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.840]   That question has been going on for a decade now.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.160]   Why is there this other way to get it filed that's specific to the application.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.480]   It's in this little window and it's been adding features to it.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.800]   But the bottom line is that it's duplication of efforts.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.760]   Your task is to find a file and open it.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.800]   And when you do it from within an application, you use this different-looking interface of
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.480]   those and have all the same features as the Finder.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.000]   You could file a bug and say, "Oh, I want a quick look in there."
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.880]   You eventually end up duplicating the whole Finder in this little window.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:49.880]   That's okay.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.880]   I got a 200 gig hard drive.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.880]   I bet that I-
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.880]   I don't know about memory.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.880]   I'm talking about programmer effort debugging.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.880]   I don't know.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.160]   First of all, I don't care about the effort that other programs are.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.160]   That's their problem.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.160]   That's their problem.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.600]   I'm saying for my own perspective.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:12.520]   This is one of those really interesting user interface questions because I find it difficult
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:19.200]   to get my head around the concept of not having a standard file open box.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.200]   If I hit command O to open a document in Word, what would happen if I did not have that?
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.200]   Right.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   That's why they haven't done it because it's a hard problem.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.120]   Obviously, you don't chuck them back to the Finder in some sort of strange mode.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.360]   You have to give them something.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.040]   But from an implementation perspective, you want that to essentially be a componentized
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.040]   version of the Finder.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.360]   With the Finder with the reusable component that you can make appear in any application.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.880]   Or at least quick look.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.880]   At least quick look.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.880]   We need to open up.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.880]   That is a great feature.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.040]   Believe it or not, I find my- I can spend like 45 minutes just in cover flow and quick
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.240]   look because it's so much-
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.780]   It was productivity boost.
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:53.780]   Yes, it was.
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:58.360]   Well, it's not just that it's just that you know, I don't really- how much time I'm going
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:03.520]   to spend looking at the credit screen for an application that I didn't need to actually
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.520]   launch.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.760]   Really, I just want to see what's on page four of this.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.760]   Right.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.760]   And then I need to go home.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.760]   Right.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.120]   No, it's immensely useful.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.080]   I just like going back through old documents and reading them.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.880]   It's really fun.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:22.000]   With every single new update, they keep sticking it to anybody whose primary impulse is to
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.320]   organize their stuff and do what they've been taught to do since like their age eight.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.000]   They put folder clothes neatly, hang them up, nicely in the closet.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.320]   The people who just tossed things in one big pile with release after release, Apple keeps
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.840]   rewarding them with smart folders, with a cover flow, with quick look.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.360]   It's like, "No, bother it.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.360]   I organize."
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.360]   Ah.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.240]   You see, we were right all along.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.240]   That's messy, folks.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.760]   Let's talk a little bit.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.320]   You spent quite a few words on file system events, John.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.280]   And I found this very interesting FS events.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.480]   This is one of those under the hood things that people may not be aware of but could
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.360]   make a big difference in how the operating system works.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.360]   What are FS events?
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:06.640]   Well, I mean, the basic problem is you want to ask a question like, you know, what has
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.480]   changed in this file system since the last time I asked.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.560]   And if you have a 500 gig drive, that's a really expensive question to ask if you have
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.560]   to say, "Oh, I don't know.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.120]   Let me go look at every single file on your desk and tell you which files have changed
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.560]   since the last time you asked."
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.560]   That's not feasible.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.560]   Time machine to do it all the time.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.120]   Time machine constantly to say, "What do I need to back up?
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.320]   What have you changed since the last time I made a backup?"
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.800]   FS events is simply a way to efficiently provide that answer without having to grow up over
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.800]   your entire hard drive.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.800]   And what are the benefits?
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.800]   Well, obviously the benefits.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.800]   Where are we seeing this?
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.800]   Is this one of the...
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.440]   I mean, I noticed Spotlight is much faster.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.240]   Is this one of the reasons Spotlight is so much easier?
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.480]   No, Spotlight is faster because they rewrote parts of it.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.200]   They really needed to rewrite Spotlight.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.880]   I actually turned it off in Tiger and I know he's in that.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.880]   It was such a huge difference.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.880]   Spotlight uses essentially the fire hose version of the FS events.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.960]   FS events is a public API that gives you sort of a less granular answer.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.760]   Spotlight uses the DevS F/F events which gives you every single event as it happens in real
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.760]   time.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.760]   And that's not a public API.
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.760]   Spotlight is always used.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.760]   Spotlight is faster because they rephile the way it does indexing and other things like
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.760]   that.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.880]   But I mean, FS events is for application, people third party application.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.480]   Now they can ask this question before they couldn't even ask it.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.480]   It was completely unfeasible.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.800]   You couldn't do anything at third party application that relied on answer to that question coming
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.480]   back without destroying the guy this by thrashing to death.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.320]   Well, you'd see the beach ball forever.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.920]   Now suddenly that's something that you can do and it's efficient.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.400]   So it opens up this whole new avenue of interesting things that you can do in application, new
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.760]   application that you can write.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:35.680]   It's a big deal for developers who never needed to do anything having to do with a
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.680]   file system.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.960]   I asked Apple about ZFS.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:43.160]   This is the Sun file system that was rumored to be, I think it was Sun that announced it
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.680]   was going to be part of OS 10.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.680]   Oops.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.160]   Apple told me, well, we do have a plugin that will read ZFS.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.840]   There's a developer read write plugin, but it's not going to be one of the choices for
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.840]   file systems.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:57.840]   You talk a little bit about this.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.240]   You think ZFS may be something in the future for Apple?
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:06.440]   Well, I mean, the thing that's lurking out there is HFS Plus is old and kind of creaky.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.600]   And so, you know, what kind of play is this?
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.600]   Eventually, I mean, it's not terrible.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.600]   It's not the end of the world.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.400]   But eventually you got to kind of say, you know, everyone else is moving on.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.200]   We still get HFS Plus, what replaces it?
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.680]   And VFS looks like one of the candidates for a replacement.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.600]   You can do a lot of interesting things with VFS.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.840]   Provides better data integrity.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.640]   You could implement time machine even more efficiently by only backing up the individual
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.800]   disk blocks that change rather than updating and backing up an entire file in just one
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.800]   little byte of it changes.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.800]   That would do that.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.200]   So, all that would be possible with VFS.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.640]   But, you know, like I said, it's not for 10.5.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.320]   So, the question of what will replace HFS Plus continues to be out there waiting for,
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.120]   I guess, 10.6.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.960]   Time machine, which is the flashiest of the new features, is really backup for mom.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.000]   That's not something probably a lot of people will use, particularly since you really want
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.840]   to buy or somehow acquire a second external hard drive that's even bigger than your internal
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.840]   hard drive to use it.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.840]   Well, that's not necessary.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.840]   I'm sorry, go ahead, John.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.840]   You think that's not something a lot of people will use?
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.280]   I think it's the only thing a lot of people.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.280]   Really?
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.280]   People who don't back up.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.120]   I mean, I think they're better backup solutions.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.680]   Everyone who doesn't back up, I'm assuming, has someone in their life who knows that they
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.680]   should back up.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.680]   Right.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.680]   And they find out that they get time to do it.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:21.400]   Now you can back up, just buy a hard drive, plug it into your computer and click OK and
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.560]   they can do that.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.520]   I hate, I mean, I'm the one who's always saying, and that's not really a good backup
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.320]   because if there's a fire, you've lost everything anyway.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.840]   Well, baby steps.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.760]   It's, yeah, I guess it's better than no backup.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.760]   Much better than no backup.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.320]   Yeah, and I turned it on on our family machine because what this is great for is kids who
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:43.520]   accidentally delete their homework and they can always go back in time and get it or delete
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.600]   songs or albums and so forth.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.280]   I don't know, Andy, you like it?
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.680]   I don't like it because I'm probably not the sort of person's up for you.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.960]   Time machine is designed for.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.240]   I'm exactly with you.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:00.000]   I use super duper and every time I think of a new way that makes more sense to modify
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.680]   the way I back things up, super duper less than we do it.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:08.320]   Right now, every night, I happen to dock my iPod to my back every single night, you
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.200]   know, to charge it and to sync it up.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.160]   And so I simply said, well, geez, I've got 60 gigs free on that device.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:18.680]   I just simply have it automatically back up all my important files to the iPod because
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.840]   sometimes my external hardware, the big one, isn't attached.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:26.880]   So essentially the long story short, super duper is making three or four different backups
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.840]   and three or four different places as the opportunity arises.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.080]   And if I forget to plug in my iPod, it doesn't care.
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:39.880]   However, time machine, I start to get my head around it when they, if I start to imagine
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:44.720]   them calling it I back up because if you imagine it as an I app where iPod was not designed
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.960]   for people who really know what they're doing, it's designed for people who absolutely can't
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.760]   be bothered with photography and with editing pictures and it gives them the ability to
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.400]   do that.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.720]   And it turns out that it's a little, it's clunkier, but it is more flexible than the
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.040]   demos make it believe you can.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:05.080]   If you just want to back up your documents folder, you can just back up your documents
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.080]   folder.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.720]   Like 20 gigs available on an external drive, you can just time machine once one folder
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.960]   or just one specific account.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.120]   You can use network drives.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.920]   It really is painful that you can't create a bootable backup like you can with super
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.920]   duper.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.160]   I mean, I've had problems with hard drive before where it's like, look, I know this is
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.360]   a problem, but I've got a deadline and an hour and a half.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.240]   I just want to be word processing again.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.800]   Super duper, let's me do that in five minutes with time machine.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:36.040]   I'd have to find where I put my DVD, my install DVD, boot off the DVD and then do a restore
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.400]   from the DVD and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:43.240]   There's one thing for sure is that it will be the most demoed feature of the left.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.400]   It's an awesome demo.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.800]   I'm just not sure how many power often I need to rewind and get back a file that I deleted.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.840]   I don't think it's aimed at the Andy and not because of the world.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.760]   Or me, that's a nice one.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.040]   I'm going to end up using super duper and time machine.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.600]   Perhaps the way it's the hardest, but the two things are totally different.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.520]   I'm a group with you entirely super duper.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.600]   I've been using it for a long time now.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.680]   It's great for that quick recovery, but on the other hand, it doesn't keep history of
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.000]   your files and everyone's in a while.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   I like that.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.760]   This is for this is for an Fae.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.760]   It is for an Fae.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:18.120]   This is for an Fae and for the millions of people who don't back up squat.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.600]   And know nothing about it and don't want to care about it.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:26.520]   And I guarantee you many of the initial, I mean, do we remember the first iteration
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.520]   of backup?
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.520]   It was horrible.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.520]   It's still horrible.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.920]   But I mean, it was really horrible.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.600]   I like I like backup a lot.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.600]   You use it?
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:40.400]   I mean, there are nine other people that do can enjoy it, but this is so much better.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.280]   Well, I like the idea of simply saying, what do I want to back up?
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.280]   I want my documents.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.960]   I want my iTunes store purchases and I want new photos and dang it with backup.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.920]   You can simply say, yes, back up my documents, my iTunes purchases and my new photos.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.600]   Not my nude photos, my new photos.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.600]   Very much.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.760]   Was that got some to do with last week's discussion on modeling fees, Andy?
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.520]   I could just download those from the used groups, just like everybody else.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:08.840]   But I think backup is, again, it's not an ambitious program, but for what it's designed
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.320]   to do, I think it does it rather well.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:16.040]   I'm glad that there is a diversity of backup solutions and I'm glad that there is a really
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:21.280]   the best features of time machine for me is this is that simple dialogue box that comes
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.800]   up that says, hi, I notice you've connected up an external hard drive.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.960]   Do you want me to use that for backups from now on?
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.280]   Just click this button and that's the last thing you ever have to do.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.280]   I'm waiting.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.280]   We'll see.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:36.320]   We're going to hear some pain from this down the road when people realize you, you know,
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.240]   first of all, it runs out of space pretty quickly.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.920]   Well, that doesn't run out of space so much as it simply.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.640]   Start deleting the old backups.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.640]   Exactly.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.560]   You basically, you wanted to time ends at this point.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.560]   Please do not go backward.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.560]   No, pass.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.960]   You know, I just like the old days.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.520]   Remember we had the old Bernoulli drives?
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.560]   I mean, you run out of Ramon.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.560]   Any drive.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.960]   I love those fries because they really made you feel like you were backing up.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.960]   Yes.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.920]   It made you feel as though your data was really, really secure.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.920]   And they look like those machines in Doctor Strange love, right?
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:15.320]   Well, I mean, you know, so time machine is the kind of thing that the unwashed masses
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.520]   will get excited about.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.720]   They will demo.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.880]   It might sell some leopards.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.600]   What do you think is the feature?
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.760]   I'll start with you, John Serk.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:28.720]   You said that the advanced user is going to go get most excited about.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.720]   How advanced is advanced?
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.760]   Is it someone who knows anything about the development process or is it just a user?
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.400]   Let's say power user, then we'll talk about developer.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.400]   Power users, too.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:43.360]   I would imagine a power user, if he gets this point in the demo, is going to try connecting
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:48.400]   to network servers and find out that it's no longer painfully ballerific.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.320]   One thing to do is say, this will change my life on a daily basis.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:56.520]   And for this reason alone, for me, the power user, it's worthwhile for me to get this just
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.840]   so I don't have to stare at that beach ball.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.840]   No.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.720]   And when I can open my NAS with one click and see everything that's on it, it just makes
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.040]   me happy and with cover flow and quick click.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.880]   How about you, Annie, the power user?
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.280]   What power user feature do you think is most exciting?
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.840]   I really think it's going to be back to my Mac.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.720]   Just the simple idea of wherever I am in the world, I can now connect back to my home
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:22.080]   Mac because that's a feature that you can exploit in a million different ways.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.720]   I can think of so many different automated actions that would have been impossible without
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:32.000]   this feature unless I had a static IP address back at home that now.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.480]   If I want to suddenly see what's going on in my office, I don't have to download a special
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.400]   web security app.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:44.800]   I can simply go back to my Mac and then simply write an automated action that simply puts
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.200]   stuff on a local web server and then access the web server.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.200]   Easy.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.880]   Or even better, just open up the screen itself and just simply turn on the camera and see
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.880]   what's in there.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:57.160]   Is it VNC or is it just VNC compatible?
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.160]   I'm told that it's actual VNC.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:03.000]   I mean, the user's IPsec, that's the many different kinds of VNC.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.200]   It does use IPsec and it's inside it's IPV6.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:10.080]   It's, you know, all buzzword compliant, but I'm just wondering because they use the word
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.080]   VNC.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.160]   I was wondering if they use the code from VNC.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:17.320]   Apple does have a list on its website of compatible VNC apps.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:22.600]   So it's not just a leopard-only feature.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.680]   It's not even just a Mac-only feature.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.840]   It's a standard party kind of work.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.360]   And it is a VPN in the sense that you could, because it's IPsec, you could use it as a
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:38.480]   secure tunnel back to your Mac at home and surf there securely, which is great.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.800]   That's something that also seems sort of odd to me.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.640]   That it seemed like as you're developing this feature, you think, well, geez, we're building
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:50.160]   this secure tunnel back to the computer, why don't we just simply make this into a VPN
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:56.200]   so that I don't have to launch Firefox from my home Mac 4000 miles away to be assured that
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.560]   I can use this open WiFi access point here and here in San Diego.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.360]   And what if I specifically doesn't work with ICS, you can't use internet connection sharing
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.360]   with you.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:09.240]   So when you can, again, go back to your Mac and then simply launch Firefox, you know,
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:14.440]   back in Boston when you're sitting in San Diego, but it just seems like, guys, Rube Goldberg,
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.000]   move eight steps, you'll have something really awesome.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.880]   John, do you know of any plans to do something like that?
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.240]   I mean, you got to say something for 10.6, right?
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.600]   You can't, I mean, if you think about what they had to do to get back to the Mac to work
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.000]   right, you know, everything has to do on a server side and everything, you just want
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.120]   to get something working and out the door.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.400]   And I think like hanging fruit is screen sharing and making your Mac show up in the sidebar.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.040]   So that's kind of like, let's go that the work.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.040]   This is our first release.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.920]   And you don't want to invite off too much.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.920]   It works pretty spectacularly.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.440]   I mean, I have to say, it's a pretty darn impressive program.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.440]   And it's, and by the way, it's fairly speedy.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.440]   I mean, of course on land, it's totally usable on land.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:58.920]   It's even on my airport extreme, you know, Wi-Fi G, it runs at pretty much full speed.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.480]   It's very, very slick.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.560]   I haven't tried it over the internet.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:02.960]   Have you tried it over the internet, Andy?
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.400]   I've tried it over the internet and it's actually very, very credible.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.800]   You definitely won't be fooled into thinking that you're running an application locally.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.040]   But it is very, very, very, very usable.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.040]   There are multiple settings.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.800]   You can tell it, you can tell it whether you want it to be more responsive or whether you
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.200]   want it to be more, more detailed.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.320]   But again, I was doing word processing from, well, from 50 miles away, but 50 miles as
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:31.360]   good as 5,000 through a crummy, you know, bakery, cafe, free open Wi-Fi.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.960]   And it was very, very credible.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.960]   I use incredible.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.960]   I would use.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.960]   Yeah, amazing.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.960]   Hey, are you still using Firefox though?
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.960]   You haven't, you haven't.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.120]   Safari 3 seems so much faster than Firefox now.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.920]   I kind of tempted not to use Firefox.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.560]   I'm just, well, the thing is my world is already in Firefox.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.040]   I know all those extensions.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:53.560]   It's not the, well, not even for me for extensions, just the simple fact that I've got my website
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.560]   URLs.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.560]   I've got my personal web server stuff in a bookmark there.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.800]   I've got my blog line stuff.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:04.680]   I've got my automatic post to delicious automatic post to this, that, and the other.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.680]   And I know that's easy to transfer over to Safari.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.440]   Safari was not an application that.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.440]   Awesomely impressed me as being a wonderfully new thing.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.560]   I know that's, I know that it's theoretically faster.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:20.080]   I know that they've beeped up the security and they've closed, closed up some holes.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.480]   And the clipping feature, I would enjoy that if not for the fact that it forces me to go
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.160]   into dashboard actually to actually use the clipping.
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.400]   I'm sure that it's some, just like, just like with, just like with Safari on most of
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.960]   my desktops, I will have both of them open at the same time.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:38.800]   I find that because my default browser is set to Safari, again, for no particular reason,
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.200]   I'll click a link and an email and I'll open Safari and I find myself over the course of
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.680]   the week using both browsers just interchangeably, not really caring what window I'm clicking
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.680]   into.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.080]   Leo, you want to know my advanced feature?
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.080]   Word of the day screen saver.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.280]   I haven't seen that yet.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.280]   I'll have to check it out.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.280]   Because it's up to five words, five new words.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.960]   And I, you know, I think that's pretty advanced.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.120]   The new dictionary is good.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.120]   It uses Wikipedia.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.960]   I kind of like that.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.200]   And by the way, if second choice would be the shell screen saver, I have new colors.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.880]   I clearly have not played with the screen savers yet.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.520]   I get into the deep stuff.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.440]   You guys, you know, you're up here at the surface.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.080]   I get down there where it matters.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.080]   Okay.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.680]   John's talking about journaling in ZFS.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.160]   I'm talking about, well, now you can have an RSS feed as a widget.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.720]   It's awesome.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.200]   Let me ask John for the developer what will be the most interesting.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.280]   Oh, there's so much to the developer.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.280]   It's a lot of it.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.400]   It's kind of painful because as a developer, as you learn about this release, you know,
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:39.080]   with the years of the very sea, you realize you started to dread the fact that you have
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.520]   to continue to support Tiger and earlier.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.320]   Everything is so much easier.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.320]   Every framework is improved.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.240]   There's a new framework that I do so much.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.080]   You can eliminate so many lines of code.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.440]   You have these things that you just get for free that you can throw into your application.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:55.000]   New views, core animation, you know, it's just unbelievable.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.520]   And then you just, I can imagine the thinking feeling, oh, we have to support Tiger for
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:01.280]   the first year of your whole future because not everyone's going to upgrade to Leppard,
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.440]   but Leppard is fantastic for developers.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.560]   Please, everybody, upgrade to Leppard so we don't have to support Tiger in the future.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.660]   Yeah, I mean, that's what if every developer got their way, they would snap their fingers
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:12.520]   and force everyone to use Leppard.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:18.240]   You talk, I mean, I, I, I, I, okay, let me ask Andy and then we'll get back to you because
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.240]   there's so much in your review.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.560]   Andy, what was, what is the developer feature of the moment that you think developers will
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.560]   get?
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.560]   We'll slather over.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:31.800]   I'm going to, I'm going to stick to back to my Mac and, and, and, and, they'll start developing
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   for that.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:37.120]   Well, because again, it, I'm, I'm thinking broader view and actually I'm thinking more
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:42.480]   about Apple, Apple and house developers because there are some features where you just wind
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:46.400]   up sitting back with, you know, with your mug of cocoa and just thinking about what this
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.720]   new feature implies.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:55.960]   And the basic theme of this feature is that it is easy to project resources from your
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.080]   home Mac to let's not even call the Macintosh.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.480]   Let's call them to devices that you have out in the real world.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.680]   And now I have an iPhone that has Wi-Fi built in.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:11.600]   And now geez, Apple's buying lots of lots of RAM up there and there's this rumors of having
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.200]   these nice slim tablets and slim Macs.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.640]   What if, and this is boy underscore and boldface and put all those really nasty HTML flat
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.840]   1.0 flashy, annoying things to highlight this?
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.780]   What if this is infrastructure for cool things that are going to happen in 2008?
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:31.840]   Because if this, if doing this sort of thing is easy, then a whole bunch of different hardware
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.840]   and a whole bunch of different third party software also becomes very, very easy.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:41.000]   Again, just as, I mean, John was absolutely was had it really right on the money when he
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.520]   was talking about the developer stuff in his, in his review, because man, I launched, I
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:49.920]   loaded up Xcode and I started just seeing, well geez, how difficult is it going to be
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.480]   for me to add this feature to this totally Apple script based application that I have.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:59.040]   And suddenly I've got Windows doing really cool animation and layers and transitions.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:03.920]   And now I've got things of things that I couldn't do via a network, my blogging application.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:08.000]   So many things I did not want to do because if I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.640]   teched it out and figured out that I would have to spend two weeks adding new infrastructure
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.320]   to get this sort of broad based networking on it.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.320]   Now it's trivial.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:20.240]   It's like three lines if that, and if that's just to correct bad mistakes that I was making
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.160]   and doing things in a non standard way before.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.680]   Scott's not too far off when he's talking about the screen savers.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:28.120]   In fact, you said this yourself, John, you said the animation age begins.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:31.600]   We're going to start to see all sorts of, because of core animation, all sorts of animation
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.760]   in every part of the computer.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.760]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:39.240]   I mean, they made it so, they made it so easy to do something that was previously such
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:40.240]   a pain.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.320]   Like the reason only Apple's application had that extra polish is because they had like
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:47.000]   the open jail guys and the core graphics guys who could program, you know, these fancy
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.120]   transitions and no, that's not your area of expertise.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.800]   If you're a developer developing some other kind of application, you don't want to learn
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.800]   graphics API.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.800]   You don't want to learn open jail.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.080]   You don't even know what open jail is.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.320]   Like I'm writing, you know, a text editor.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.720]   I don't care about open jail, but you want it to look cool.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.160]   Like, you know, Apple's cool transition.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.880]   So you'd spend the time and it was just a waste of time and energy and, you know, now
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:06.880]   they've got core animation.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.360]   So look, we know you want to look cool.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.120]   You know you want to look slick, but you don't want to learn any of this complicated stuff.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.440]   Here's an easy way to do it.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.880]   So how does it relate to quartz?
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:18.240]   I mean, for us, when I look at Shell, the screensaver, Scott Likes or Arabesque, which
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:23.840]   they're clearly quartz screensavers, how does core animation relate to quartz?
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.880]   Well, quartz is the umbrella name for all sort of screen drawing and Mac OS 10.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.680]   Core animation is a framework of quartz.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:36.160]   Core animation is a framework in cocoa that takes advantage of quartz.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:41.360]   So basically the big feature of it is that it has all these abstractions for animation
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.520]   for things that are animated, for these layers that are animated.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.520]   But anything you want on a layer, and here's the simple way to make it animate.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:52.360]   And what they've done in cocoa is take all the things that you can do that are conceivably
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:56.080]   animatable, moving something, resizing something, making something appear, making something
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.680]   disappear, and where something is basically anything in the entire framework.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.440]   And I said, oh, all those things that you can do, now you can make them appear as an
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.160]   animation instead of instantly going from one state to the other.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.160]   And you can do it easily.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:11.720]   So underneath that's using quartz, using OpenGL, using core graphics, but you never
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.720]   need to know that.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:17.160]   You just need to say, yeah, before I was moving this window, now when I move the window, please
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.560]   make it animated from point A to point B instead of just moving instantly.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:24.240]   And that's why I feel great for developers because it removes the burden of having to
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.240]   learn that though.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.240]   Right.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.880]   Leo, you want to know my developers, please?
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.720]   It's the Danish spell checker.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.840]   You have a Danish girlfriend you haven't told us about?
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.120]   No, but I mean, the developers have been clamoring for a Danish spell checker.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.120]   I happen to know too.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:44.120]   Who are Danish who wanted to say, you know, they were, they were just tired of not having
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.600]   a Danish spell checker.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.760]   Thank God.
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:51.720]   You know, I noticed that getting back to something, go ahead, Annie, I'll get to my
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.560]   house going to make us more to ask for market.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.200]   I'm glad I didn't make because it was.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.960]   And Randy, by the way, there's Russian localization in where Russian localization in where you
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.960]   can do.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.680]   Oh, West 10 leopard is fully localized in the Russian language.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.680]   And we all know that.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.680]   Even better.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.960]   Like I said, last week, it has a not go localization.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.560]   It pronounces my last name correctly.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.160]   When you use that, go.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.000]   Alex does a not go right.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Wow.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   I'm going to have to.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Did you try?
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   Did you try your name, Leo?
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   I'm sure it does my name wrong.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.480]   I tried my name and it improves.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.560]   Does not get it right, but it's an improvement.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.560]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.560]   All right.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.560]   Well, let me launch stickies here.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.560]   Okay.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.560]   I'm going to try John.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:30.560]   Sarah.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.560]   How could it not pronounce your name?
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.560]   Sarah Qsa is how you pronounce it.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.560]   Sarah Qsa.
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:34.560]   I guessed right.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.880]   Alex guesses on John Sarah Qsa.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:38.880]   John Syracuse.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.880]   Cuse.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:40.880]   Cuse.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.880]   That's quite good.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.080]   If you tried in Tiger, you'll see the big difference.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.880]   Does it call me borny?
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.880]   I don't know.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.880]   Let me do Andy first.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.320]   It's I H N A T K O right?
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:55.000]   Andy, I always can't remember where that I know there's a stray H floating through your
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.280]   name, but I can never remember exactly where.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.280]   Is that right?
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.760]   I H N gypsy blood.
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.760]   Good wonders.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.760]   I H N A T K O correct.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.760]   All right.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.760]   Let's see.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.760]   That's pretty good.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.680]   That's really good.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.080]   Let's see Scott boy.
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.080]   This is silly.
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.080]   I'm wasting your time here.
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.240]   This is the kind of thing that really this is what really people care about in operating
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.400]   systems.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.000]   These are the important things.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.520]   Guys, you're stuck in traffic.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.160]   What the hell else you're going to listen to?
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.720]   Scott Born is right.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.200]   All that money I paid turned out to be worth it.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.200]   Okay.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.520]   Well, this will be the final test.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.960]   Let's see if it gets my name right.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.960]   I like Alex.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.560]   Now, is this one of the AT&T voices?
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.760]   It must be.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.760]   The natural voices.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.320]   I think I think so.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.160]   I'm not sure whether it's something they licensed or whether they actually built it
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.160]   themselves.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:47.520]   You know, it's funny because Apple's always done this speech recognition, all this stuff
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.120]   in the background, Casper and all this stuff.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.040]   And it never really made it to the forefront.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.960]   But I think that they've got a department doing this all the time.
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.880]   I mean, if you I mean, if you miss these sort of voices, you can get them you can get
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:04.880]   voices as good as this in Tiger.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:09.480]   If you are a bit of a pig and you much rather have like an Australian woman speaking to
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.480]   a natural voice.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:13.280]   I mean, no, no, no, it'll cost you 30 bucks.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:16.440]   You know, there's always cash involved in the transaction, but you can make an app.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.440]   Leo Laportz, Leo.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.720]   Yeah, it doesn't get my name right.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.720]   It blows it.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:20.720]   It says Laportz.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:21.720]   It says Laportz.
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.120]   Hey, it's it does better than the iPhone.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.200]   That's all I can say.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.200]   Leo Laportz.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.200]   That's pretty good.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.440]   That's not too bad.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.440]   That's pretty good.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.280]   Okay, I'm done.
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.280]   Resolution independence.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.200]   I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.120]   John Syracuse, but apparently it's a good thing.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.120]   But it's not here yet.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.120]   Right.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:45.080]   Well, the idea is that someday, someday in the distant future, we're going to have screens
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:48.800]   whose dots per inch is close to that of printed paper.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.880]   You know, you can right now you see the difference when you either print something, the text
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:55.160]   looks very, very sharp and on your screen even with anti-aliasing is kind of fuzzy.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.160]   So that's the idea.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.680]   We're going to go try these great screens.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:01.320]   But if you ever had a screen like that today, everything would be unclickably small, you
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.720]   know, the menus would be microscopic, which check boxes would be a little dot.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.720]   It needs to scale up, obviously.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.600]   So you need some way to draw the same things, but with more pixels.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.960]   And that's what resolution is all independence is all about.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:12.960]   So is that not?
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:16.640]   I mean, you mentioned in your leopard review, is that not in leopard yet or are we making
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.640]   a step story?
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:22.440]   But there's no user facing way to change the user interface scale.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.440]   You have to load a developer tool and you can crank it up and then you can see how many
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.760]   your applications break horribly when you try to do that.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.560]   The Apple date is 2008, they say.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.560]   Well, it's fuzzy off in the distance.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:37.200]   Then that's around the time that developers should be ready with their applications to
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.200]   go resolution.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.760]   Doesn't mean that there's going to be user visual feature then.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:44.280]   That's just what they've told developers to shoot for, you know.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.280]   Let me see.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.280]   What else?
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.280]   You know, I'm surprised.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.960]   Have you played with spaces, Scott, born at all?
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.040]   I was actually having that.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.240]   That's actually my favorite thing that I like.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.480]   Yeah, I didn't expect to like it and I love it.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:03.320]   Yeah, because you know, the thing is that I got used to having dual monitors and I realized
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:08.560]   that when people are working on a laptop or something, this really is the answer.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:13.000]   A lot of folks are used to this kind of thing that have done some high-end work and you can
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.720]   have one space that's just for word processing, one just for the web, one for graphics.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:19.800]   It's really easy to work.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:23.680]   You just click a little arrow and that was the first thing that really caught my eye.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:29.720]   I've actually cared about that.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:35.040]   I've played with other spaces-type programs on Tiger and I always abandoned them because
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:39.200]   it wasn't easy to use and they're made a couple of changes that make it more easy.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:43.640]   One is that you can assign applications to a space so that it automatically opens there
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:47.480]   and that by itself kind of solves my issues with it because they automatically kind of
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.760]   organize themselves.
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:53.720]   Now, once you turn on spaces, turning it off causes issues.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:58.120]   Applications will still open in some space somewhere that you can't get to.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.560]   We haven't had that problem.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.960]   You can reorganize things.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:04.960]   I like it.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.400]   Even though the 30-year-old works better than- it definitely works better than some of those
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.920]   third-party apps that tried to do the same thing.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.920]   I should hope so.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.320]   I mean, Apple threading in those third-party apps were just like crossing their fingers
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.160]   and then I hope this works.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.160]   It's very fast.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.760]   If you use the control arrows to move through it, the animation is great.
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:25.120]   When you open an application in a different space, when you click on it in the dock, it
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:30.040]   scrolls over to that application smoothly and quickly.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:31.600]   It makes it very usable.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.000]   But no, John and Andy, they're pros.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.040]   Do you think spaces is a good idea, John?
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.040]   Do you use it?
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.320]   Unquestionably a good idea.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.760]   I think it came at just the right time.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:44.400]   Unlike many other features in Mac OS X, this one came at just the right time because for
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.480]   the first couple versions, this is not an essential feature for everybody.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.640]   But there's a certain class of people that are interested in it and it's nice to see
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.280]   a supported version of it that Apple will continue to do.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.280]   Well implemented too.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.280]   Right.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.280]   It's workmen-like.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.920]   It's not the best virtual desktop feature in any operating system, but it gets the job
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:00.920]   done.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:01.920]   It does pretty much everything you want to do.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.960]   The only thing that they're really missing is the different desktop backgrounds in space
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.080]   because that'll visually differentiate them.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.320]   But after that, it's good to go.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.640]   Somebody will write a little hack to do that.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:12.640]   Right, eventually.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.040]   Andy, I'm using a 30-inch display and I still use it.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.400]   It's great on a laptop, but even on a 30-inch display.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.400]   It's useful.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.280]   Andy, is this eye candy or something you like?
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.600]   I really like it.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.680]   I think that it's one of the smartest things that Apple did because they knew when to back
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:32.360]   off and simply they designed it like a really well-made toggle switch where they gave minimal
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.400]   controls just enough to make it clear and effective.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:39.960]   They made it flexible enough so that you can use this feature for whatever makes sense
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.240]   to you.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:46.840]   For me, I find myself, every time I'm using an application that has a really good full-screen
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:52.440]   mode like Aperture or iMovie, I find myself giving it its own space so that I can go into
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:56.520]   Aperture mode, turn this into an Aperture computer as opposed to a computer that has
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:58.560]   Aperture as a running application.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:05.280]   As a matter of fact, I'm looking forward to seeing developers create applications that
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:09.480]   are not designed to be really used as regular applications, but applications that are designed
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.440]   to fill out an entire space on their own.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:20.920]   One of my dream apps has always been a full-screen, no-user interface, huge status board with
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:25.840]   big letters and big icons so that from across the room I can see what my latest three emails
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:30.040]   were, what the network is, the latest three headlines.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.440]   Basically, if I'm across the room doing something else, I just want to see, oh, is there something
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.720]   I need to keep an eye on?
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:40.240]   If I see an email that's outlined in red and glowing like a Star Trek red alert indicator,
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:43.760]   I'll know that, okay, you know what, I'm putting down the model kit and I'm coming over here,
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.240]   I'm going to answer that.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.840]   It's not just that, but all kinds of little things like that.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:53.440]   It really allows the, it gives a really interesting mechanism for an entirely different approach
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.520]   to how I interact with the Macintosh.
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.160]   I'm really looking forward to seeing how people exploit that.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.880]   John, is there an API for Spaces?
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.400]   Can developers write to it?
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.920]   No, that would not be very Apple-like with it.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:10.120]   There's no public API for saying you may like Spaces, but now here's a third-party opportunity
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.480]   to enhance Spaces to make it better.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.880]   No, Spaces is what I can provide to you on a set.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:14.880]   It doesn't have to be that complicated.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:19.000]   All you have to do is create a window that's larger than the monitor area, just like you
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   have.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.600]   Yeah, it's taking advantage of Spaces by filling up a Space, no problem.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:23.600]   That's the easy way.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.600]   That's right.
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.000]   But, you know, enhancing Spaces to do things that Spaces currently doesn't do, like, you
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.560]   know, make it drag items from one Space to the other in a slightly different way or,
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.480]   you know, the custom does that better.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.240]   They should make it work like an 8-track tape player.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.800]   You just push a button, it'll send you to a random Space.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   Oh, it's not worth it.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.240]   Random Space.
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.560]   I like the new doc.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.160]   I've heard people complain about it.
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.160]   It's aesthetics.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.200]   In fact, I usually had the doc on the left, but I've actually moved it to the bottom just
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:53.000]   because I want to have that pretty glue and the reflections and the runway going off into
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   Space.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.600]   I think this is pretty opinions, comments, suggestions.
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:04.480]   The worst thing you can do is make something that I like, that I use a lot, not do the
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.720]   thing that I rely upon for you.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:11.360]   I mean, I've always used it as a document launcher, an application launcher, as a hard
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.360]   drive browser.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:17.880]   The single feature that I've always loved about it is that I can drag my documents folder
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:22.360]   into it and now suddenly I can navigate the entire documents folder through...
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.840]   You can't do it anymore?
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.640]   No, you can't do it exactly.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:26.640]   Not limited to the greater.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.400]   I'm limited to the fan.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:33.440]   Worst of all, again, there's a handful of features because I've been using the seeds for
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:34.440]   about...
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.600]   Must be closed for a year now.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:39.240]   There are a bunch of features where as soon as this feature appeared, I'm like, "Oh,
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.880]   well, geez, it's a beta.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.480]   Clearly, this is a bug.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.280]   Look how they messed up this doc icon."
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.400]   Now, it just looks like a random stack of icons.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.680]   They're just dog-piling one on top of the other.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.680]   That's not intentional.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.040]   Oh, yes it is.
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.040]   No.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:58.280]   Instead of saying, there's a conference room meeting and they put these two ideas on the
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:03.320]   whiteboard and they said, "Okay, what if we simply have a folder that says documents
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.440]   on it so that people can look at it and say, "Yes.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.880]   This is the documents folder."
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:11.880]   Over here, we have the idea of having every single icon inside that folder stacked one
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:17.200]   on top of the other so that the documents folder stack looks identical to the movies folder
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.800]   stack which looks identical to the hard drive.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:24.680]   Those have big whopping piles of junk right there in the doc that no one can tell the
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:25.780]   difference between.
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:27.480]   We can go one way or another.
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:29.960]   I say we go for the worst choice possible consensus.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:30.960]   Yes, good.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:31.960]   Let's go with the worst place possible.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:36.960]   I agree with you.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.960]   It's confusing.
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:39.960]   It's confusing.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:42.440]   It's like two bullets for me.
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:44.280]   I don't mind stacks so much.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:47.320]   The idea of stacks is it certainly works for a download folder.
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:48.320]   It doesn't work as well.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.480]   You think it works for a download folder.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:52.600]   Now you've got something on your doc that constantly looks like a disk image.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:53.600]   I may be.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.240]   I can learn to identify that until I download the packet maker and follow it.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.240]   Yes, right.
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:05.200]   You've got to read the applications folder in your doc which I do.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:08.440]   You're going to be staring at that automated robot for the rest of your life.
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:14.880]   I have one password that will never be superseded by anything.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:18.320]   It's always going to be my applications folder unfortunately.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.320]   You're right.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.640]   I have so many applications in my applications folder that grid fills the screen.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:23.640]   It's useless.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:27.440]   It's just like starting up in System 7 now.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:32.840]   Like Andy said, the ultimate thing is to take something that people use before and just remove
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:33.840]   it for no good reason.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.160]   You can remove it because you think you have a better replacement?
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.160]   Fine.
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.280]   No one can argue and say, "Oh, this is a better replacement."
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.720]   You have the old thing in there.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.440]   Make it off by default.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.560]   I've never been a fan of the doc.
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:47.960]   My big complaint is that I have to use it because there are things that it does that nothing
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.880]   else can do which drives me nuts.
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:50.880]   I'm fine with the doc.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.360]   It's good for most people.
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:55.080]   I just do not like it and I can't get rid of it.
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:59.320]   I think the way they implemented the stacks in applications like Aputure makes sense.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.320]   I don't think it makes sense in the doc.
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:05.320]   Yeah, I was really surprised to find that it was just going to be a doc thing because
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:10.680]   as soon as I saw it in the new iPhoto and in the new iMovie, the ability to simply casually
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:14.360]   scrub through the contents of a folder, I thought, "My God, I could really see myself
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.840]   using that in the Finder."
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:19.520]   So I was looking forward to when I see them using stacks, stacks, stacks, stacks, the
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.400]   same word they're using in these other applications.
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:24.160]   I was looking forward to seeing it in the Finder in other places.
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:27.640]   But this is just a colossal disappointment.
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:31.280]   Well we found one big negative.
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.840]   Any other negatives?
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:33.840]   People are things you're having.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:35.840]   Menu bar, menu bar, menu bar.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:37.880]   You don't like the translucent menu bar?
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:41.280]   I'll tell you all the other reasons why it fails for me.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:46.040]   But the number one is, you know, I've been, that's not one of those features where when
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:50.640]   it first showed up in one of the seeds, first of all, it was a lot more aggressively translucent
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.640]   than it was before.
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:54.400]   So that you couldn't see the clouds of it.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:58.080]   And again, I thought, "Okay, geez, they must have done something weird to the menu system
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.920]   and now if that's a bug, okay, well they'll fix it."
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:00.920]   No, that was intentionally.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.920]   Damn, idiots.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:07.320]   But so I installed like the gold master and I thought, "Wow, there's a new feature.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.960]   There seems to be some sort of an indicator light next to the edit menu."
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:10.960]   I wonder what that means.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:15.080]   I said, "No, that's a star from the background that's bleeding through."
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.080]   Oh, man.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.080]   That's like, "Oh."
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:19.720]   So we have to choose our desktops more carefully, I guess.
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.680]   It's just cool to do stuff like this.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:26.400]   I mean, I feel like there is some sort of meeting where they're saying, "We need to
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.400]   do something to make this not look like the previous OS release to someone who walks into
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:31.400]   it for a while."
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.840]   What can we do if this looks new?
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.280]   And secondary entirely, "This is a good idea.
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.920]   Any rational person do this?
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:38.920]   Any reason?
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:41.600]   You'd want to see what's behind the menu box?"
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:42.600]   No!
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:43.600]   No!
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:44.600]   Never.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.600]   And not only do they do it, they have a core animation filter running out.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:50.640]   So now, not only does it show you through what's behind the menu bar, but it runs with
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.640]   the complicated filter on it.
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:52.640]   What are you thinking?
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.080]   None of those people are making them do something else.
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.080]   No.
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.120]   On a new Mac, all the core animation stuff is going through the GPU.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:02.640]   So because somebody has a number of people who said, "Well, gosh, I don't want this
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:03.960]   reflection in the doc.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.000]   That's just using up CPU cycles."
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.800]   But they're probably unused anyway, right?
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.360]   I mean, it's not slowing or system time.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:13.240]   No, the GPU involved in sending commands to the GPU and the GPU is used for other things.
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:14.240]   That's not the reason.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.800]   Well, the reflections are like, "Why do I need something else?"
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:20.280]   "Let me take the disadvantages of the real world and apply them to my computer."
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.280]   "Flare!"
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:25.560]   "That can be distracted in the same way by the elements of my computer."
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:30.680]   "Let's build a room with the scent of over-cooked microwave popcorn too."
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:35.600]   "All the things about real life just infuse."
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.120]   The first operating system with bad breath, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.760]   "Scott Borne, you haven't weighed in.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.760]   What do you think?
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.320]   You're an aesthetic kind of guy."
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:49.440]   Like I said, I like the ideas of some of these things looking pretty and stuff, but I wonder
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:54.200]   if a lot of this stuff wasn't just done because some department over at Apple was like, "Hey,
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.440]   you guys are in charge of making this thing look like it's worth a buck."
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:00.840]   And it's really hard.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:03.120]   Of course, I was the last guy I know.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:07.880]   I have to admit to completely implement OS X. I stuck with OS 9 forever because I was familiar
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:08.880]   with it.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.600]   I'm one of those kinds of creatures I have it.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:14.360]   I'm going to tell you right now, looking at it for five minutes today was very distracting
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.360]   to me.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:19.240]   And I immediately thought about, "Well, I won't put it on my main computer because I
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.240]   can't do that."
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:21.240]   "Really?"
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.240]   "I really can't do that.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.320]   It's just very distracting."
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.160]   And the whole idea of it is bizarre to me.
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:32.360]   It's sort of like, there's a reason we don't put those airport scanners in plain view where
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:35.040]   they show your entire body as you walk through security.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.840]   Some of us don't want to know what's there.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.800]   "All right, well, I like it.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.800]   So I guess I'm..."
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   "You're the only one."
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:41.800]   "I'm the only one.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:46.520]   I like my computer to have interesting distracting colors, maybe because I don't want anything
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.520]   done.
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.520]   I don't know."
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:54.320]   I kind of see some of the logic behind it because if I'm opening my heart and trying
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:55.800]   to see the good in my fellow man-
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:56.800]   "Would you please?"
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:57.800]   "Something that I'm trying to do."
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:58.800]   "Yes, please do that."
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.800]   "I could..."
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:02.480]   "You can say that, well, look, the menu bar is completely white.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.720]   Document areas are also completely white.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:09.760]   If we make the menu bar a different color than white, it sets that apart from your
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:13.640]   live editing, your live creative area of the window of the screen."
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:16.000]   "You're blending into the thing behind it?"
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   "Exactly.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   I'm trying hard.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:23.280]   It's sort of like saying, you know, I know you count those three people, but you had
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:26.600]   a drug habit, you worked in your right mind, you just wanted the drugs.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:27.600]   I understand."
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:31.120]   "I've got one semi-legitimate theory for why you do this.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.120]   The best one I've heard.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:35.240]   I didn't come up with this, but the only one of her that you could say, someone who's
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:38.280]   not completely insane could have been persuaded by this argument.
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:45.160]   That going forward in the past few years, the menu bar itself is the emphasized user interface
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:49.600]   element, being replaced by toolbars, panels, and other things that are in the application
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:50.600]   itself.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:54.160]   By de-emphasizing it visually, Apple is sending the message that most of the controls that
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.800]   most people use should be visible in the toolbar or sidebar."
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.800]   "Pay no attention to that menu bar.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.440]   That's not the menu bar you like."
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:04.760]   "If you think about how often people use the menu bar, people load iPhoto and they just
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:06.080]   click on the icons in iPhoto.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.480]   Do you ever use the menu in iPhoto or iTunes?"
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:09.480]   "I mean right."
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:10.720]   "That's all I can think of.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.960]   I don't say it's a good idea.
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:15.600]   I still think even if you're going to de-emphasize it doesn't mean you make it ugly and illegible,
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.600]   but that's the only argument I've heard."
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:22.840]   "Arched into a group meeting saying, 'You know, I just used a Linux Mootv photo editor
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:23.840]   for the first time.
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:26.560]   I think every time we have a new feature, we should do that.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:30.080]   We should have a new button and a new pop-up and a new sub-menu.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:34.240]   If they can see their desktop pattern at any moment during the third experience, then
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.240]   we failed.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.120]   I want you to take care of this."
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:42.120]   "Now, I have to say, I think Apple's biggest disadvantage over Windows.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:45.960]   Now don't shoot me here is that in fact Windows does menu bars right.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:50.560]   It attaches the menu bar for the application to the window of the application.
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:52.760]   It's crazy that you have this...
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:56.960]   Well and it's really a problem on big screens because on a large screen the menu is way
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.840]   to hell far away from the window.
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:54:59.840]   You think I'm wrong, huh?"
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:03.440]   "I think your problem is you have too much money and can afford 30 inches away."
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:06.040]   "Well more and more of us are.
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.840]   I use a 23 inches play.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.840]   I don't think I have that problem.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:13.920]   But I don't want the menu bar eating space and everything at one of my menus that drives
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:14.920]   beat in FANDA.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:17.240]   Ignoring the targeting ability, having to click these things.
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.200]   I do not want a menu bar in every single window.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.200]   It's absolutely insane.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:22.840]   It's a colossal waste of space."
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:25.120]   Only one menu bar could be active at one given time.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.120]   Why is it displaying make-tons like cat-act?
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:30.360]   "I have hundreds of text documents open when I'm doing stuff.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.800]   I do not want a menu in every single one of those things.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:33.800]   I hold screen to the menu."
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:34.800]   "Oh my god."
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.680]   "A menu is 10 pixels wide.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:38.680]   Deep."
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.440]   " Multiplied by the wizard document.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:41.440]   Add up the pixels.
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:42.440]   It's real screen real estate.
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:45.760]   And then again, it doesn't even ignore the targeting thing where I don't want to have
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:47.400]   to be aiming for this little menu missing.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:50.480]   We're going one above to getting a menu bar of the window below.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.480]   Oops, you know.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:52.480]   The menu bar should be at the top.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.480]   Let me run out there.
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:54.480]   Get the menu you want.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:57.520]   If you don't like it, pretend it's being de-emphasized and customize your tools."
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.520]   "I disagree.
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:02.320]   I really think the menu bar belongs in the act of windows of each application."
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:04.320]   "I don't know if Apple never listens."
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.360]   "Well, I'm sure they won't.
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:08.560]   So you're in luck there."
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:09.560]   "I know."
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.320]   "But maybe that's where Apple's headed.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:13.920]   That's why they're de-emphasizing the menu bar.
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:15.960]   They're trying to say don't look up here.
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:16.960]   Start looking at the application."
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:18.760]   "Maybe you're right, Mr. Syracuse."
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:21.120]   "There would be a popular revolt if that ever happened.
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.760]   I like to think that the Mac community would march on Cupertino."
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:25.760]   "Really?"
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:26.760]   "That ever happened."
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:29.160]   "They haven't marched on Cupertino for the mighty mouse.
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:30.160]   I don't know why they're-"
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.400]   "But you're right, but this is a much bigger deal.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:36.000]   I can't think of much that would be a bigger deal than removing that top menu bar."
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.400]   "Well, it certainly is one of the things that really distinguishes Apple from Windows
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:41.400]   Microsoft."
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:46.200]   "I was going to say remember what happened when they had early betas of 10.0 and the
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.480]   Apple menu was in the middle of the menu bar."
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.240]   "The menu was just an inert logo."
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.240]   "Yeah, exactly."
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.240]   "And people float around it."
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.240]   "Yeah."
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:55.680]   "It's like you've done something unspeakable to their cats."
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:59.160]   "It's kind of like when they changed the original Coke formula."
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.040]   "Well, I stand corrected.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.760]   I had no idea it was such an issue."
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:06.200]   "There's big feeling behind this as an NFL format user."
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.440]   "You want to do a firefight, Mopor?
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:11.000]   Well, I've poisoned my mind by using Windows apparently."
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   "Yes, you broke your mind by the way."
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.680]   "We could answer that question easily."
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:16.680]   "You do it."
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:18.680]   "You do it so well."
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:19.680]   "Windows weekly would continue."
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:22.720]   "It had to do with all that LDS you did in the 60s.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.440]   It was Windows that did it."
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:26.440]   "The latter day Saints?"
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:28.920]   "So let's talk about performance.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.080]   It does feel faster.
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:32.480]   Has anybody done benchmarks though?
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:33.960]   Do we know if it's faster?"
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:38.840]   "I did benchmarks timing application launch and that was faster fractionally.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:41.080]   But application launching to me feels faster.
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:44.400]   I think because they're shaving off bounces as usual, you know, like that guy can't bounce
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:45.400]   it and it just feels faster."
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:48.000]   It bounces twice and nothing happens for a minute.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:54.040]   "I stopped watching most applications that ship with it from launching it to be able
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:57.240]   to use it like to be able to type your first character and text edit for example.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:00.840]   And leopard was marginally faster for me on the same exact hard drive, clean install
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:02.680]   and both faces and tiger, you know."
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:04.320]   "Marginally though, that's not a lot."
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:06.000]   "Marginally, but I mean that's just one area.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:10.400]   There are tons of areas where leopard frameworks are way, way faster, text drawing, line drawing,
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.560]   you know, but it requires some effort on the part of the developer to take advantage of
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:14.560]   those.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.560]   So going forward, those will improve."
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:17.560]   And of course you think like spotlight.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:18.560]   I mean does that count?
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.520]   Obviously spotlight is ridiculously faster.
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:21.520]   Everyone agrees on that.
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.520]   "It's usable."
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:24.800]   "That's not OS performance that, you know, leopard is in fact."
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:27.720]   "Well it's faster because that's a feature that people were avoiding because they were
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:29.960]   so slow and tiger and now it's not."
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:33.000]   There are most of the control panels of the same, most of the little accessories are the
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.320]   same with the exception of the network and the Bluetooth control panels which have been
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.120]   much improved.
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:40.640]   Big improvements there.
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:45.520]   You point out, and actually Apple pointed this out to me, and it's a little slam at Windows
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:50.200]   when you browse through your shared computers.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:54.320]   If you have a Windows computer, you know, each computer has its own icon.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:59:01.840]   The Windows computer will have a crappy 17-inch CRT monitor with a blue screen of death on
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.720]   it, which I think is a nice little touch.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:06.200]   I think it's unprofessional.
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:07.200]   It's a little unprofessional.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.200]   A little bit unprofessional.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:09.200]   They were...
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.200]   I'll proceed.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:11.200]   You've got to check that out when you ship it.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.200]   They left it.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:15.200]   Or they really, they should put a big screenshot of Aeroglass on it because I think that's horrendous.
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:18.400]   It would have been more insulting than a blue screen and more appropriate.
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:20.240]   True, it would have been accurate.
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:21.240]   Right.
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:24.120]   Well, anyway, it's a little slam at Microsoft, which...
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:25.120]   You're right.
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:26.600]   It kind of surprised me a little bit to see that.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.480]   It's a little childish, but what the hell?
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:30.080]   We're child, we're children.
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:33.400]   Maybe they could have just had the menu bar move when you got there.
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:34.400]   I don't know.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.000]   Any other thoughts before we wrap it up?
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.200]   We're not going to do a pick this week.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:41.320]   I want to give you all a chance to think about what your favorite leopard maybe applications
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:44.560]   will be for next week or something like that.
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:45.560]   Any final thoughts?
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:46.560]   Any Enoco leopard?
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:50.240]   I guess what I should ask everybody is, should people upgrade?
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.240]   Who should upgrade?
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:53.240]   Who should not upgrade to leopard?
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:54.240]   Any Enoco?
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:57.840]   Again, it will be a different set of people for everybody.
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:02.120]   If you go to Macworld.com, I basically priced out what each of the features were for.
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.320]   I think there are a lot of people who will upgrade just to get the new version of Mail
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.360]   because it's the next...
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.360]   Really, it's the next iteration.
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:13.000]   It's designed to be more of a professional tool for managing everything.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   I love the task.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   I really do know that.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   I really do know that.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.360]   I mean, you get an email and it contains four different things that you're interested
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.360]   in.
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.000]   It has an email address that you want to create into a contact.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.040]   It's got a new appointment in it that you want to add to your calendar and it's got
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.280]   a new thing you want to add to your to-do list.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:33.200]   Finally, the new Mail understands all of that and can integrate that into one application.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.200]   For me, there were like four different things that made it a must buy even if Apple didn't
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.800]   give me a free copy.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:42.000]   But I think there's no one killer feature for everybody.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   Are you bitter?
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   Bitter?
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.720]   Apple didn't give you a free copy?
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:47.720]   Are you bitter?
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.600]   Apple gave me a free copy, man.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.200]   Oh, even if I see what you're saying.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.200]   Even it was the subjunctive.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.520]   I'm saying that they not.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:03.480]   Even me as the honest, independent journalist for whom every penny is a hard one battle
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.920]   from the people who will not process my invoices for six months.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.600]   I would be buying this $129 package.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.240]   And that's another great feature of it that Apple still is doing the smart thing.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.920]   They're saying let's have it relatively cheap and let's not have four different versions
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:18.920]   of it.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.120]   Four, I think there's seven versions of Windows.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:26.480]   Oh, because it keeps subdividing like pull-in-arian worms, which is about the same level of
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:31.080]   ephm which this is the operation has been written.
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.440]   Yeah, I mean, that's also a good feature.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.920]   Everybody's going to buy it.
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.720]   Everyone's going to be using leopard.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:39.720]   The question is whether they're going to buy it right now or wait until next year when
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.240]   they plan to buy a new MacBook or when they plan to buy a new iMac.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.200]   I think the upgrade is so painless you might as well just get it now.
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:50.680]   Unless you're one of those holdouts who desperately needs to continue to run hypercard or any
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:55.560]   other classic app, that's the only deal breaker and that's not going to affect more than I
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:00.040]   don't know for people who are whose computers are made out of, you know, dried twigs and
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.440]   animal hides, blashed together.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:02.440]   I don't know.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.960]   John Syracuse, a must-have upgrade for whom?
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:09.960]   I would say that if you're a home user and there's some feature in leopard that will improve
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:14.600]   your day-to-day life, whether it's mail or it's just, you know, the back to my Mac, the
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:18.000]   screen sharing, if there's any feature that you think will make your day-to-day computing
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.400]   life better and you're just a regular home user, you should just go out and upgrade.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.680]   It's pretty stable for an initial release.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.680]   You're at a police state.
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:26.280]   Point release, yeah, so it's not a big deal.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:30.600]   If you're, I would hold off if you're using a Mac for some serious work and you have existing
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:34.040]   applications that are, you know, humming along like you're using a final cut or you're
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:38.440]   doing something else, you really have to wait for those applications to be updated or at
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:42.720]   least just giving the thumbs up by, you know, by their vendors because you can't sacrifice
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.440]   your work environment for the sake of, oh, now my mail application is a little bit nice.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:50.800]   How about somebody on G4, a G5, an older Mac, if it lives up to the respects required?
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.800]   I would say independent hardware, those two categories, basically.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:57.560]   It's a feature that you think will make your life easier and you're just a regular home
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.640]   user, upgrade.
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:02.760]   If you're using it for work or for something professional, wait it out, make sure all your
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.280]   apps are ported and then bring it over.
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.040]   And Scott, we know you're waiting it out.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.920]   Well, I got, we have six machines, we put it on one.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.960]   And we have, just like John said, we have a lot of professional apps that we use on
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:17.000]   our production environment, we can't afford to risk them.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.240]   You know, I think it's a good, I think it's a good looking program.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:26.600]   You know, will the average person who has a thousand dollar Mac want to spend $129 bucks,
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.800]   you know, a low end Mac, will they want to spend $129 bucks for this?
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.960]   You know, you know, it's not, it's not a big deal.
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.960]   I think a lot of people will enjoy it.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:38.600]   I think from a stability point of view, I always prefer to wait a few weeks and let all the
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.840]   really bad things that are going to happen happen.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:45.000]   And then, you know, I'll eventually maybe get around to it, but I got to tell you, the
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.440]   menu bar and a couple other things have me, have me a little curious as to whether or
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.640]   not I'll be able to stand it.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:50.640]   I love it.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:54.240]   I'm saying everybody should upgrade to it, but I guess if you've listened to this, you
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:57.640]   probably know the reasons why you might not want to upgrade to it.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:00.360]   But I just, I just, I feel really good about using it.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:05.000]   It's, it's like a new paint job for your computer for 129 bucks.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.040]   That's, that's almost as good as real shibe.
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:10.760]   It's like the new paint job you put on your car before you try to sell it to some room.
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.600]   Anyway, what's the black pro?
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:16.760]   I've got to go to windows.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.560]   I need my menu bar.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.240]   Check out those cup holders.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.480]   Three of them, sir.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:22.480]   Brand new.
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:26.320]   I really want to thank John Syracuse if we're putting up with us for the first time joining
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.760]   us must read article.
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.160]   It's a part of the infinite loop.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:34.200]   It's the leopard review at ours, technical.com.
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:37.240]   Highly recommended apple coverage is very good in ours.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.720]   Actually news, tech news in general has been very good in ours.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:44.640]   Then we've had Jackie on before, but we're glad to get you on also.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.560]   Take a look at that leopard review.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:50.160]   30,000 chocolatey rich words.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.280]   And John, I hope you won't be a stranger and come back soon.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.280]   Sure.
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.280]   Anytime.

[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.760]   Scott, it's fun.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:04.760]   Can't wait.

[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.840]   He started audio net when I started net radio.
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:19.840]   That's right.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:20.840]   Yeah.
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:21.840]   We shared bandwidth.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:22.840]   Should be fun.
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.840]   You know, everybody's going to be there.

[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:35.480]   Annie and I coz at the Chicago Sun times and the CWOB, the colossal waste of bandwidth
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:42.040]   at double dub dub dot c w o b dot com because you can never have too many W's in a URL.
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.280]   We're overstock.
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.480]   We got to clear them all up before the 0 8 W W's come in.
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:49.440]   So come on down, bring the cash, bring the kids.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.440]   They are going soon.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:54.840]   Soon he's going to a URL with no dubs with no dubs.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:57.960]   Well, there's there's there's dub that's implied and everything that I write and post
