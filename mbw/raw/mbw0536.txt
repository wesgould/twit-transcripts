[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.760]   where I saw the wildest bus crash on Facebook. I'll show it in a minute.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.280]   It just made me sad that you were back in the freezing cold.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.280]   Yeah, I left the studio. I got on a plane. I landed and there was snow everywhere.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.440]   It was like going from Tatooine to Hoth. It was amazing.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.320]   Only you would call it from Tatooine to Hoth. I love it.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.280]   Also with us, Andy Enaco. It's getting a little chilly where you are too in beautiful New England.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.200]   Well, Frost on the Pumpkin this morning. Frost is on the pumpkin.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.440]   And it's great to have you from the Chicago sometimes. And joining us hasn't, it's been an age.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.880]   Wow. Yeah.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.800]   So from Matt Cast, Adam Christensen. I forgot where you look.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.080]   You're in San Diego. San Diego, San Diego.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.440]   Which we have known that weather stuff. We don't know what that is.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.480]   Always a beautiful day in San Diego.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.640]   Much is. Yeah. We're spoiled. It's just amazing.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.040]   They have french fries in their burritos. So nothing is perfect.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.640]   Oh, are you kidding? California burrito.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.840]   Carnia Sada. I've never had it with french fries in it. Is that true?
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.480]   That is true. California Carnia Sada burrito come down. We'll have some. They're delicious.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.200]   Where do you get that? I've been to a standing. That's where we like to go.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.040]   In San Diego is. I mean, in California.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.200]   Here's this is, by the way, got to show you this. This is the, this is yesterday in Montreal.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.440]   It's a little slippery. A little slippery. He's just helping. He's just helping him up the slope.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.880]   Just pushing him along. Yeah. Yeah. A little slippery. And then, wait a minute.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.120]   It's not over yet because, oh, here comes a cab. Here comes a cab. Is he going to be able to avoid?
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.080]   No. He did.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.360]   My, I have the anti lock breaks and all yesterday at every intersection.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.200]   It was, well, look, these guys, these guys wheels are locked up. Ouch.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.560]   But that's not, no, it's not over yet, my friend.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.800]   Because here, here comes another button. This isn't slow much. Notice,
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.960]   wheels not turning. So there's, there's really nothing this guy could do.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.760]   Every single nightmare of mine is okay. I could tell the wheels were locked up at that point.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.040]   Isaac Newton will either crash me into the spare or I would, or I could.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.680]   And you can see him turning the wheels left, right, trying anything, anything.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.840]   He helped the truck get free though. And then this is the best part.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:27.040]   Because this is all, this is not slow motion, by the way. This is in real time. But, but if you've
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.560]   ever been, and I've been in, in Rex on IC roads, if you've ever been in them, it's in slow motion,
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.640]   because there's nothing you could do about it. It's just going to happen.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.920]   You're like a, you're like an audience member. I went, I just went for a walk yesterday and the
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.240]   sidewalks were so icy. I got an incredible, a doctor workout. Just trying to do the snowplow,
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.320]   the entire way. This one's a good one, because this guy's got some weight and he's going to
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:57.760]   really damage that. Yeah. What a. Boom. Oh, no one got injured. I'm assuming. No, I mean,
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.520]   no, in fact, you see the police officer on the right, he got out of the car and one is just,
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.040]   but there's nothing you can do. We all said, sorry. We said, sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.120]   We'll wait to see like tomorrow when all the passengers of the city bus
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.560]   decide, call their cousins and lawyers and decide whether or not they've been injured or not.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.800]   So Apple has gone all the way to the Supreme Court with a Samsung decision and
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.560]   lost. Now, the decision this time was merely, it was kind of an interesting
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:37.680]   point of law, whether a company suing as Apple did Samsung can get as damages the entire profits
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.240]   from a phone. Supreme Court ruled unanimously, they cannot and send it back to the court of appeals
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.680]   to determine how much Samsung should pay. Can you imagine, was there any other vendor who
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.400]   makes his Euro profits? No, no, there was no money made. You can't sue. Yeah. It's HTC. Leave them alone.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.360]   I guess it was a jury that said $960 million. Wasn't it more even more at some at one point?
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.080]   Yeah, it was like 1.3 1.4 billion.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.640]   Billion. But that wasn't that kind of ridiculous to begin with. The idea that there is nothing
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:16.560]   that Samsung did in this phone that would have led to a penny of profit except for the stuff they
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:24.720]   took from Apple. You can look at the opposite way too. We'll see you next week in the same courtroom.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.240]   You can look at it the opposite way too. It costs five billion to come up with the original
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.960]   design. So for 1.3 billion, you're getting it like the knockoff cheap. It's a discount.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.240]   But the weird thing is that they didn't actually, I don't think they actually
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.360]   earmarked that as punitive damages. I know that first is in copyright infringement. It's not just
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:49.040]   the actual cost of what was caused by the, what the infringement cost, the copyright holder.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.360]   But in that case, you can actually get trouble damages to say, look, just to make sure that this
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.560]   just makes, just make sure you're not going to try to get a discount. If you lose,
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.320]   we're going to get three times as much money as you would have paid me. Had you licensed this
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.400]   fairly, but they were just saying, nope, this is how much, this is how much damage was done to Apple.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.560]   Poor, poor Apple. Well, I think there wasn't there some markup for being willful. I forget the
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.720]   original deal, but I think there was some. Yeah. So this was there. So there were two cases Apple
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.960]   versus Samsung. One was patented, things like a swipe to unlock. This one was the design patents,
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:29.600]   the rounded corner front face bezel and the colorful grid of icons representing programs and applications.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.000]   We've talked about this for years now. We're so lucky Steve Jobs never saw a pixel.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:42.480]   All phones look this way now. But it's true that the very first Samsung smartphone did look a lot
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.560]   like an iPhone. I mean, it would be, yeah, it would be easy to get fused. They were providing
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:52.560]   it wasn't available. Right. Yeah. I mean, they, there's a point in which you get caught and you
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.560]   don't even try to put up a defense when it's not, it wasn't that a lot of people are making fun of
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.120]   Oh, rounded corners. Yes, Apple invented rounded corners, but it went deeper than that when you
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:07.040]   talk about the icons that are knockoffs of like the photo icon and the calendar icon and not just
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:12.640]   Oh, they own it. They own the idea of a little eye calendar icon, but no, it's like almost pixel
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.760]   for pixel. They were just like cut copy paste and then like adjust the color, a slider and
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.960]   Photoshop and then good your stamp on is good. I do think they moved away from that really,
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.440]   really quickly after they got there, we have the launchpad. But you can't do not, you can't look
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.880]   at this first phone and not think that yeah, they were there's a lot of command C command,
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:40.720]   command V happening in the design lab that day. The original verdict goes back to 2012. That's
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.480]   how long we've been talking about this. Yeah, jury, and I don't know if a jury really is the best
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:52.800]   way to judge this, but I don't know any other way to do it. But the jury said, you know, they
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:59.360]   say to the jury, well, you know, was this confusing? Was it intentional? The jury ruled a $930 million
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:07.520]   in penalties. That was later cut by $382 million in December 2015 of last year, a year ago,
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:15.840]   Samsung paid $548 million to Apple. No, it wasn't delivered in a in pennies in a truck.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.920]   That's another that's a great thing. They just gave a fingerprint. That's a great fake news story,
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.520]   right? They paid the pennies. Even note sevens, I think. I would love to know how many pennies,
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:33.920]   $548 million would be, you know, I mean, how many how many trucks? Yeah, really. But Samsung
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:41.840]   appealed and said, you know, we'll give them some, but $399 million of that money we'd like back
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:49.600]   because that's you can't take every penny that we made on the phone. So this goes, this is a five
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.320]   year old suit. And at this point, you know, there's nowhere else to go. You've gone to the
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:00.320]   Supremes. They ruled eight to nothing. The opinion written by Sonia Sotomayor is that a patent
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:06.080]   violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.680]   stolen designs. They weren't again debating whether the design was stolen, but whether,
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.360]   but how much of the profit needs to go to have. Does it go back to a lower court now to
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:19.760]   re-educate the US Court of Appeals? Not overly else. Yeah, I guess you're right. What was I thinking?
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:28.080]   And in fact, the Supreme Court was careful not to kind of set a precedent for future juries
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.800]   on how to handle these kinds of disputes, except that they ruled you don't have to give everything
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.760]   if the design only covers certain components and not the whole thing.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.000]   The lawyers have paid their 100 million by now though.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.160]   Holy cow. Holy cow. Nobody wins in stuff like this.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160]   They're just pulling up to Supreme Court in their Lamborghinis.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:53.360]   And I can go on and on, but I don't think there's not much more to say about it.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:59.040]   Now there is that other case, right? The patent case, which Samsung also lost.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.360]   I don't know what the status of that is though, and I don't really care anymore.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:08.160]   They can all go straight out the door. Is that the old like slide to unlock one,
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.040]   which Chappell's not even using that anymore, right? Yes, slide to unlock. It's the software
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:18.720]   pad. The elastic banding, are they a rubber band? And then the clicking a link to determine that
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.040]   a link is a phone number in the data detector. Then you can click it data detectors.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:30.000]   But I love your I'm more piece. Where is the Samsung shaped dent in the universe?
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.080]   There's the tower PC that looks a little bit like Apple's trash can Mac.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.400]   I update it regularly. Oh, yeah, because that's brand new. That was updated a couple of months ago.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.800]   I'm actually tempted. I wonder if the Samsung has a little longer shelf life.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.080]   The thing that surprised me is when you go back, there's like before the iPhone,
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.080]   there's just like a Samsung version of the Blackberry.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:12:00.080]   Yeah. Yeah. Well, and yeah, I guess so. Yeah. Blackjack, I think it was called.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.040]   There are similarities. There's the fingerprint reader. Yeah, that does look like a Blackberry,
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.160]   doesn't it? Holy cow. It also looks like a trio, and it also looks like a lot of phones are up that
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:16.560]   that day. Yeah. Well, but even like. Yeah. Yeah. Everybody copies. Everybody's kind.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.160]   This is the original one we were talking about. And that's a whole look at that.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:25.280]   I mean, that is definitely even the icons look very similar. Yeah, the phone icon.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:31.200]   They didn't rip off the idea of an old fashioned handset, but green. Come on. Yeah.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:38.160]   Well, you know, it's interesting. You know, it's frustrating. That is from this legal perspective,
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.520]   something that I think helps users is like the commonality. Right. Green has sort of become
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:49.920]   the universal phone color and blue, like this universal mail message color sort of thing. So,
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:55.360]   it's sort of set up this language. And I think some of the copying you could maybe argue is
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.800]   done for those reasons, right? Well, and you wouldn't want, you wouldn't say, you wouldn't want to
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:08.400]   have cars that had brake pedals in different locations. Right. Yeah. And also, I don't think
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:13.840]   there's anything wrong with seeing a system that works well in the actually in the field. And then
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.280]   saying, you know what, our system would be better if we did that way. Apple certainly done that
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:22.560]   time and time again, even with the even with the iPhone, where this is the reason why Android
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.160]   benefits from the presence of iOS and iOS benefits from the presence of Android.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.840]   Yeah, we do not, by the way, know how many how many garbage trucks it would take to take a half
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.800]   a billion dollars in pennies. But this thanks to a battle cam in our chatroom and the Toronto Sun
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:43.120]   is how many pennies for this is a billion dollars with the pennies on a compared to a football field.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:49.760]   So wow, just so you know, and there's a little person down. I mean, I got to do the
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.280]   tell us straighten out. Hold on. Is that Canadian football field or American?
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:14:00.640]   Is this 100 yards down? It's a three down football field. And remember, it wasn't a full
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:05.760]   billion dollars. It was only like 300. What was like this much right here, like to take out that
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.240]   ball cube the man has to run to the left. Yeah. And then block.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.600]   Boom.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.880]   All right, enough.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:23.200]   I just can't resist illustrating these shows. So yeah, I love you. I love this. And so you keep
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.880]   this up to date with the latest because that you're right. I mean, yeah, when you take it as a
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.920]   sum total of of work over time sound and apparently they've gone through this with refrigerators
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.920]   and washing machines and everything that Samsung does because they're not an American company.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.040]   They're a conglomerate that makes everything and all of these things get adjudicated.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.200]   And we do win because they become fair and reasonably, you know,
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.960]   licenseable patents and everyone starts doing things the same and consumers benefit.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.440]   And to some degree, this happens everywhere. I remember back in 1998 on tech TV when we were
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.880]   doing the new screensavers, an Apple released the first iMac or the Bondi Blue iMac.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.280]   I guess that was the first one, right? And everybody's all excited about Bondi Blue and the stories
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:08.000]   about Steve Jobs carefully picking the color. So we went out and we bought vacuum cleaners,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.160]   all sorts of home appliances that looked, they were clear Bondi Blue plastic looked exactly the
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.920]   same. We had a whole museum. I wish I could find a picture of that.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.800]   He's so great. Because they all looked the same.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.600]   I remember seeing like George Foreman style grills like not only just in the blue,
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.960]   but also in the tangerine and the in the raspberry red dalmatian.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.280]   It was wonderful. Flower power, flower power waffle maker.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.040]   But the point I think we were making that one didn't have a floppy drive either.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:42.000]   Was that this stuff at all come up before Apple came out with its iMac. This was
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.760]   stuff predated, you know, prior art is. And you can see a huge,
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.280]   bronze influence in Johnny I was working on everything from the Mac Pro. All of it is
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:54.960]   highly derivative. Nobody would want to design something sui generous that just didn't that had
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:00.160]   no basis in the past. Because as you point out at him, we wouldn't know how to use it. It'd be like,
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:06.960]   what is this? Yeah, I mean, that's why I got a little frustrated when those lawsuits were really,
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:14.160]   really in high spirits. Because there are some people who are just so they love Apple so much
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:19.040]   that they really want to they pick up the sword and the shield and it's nothing can possibly
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:24.240]   nothing can possibly defend them as strongly as they can. And then I really had to say, well,
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:30.080]   okay, final, I'll go through my into my storage unit. Got like the big laundry hamper of hand
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:34.640]   held devices. It's like, okay, let's just look through some palm devices here. Okay, what do you
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:40.480]   know? We've got a pocket device with rounded corners and a center home button and the icons
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.800]   are on a grid just like the iPhone. It came out like four or five years before that. And here's
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:50.080]   another one where it has this app that also works exactly the same way. And it's not it's and wasn't
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:55.120]   trying to slap Apple down or slap this person down it anyway. But to teach the lesson that you
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.680]   look at what works great when something is in the field, you look at how it's you can't have a
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:05.440]   design that is just simply academic. It's it only it only exists when people are interacting with
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.760]   it. It's just like a book only really exists when someone is reading it and it's having that
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:15.200]   information that that effect on you a play only works when it's being performed in front of an
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.840]   audience. And that's when you can think that maybe I don't know if people are kind of in
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:25.280]   in the mood for like a really large phone. We can't do that until somebody is crazy enough to do it.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.480]   And then you see that, Oh, well, what do you know, people actually like this? And then you can
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.960]   actually buy one yourself as a designer say, wow, there are things about this that I really did not
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:38.720]   anticipate liking about it. And so that will hopefully that will inform your your own decisions. You
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.040]   can't design in a vacuum at some point, you have to go out into the real world and see how people
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.760]   interact with things. And if you're not influenced by things, whether it's another maker of another
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:53.200]   sort of device you're working on, or even set design at an opera, you're really not living in the
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:58.080]   world that your customers are living in. So that's a bad thing. Is this a huge design philosophy where
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.440]   it's very common to copy, you know, great artists, steel is one of the famous things. But the you
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:08.560]   don't want to ever just have somebody else. I think it came from Picasso. I think he was quoting
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.640]   Picasso. Like you don't want to make Belvin and Dobbs a story of a young boy and his imaginary dog,
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.200]   because that's way too close. But you want to copy forward you want to take and there's everything
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.800]   as a remix is a great series about this. You want to take the archetypes that people know
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.720]   and are used to and love and take them the next step. You want to contribute back nobody wants
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.480]   to be a designer who's just told, go make your version of that. They want to say, take this and
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.480]   make it better. And that's sort of what we want in the design community. Sir Isaac Newton said,
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.840]   if I've seen farther than others, it's because I've stood on the shoulders of giants. Yeah.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:41.120]   Again, and especially with technology, when you're innovating something new, when something new
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:46.560]   comes out and it works, you know, that language sort of iterates from that. And I think, you know,
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.080]   another place we're seeing this right now, and you don't see a ton of lawsuits flying around,
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:55.840]   luckily, is with a lot of the new voice devices and voice interfaces that are coming forward,
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.320]   right? Google Home really is a direct rip off of Amazon's Echo, isn't it?
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:07.120]   I wouldn't even say rip off, but it's it's more like the copy. Well, no, I'd say I'd say if it's
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:12.480]   a copy only in the same way that the iPhone 6 Plus was a rip off of the node. It wasn't a rip
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.520]   off. It was good. Hey, we hadn't really thought. Well, no, again, not even homage. It's like,
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:23.360]   it's such an odd it's such a, again, someone has to be crazy enough to say, what if we make a computer
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:29.360]   that has no screen, no, no buttons as his primary interface, you just speak to it and it talks back
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:34.640]   and we'll make it a good speaker. But that's all that we'll ever do. Really, only a crazy company
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:39.920]   would do that. But that's the it's that one ant that has that mutation. So that instead of
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.920]   following the sent trail that's been laid down to the sugar and back, it keeps going off on
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.640]   crazy tangents. And that's when you find things that are brand precisely. And that's why. And that's
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.720]   why. And that's because you don't you can't innovate. And this is why the patent system is the way it
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.400]   is. You know, there's a limited time for a patent. And in order to get the patent, you have to
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:00.320]   expose the process to the rest of the world. So everybody can take the right. Yeah, like
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:05.920]   Lotus versus Excel, it can't be the best solution for that thing. And so there's this balance between
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:11.280]   innovate and get the benefit of the innovation. You know, you put all the R and D into it.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.000]   Amazon puts all that cleverness into the echo. They should get some benefit. But at the same time,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   this is a this is a breakthrough. And everybody should be, you know, everybody should ultimately
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.800]   be able to take advantage of it. But I mean, if if if the echo didn't exist, I doubt the Google
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:30.480]   home would exist. It doesn't look like the but exactly. But it's well, and to be fair, when you
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.280]   when you're talking about like a minute, all it is, it's a speaker and a microphone and a connection
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:40.000]   to the internet. It's not as so you can. Okay, well, how about we make the speaker square?
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.880]   Okay, it doesn't really change how it works. But it can be so no Sandy. They totally
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:49.040]   copy so no. Well, I'm so I might have, yeah, might have be the prior right there. Go ahead,
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:54.320]   Adam. I was just I was gonna make a joke. I'm waiting for the the renews it lawsuit against
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.880]   Google. It does look like a renews it. In fact, there's a renews it in our men's room here. And I
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:04.640]   thought, Oh, I put an echo. Oh, no, no, no, no, it's not like Google home. On that subject, I do,
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:09.920]   I will quickly say because there might be some people who are thinking about the Google home and
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:15.680]   the Amazon Echo. I have to say that I've been using the Google home for about a month now.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:21.840]   And I did take it out of the I did I did kind of shut it down. It's not working as well as the as
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:29.040]   the echo is. And it's not as mature as the echo is right now. I think that'll change in time. But
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:36.400]   I think that people right right now the the the echo is really at that wow. That wow spot in
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.160]   technology where if you give this if you give someone this for Christmas and they've never used
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:46.000]   it before, it will just work and it'll work with everything. And you will try to try to stump it or
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.640]   try to figure make it trip over something and it just plain won't. And you can be in the next
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:56.880]   room and it'll work. And it'll just be a magical device Google home. You can see the potential of
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:03.040]   it, particularly when they hook up eventually hook up a lot of their machine learning into it.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:07.760]   Right now it's nice. It's cute. But it's not quite there yet. Yeah, you're you came to
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.920]   independently the exact same conclusion. I did because I'm getting questions now from
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:17.440]   on the radio show, which should I buy because it's with it with the Amazon dot down of $40 for
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.920]   Black Friday. It's very it's very tempting if you have a pair of speakers lying around and I agree
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:26.320]   with you. The only thing the home is better at is kind of general knowledge based questions.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.760]   You can talk to Google and because Google has all of that data, but the echo is more
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.160]   useful in so many ways. And once the Sonos integration appears next to early next year,
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:42.160]   that's going to be amazing. Yeah, I mean, again, Google has this they've got the dragon in the
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:47.760]   keep waiting to be on slipped. And that is when it's just as good as the handheld search where no
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.160]   matter what you ask it, it will figure it out. Right now I'm having a problem with the with
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:57.520]   the microphones. Oh, really? Oh, okay. Well, I mean, I've I've had it like I put it in the bedroom
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.760]   because that's where like I get dressed in the morning. That's where like I'm when I think at
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.720]   night, I'll like give it notes or that's when I wake up, I want to know, do I need to get out of
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:12.400]   bed right now? Or can I just, you know, sleep for another 20 minutes? And even like with it,
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:19.840]   three feet away in the nightstand, I would find myself using like my 1990s 2002 style of speech
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:26.480]   of what are my appointments tomorrow? What did you get?
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:35.120]   A weather in York on Thursday. Do you have Adam? Do you have either of those? Do you use Siri? Do
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:42.800]   you have some? I just got a dot. Yeah, at 40 bucks. And that's what's going to power Amazon.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.120]   It's going to suddenly it's going to explode. And they now have 5000 skills they announced.
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:52.080]   That is remarkable. It's also points up a real problem with these because you don't you how would
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:56.400]   you even know what skills it had and how to add them and remember the syntax for calling them,
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:03.600]   etc, etc. 50 of them seem to be dog facts. There are a lot of dog facts, a lot of bad dad jokes,
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:10.080]   a lot of them are semi useless. But then there's buried in there that these nuggets are very useful
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:19.040]   skills. All right. Yeah, I'm it's so funny because you pointed out Renee when you were here that
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:25.680]   the Apple Watch app sells the Echo by a factor three as far as we can tell. And yet everybody says
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.400]   the Apple Watch is a flop and the echo is the next big thing. You're Pat account. Everyone has
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.960]   to make one. Where's yours? But I think the future might be a little brighter. Although Tim Cook
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:42.080]   says the Apple Watch sold better than it's what it what was the quote? It's the best
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:47.760]   holiday weekend ever or something like that. So it was super funny because IDC put out numbers
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:53.120]   saying that it was down 70% or something IDC. Sometimes they say Windows phone is going to
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.280]   eclipse iPhone and Android by 2015. So I mean they're they can be really hit and miss it times.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:03.040]   But I saw an i'm worthy we the iPhone is usually the most the most in demand product that we have
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.200]   over the holidays. But this year over Black Friday, the interest for iPhone was super high. But
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.040]   Apple Watch was even higher than that. Especially people trying to figure out do they get an Apple
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.880]   Watch 2? Should they get an Apple Watch 1? What are they sacrifice? Should they take a deal on an
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.840]   original Apple Watch? What are the different options? And we had an incredible amount of interest in
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.840]   that stuff. So it made no sense to me that they were saying that it was going to be so depressed,
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:29.200]   so turned down. So I started asking around that it sounded like the numbers were really really
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.440]   really off for Apple Watch. And then I guess Tim Cook felt similarly because he decided to come
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.920]   out and say we're still not sharing numbers with you. But I'm going to tell you that bugs me because
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:44.400]   I feel like this could be maybe it's because we live in a new era where people make a certain
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.440]   people make assertions without any facts behind it. But without releasing numbers,
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:55.600]   I mean I'm not saying he's lying and he wouldn't he couldn't lie right. He's the CEO of publicly
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:59.280]   held company. But it's a weird thing. But they don't release the numbers. So but it's like,
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.480]   yeah, no, we're so better than ever, but we're not going to tell you how well.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.240]   Yeah, so this is the conundrum there. And they are the only company that really releases numbers
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.440]   for anything. Like if you try to find out how much Samsung or Amazon or any other company
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.840]   ships, good luck to you. They might tell you how much they've stuffed into a channel at a certain
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.360]   point in time. But they'll never really tell you sold numbers. And Apple does. They do it for
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:22.000]   iPhone and iPad and Mac. And now they don't want to do it for Apple Watch because probably they feel
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.840]   it's going to take a while to ramp up. And also it's a highly competitive new area for them.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:29.360]   And now it's like, well, you gave us these, please, you know, not giving us this is super
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:33.520]   suspicious. How many echoes were sold? I mean, I don't I only Jeff Bezos. No, yeah, they never
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.720]   announced that either. So both these numbers are best selling Kindle ever.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.440]   Objections. Yeah, but it's also worth it's also worth mentioning that this is the same week that
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:46.800]   Motorola, who in my opinion, makes the absolute best Android Wear watch out there, said that
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:52.880]   don't expect a new watch in 2017. We're not even promising. We will make an update to any of our
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:58.240]   wearables because we don't think it's we can't we can't we can't it's not a big category or at least
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:02.320]   the state of the company right now is that they've got really have to focus on phones. They don't
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:09.120]   have enough attention and resources to continue to promote and develop a market because one of the
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:14.640]   and you can say that one of the reasons is that Google had a delay their big Android Wear 2.0
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.920]   operating system until early next year. But certainly if they were going gangbusters and sales,
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.160]   they would say, you know what we will we're willing to suffer for three months to get that big payout
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:29.840]   when everybody was clamoring for an Android Wear 2.0 watch. Well, and it's also a week that Bebel
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:38.000]   sold for basically the cost of its debt to Fitbit, which is see the same IDC report that said Apple
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.640]   watch sales were plunging. So that Fitbit is the king of the hill here. So it's so funny.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:50.960]   It's very because I got to tell you, I wish Apple I mean, look when when you look at Tim Cook's
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:57.280]   quote, it's very Trumpian sales growth is off the charts. They have a problem. It's huge. It's
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:02.240]   huge. Well, give us some facts if you're going to say that. Well, I think I think because it's
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:08.000]   because there have been so many reports of, Oh, look how badly Apple watches tanking. If you I mean,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.840]   he sees the numbers, he knows the truth and he can say, look, no, sales are not tanking. We're
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:16.880]   actually doing really, really well. And you can't get it to stores. Exactly. And if there it if and
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:24.160]   it's not just not wanting to say things that might not paint Apple sales in the greatest light,
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.160]   oftentimes there is such knock on repercussions to saying here are the actual figures quarter to
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:33.200]   quarter growth. I get particularly in a particularly in a market where everybody is trying to figure
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:40.560]   out that we know that there is gold somewhere in the this 1200 acre area. We know that for a fact,
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.560]   we just don't know where it is and how to get it out of the ground. And that's the state of where
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:49.520]   it goes. But here's the fact that we know sell through is greater than any week in the product's
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:54.240]   history. Does that mean it's great or just it's better than it's been in the past? We're on the
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:59.840]   track for the best quarter ever for the Apple watch. Does that mean it's sales that you would that
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:04.480]   Motorola would turn around and say this is it where this is it? This is our hot product or is it just
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:10.320]   better than a crappy bunch of quarters previously? And we just don't know. Yeah, I'd also I'd also
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.640]   like to know they've done the math IDC did the math and apparently IDC got it wrong.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:20.960]   I'd also like to know how much of this is is a direct result of now having a cheapest buy-in at
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:28.480]   $279 where I used to be $400 right now. It's right at that you can't it's right at the price you would
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.600]   expect to pay for a decent smartwatch made by anybody. So that's the reason because I can't
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.680]   think any other reason why sales would suddenly be the best quarter ever for Apple watch.
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.440]   Yeah, well, and the and the other and the other reason to be another reason to be fair is that
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:48.880]   in just a few words, this is the year in which this is the quarter in which Apple watch doesn't
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:54.880]   suck. It didn't universally suck before, but with the the third version of the watch,
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:00.320]   oh, as Apple seems to finally be making the watch that they would have made had they understood
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:06.480]   the market that this well two years ago. This is the one where if you were to ask me last year,
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:11.520]   if I should buy an Apple watch for for myself or for a friend or for somebody for Christmas,
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.200]   I'd say no, because they really haven't figured out what they want to do with it. It's kind of
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.040]   confusing and there's a lot of stuff that I don't really use it as much as I thought I would.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.320]   This year, I would say no, it's really great. It's really great watch. It costs no more than
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:26.960]   very little more than what you would get for a Fitbit with the same amount of features.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.400]   And it is quite useful and it's quite simple. And this is the year which I would recommend
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:35.840]   people buy a watch. I haven't seen any ads for the Apple watch, but apparently there has been one.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:40.960]   This is maybe why the sales are through the roof. I don't know.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:45.200]   No, it's a more coherent message and town news point is like it's really focused around fitness
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:49.520]   now and you can get in for $269, which is way cheaper as 20 bucks more than the middle level
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:55.520]   Fitbit which is a much better and it could be that similarly, there's no real tablet market,
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:59.520]   there's an iPad market, and then some lower priced ebook readers or video tablets.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:03.040]   It might just be that there's no smart watch market. There's the Apple watch and then a variety
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.800]   of Fitbit devices that are like the equivalent of it. And Fitbit in most cases isn't really a
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:11.680]   watch. I mean, I have the Fitbit Blaze which is kind of a watch. It does notifications and has time,
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:16.800]   but really Fitbits probably the mass majority of their sales is in the lower price fitness
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:22.720]   trackers as opposed to full-core watches. It's not concrete evidence, but the evidence that I
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:28.960]   sort of use sometimes to judge this stuff is are people outside my immediate tech circle asking me
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:33.440]   about Apple watch and stuff like that. And I'm getting a lot more of that now especially again,
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:39.280]   with the lower price points. I get a lot of people who are very interested in and of buying
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.840]   the series one. I think the series one is a nice level for a lot of people because you get the
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:48.000]   latest technology. You don't get everything in the series too, but you get that lower price point.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.840]   So I think a lot of people are responding to that sort of like Andy said, you know,
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:56.720]   that people are recommending them to their friends and family and it's starting to extend outside of
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:01.360]   just tech nerds getting these things. And I think that crossover point too with the fitness
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:06.240]   trackers, it is just a little bit more and you get a lot of extra functionality that you're maybe
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:10.320]   not going to get with the Fitbit. I had the funniest experience at the airport because
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.600]   almost always when I go to the airport, I just tap my Apple watch at the boarding machine and
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.680]   it goes through and every time the person at the machine is like, oh, is that going to work? Oh,
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.520]   it worked. Oh, that's so cool. And this time I did it and they just looked at me and raised up
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.080]   their Apple watch on their wrist and kind of smiled and I'm like, okay, it's starting to permeate.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:31.360]   I do see more of them, I have to say. Let me just check and see what the availability is.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:37.360]   This is a big story too because Apple still is having trouble getting these into stores.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.920]   Yeah. Let's see, 42 millimeter case. Let's see the series one.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:49.440]   Yeah, this you could get December 8th, series two, December 22nd. But the
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:54.000]   but the sport watch, I'm looking at the sport watch with the silver case in the white band.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.880]   The least expensive. Yeah, it varies by watch and by region. Like the Nike watch is
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:03.280]   concerned. Some of the some of the 38s are easily available. The 42s are not. It depends on exactly
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:07.760]   which one you're looking for. But people if people could just get them when they wanted them,
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.240]   I think the numbers would look different as well. All right, let's take a break.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.360]   Adam Anks is here from the Maccast. How long have you been doing?
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:20.880]   That's quite. Thanks to Christians. And I said it again. There's two Adams in the Mac world,
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:25.840]   unfortunately, and it's very confusing for me because I'm losing brain cells rapidly.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.560]   Adam Christiansen, how long have you been doing Maccast?
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:33.920]   Started in December of 2004. Longer than we've been doing this show.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.320]   Yeah. In fact, there weren't even podcasts. Oh, I guess there were. That was right at the
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:43.840]   beginning of podcasting. Right after we had Adam Curry and Don Andrew and some of those books were
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:49.040]   around. I was around. I did my first podcast in October, September, October of 2004.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.000]   But we didn't start Mac break weekly till the following year, I think.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:59.680]   Because I looked at your success and I said, "Damn it. Damn it. I remember you. You even did
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.440]   something back then. I don't know why. You even you contacted me and reached out to me at that
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.320]   time and said, "We're going to do this. You know, it's just going to be a big deal." I didn't want
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.720]   to step in that little terry. I was very polite. Not even necessary. It was great.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:17.600]   Well, I wouldn't do it today. In those days, there were only a handful.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:23.520]   It was only a handful. It was kind of like you had the category. I didn't want to step on you.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.040]   And you were very gracious in saying, "Go ahead and do it too." That was very gracious.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:32.160]   I didn't own podcasting. No one does that. There's plenty of room.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:36.960]   There's plenty of room for all of us. Maccast.com. Also, Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.880]   Times. When he started the Chicago Sun Times, I remember he has the Herald Tribune if it was
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:49.200]   okay. Way back in 1862. Great to have you. That was just the morning edition of the paper.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:55.120]   Right. You don't remember there used to be in every market a morning and evening, at least,
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:59.840]   a morning and evening paper. Red car costs just a nickel.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:06.240]   I used to deliver those. Did you? Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:12.080]   My brother-in-law, when we bought our house, we're kind of on the edge of town. And he said,
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:19.200]   "Oh, yeah. I used to deliver papers out here on a horse." Wow. Yeah, wow. Because he's not even that
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:27.120]   old. And also here from thefabulousimore.com who need to ask no permission for existing,
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:32.080]   because it is the one and the only, the best place to go to find out what's going on with your
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:40.880]   computers and your Macs and your watches and your straps. So many. And he also has a bunch of really
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:45.760]   good podcasts, including Apple Talk with the newest. Our show today brought to you by my mattress.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:53.920]   Love my Casper. Love it. Sleep is so important to me, as you probably could gather looking at me.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:59.440]   I like to sleep. And as I get older, I find a good night's sleep becomes more and more of a
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:05.520]   precious thing. Having a great mattress makes a huge difference. And Casper is a great mattress.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:11.600]   It breathes. It's cool. So you don't overheat. It's just a wonderful, wonderful mattress.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:17.280]   Time Magazine called it one of the best inventions of 2015. How about that, huh?
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:23.760]   I just, I love it. And now here's the deal. It's made in the US. You can get free shipping and
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:29.360]   returns in the US and Canada. Big Innovation Award for 2016. Fast Company Innovation Design
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:36.560]   Finalist 2015. Here's the thing. They save money by not having a showroom. Actually,
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.400]   I think they do in New York. I think there's some places where you can get a Casper showroom.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:46.080]   But the point is you really can't judge a mattress by what it feels like in the showroom.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:51.760]   So they give you a 100 night trial. You order your Casper mattress right now. It comes in a
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:57.120]   surprisingly compact box. Anything from a twin all the way up to California king. You open up the
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:02.880]   box. The mattress opens up. By the way, there's no latex smell or anything. I don't want to,
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:08.320]   you know, but it really, it's fresh. It's clean. You sleep, you could sleep on it immediately.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:14.240]   In fact, we did. Slipped on it immediately. And it was so comfortable. But if at any time in those
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:19.360]   first hundred nights, you say, well, I like my old mattress better. You call them. They'll come
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.240]   and get it. They'll take it. They don't put it back. You don't have to put it back in the box.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:27.120]   That would really be mean. You can't. You'd have to have a special machine, I think. But they'll
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.240]   come and get it. They'll pick it up and they'll get it out and they'll refund you every penny.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:38.320]   So this is really the beauty of the Casper mattress. C-A-S-P-E-R.com. The perfect mattress.

[00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:00.560]   temperature. I didn't even know what that is. Older. And they really, really, they tried 100
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:06.640]   different formulations to get the perfect mattress. And even if it's not perfect for you,

[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:41.200]   They copied our video. We haven't used shown that in a while,
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:46.160]   me jumping on the mattress, opening it up and jumping on it. Do we still have it? Anyway,
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:50.800]   I love my Casper. Terms and conditions apply for that $50 deal. And that is towards a mattress
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:56.640]   purchase, although Casper sells pillows, which I have to say, they say, don't mention the pillows.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:00.320]   They're really good pillows. Just pretend I didn't say anything. They're really good pillows.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:06.320]   They also sell a dog bed, I think, right? Have we got one? We didn't get one for Ozzy. We got to
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:11.840]   get the Casper. Maybe that's Ozzy's Christmas present. Do they still do that? I can't remember.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:17.840]   Casper.com, I guess not. Well, more products, let's see.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:26.560]   /MacBreak. And for the mattress, you can get, yes, I just thought of Ozzy's Christmas present.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:33.680]   For the mattress, $50 off and use Africa MACBreak terms and conditions apply. Why shouldn't Ozzy
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:39.840]   have a Casper? I already got one for her dog. Does he hear she like it?
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.720]   I think so. They come in. Oh, that's a pretty color. And they have it for different sizes.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:49.280]   He's a little dog, so I get the little one. That's really cool.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.320]   All right. Part of the fun is even just unboxing it.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:58.240]   Isn't it? As a kid, I always wanted to have one of those navy rafts where you pull the thing
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.000]   and suddenly explodes into shape. This was close enough.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.840]   It is a wonderful, wonderful mattress. We are talking about Apple.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:12.800]   MACBreak Weekly, the second longest running Macintosh podcast in the world.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:19.280]   It might not even be that, Adam, but you're the first. I'll grant you that.
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:26.880]   MACCasts with Adam Christensen at MACCast.com. There's a certain irony in this Apple.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:35.680]   It appears, according to rumors and reports, has taken the team that does the airport extreme
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:39.920]   and moved them over to the Apple TV. It would make sense in the new Apple that they probably
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:46.400]   wouldn't make routers anymore. At the same time, JADI Power released a study saying it is the number
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:54.320]   one customer satisfaction router in the world. Customer sat beating a SUS D-Link, Tp-Link,
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:58.560]   neckgear, Belkin, Lynxis, Lynxis, of course, on the bottom.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:04.080]   3,037 customers, they measured overall satisfaction,
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:09.440]   Wi-Fi range, reliability, speed of upload, download, restore connection, easily security capabilities,
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:13.360]   price, ease of use, variety of features, intuitive user interface and customer service.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:19.600]   And by a fairly large margin, Apple beat the average and became number one with 876 points out
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:24.480]   of a thousand. And it was not contrary to some fun, a Cupertino City survey.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:33.680]   I don't think that's going to change Apple's mind. Bloomberg, Marker.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.680]   I don't think we know Apple's mind, though. I think that a lot of times we see the elephant
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:41.840]   and we're like, "Oh, tail, this is clearly a tail, and oh, look, big snake." And there really is
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:46.080]   an elephant. So whether Apple is really getting rid of the routers, whether they're working on
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.920]   a next-generation router, they're making their own home hub, they're doing their going to build.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.360]   I mean, like I said, the rumor is Apple's going to be doing truly wireless charging next year.
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.640]   If you walk into your house and your phone starts charging, what is controlling that?
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.760]   What is it charging from? I mean, there's all sorts of interesting things going on.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.800]   Well, maybe the home hub is now the Apple TV.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:09.840]   Maybe. And maybe that team moving over to the Apple TV, what if the Apple TV became your router?
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.560]   Is your router, is your charger, is your home kit hub?
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:17.280]   Well, I think they'd like to sell you a lot of different things rather than roll. It doesn't
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:23.120]   make as much sense. But considering how exciting the idea of mesh networks is becoming in the home,
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:27.760]   if Apple were to decide to, we're going to make everything mesh, and not only does it allow us to
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:31.840]   deliver a more modern sort of networking experience that works better and more
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:38.720]   more installations, but now it's sort of slipping under the door. It allows us to put, here is a
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:44.080]   Apple device with the radios in it that is inside the bedroom. Here is one that's inside the living
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:50.480]   room. Here is one that's inside the kitchen. And now we've not in this creepy way, but now we know
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:55.200]   where somebody is by virtue of their, I know their watch is in the living room. So therefore,
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:00.320]   the user is in the living room. How can we improve the experience by knowing that's where somebody is?
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:05.600]   Can we send alerts instead of to everywhere in the house? Can we send it to expressly the device
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:10.160]   that they're closest to right now? There are a lot of things that they could do.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:15.680]   Rene has a good point that one of the frustrating things about the way Apple works is that they're
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:20.320]   not going to tell you why they're doing anything partly because they themselves don't know what
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.760]   they're going to be doing in a few years. They want to leave their options open. But it does so
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:27.360]   means that we can all be promoting the fact, "Oh, look, they're getting out of networking. Why
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:32.080]   they're getting out of networking?" And then come July, they're rolling out this amazing new product
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:36.800]   that makes me want to throw out the $300 stuff that I bought last year and replace it all with the
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:47.040]   new Apple stuff. We're going to do a review, I think, on this new screen savers on Saturday.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:53.280]   Dave Hamilton, another Mac, a lotcaster, has them all.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:57.760]   He wrote a great article over on his site.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:04.160]   And so Dave's going to come on and we're going to, and I think he's, we're just now getting the
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:08.480]   Google router just came out today. I should be getting mine this week.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:13.680]   I actually set it up about an hour before. I have the three unit station.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:22.720]   The only thing I can say right now is that it's positive that I started setting it up at like
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.200]   25 minutes before the show started. Wow.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.960]   And it finished just like five minutes before. I'm not using this now.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:33.920]   Always just wired. But I will say that it was very easy to set up.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:40.160]   It's basically self-configuring. And for the first time, I actually have decent Wi-Fi like here in
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:45.920]   the podcasting studio. And that's not because I have like one of the mesh pods like here.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:51.840]   It's actually another room away. But it seems to be working very, very well. It was easy to
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:55.680]   configure the box. The box is lovely. It's another box you want to save.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.160]   But yeah, it's I like it.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.280]   Yeah, we've been using the euro and they're a sponsor, by the way, but we've been using
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:05.200]   euro for some time and be very happy with it. But I'm getting once I get my Google, I'll set it up.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.280]   I have two networks in my house. Don't ask why.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.400]   Comcast. There's that's all you need to know.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:16.960]   I don't ask, but also Leo. I ordered Comcast business class. And then I thought they would turn
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.280]   off the consumer class, but they didn't. So then I went into the store because I found that
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.720]   that's a better way to deal with Comcast and said, hey, I don't want the consumer because I got the
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.800]   business class. They said, well, it's going to cost you. So what do you mean? Well, it actually
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:34.880]   cost you more not to get rid of the consumer. So I don't know if they're I just kept them both
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:40.800]   with help, but this but it makes me a perfect test bed for testing side by side. The Apple,
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.720]   not the Apple. I did use an airport extreme until I got the Asus.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.880]   Very happy with the Asus AC3.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.880]   Kerry Hilton, just posted his Google Wi-Fi review and Android Central. He loved it. He thought that
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:53.760]   they're all good. All the meshes are good. But if you're deeply ensconced in the Google
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.240]   ecosystem, it makes a ton of sense to go with Google Wi-Fi.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:46:01.280]   Yeah. Mesh gets me really excited because I've tried a lot of different solutions, including,
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:05.680]   well, what if I set up another Wi-Fi base station separate in the podcast? Any place where I have
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:11.200]   really, really terrible reception? What if I were to a create a plug another router Wi-Fi router
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:16.480]   into a wired ethernet? Or what if I were to plug in another device, but make it into a Wi-Fi
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:21.200]   extender? And there are always performance trade-offs and things that will start working,
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:26.320]   but stop working because the topology of the network, because networks really are fundamentally
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:34.240]   designed to be created and maintained by folks who are experts in networking. Because if you just
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:38.880]   try to, it'll all work great the day you move into your house and you set everything up. But
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.960]   over the next three years, as you add extenders, as you add different drops, if you add switches
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:48.880]   here and there, suddenly you'll get a frame drop that lasts for like 10 minutes and then you don't
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:54.560]   know why. And you don't fix until you take out everything and rebuild everything to make more
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:47:00.800]   common sense. So I like Mesh because it seems to be a better attitude towards how do we extend
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:07.200]   the size and the range of a Wi-Fi network? We just simply basically drop a bubble of Wi-Fi
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:12.640]   that's maintained by multiple sprinkler heads rather than try to say, well, we've got this,
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:17.760]   we've got three different soldiers fighting to keep things alive and some of them are going to
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:23.360]   be up and some of these are going to be falling on their own swords. So after two hours, nothing
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:28.400]   has caught on fire yet. So that's my two hour review is it's good stuff. Well, mine's right now
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:35.600]   in Chicago, Illinois and will be here in a few days. So I will set it up as well. I do think these
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:39.040]   Mesh Solutions are a better solution. I think if Apple were going to stay in this business, it
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:42.400]   really would have to offer something. How many knows to get, how many of the little
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:50.000]   I got the three pack. I have a three pack of Euro. But by the way, the verge review said the fastest
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:57.200]   of the three was the Orbe, the neckier Mesh. They all, I have to say they all seem very similar,
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:02.480]   at least in terms of the internals. I think it really has something, the software is really what's
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:07.280]   going to be this separating factor. And then there's these little plume things, which are
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:10.960]   interesting because they're cheap, they're 75 bucks, but you're supposed to put one in every
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.480]   room that you want Wi-Fi in. And then they hand off. So I don't know.
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:19.520]   You know, anyway, I'm looking forward to seeing David's review because I think he's trying to
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:23.600]   maul in. And then eventually, Holmes will just be built with Mesh networks in the walls.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.680]   Right. So don't worry about this anymore. Right.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:32.080]   Yeah. You'll look for the infrastructure. Let's also do a plug for, I'm a big fan. I tweeted
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:36.560]   something this morning about wired networks because Amazon had to deal on like this really nice
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:42.960]   five, five port hub, excuse me, switch that I like a lot. I have like four or five, six, seven of them
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:49.440]   in the house. I feel like wired ethernet is a lot like LED light bulbs, where you will start off by
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:55.040]   putting it in one place where it makes absolute crystal clear sense. And then over the course of
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:01.760]   two or three years, you will wind up putting a switch in every single room, not because it was
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:07.520]   absolutely necessary. But because now you're not intimidated by cable and your spouse is no longer
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:13.920]   upset that there are cables running through the floor or that you've drilled holes to make
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:19.520]   cable drops. I don't think anything will ever match the speed and the reliability of just playing
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:24.720]   old cat six ethernet. No, it's really nice. In fact, yeah, if you're building a house, put in
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:30.320]   put in a hard wire in every room, you'll be happy. In fact, I've been very tempted to have there's a
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:33.920]   guy in town who will come out and spend time in my crawl space.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:41.760]   Back home, my problem there is you're getting less and less places to plug the other end in. So
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:46.320]   it's great you got it in the wall. But what's the kind of running to a special if you're a
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:52.560]   Mac owner, I just upgraded to a 2015 and I still don't have, I still got to go out and buy the dongle.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:56.160]   Yeah, that's a good point. Nobody has yet.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:02.240]   And also, when the reasons why it became such a big issue not having Wi-Fi here is that
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:07.520]   like I do a lot of stuff that's on my iPad, I like to have like my iPad sort of like as a status
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:11.200]   screen. And sometimes I just want to, I started running something in a coffee shop and I just
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:16.560]   want to continue it here in the iPad. And when I get like one bar that keeps dropping in and out.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:22.000]   So and you also want to have your phone able to automatically connect and do its sinking thing
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.880]   without having to wait and wait for another three or four days for it to find another spot.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:31.840]   So unfortunately it's a it's a wireless world, but it's not necessarily always optimally a wireless
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:37.760]   world. It's so interesting how networking, which was really the province of the magic priesthood at
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:42.720]   war. God. Now something we are all doing. I was just Dr. Mom said, well, one of the reasons the
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:47.040]   Orbea looks better is got four ethernet ports on the back. So you don't have to buy as many hubs.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:52.720]   And I just responded, well, I ended up buying two 24 port TP link switches because it was just
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:51:03.600]   easier to have 24 24. Really 48 ports. But that's because on my home theater, I want everything wired.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:09.120]   Exactly. And it keeps getting like worse and worse because I had it, I finally had to upgrade the
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:15.120]   switch in my bedroom because it finally went from the start getting so crazy that I need to have
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:20.000]   ethernet for like my laptop on the nightstand in case you know, I want to stay in bed for six hours,
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.200]   but still work. And now I've have three different network devices on the TV. And that's why it's like,
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:30.400]   if I'm going to try to keep all of this managed on Wi-Fi versus all I got to do is remind myself
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:35.360]   not to trip over that big ethernet cable that's that's nailed to the nail to the header board on
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:40.800]   the on the stairs going up, I would much rather have ethernet. And now there's almost no there's
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:46.080]   almost no room that I spend at more than 30 minutes sitting in any given day that does not have an
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:52.320]   ethernet hub in it. You need both really you need Wi-Fi for your swag. It's funny they could
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:57.920]   make a portable ethernet. I mean, I would just be well good. But this is why these mesh hubs,
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:03.280]   I think, are as a category, because we really do rely on speedy Wi-Fi and.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:07.760]   It's kind of the point where you don't have Wi-Fi, you just feel like like powers out or like the
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:13.120]   phones aren't working. It's like utility is now missing. That's why we need better internet.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:17.120]   That would be the next thing to get some decent internet. I think that's probably true in Canada
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:22.640]   too. Internet 3.0. Yeah. All right. It's fine. It's just expensive. I finally bit the bullet.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:33.440]   I should have done this ages ago and bought a big Synology 5, a hard, you know, array because
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:37.280]   and I'm going to get two of them when I wanted work and went at home because they'll sync with
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:44.080]   each other. And then the backup the max to it, use it for instead of Dropbox,
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:50.960]   use its share capabilities as a Dropbox instead of ever knows, it's note capability.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:54.880]   Yeah. I don't think I'll use as a media server so much. I know a lot of people do.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:59.360]   But I finally just said, you know what, I've because I've been doing all I've been doing it,
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:04.560]   you know, bits and pieces. I just need a effective overall strategy, I think, at this point.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:11.600]   Anaz is the Synology that I bought three years ago, that's got to be in terms of bang for the
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:17.040]   dollar. I can't think of a single other thing that I bought where year after year is I think of new
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:21.600]   things I would like to do. I'll find oh, there's an answer somewhere in the Synology. It's pretty
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:25.520]   amazing that I have got there. Yeah. I mean, as I decided that I need, I don't I'm going to ditch
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:30.240]   I want God, how do I ditch iTunes? Oh, well, I can actually set a Synology to do that. How do I ditch
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:35.440]   like cable? Okay. Well, I actually set up Synology as my TV server. Even security cameras, you know.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:40.880]   Yeah, security cameras for even for how do I make sure that I can get access to this no matter where
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:46.240]   I am in the world. And I'm thinking that, oh, here's a here's a wonderful custom service and device
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:50.880]   that they will put my photos and here and there and everywhere it doesn't work. And then I belated
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:56.000]   to realize that or I could download this free Synology photos app that will that be through
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.960]   the central service will find my NAS and connect me to all of my documents and all my movies and
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:07.520]   all my oh, okay, I actually I spent $300 three years ago and that's really all I ever needed
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:14.480]   to spend on this. Okay, got that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Time machine for people who are worried about
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:20.720]   the loss of the time capsule, the time machine integration with the Synology has for me worked
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:24.160]   great. It's been a great solution because my kids won't plug into anything. They're like,
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:28.720]   ew, they're like, people, and I need to back up their stuff. But they can have their own Synology
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:33.520]   account. And it's a time machine backup. Yep. The one thing I heard and I have, you know,
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:38.160]   I feel like I'm the last man of this party. The one thing I've heard is that you can't do that magic,
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:44.240]   you know, the thing that comes up with the top with the stars fields going backwards and you can
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:48.320]   go back in time, it does have versioning, but it doesn't allow you to do that. Or is that not
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:52.640]   having to try that? Yeah, I don't I won't miss that. In fact, I don't use time machine, but I think
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:57.760]   I might because that's a really good, it's a nice like extra like you already have your backup
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:02.880]   stratagunist. It's a redundant, excellent, very low effort. It's funny because I asked Lisa this
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:07.760]   morning, so I'm getting this thing. Do you need backup? She said, no, I do everything in the cloud.
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:12.800]   And that's the reason this is kind of even this is going to be obsolete for most people because
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:19.600]   they use Evernote or they use Gmail or they use iCloud. And so they don't, Lisa doesn't worry
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:25.120]   about backing up anymore because all her documents are in the cloud. I still would back up. Yeah,
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:29.840]   you're kind of trusting. I had this thing yesterday where iCloud was down for a while and at the
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:36.080]   exact time, right? But I had the same like Gmail was coming back is can't find SMTP can't find IMAP.
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:41.360]   And so I was like bombed off of email for about an hour and a half yesterday before Gmail came up
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:45.520]   before iCloud did, but I just couldn't use anything. And I was another stark reminder that this
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:50.960]   cloud stuff is wonderful until something happens and you really need that. And that and then just
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:56.160]   kind of overall concern about security, privacy and so forth is kind of prompted me to start looking
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:00.640]   at this has been a year long process of looking at different ways to run my own cloud. And I've
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:05.680]   been using sandstorm, which I really like. But once I realized that Disk Station Manager does all
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:10.320]   of the thing, including because it supports Docker, you can add anything that Docker supports,
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:14.560]   which is everything. I mean, you could run you can run your website from here. You could do
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:20.160]   everything from here. So I only think on it is, you know, it is fairly easy, but I would say it's
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:23.280]   not it's not like mom. Yeah. Yeah. My mom.
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:28.960]   Oh, let's do it. But no, you know, anybody with reasonable computer skills, I think, can
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:34.480]   it? It's basically a Linux machine. Yeah. You know, that's basically just optimized for an S with
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:40.800]   lots of disks. But but the but what people what might scare people off, we should tell people that
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:47.760]   when I want to do something with my NAS, it is I open up a web, I click a link on my that I book
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:53.920]   marked and I basically am looking at a GUI desktop with windows and icons. And it really is just like
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:57:00.000]   using a modern GUI based desktop running apps and whenever I want to update something, it's not
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:05.520]   different, really different from going to the app store and and clicking a link to update software.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:13.120]   The only things that become a little bit hairy are when you have to install stuff that's not part
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:17.680]   of like the package manager, not not part of the app store, so to speak. And even that's just you
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:22.960]   download it and then you point the this piece of software on the NAS to please install this or
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:29.920]   please update this. But it I there are a lot of things that have been going through my mind over
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:36.400]   the past few weeks. And one of them is the do I have how concerned should I be about having
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:44.240]   even more than usual should I be more concerned about having my data on Dropbox or on a shared
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:50.640]   cloud system versus a box that I control by myself. And if I wanted to unplug it and take it off the
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:55.440]   internet completely for a couple of days, I could actually do that literally by pulling a plug and
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:58:03.120]   now nothing can actually get at this data. And it's always the balance between how confident I am that
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:10.720]   am I that Dropbox will tell tell somebody to go to hell without asking for if they ask for my data
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:15.760]   without the proper paperwork to say yes, you are you have a court order, you have a warrant,
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:19.920]   there's all this stuff versus well, it's easier for us to just give people access, give this person
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:26.880]   access to Andy stuff versus how bad will my secure if I'm the security officer of my NAS,
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:31.920]   how bad a job will I do. Yeah, that's a good question. When you would you at least for me,
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:38.960]   I'd prefer Google does this. Yeah, because I'm not I'm not I'm not a political dissident. I'm a
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:42.640]   journalist, but I don't write negative things about the Syrian government or anything like that.
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:47.280]   So I don't believe I'm a hacking target. But these are things that kind of get on your mind when you
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:51.920]   well and I don't know who are these who is Synology and where are they located. I mean,
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:56.720]   you're also somewhat trusting them to keep the firmware in any packages they might have gotten
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:03.360]   open source. You know, I feel like I feel like I I just discovered the Beatles, you know, you guys
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:08.720]   are going, yeah. But you're is interesting. Pointly, like remember when there was all the
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:12.720]   controversy about some countries that might let Blackberry like might give their government's access
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:16.880]   to the Blackberry squid servers and Microsoft was all too happy to point out, well, you can't do
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:20.480]   that with exchange because every note is separate. You have to go after every single business that
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:25.280]   runs in exchange server and this is similar to me. It's possible someone might eventually do a
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:29.360]   grand interception of everything on Google or everything on iCloud or everything on Microsoft.
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:32.880]   But if you if you're running your own NAS in your house, that's something that they have to
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:38.880]   literally go bought like box by box by box by box. Right. Yeah, that's true. It's not a single
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:46.400]   attack service. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I just I haven't done anything with it yet. So I'm not,
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:50.320]   this isn't a review, although look, there you got three people using it. That's a sign.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:55.600]   Yeah. Do you use it to Renee? Yeah, I have one right here.
[00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:01.920]   Really, I feel like, and just and just to underscore this, when I first bought it,
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:08.480]   I only bought it as a way to have a big file server. I did not buy it for any other reason than
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:13.440]   I want to have like a central file server that will have five level store files because I didn't
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:18.480]   want to have to keep a Mac running 24/7 to do that. And then it just as I say, it's like every three
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:22.320]   months, like, yeah, I really would love to do this. Like, oh, that's right. I can actually do that on
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:27.360]   the NAS. And one of those things, once you have it, you find another use for it. So like I do web
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:32.320]   development, and I've always set up websites locally on my my Mac, you know, for doing development.
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:36.720]   And, you know, it's got Docker on there. I can brew all kinds of stuff at it and set up,
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:41.520]   you know, virtualized environments all day long. It supports Node.js. It supports Tomcat,
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:52.400]   Apache. I mean, you really there's it's kind of an amazing thing. Also, I feel like a big networking
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:58.560]   stud that I have this. That's the thing when you when I see my 24 just a 20 buy a 24 port switch,
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:01.840]   you want to feel like a stud in the lights blink, and you go, I don't know what's going on,
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:10.000]   but I got quite a closet. The consumer version of that switch doesn't have nearly as many
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.320]   blinking lights as that one. And the case is made of metal metal metal.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:20.320]   Metal. Let's take a break. Come back with more. Annie and I co Chicago Sun times Renee Richie,
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:28.080]   i'm more.com the wonderful Adam Christians and Mac cast.com. Our show today brought to you by
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:33.760]   Gazelle as you eyeball all the cool new gadgets that could be in your life. Do not forget
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:42.080]   that you can sell the old gadget at Gazelle G A Z E L L E dot com. You can go in to Gazelle
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:46.880]   dot com and get a quote now that's guaranteed for 30 days. You're not locked in. They are.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:52.160]   And that's really nice. That means you have 30 days to decide to get the new gadget. Now a
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:57.120]   day sometimes does take a while to set it up, transfer it over, make sure you're happy,
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:00.880]   and then pull the trigger Gazelle pays a shipping on anything worth more than a buck.
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:05.600]   They turn it around fast. If you can't or forget to wipe the data, they'll do that for you. They
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:11.680]   even buy broken iPhones and iPads. They'll give you a good good price for those even at Gazelle
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:19.280]   dot com payments come in cash by a check PayPal or Amazon gift card. If you could,
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.400]   you know, if you're going to buy a Synology and ask just get all those Amazon gift cards because
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:28.720]   they bump it up by 5% even better. You can also buy a Gazelle. This is something relatively new
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:36.480]   Gazelle takes the very best pre-owned devices in only a couple of categories iPhones from the
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:46.320]   6s and the 6s plus iPads, Samsung Galaxy phones, and after a very rigorous 30 point inspection,
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:51.760]   we'll sell it to you at a very affordable price. You get to choose the quality so slightly used,
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:58.560]   like new. Every device is backed by a 30 day return policy and of course it works with the
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:05.280]   major carriers AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint, but there's no carrier contract. That's awfully
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:10.640]   nice. They also provide a financing now through a firm and they can do that at checkout. So you
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:17.280]   just check the box. It provides some basic information and you can get financing. They also offer 12
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:22.480]   month warranties for cell phones and iPads powered by assurance solutions that cover the usual but
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:30.080]   also water damage, crack screens, hardware defects and more. G-A-Z-E-L-L-E to buy or to sell,
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:40.000]   it's got to be Gazelle. It's the smart way to recycle and to do a good thing for the environment.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:48.720]   And we love them. Gazelle.com. We're mentioning the Synology. One of the options is Calendar.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.680]   You can use it instead of Google Calendar. I probably won't or iCloud Calendar, but at least you
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:00.160]   probably don't get iCloud Calendar spam on your Synology. That's what's been going on Renee. That
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:05.600]   is wild. I actually got the double whammy. Most people got one or the other, but I got the double
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:09.600]   whammy. So for a while now, we've all known about email spam and that is people just send you
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:13.680]   unsolicited email messages, but we're getting better and better services like Gmail and all
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:18.960]   sorts of other solutions are giving you ways to block those. So at some point, it seems like very
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:24.880]   recently in the last few weeks, spammers decided, "Hey, email is getting harder. Let's try other stuff."
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:29.200]   And one of the things they tried was iCloud Calendar spam. So what they basically do is just
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.440]   start adding you to Calendar invites. And as long as they have their email address, those calendar
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:38.160]   invites send push notifications and you can decline it, but then they get an email back.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:43.600]   And I managed to avoid this one, but at the same time, I started getting Google Docs spam because
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:47.920]   it turns out as long as someone's Gmail address, you can add them to Docs folders. And I opened up
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:54.320]   my Gmail, actually look at Macbreak weekly last week, and there was 30 entries for parts
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:05:00.560]   availability from China for all sorts of things like screens and radios. And both those things
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:05.280]   just started bombing us back to the early days of the internet. So I actually had this problem at
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:11.120]   one point, maybe a year ago with Google calendars through Google+, people were able to invite me
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:16.000]   to their Google+ event, even though I had no interest in it, and it showed up my calendar,
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.880]   which was incredibly annoying. Facebook groups were like that for a while too.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:24.000]   Yeah. So the solution I think is the same in all three cases, which is to not have...
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:31.280]   This is from iMore. And a good article at iMore by Lori Gill.
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:37.360]   Apple is apparently working on this. In fact, they've even contacted some of our listeners
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:43.200]   saying, "Give us more information about this spam so we can help fight it." But I think Apple's
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:50.160]   plan is to treat it like spam and block the sources. This would block it from going into your calendar.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:54.800]   You go into the calendar settings, click on the advanced window, and check the box that says
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:06:01.920]   email to... And it will... Then it makes them... You still are going to get them, but they'll go into
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:06.480]   your email account where they'll presumably be spamified. And some people have said that if they
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:10.720]   block calendar, it invites through apps that that is fixed, because maybe some people are using apps
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:16.320]   to send these masks calendar invites. What I would like is an ability to restrict it. I think all
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:19.600]   this is well and good, but I would like, for example, to say only allow calendar invites from
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:24.880]   contacts. And maybe that'll cause me to miss out on some, but 99% of the time I'm getting
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:29.360]   calendar invites from people I already know. I do have to say, I got some great deals on RayBans,
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:37.760]   but no, no, I didn't. Apple says we're actively identifying and blocking senders. Now, this
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:45.040]   was a statement to you, actually, at iMore. We're sorry that some of our users are receiving spam
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:49.360]   calendar invitations. We're actively working to address this issue by identifying and blocking
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:57.920]   suspicious senders and spam in the invites. So that is one way to do that. This is from Renee's
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:04.000]   Twitter account. That's one way to do it. But I think ultimately a two-pronged approach.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.280]   I'm sure Apple will be on top of this now. The other thing I've noticed is though, since that
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:14.160]   black, it was kind of right around Black Friday when these things showed up. And I personally,
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:18.720]   I didn't really change any of the settings. And I haven't seen any sense knock on wood. Hopefully,
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:22.000]   hopefully that's Apple doing whatever they're doing on their side.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.040]   Okay, good.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:30.000]   So, it kind of shows you like, I'm way less. I thought that the Google had actually fixed the
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.240]   docs spam that I got one yesterday randomly. And I'm hoping that that's just, but it's hard.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:38.400]   This stuff is a non-trivial problem to solve because anyone who operated any sort of software
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:42.000]   on the earlier internet knows that you cannot establish a feature that people can't figure out
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.320]   a way to sort of take advantage of for their own benefit.
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:48.880]   On the face of it, the idea that somebody could email a calendar invite to you and have it
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:53.440]   appear in your calendar is kind of... But every calendar allows that because in business,
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:54.640]   that's a very common use.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:59.600]   Outlook and Exchange servers and all of that. That's how it works.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:03.680]   And it's really useful. I get a lot of calendar invites from work, right?
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:10.240]   To conference calls and go to meetings and things. And so, the disadvantage to me is,
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:14.240]   I'm going to have to turn those off because people have figured out a way to spam it.
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.560]   But we use Google Docs for my job.
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.480]   And we just add...
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:18.960]   Exactly.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.960]   People are not so... No, I'll share the doc with you.
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.520]   And as long as you know their email address, it just works.
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:26.640]   And now they're going to have to find a way of making that not work as easily for me.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:27.280]   I don't like that.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:27.520]   Right.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:34.480]   I mean, I just kind of... You have a combination of rage and depression over this.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:40.000]   It just kind of makes me... It gets me in that kind of moody,
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.760]   emo teenager point of view that there is nothing so wonderful that humans can
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:51.440]   create that another human looks at it and thinks there must be a way I can wreck this for everybody.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:56.160]   It feels like that's getting worse. Like there's more people who are willing to be jerks
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:00.480]   on the internet than there used to be. Is that true or is it more of the jerks
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.840]   or getting internet savvy?
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:02.480]   Yeah.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:03.760]   They have more access to jerks.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:08.880]   More people on the internet means the percentage of jerks goes up along with the overall users.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.440]   And they're billion...
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.720]   But back with us, this skyrocket.
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:11.840]   Stop being jerks.
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.960]   Actually, none of the jerks listen to this show, so we're...
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:18.400]   The access points are increasing exponentially.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:22.080]   The vectors, the attack vectors just go up exponentially every day.
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:28.080]   It does feel like the internet is to some degree given people a license to be
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.680]   doofuses.
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.880]   Now you're putting your refrigerator in your washing machine.
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:33.200]   Right.
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.520]   So it's increased that range.
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:38.480]   How about the battery issues with the MacBook Pro?
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:42.480]   You know, last week I used my new MacBook Pro with a touch bar on the show.
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.800]   Now I was using Chrome.
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:49.360]   And it lasted just as long as the show about two hours for the 15 inch.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.760]   That's, of course, way below what it supposed to be.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:56.560]   But I do think it's Chrome because I started using Safari on it and the battery life is much, much better.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.960]   Yeah, I think there's two things going on there.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.320]   One is I think their API is seriously out of its mind right now.
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.400]   And I did check with a few people who are used to it and it goes,
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:08.160]   "Yeah, it'll report like 14 hours and then three hours and then 16 hours."
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:09.680]   Maybe we should just say after 10 hours.
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:10.880]   It's just 10 hours.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.560]   So I think that Apple...
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.240]   Whatever's gone wrong with that,
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.000]   Apple needs to fix because if you think you have 14 hours and then it's told four hours,
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.160]   you just, you lose faith with the entire system.
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.240]   And the other thing is that we...
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:23.600]   It's like same thing with phones.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.440]   A phone when they measured performance before it was based on standard internet usage.
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:30.400]   And you can go back to the early days of Google or Apple talking about battery life.
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:33.200]   And it's they thought you were surfing the web and reading your emails.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.760]   And now we're Snapchatting and Pokemon Go and Facebook.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:39.840]   And these are much, much heavier battery consuming apps.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:42.560]   And the same thing is true on laptops.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.760]   We're running all sorts of video editing software.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.160]   Slack, to me, has been just as bad as Chrome.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:51.120]   Slack never used to be a problem, but now Slack is running audio APIs.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:53.200]   And it's basically an absolutely unsolicited browser.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.600]   And it's hitting my battery like nobody's business.
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:59.200]   And we have to come to terms with the fact that these apps are draining more.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:03.200]   So I think Apple has to sort of rejigger how they measure battery life in a modern context.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:04.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.440]   I mostly feel about...
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.320]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:10.080]   I was just gonna say I'm also a little leery anytime a new machine comes out.
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:14.320]   And it's the first couple of weeks to take too much, you know, to put too much on these.
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:17.040]   Because even Apple themselves now with the operating system,
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.560]   you migrate your stuff over.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:21.680]   And there's like all these kinds of background processes going on.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:24.400]   If you're using iCloud Photo Library, it's indexing your drives,
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.120]   it's doing all this other stuff, right?
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.200]   So I think things need to calm down a little bit.
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.480]   I think there is maybe something here,
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.200]   because I've had a couple of people when I talked about this on my show,
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:36.480]   email me and say, "Yeah, I got two or three hours."
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:39.760]   So I think it's a combination of some software things, new machine,
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.160]   and some of the things that Renee mentioned.
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:42.880]   Rev Aboard.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:43.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:44.080]   Rev Aboard.
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.520]   I never want to first go up anything.
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:49.120]   I never know how we feel about a lot of this stuff where...
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:54.160]   I admire the fact that Apple keeps trying to figure out how to extend the battery life
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:55.040]   any way possible.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.000]   If there's an extra 20 minutes they can squeeze out of an app,
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.840]   just by changing a new API or having it behave in a certain fashion,
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.760]   you never know when that's gonna be the 20 minutes that allows somebody to finish their dock
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:09.360]   and send it before a deadline, before the battery finally goes the way
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.040]   a place of ghosts and winds.
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.200]   On the other hand, we don't want a situation where
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:18.320]   there's a conditional to every single battery life statement that Apple makes,
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:21.280]   where, "Oh, are you not using the Apple branded browser?"
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:21.920]   Oh, there you go.
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.360]   You'd use the Apple branded browser.
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:26.480]   Or, "Oh, are you using Microsoft Office?"
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.080]   "Oh, I'm sorry. That's an edge case."
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:32.080]   If you switch to iWork, however, you'll find that you won't have it.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:35.280]   Okay, but what if I want to use the software that I want to use?
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:41.040]   Nonetheless, I appreciate them finding places to save battery life for everybody.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:46.800]   I just sometimes I wish that there were a way that they could sort of pull out.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.480]   Here's how we came to that number.
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:51.520]   Here's how much it works with optimized software.
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.760]   Here's how well it works with non-optimized software.
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:58.720]   Even if we're just them bagging the gun, here's how hard we work.
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:04.320]   Here's how much work we put into the Safari browser to make a hammer of the battery,
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:05.920]   much less than our competitors browsers.
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:08.240]   I think that should be surface a little bit better than they're doing right now.
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:11.840]   People are getting really different results.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.840]   I get about eight hours consistently on the 13-inch MacBook Pro with the touch bar.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.040]   I've been testing that.
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:20.000]   That's when I traveled to Petaluma with, and I was using all the time.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.240]   And it's less than they told me.
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:23.920]   They told me 10 hours, and yeah, I'm running Slack.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:29.360]   But again, if the Apple Intel messages were not making computers more powerful,
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:32.560]   or making them more efficient, then they've got to show me that efficiency.
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.160]   Otherwise, that message is simply not true.
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:37.680]   If they say 10 hours of battery, we've got to be getting 10 hours of battery.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:40.000]   And yeah, maybe it's nine hours if you're running Chrome or whatever.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:40.880]   That's still within.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.560]   I haven't been getting great battery life.
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:43.600]   Is there anything we can do?
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:44.400]   The 15-inch is different.
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.800]   So the 15-inch has a discrete graphics.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.440]   What Apple does is use both the integrated and the discrete graphics,
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.560]   and it's going to default to integrated graphics to try to save you power.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:56.000]   But when that discrete graphics comes up, it's got to power that separate card.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.120]   And in some cases, that's what you want, because you want fast, final cut rendering.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:04.080]   You want, but in some cases, apps are just rendering to the buffer to make text scroll better.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:08.720]   Like I remember the original version of Tweety for Mac was kicking in the discrete GPU all the time,
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.320]   even though probably really didn't have to.
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:15.440]   So anytime that discrete GPU hits, but it still shouldn't be two hours.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:15.920]   That's way-
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:20.960]   So it's not a hardware issue, and it's something that could be fixable in software over time, you think?
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.400]   I hope so.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.160]   And again, these are brand new machines.
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.320]   And a lot of old timers will say don't buy Revavors, but I think it's more like,
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:32.240]   if you buy a brand new machine immediately, there will be hiccups as a million people
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:35.280]   find all the problems that no Tweety, the apartment in the world, could find.
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:38.480]   And if they don't react quickly and they don't update it quickly, then that's an issue.
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:41.440]   But as long as they're responsive and they're looking into it, I think it's good.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:45.120]   Basically, what I do now is whenever I'm around a Type-C connector of any kind,
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:47.840]   I just plug it in to see what happens and usually it charges.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:51.840]   Well, that's what Steve was saying is iPads are always plugged in.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:55.200]   So it's less of a pain point for me.
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:59.040]   But if I were traveling with it, I might be a little more perturbed.
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.800]   I made the whole flight without any issue of this.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.480]   It was six and a half hours and I was still having a full plenty of battery left when I got off.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:09.280]   Now, what I didn't know, and this is from nine of five Mac, is that they default now to
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:12.960]   scaled non-native retina display.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.080]   Is that true?
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:14.960]   Yep.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:20.880]   Yeah, I verified this because somebody brought this to my attention and I did some research on it.
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:23.840]   I don't know that it's a huge issue.
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.840]   It's just an interesting change.
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:30.160]   So when you're on that default setting, I forget the numbers.
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.520]   It looks like...
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:35.680]   It says 1680 by 1050.
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:41.120]   Yeah. And if you drop down one level from there, I think you end up on the, what would be the
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.800]   two to one sort of...
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.160]   So the native is 2880 by 1800.
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:49.920]   So if you dropped down, you'd be a 1440 by 900.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.440]   But that's not even 1080p.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:58.640]   But I haven't noticed it looks bad, but I am a little perturbed that it's scaled.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:00.240]   They've been scaling.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.120]   So for the last, I forget it was Mountain or before Mountain.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:06.880]   They did a really, really good desktop scalar they started using because
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:09.280]   Apple originally wanted to go to resolution independence,
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.600]   but everyone realized that that was a beautiful, beautiful dream.
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:14.400]   That was never going to be a reality, which is why they started going to retina.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:17.040]   But it's the same scalar they use in the iPhone.
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.840]   I believe it's the same scalar they use in the iPhone pluses,
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:24.080]   which are internally 4x, but are 3x, but are dropped down to 1080p for the screen.
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.480]   I also kind of resent it that they don't let me...
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:31.040]   They've really dumbed down this control panel, and this has been for some time.
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:32.320]   And all it says is, you know...
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:34.160]   Best for retina.
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:34.960]   Best, whatever.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:37.120]   It doesn't even say that anymore.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:40.320]   It says default for display or scaled, and it chooses...
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:41.680]   I don't...
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.040]   More space?
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.680]   I would love to have a setting that says,
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:48.240]   "Well, I'd just like to see one to one for dot.
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.280]   What does that look like?"
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.200]   Now, I've done it before because you can...
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:55.600]   Third-party utilities let you do it, and it's unusable because everything's so tiny.
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.760]   But sometimes you'd want that.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:58.880]   Now, right...
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:03.440]   Because it's a high DPI display, apps like Lightroom and Photoshop,
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:06.560]   when you're looking at a photo, do go one to one.
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:09.200]   It's so confusing.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:09.760]   And so does OpenGL.
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:12.320]   I guess that's why they do this, is because they don't...
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.080]   Don't worry, we'll take care of this for you.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.680]   Right?
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.920]   I mean, yeah, so their audience is increasingly...
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:23.360]   Again, the Mac audience is hugely different now than it was even five or 10 years ago,
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.480]   where most people buy notebooks,
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.160]   most people don't connect external to...
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:29.600]   Like, what single digit 1% of people connect external displays
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.800]   and worry about this kind of stuff?
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:35.040]   Is there any reason we should not go into our display settings and do
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:41.280]   1,400 by 900, which is an even division of the full native resolution?
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:42.880]   Wouldn't that look better?
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:45.280]   And Photoshop would still give you one to one when...
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:49.600]   If you are someone like Lauren Brickerer or Michael...
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:53.600]   Like people who could see tiny, tiny pixels and frames dropping,
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.560]   and half scan lines.
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:58.480]   It'll annoy you and you'll want to change it.
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.960]   But for the vast majority of people, it makes no difference.
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:03.920]   And 900 is not a lot of pixels in vertical height on a web page.
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.680]   So it doesn't really show you a lot of information.
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:08.000]   So most people are better off with a scaled version.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.160]   I think the fact that this happened when these new machines came out
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.640]   and we're just talking about it now, what a couple of weeks later...
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:15.360]   We didn't notice.
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.880]   Nobody really noticed this.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:20.320]   Says a lot about the quality of the scaler that Apple put in there
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.000]   and probably went into their decision going,
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.600]   "This is probably okay to do because the majority of people,
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:26.640]   it's not going to matter."
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:27.520]   Here's how...
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:29.600]   So I have a high DPI display in front of me.
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:32.480]   This is the Surface Studio from Microsoft.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.920]   And it's 4,500 by 3,000.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:38.160]   I mean, it's super high resolution, but it's 20.
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.320]   So here's what they do with the control panel.
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.840]   Change the size of text and other items.
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.040]   200% recommended.
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:45.120]   That's that screen doubling.
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.280]   So it is equally kind of dumbed down,
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.320]   but you can go then to advanced display settings
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:55.360]   and see actual resolution and choose actual resolution.
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:59.280]   And I kind of would like some solution a little bit like that, right?
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:01.680]   Or maybe a real time where you could actually see a simulation
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:02.560]   of what the differences are.
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.160]   I still don't know if the numbers are really...
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.000]   Yeah, no, they're not.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:06.560]   ...hake to people.
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.280]   Yeah, but so maybe like have a screen next to it
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:10.400]   and show the text getting bigger,
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.160]   getting smaller, the amount of information you could...
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:13.360]   I mean, Microsoft...
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:14.080]   I presume Apple does.
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:14.640]   I can't remember.
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:16.400]   No, they don't do the same thing.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.720]   When you change the resolution on a Windows display,
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:20.880]   it says...
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.080]   Linux says this too.
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:22.960]   Okay, what do you think?
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:23.440]   Do you like this?
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:24.960]   Keep it or should we revert?
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.040]   Because it's unlike a Mac,
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:28.560]   it's conceivable in Windows and Linux
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:29.600]   that you could change it to a resolution
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:30.640]   that actually doesn't even work.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.040]   And so the screen will go blank,
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:34.720]   so it gives you 15 seconds to say,
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:36.800]   "Yeah, yeah, apply these settings or just revert
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.160]   because I can't see anything."
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:41.280]   I'm using...
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.120]   I guess I'm not using high DPI here,
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:43.920]   or maybe I am.
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:46.000]   All of these guys do this.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:46.880]   They kind of...
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.960]   They fudge it.
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:52.000]   There's a huge amount of thinking in terms of interface design,
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   that implementation details shouldn't be something
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.200]   that it just causes us pain.
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.840]   We don't need to know there's two cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus,
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.520]   because they're logically treated like one camera.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:00.560]   It's not a limitation detail.
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.680]   Stop worrying about it.
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:03.520]   Stop worrying about how we do the screen doubling.
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:04.880]   It's dense, okay?
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:05.920]   It's dense, you'll like it.
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:06.800]   Use it.
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.720]   So because I'm mirroring, I just said this.
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.640]   So this is not what I wanted.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.320]   And now it's...
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:13.680]   You can't see it, right?
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:16.240]   But it says, "Do you want to keep these display settings?"
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:17.680]   Reverting in nine seconds.
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:18.720]   No, I don't want to keep these.
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:21.440]   This is clearly not the right display settings for me.
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:22.240]   And I've gone back.
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:22.800]   Thank God.
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.920]   So it is possible to screw it all up in this manner.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:28.720]   I don't know.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:29.840]   I'm an old timer.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.680]   I like a computer I could screw up.
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:34.080]   Give me a computer.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:36.480]   Use and find the Pausex control for this computer.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.880]   Give me a computer I can really ruin.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:39.200]   So...
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.320]   Terminal, change it.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:43.520]   Our advice would be maybe play with it and see, you know,
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:47.520]   do the...
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:51.360]   Half DPI would be this one in the middle or...
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.520]   Yeah, and you can try it over it.
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.480]   I can.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.280]   I'm not on the Mac.
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.560]   I'm on a Windows machine.
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:59.120]   But I'm thinking that's the one you want, right?
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:01.760]   So I would try it.
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:04.080]   And if you find the text is too small for you to read,
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:06.080]   go make it a little bit bigger.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:08.320]   And if you find you're using Photoshop or the web,
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:10.320]   you just can't see enough stuff, then make it a little bit.
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.400]   What if we just set it default for display?
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.440]   I mean, that's how it uses.
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:13.920]   To be.
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:16.000]   Well, the new default is the...
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.440]   That's the point of the whole thing,
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.120]   is the new default is the...
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:19.520]   Scaled.
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:20.000]   Scaled.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:20.480]   Scaled.
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:20.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:24.880]   But these systems are better than they used to be.
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.360]   It used to be you never wanted a scaled, you know,
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:29.200]   1.3 times or...
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.040]   Yeah, and those people won't notice.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.240]   They're so small to pixels.
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:32.640]   Now it is.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:33.760]   And this is only on the...
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:36.720]   I believe is only on the new 2016 machines.
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:37.040]   Right.
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:37.760]   2016 Macbook.
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.120]   They changed it just for the new ones.
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:40.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:40.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.000]   And that's why people are like, what?
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.760]   At first I went back and forth.
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:45.920]   Whenever I was on the web, I'd have the bigger text.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.800]   And then when I would switch to Photoshop or Final Cut,
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.320]   I would go to the bigger display again.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:52.080]   And then I just got tired of switching.
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:52.800]   That was fine.
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:53.680]   I accepted it.
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:54.560]   Learned helplessness.
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.320]   All right.
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.440]   Well, there you go.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:59.040]   I did.
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:21:59.920]   But some people can see it.
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.360]   Like some people on the iPhone 7 Plus,
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:02.640]   they can't, they have a hard time
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:04.080]   because they see the flicker in the scroll.
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:04.640]   I can't.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.080]   I will see it now.
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:08.400]   I didn't see it before, but I know I'll see it now.
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.920]   You'll imagine it.
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:10.640]   Even if you don't see it.
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.360]   I'll imagine it.
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.160]   Exactly.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:12.880]   Exactly.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:14.640]   Why'd you tell me that?
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:18.160]   Users are also, as less or less,
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:20.560]   are doing the rundown of what's wrong with the new MacBook Pros.
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:29.840]   Which, by the way, I know, I do say that the touch bar is not as useful as I was hoping.
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:32.400]   But overall, I really like the new MacBook Pros.
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:35.120]   Some are saying there's graphics issues
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:39.120]   predominantly on the 15 inch,
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.560]   which has the Radeon AMD Radeon in it, right?
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:44.560]   Just take it back.
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.720]   If you have any issue with any part of the computer,
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:50.000]   I mean, Andy said this many times, take it back right away at Apple's office.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.680]   Okay. So this is not a universal problem.
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:52.720]   This is just some of them.
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:53.840]   No, I haven't had it on any of mine.
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:54.960]   I've got three of them sitting here.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.920]   And it's also, according to this article from MacRumors,
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:03.200]   it's crashing while transcoding video with Premiere Pro,
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:07.040]   which is probably a very small number of users do that.
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:10.800]   But again, if it is you, you have an absolute right to keep that thing back
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.080]   and say, "Make me happy."
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:13.200]   Yeah. And demonstrate.
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:16.720]   A lot of people don't know that Apple does have a 14-day,
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:18.320]   no questions asked, return policy.
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.000]   So long as you have all the packaging,
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.520]   so long as it looks like you haven't dragged it behind a truck,
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:27.520]   or even a Tonka trunk truck, they will give you your full refund.
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.760]   Here's what you should be looking for.
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:31.840]   If it does that--
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:32.720]   It does not normal.
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:33.920]   You should not be happy.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:36.400]   You weren't using it for underwater photography.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.440]   That's not normal.
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.040]   It's flickering.
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:39.840]   It's blinking as-
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:43.280]   As much as I keep talking a lot about it,
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:45.360]   users should have the power to make their own decisions,
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:46.480]   make their choices.
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:50.240]   To my right here, I've got the screen of a Linux computer
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:52.240]   that has a dead black screen,
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.880]   because I tried to install a desktop manager that I did
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:55.600]   how to install.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:56.400]   Yes, I've done that.
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:59.840]   Now I'm going to have to do a lot of SSH behind the scenes.
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:00.080]   Yep.
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:03.840]   All that stuff that I told you to do last night, please pretend I didn't.
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:07.120]   John, how many times have I trashed my Linux box now in this?
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:07.920]   Twice.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:08.480]   Twice.
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:10.400]   First time I started--
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:16.160]   This is why-- Linux is great, because you can do this,
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:18.080]   but it's also horrible because you can do this.
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:23.600]   I wanted to set up LVM, the Linux volume manager,
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.280]   or actually logical volume manager,
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:27.680]   to allow me to do--
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:31.680]   to extend the volume and then have a third volume for snapshotting,
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:33.200]   because it does snapshotting.
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:34.400]   And I went halfway through it,
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:36.240]   and then I forgot that I'd only gotten halfway through,
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:38.400]   and I went home, and then I rebooted the machine,
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.560]   and of course it was very confused, and nothing happened.
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:43.040]   So the nice thing is easy to install,
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.200]   reinstall it, and then for some reason,
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.160]   I really won't understand.
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.160]   I chose the ZFS file system.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:50.640]   I know, because I wanted it, because this is going to be cool,
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.880]   and that's something went horribly wrong there after a while.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:57.680]   So now I'm just using ext4,
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:01.200]   and it's just normal, and I'm not doing LVM or anything.
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:04.560]   Speaking of which, where's APFS?
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:06.240]   Yes.
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:07.440]   2017.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:09.360]   But is it making progress?
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.800]   Has anybody got the beta?
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:11.920]   Are they updating the beta?
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:13.280]   Is it we have been made any progress?
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.040]   I fear this is going to be like pink.
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:16.720]   Right?
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:19.280]   So I don't think so, because they're putting it into everything.
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:21.760]   It's going to be everything from Apple Watch to all the way up to top.
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:22.240]   They need it.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.520]   They need it, because this is--
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:26.400]   So if we're just maxed, yes, they've probably abandoned it.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:29.200]   But it's going to be for everything, and it is a modern--
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.360]   We're talking about the new modern Apple file system
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:34.560]   that does all the cool things that ZFS does.
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.160]   Yes, snapshotting and cloning.
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.000]   And I would normally jump on this,
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.080]   but file systems is one of the few things
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:44.400]   that I will stay away from until it is a more public-facing beta.
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:47.600]   And as Apple themselves point out,
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:51.120]   HFS Plus, which we use in HFS's predecessor,
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.080]   are more than 30 years old.
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.640]   These were file systems created in the era of floppies
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:00.480]   and 1,024 cylinder hard drives.
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:02.320]   And we're tricking hard drives at this point
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:06.000]   to put anything more than a 500 megs on it or whatever it is.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.200]   And it's about time, and with flash drives and everything,
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:13.200]   we had a modern file system that also really importantly,
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:17.040]   focused on data integrity with things like check summing and snapshots.
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:19.200]   And so copy on write.
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:24.400]   All of this will happen sometime next year.
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:25.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.600]   Yeah, well, I mean, it's not truly old.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:30.320]   It's like putting people in an iPhone on an AI.
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.960]   It's not going to be a problem because people will just buy their new iPhone.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:35.680]   And it'll just have this and they'll copy their data over and Apple
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:36.640]   will figure it out in the background.
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:37.520]   It'll be fine.
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:39.120]   But anyone migrating their Mac to this,
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:41.280]   that has to just work.
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:42.960]   There's no zero room.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:44.800]   And of course, there's going to be all sorts of errors.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:48.720]   It will have lots of great discussions about how we completely blew the migration
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:50.240]   to Apple File System.
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:52.720]   But it's one of those things where it behooves them to take their time.
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:55.280]   That's why I think they introduced it at WWDC six months
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:58.320]   before they were even thinking about migrating us there.
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:02.000]   And it's super interesting in the context of our earlier conversation about routers
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.480]   because once you have this technology on every Apple device,
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:05.760]   what does that mean for iCloud?
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:09.920]   For things like desktop and documents and iCloud sync and iCloud backup and all of that.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:14.240]   Because suddenly that is probably way more accessible to a wider range of Apple devices.
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.320]   And they're great at doing this fusion stuff now,
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:20.160]   which you speak of near line where you have some stuff on local storage as fast and available
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.520]   and some stuff on the cloud that's a click away and sort of blurring the lines
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:24.560]   between those two things.
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:26.960]   I think Apple File System gets super interesting in that world.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:34.880]   I've been looking for more recent posts since June because that's when Apple announced it.
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.480]   There haven't been a whole lot.
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:41.920]   Although here's a piece that came out yesterday.
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:43.440]   No, it says 10 November.
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:44.400]   That's the future.
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.760]   Here's a piece from the future.
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.200]   What day is today?
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:51.920]   How could this be coming out on the 10th of November?
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.520]   Is that some sort of British time?
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:55.200]   That was last month.
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:56.640]   Oh, this is December?
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.240]   Oh my God, when did that happen?
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.160]   I'm sorry, I'm an idiot.
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:06.080]   From this is from the Register, new features could shake up how Mac OS machines are managed.
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:08.480]   Specifically for Mac administrators.
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:13.680]   And of course, one of the biggest things is the Apple File System or APFS.
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:18.400]   And this is a video from Black Hat.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.200]   Anyway, I think this is all going to be very interesting.
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:24.880]   But I am curious what its current status is.
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:32.240]   So if anybody's working on this or using it, I'd be very curious where does APFS stand?
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:37.040]   And also they're going to introduce a new system called Mobile Device Management
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:43.600]   for managing iOS devices that will be kind of an intermediate interface to this stuff
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.680]   that Assistant Menzel have to also deal with.
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:53.360]   One of the things people have said about APFS is it makes everything more iOS-like.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.760]   Which is interesting.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:58.000]   I don't know if that's a fair idea.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.200]   The way you think about it, sorry.
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:02.240]   I was just going to just more modern in general.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:04.800]   It's not that Apple is moving the...
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:08.480]   It's not as Apple's making this huge advances.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:10.880]   There are these concepts that have been around forever,
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:15.520]   where you get things like versioning and rollbacks for free.
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:19.040]   And being able to deal with infinite volumes for free.
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:24.800]   And not have it shoehorned into an operating system that is still shocked that you're upset
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:29.440]   that you have to swap out 400K floppies every three times, every time you want to save a document.
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:30.240]   So it's not...
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.320]   If people are...
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.800]   That shouldn't be a flag about anything in particular.
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:38.320]   Although, as Renee says, it's nice to have every single device that Apple makes
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:43.600]   on the same page and how to get a blob of data moved from one place to another
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:46.800]   and stored someplace permanently makes a lot of things super, super easy.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:49.120]   It's sort of like Swift.
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.800]   There was this school, like what's Apple going to do?
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:54.160]   They can't just buy next again and have their next generation thing.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:56.160]   But slowly, step by step, they announced Swift.
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:59.440]   And then Swift is going to go across their entire range of products.
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:02.320]   And then APFS is going to go across their entire range of products.
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.440]   And there'll be more of those...
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:07.920]   Looks like interesting things with Core Data and all these other systems that they're working on.
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:11.360]   And then piece by piece, you end up being a modern operating system.
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:14.720]   And I know some people fear iOS, but iOS is not just iOS.
[01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:17.600]   iOS is also a modern approach to architecting all these things.
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:21.920]   If Apple could start over today and re-architect, they do things even differently, I imagine, than iOS.
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:24.720]   Sometimes new is just new.
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:28.160]   It's not new because it's iOS or new because it's different than the Mac.
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:29.840]   It's just we thought about this for many years.
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:32.000]   We've got this experience now and we're making something better.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.920]   And yes, it'll happen to be on both our products.
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:39.600]   We've been talking a lot, Adam, on the show about
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:43.440]   Wither Macintosh, Wither Mac OS.
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:47.120]   And it seems fairly clear Apple's turning its back.
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:48.960]   And I would love to see...
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:50.320]   You're a developer.
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:54.320]   I would love to see Apple go all in, presuming that...
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:57.600]   Okay, look, everybody ultimately touch first devices.
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:02.160]   iOS devices are going to be our bread and butter, the consumer system.
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:10.160]   But we still would like to serve the professionals and the developers in the world.
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:17.600]   What if they just went all on a Mac OS being like a really hardcore developer focused,
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:20.880]   professional focused operating system?
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:21.920]   You know, a Solaris.
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:24.960]   Just something really super hardcore.
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:27.040]   And APFS would be one of the things you would do.
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:28.480]   I would love that.
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:31.040]   I think a lot of people would look at that.
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:31.520]   Yeah.
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:35.520]   It's what a lot of the very vocal parts of the community are saying.
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:40.240]   And they just build expensive but super powerful high-end machines
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:42.480]   for the trucks.
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:43.120]   Make trucks.
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:44.480]   If you're going to make trucks, make trucks.
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:48.160]   I mean, I think they will...
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:49.200]   I don't know.
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:51.040]   2017, I think, is going to be a big...
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:52.240]   Well, we'll see.
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:54.160]   ...for what happens.
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:32:00.560]   I think 2016, you kind of got to throw out a little bit because things just didn't line up for them
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:04.080]   in terms of what they probably should have built and what they did.
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:09.520]   I've been saying on my show, I almost feel like they should have waited even on the Mac
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:10.480]   book, "Prose."
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:15.360]   But I think they just felt they had to get something out the door in 2016.
[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:20.240]   I don't know if it was the right move or not, because everybody was screaming for a new machine.
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:24.000]   And now they're upset because it wasn't exactly what they wanted.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.240]   They're kind of in the position that Microsoft was in with Windows 8, where they're straddling.
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:31.280]   In this case, they're straddling consumer and professional.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:37.600]   And it's hard when you're straddling and they're separating, your legs get farther and farther
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:38.720]   apart pretty soon you fall in.
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:40.880]   They're going to have to choose.
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:46.960]   And I think they have a very reasonable kind of roadmap for the consumer products that are
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:48.080]   pretty much iOS.
[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:53.840]   I would love to maybe even spin off a division or they're big enough.
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:56.400]   They're rich enough they could do this.
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:59.040]   I don't know that the org chart thing is the right solution.
[01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.680]   And I haven't really discounted Apple on this front.
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:06.160]   Again, I'm wanting to wait and see what happens in 2017.
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:07.600]   But that's Nudgeam.
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:08.800]   Now's the time to Nudgeam.
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.080]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:11.040]   Before they commit.
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:12.960]   But I think they are getting nudged.
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:17.360]   I mean, if you look at the stories that are being written and what people are saying in
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:20.720]   the pro video and the photography and all those communities that you're talking about,
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:27.280]   the developer community, they're saying loud and clear, don't forget us.
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:27.920]   We're still here.
[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.480]   We want these machines and we want this technology.
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:32.640]   And some of them are starting to move.
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:38.720]   So yeah, I think Apple neither needs to pay attention to that and do something.
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:43.760]   Or I think they're going to turn around and find that this large core of vocal people
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:49.760]   who are also the people, by the way, I think that heavily influence the consumer sides of things,
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:52.960]   you know, they're going to be looking at other platforms and systems.
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:54.160]   It's starting to now.
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:55.440]   I'm not really worried about it.
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:00.000]   But if Apple does choose that, you know, this is how we're going to continue things.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.240]   I think they may turn around at some point and find a lot of those people are gone.
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:11.040]   And what that means overall for the future of, you know, the Macintosh, that is a little bit
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:11.680]   scary to me.
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:17.760]   Yeah, I feel so it's sort of like an A or they're at a crossroads right now,
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:20.240]   where there is no right answer to this.
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:27.120]   They can choose between the goal of being the technological bread basket for the world,
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:31.920]   which means that they would have to broaden their scope, they'd have to make some things that
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:37.360]   maybe they don't want to make, they'd have to, you know, create a create more high performance,
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:43.520]   excuse me, create hardware that's not necessarily for the 80% of the users out there,
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:48.320]   create the hardware that's not necessarily going to generate 40% profit margins,
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.880]   or they can decide to become a niche brand.
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:55.040]   And oftentimes, niches used as a slander term, but I don't mean it that way.
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:00.880]   They can simply say, we are okay with not having the sort of influence that we used to have.
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:06.320]   We were okay with not being able to change the world to whatever extent that a large company can
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:10.960]   change the world. We are going to be content in making the half dozen products that we really,
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:18.240]   really can be fanatical about. And if credibly, some people could say that the world is passing us
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:22.480]   by, we're okay with that because we will still make the best phone, we will still make the best
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:27.120]   tablet, we will still make the best watch that's out there and people will appreciate that this
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:32.640]   is the best made laptop you can buy. It's A or B, I think that they're having a hard time trying
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:37.280]   to pretend to be both companies. I think they're going to have to choose to be about being one
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:41.200]   of the other soon. There's also something really interesting going on where like,
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:44.640]   and there's a couple of really bad analogies I'm going to make knowing that they're bad analogies.
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:49.040]   When Apple TV was updated and there was no Bluetooth keyboard support, my Twitter feed was filled with
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:52.960]   it. You'd think everyone in the universe was really upset by this. And it turns out almost
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:58.560]   nobody uses it to the extent that when WWDC happened, nobody was using it because it was almost
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:02.720]   Apple TV developers who ever used the thing. But if you go by your Twitter feeder or people talking
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:06.960]   on podcasts, it was a major problem. And Apple was abandoning an really important piece of
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:11.760]   functionality. And the same thing with the display, I really am upset that Apple's not making an
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:17.440]   Apple display. I think it's a mistake. I think that the display is to the computer what the
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:22.560]   interface is to the app. It's what you look at. And Apple not owning that experience,
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:27.360]   I think opens them up to, well, have an LG display. Why can I get an LG computer? It's just
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:31.520]   it's something I don't think that they should want any part of. But it's something that they seem to
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:36.160]   be willing to seed. But at the same time, it's low single digit percentages of people who buy
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:41.760]   these displays. Almost everybody, again, a bad analogy, everybody says they watch PBS. But when
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:46.400]   you switch from Nielsen cards to Nielsen computers, it turns out almost nobody watches it.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:50.240]   Yeah. Well, we buy we vote with our wallets. We buy Apple notebooks and
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:55.840]   yeah, pros and advanced users are a small number. They're not going to move the needle. Okay, but
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:00.880]   that's they're a tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of it that we online distort beyond that because
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:04.800]   we have to have a chamber. But I do think we have to acknowledge that they have an import to the
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:09.840]   ecosystem. I mean, it's more than right. They have an importance, larger than their numbers,
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:15.680]   it larger even than their economic value to the ecosystem. That's why I think they should keep
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:19.280]   making my I think incredibly important. And I think Apple is having to Andy's point,
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:22.960]   Apple, I think is having this exact argument. I think they're probably in a room screaming
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:27.440]   at each other saying we need to make this display. No, we don't. We need to keep the desktops.
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:30.560]   Some of the stuff is more complicated. It's easy on the internet, but some of it's more
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:35.600]   complicated. Like they didn't update the iMac for the first time in several years in October. But
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:40.240]   how would they update the iMac until it stopped making the chip of 21.5 inch, the chips that they
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:45.200]   use for the 27 inch, they could put USB C Thunderbolt 3 and make that the only change. But that's
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:49.280]   a pretty disappointing iMac update to how this year and they get railed from it. I can tell you
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:54.720]   what they should do. I'm not worried about the iMac. They should re-release the cheese grater,
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:38:01.520]   the older Mac Pro with up with slots with room for how many drives, eight drives with
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:10.080]   ample upgrade capabilities. That is what a pro wants. They don't want the trash can Mac.
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:14.720]   They, you know, we put up with the 5K iMac because it's an amazing display to your point.
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:20.720]   But what we really want is a cheese grater Mac. We want that Mac Pro that we can upgrade it and
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:27.440]   upgrade it for years to come. Right? I would just say that the big problem is that it's not so much
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:33.360]   that there is an entire single market that's being ignored. It's that to pick up on grenades,
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:39.440]   not at all crappy analogy. I mean, people, yes, it's true that I, for instance, I don't sit down
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:46.640]   for six hours and watch PBS. But I absolutely love Antiques Rocho. I absolutely love the American
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:52.080]   experience and I absolutely love the Med Opera broadcast they do. And so maybe it doesn't mean
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:56.000]   that they're making a huge amount of money off of me. But if they decided to become a home shopping
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:02.960]   network, I would really, really miss out on that. And it's not so much that if there's one bad
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:09.280]   feature of the new MacBook, it doesn't mean that, oh, well, who cares that the pros are just like
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:15.520]   8% of the market. You're also getting rid of the people who really never wanted to
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:22.640]   do a track 4K video editing on their laptop, but they wanted to have a really comfortable keyboard
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:28.800]   and they want to have a better arraignment of ports. And they don't mind having something a
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:33.840]   little bit thicker. Again, these are not people who can create a coalition and say, we are people
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:40.000]   who are writers who like good keyboards and want underneath in a port and darn it, we spend money.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:46.960]   Our dollar, it's easy to, I think that as a designer, it's easy for Apple to talk themselves
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:51.360]   out of good ideas because, oh, well, look, here's the numbers. People are not using this feature
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:56.720]   and therefore we can get rid of it. But the thing is you're taking one little brick out of this big
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:01.520]   wall and then you keep doing that over to see we keep taking bricks out of the wall and it's the
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:07.040]   wall still standing. We can keep doing this. You don't know at what point you've created a really
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:12.720]   huge structural problem until suddenly you're surrounded by broken bricks and mortar and screaming
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:17.760]   crying, paying its people in pain with broken bones. It's also more than hardware to me. It's
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:23.120]   the operating system and I would even look at Mac OS and look at kind of maybe stripping it down
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:28.640]   a little bit, simplifying it, cleaning it up. You know, one of the strengths of the Macintosh
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:39.280]   is it came with Python and Ruby and Apache. Put that stuff in, make it Python 3, not to 7.
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:47.280]   In other words, make a pro simplified, I think. I think they've crufted up Mac OS with a lot of
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:56.720]   usability features that just make it messy and make Cheesecake or Mac with a pro operating system
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:03.840]   running APFS. Adam, I mean, as a developer, when you like that, you got me thinking because I haven't
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:09.120]   been paying attention to servers. So what's going on? Yeah, well, they stopped. I mean, server now
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:14.880]   is an app you run on your right, right, right. But I consumer grade Mac OS and they don't make
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:20.160]   the rack mountables anymore. That's fine. I can understand that. I was going to say, I agree to
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:25.440]   you to the point that, you know, if you look at Mac OS Sierra, a lot of those features that are in
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:30.880]   there are about integrating with iOS, right, Siri over, you know, so they're very much the last
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:36.240]   couple generations we've been getting mostly consumer focused. Don't even make iTunes anymore.
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:44.480]   How about that? I think a lot of people for a lot of reasons would say, you know, I think Apple is
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:49.600]   finally turning itself around. If they say we're not even replacing it with anything,
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:54.640]   just know that we discontinued iTunes. Thank you. Goodbye. It was a great, great, great to run.
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:58.080]   Poor guy at Virgin Records trying to upload his catalog.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:01.920]   I think there's an opportunity there.
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:08.080]   Yeah, it's interesting because they have a unique, they have, again, like to go back,
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:12.000]   they have a unique problem is that they were successful in mobile and most computer companies
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.520]   weren't. So they could just keep on either making computers or try mobile and realize it
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:20.080]   didn't really work for them. Google does not have the entrenched traditional computing business
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:24.080]   that Apple had. Microsoft was not successful at starting the new mobile business that Apple has.
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:27.200]   And now they are straddling those two worlds. And it's the only company that's really doing that.
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:32.000]   Blackberry didn't do that, Palm didn't do that. HP certainly didn't do that. And it's
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.400]   it is a problem that does not seem to have longevity in it.
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:39.120]   Yeah, spinning it off though, I don't think is the answer because there is
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:46.160]   so much cross-pollination that we do benefit from, you know, even going back to what Renee was
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:52.720]   saying earlier about the file system, right? So, and I like that Apple keeps the thought process
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:56.800]   so they underlying technology is there, but they're very much still separate. But yeah,
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:02.000]   it's put them in a quandary for sure. I don't be saying, oh, it's just, yeah,
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.840]   dreaming of your pro-mac. I'm fantasizing. It's not the cheese grater.
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:09.200]   A lot of people have been saying the same thing. All that's the
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:13.840]   hearing that that mantra a lot is, you know, why doesn't Apple just do this one machine
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:17.520]   for the 1%? You know, before they lose this business, they have the
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:21.760]   co-classic Mac. They have the business, but they're about to lose that business.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:26.000]   Not about, I mean, it's not a bad idea. Will they do it? I think likely not,
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.680]   unfortunately. The reason I, you know, I understand the disadvantage of spinning it off,
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:36.320]   but the reason I think they need to spin it off is it's too small a business for them.
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:42.080]   There'd be too much temptation to pull people out of it and put them on, you know, the next
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:46.720]   version of iOS. Would survive spun off though? I just don't think that they'd be able to maintain
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:49.280]   it. Well, it would be a much smaller company, right?
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:56.880]   The Apple company. So, call it the Apple Computer Company, you know, or the Macintosh company.
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:01.440]   And because if you look, even just like CoreOS is one division and they make all the plumbing
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:04.800]   for everything and then you'd have to redoicate that, duplicate all those things.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:09.520]   But that's why we're getting this hybridized operating system that is really ultimately a
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:16.160]   consumer operating system. And they're going to lose the most influential group of people
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:21.360]   that's the problem. I mean, on the other side of it though, they have this whole other dilemma where
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:31.920]   AI, BR, AR, voice first interfaces and things are vastly becoming the future of computing in a
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:36.400]   lot of different ways. So they're also having to like deal with that, you know, five, 10 year
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:42.160]   out dilemma too. It's like, how much do we want to invest in this when everything is going that way?
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:49.200]   Yeah, no, that's the problem. That's why you need a small spin-off company that doesn't care,
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:53.840]   five years when you have your marble and that marble just attaches to any monitor that's near
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:57.920]   you and becomes your environment. You'll worry about, oh, we used to talk about desktop versus
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:01.200]   phone. And now I just have glass everywhere in my little marble core.
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:08.320]   It's not that developers wouldn't want that, but I, you know, I mean, eventually we're going to be
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:15.760]   in a world without keyboards and, and, and, and developers, maybe, you know, maybe we're, maybe
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:24.560]   this the 1% is the dying breed is the dodos and that's it, you know. Netflix is the number one
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:30.560]   grossing iPhone app in the United States. You wouldn't think so. They're free. Ah, in app purchases,
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:37.200]   though. In fact, once Netflix added in app purchases, they saw a huge growth. So that Apple 30% tax,
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:42.960]   that's, that's looking okay right about now. They're on the 15% rocket, aren't they? Oh, yeah,
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:50.080]   they get a special deal. Yeah. App revenue has increased steadily. This is according to a sensor
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:57.600]   tower and their app intelligence platform. You see that it's funny when you look at the graph,
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:03.200]   you know, this is November 2015. There were some stumbles there and then, and then it immediately
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:07.600]   is like number one is at the top there. They've been hovering around number one for all this time.
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:14.720]   Weekly net revenue was has grown over the last two years from 50,000 to 2.9 million.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:20.480]   Last month it was number seven. This month it is number one and look at the revenue growth
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:27.840]   over time. Of course, now that you can download some of the Netflix original stuff for offline use,
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:32.400]   I think this is going to go up even more. I think it helps too that they're going crazy with their,
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:35.520]   you know, as a case, someone who doesn't have cable and is a cable cutter.
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:40.560]   It's a great choice. They're going crazy with their original programming and a lot of it's
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:45.760]   really good. I love the idea that I could download Stranger Things and watch it on their plane.
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:49.600]   It's just fantastic. You can have Stranger Things and Gilmore Girls playing at the same time.
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:56.480]   It's so funny to watch Netflix because remember we, I mean, we in the tech
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:01.440]   journalist business thought they were going to go out of business when they announced,
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:03.520]   oh, we're going to do this. Yeah.
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:07.920]   And he'll DVD charge you twice as much and it was just, and
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:13.840]   I actually never doubted Reed Hastings. I always thought this guy knows what he's doing.
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:16.400]   Well, when they split the company in two for a few months, you doubted him, right?
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:20.720]   I thought, no, you know what? Here's what I thought. I thought Reed knew what he was doing.
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:25.520]   I thought Reed was moving towards streaming. Had this problem because he had this DVD business
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:31.280]   and he had the market and he had the board that he had to kind of give them away going forward
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:35.840]   to not cannibalize their DVD business. But I think he's so smart. He knew that ultimately,
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:42.240]   the path forward was to cannibalize the DVD business. So we went through this ridiculous,
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:47.760]   you know, shadow play for the benefit of investors and the board.
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:52.960]   And it was really just to placate them because he knew what, yeah, it was theater. He knew what
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:58.640]   the future was and he was right. It's streaming. And he was also right pumping hundreds of millions
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:02.560]   of dollars into original programming. That's been a huge success for them.
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:06.080]   Most markets, they were never DVD. They were introduced as a streaming service.
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:08.160]   Right. All we got was an F X streaming. That's all we know.
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:15.840]   It's so funny. Megan posted on her Facebook feed. She was visiting her dad. And grandpa still
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:21.280]   had some red discs, you know, those red films with the discs. Oh, the kids are marveling.
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:28.080]   What's that grandpa? Well, my day. Here's some library books. Two kids.
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:35.600]   It's funny how things, how fast things change, right? Unbelievable. Unbelievable.
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:41.680]   Let's take a break and our picks of the week coming up in just a little bit.
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:49.120]   You know, it really looks great on my giant size screen is my website. If I go to leolaport.com,
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:56.400]   let me do that real quickly and show you. I just, I love how this looks on a giant screen PC.
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:02.240]   This is just, this is good looking stuff. And you know what's neat? Because I did it on
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:08.720]   Squarespace, it looks just as good on a little itsy bitsy screen. Squarespace is the place to
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:15.920]   create your next website, the best hosting, plus the best content management system
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:20.160]   to give you the best of both worlds. Look at that. The little screen and the big screen. Same site.
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:26.080]   I don't have a separate mobile site. I've got them both. And that's the beauty of Squarespace.
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:30.640]   In fact, yeah, I think yesterday, the day before I just, I realized, oh, we don't have
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:36.800]   anywhere that 3D walkthrough we did of the old brick house. So I, on the air, I posted it on my
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:44.320]   Squarespace blog. And I, and people could watch and see how easy it was to embed this and create a
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:49.920]   new blog post. I love Squarespace. Now don't judge Squarespace by my design because I've made
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:55.040]   it very simple because I kind of like, I like a simple design. But Squarespace, and that's the
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:58.160]   beauty of Squarespace. You start with their templates and you can make the design
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:04.240]   your own, no matter what. You can make it look like your art, like your restaurant, like your
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:10.080]   business, like your, your personal ethos. Squarespace is the place to make your next website.
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:17.040]   It is awesome. Every Squarespace site reflects you, whether it's your professional online store,
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:24.480]   your beautiful portfolio as an artist or a photographer. And of course, because every site has e-commerce
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:30.320]   built in, you can, it's great for the mobile shopper or the desktop shopper too. You can sell
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:36.400]   unlimited products with zero transaction fees. Your data, your financial information is absolutely
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:41.120]   secure because they run the hosting and the software. It's also that tight integration that
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:45.200]   makes Squarespace so great. It's kind of like Apple. You, you want to have great software,
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:48.720]   you got to make the hardware, you want to have a great website, you got to make the server and
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:53.440]   the software. The new commerce app, which you can put on your phone, iOS or Android,
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:59.440]   lets you fulfill orders on your Squarespace store, manage product inventory, resolve customer
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:06.160]   invoices directly or issues directly from your device. Squarespace commerce powers your business.
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:10.160]   It's the only platform that lets you create, manage, and brand your store in a beautiful way.
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:13.600]   It's not some afterthought hanging off. You know, you, so many times you go to a website,
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:18.400]   then you go to the store and it's like, you know, it's like kind of the, the back of the house there.
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:22.400]   Not with Squarespace. It all looks the same. It all looks great using your templates.
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:25.760]   They have a basic plan and an advanced plan with features for your growing business. It lets you
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:28.480]   accept payments instantly. You don't have to worry about getting a merchant account.

[01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:37.680]   so they have more than 300 top level domains. You can buy at Squarespace. And one of the great
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:42.640]   things about buying a domain name at Squarespace is you get that, you know, great parking page,
[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:46.480]   so much better looking than those other guys right out of Squarespace. And of course,
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:49.840]   it's a snap then to get the page going whenever you're in the mood.
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:54.320]   Hunt, if you want to get, it's easy to do, but if you want to get geeky hundreds of customizable
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:59.440]   settings, including fonts, colors, page configurations, a great developer platform too,

[01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:14.640]   Click the get started button. That's it. But if you decide, this is for me, as I did,
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:24.400]   make sure you use the offer code MAC break because you'll get 10% off your purchase at squarespace.com.
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:29.680]   I've never had such a good looking website. You know, it's funny because it was so easy to do.
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:34.400]   It kind of sucked me in and slowly moved more and more over there. Now I suppose I should work
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:39.600]   on the template a little bit, you know, you know, get a better looking, but I put, I put my photos
[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:44.480]   there. I put my calendar there now. Everything, all the about pages, and just love it.
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:50.720]   Let's get some pics of the week. Adam Christensen, you know about this, right? We do it every week.
[01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:56.480]   You're our guest this week. You get pride of place. All right. I've got a good one because
[01:52:56.480 --> 01:53:01.520]   it's actually hour of code week. I don't know if people know that that's going on. Oh, I didn't.
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:09.200]   Yeah. And there is and plus it's the holidays, so I wanted to do something fun. And this is,
[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:13.200]   hopefully you guys can see this and hopefully I don't spill these things everywhere. A little
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:18.240]   pandering. So there's your twit logo. Nice. You invented the light bright.
[01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:25.120]   Well, this is called blocks. And it's a product and an app. It's actually a company out of St.
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:30.560]   Louis called Pixel Press. And you get these little cubes and you get this 13 by 13 grid.
[01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:38.640]   And what you do is you design and build your own eight bit side scrolling video games with the
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:44.160]   app. So you pluck down the pixels. You take your iPad, you take the camera, you point it at it.
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:50.240]   It will that's so cool into your characters, your backgrounds, you can do animations.
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:56.400]   So you build all of the elements and you store them into your account. They have an online
[01:53:56.400 --> 01:54:02.160]   community. They call the virtual wall. So I actually scanned this in and it's a grid system. So if
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:09.040]   you go to slot minus 103 97 on the virtual wall, you'll find you'll find that. I shared that out
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:13.040]   there. So you can share out your your things. You can download other people's you can download
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:18.240]   other people's games and you basically you design and build out all the assets. And then you make
[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:24.960]   your own maps. You texturize everything. And you create a game that you can play your own game
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:29.600]   that you can play on your iOS device. So it's all about game development. You can iterate. You can
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:35.200]   do testing. And it's just a really, really fun product. The company recently partnered with
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:40.080]   Mattel. They're doing the the physical part and they're now focused on the software.
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:47.120]   And it's 49 99 US retail. And I think you can get it on Amazon for under 40 bucks.
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:53.040]   Really neat. Hours and hours of hours of fun. And and you can build multiple rooms. I think
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:59.040]   you can do 169 different rooms in a game level. So you can build some pretty
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:05.200]   amazing games and it's got power-ups and coins and what ages would this be appropriate for you
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:10.960]   think? Oh, I, you know, as simple as, you know, if you just want if a kid just wants to get into,
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:16.560]   you know, building little characters and creating animations that could start as young as, you know,
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:21.440]   sick. I want to get this. This is great. Yeah, it is a lot. It's a lot of fun. These are the
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:25.680]   same guys. They did a they did another one a while back. A Kickstarter called floors,
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:29.040]   which was graph paper where you would draw everything out. Oh, and I forgot to mention.
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:32.400]   So the different colored blocks when you're building your game levels, you can actually
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:37.280]   build your game levels. The green are like terrain and the yellow ones are your coins and,
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:41.840]   you know, I think the red ones or green ones are villain or different colors. So different
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:46.880]   colors have different meanings when you're sort of plugging them down and building out your levels.
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:52.400]   And you can do all the stuff just in the app as well. But it's really, I love this idea of
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:56.160]   bridging the physical world and the digital world and sort of bringing them together.
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:56:00.560]   I think it makes a lot of fun. And thank you for reminding us is the hour of code.
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:06.000]   Bloxel builder, Bloxels builder.com, I believe is the best. Nice.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:14.400]   Hour of code.com. There are 146,961 hour of code events around the world.
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:21.120]   Going on, spend an hour learning the code. You might find a new hobby.
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:25.520]   Now Apple's participating with playgrounds, I believe there's some good stuff in
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:30.000]   some playgrounds. Yeah, switch playgrounds have a bunch of curriculum stuff for students and stuff.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.720]   And I think the Apple store is doing hour of code events at the store. All week. All week.
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:40.560]   That's really neat. Renee Richie, your pick. My first one was hour of code at the Apple store.
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:46.080]   Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Beautiful tie in. They're going to, you can go there all week.
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:50.640]   They're going to have a series of sessions. I went for the last two years. I'm probably going
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:57.040]   to go again this year. And they just, they bring kids in and they show them very easy to use,
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:01.360]   step by step ways. Depending on the age, they have a ton of people there to work with them.
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:06.720]   It's really hands on. It's, you know, Swift playgrounds are new this year and that's Apple's new app
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:12.720]   for the iPad. It just went to version 1.1. It's really a really great hands-on dynamic way
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:17.760]   with downloadable lessons to sort of get, you're not, you're not sitting there like, you know,
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:21.840]   Xcode project new. You're just learning the basics of how a loop works or how, you know,
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:27.040]   basic functions work and you go through it and it really gamifies it in the best possible sense.
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:30.960]   And you can, you can go to, I think they're running it most of the week. Just check with
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:36.960]   your local Apple store. You sign up, you go in and it's, it's really a great experience. And again,
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:42.320]   I'm always surprised at just how many people of the staff are dedicated. You know, there's,
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:45.680]   the kids that are table, they have max, they have iPads and the staff is just there helping
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:49.600]   them through it. So if you have a spare hour and I think most of us do get your, get your kids
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:53.600]   in their coding. It's a great way to start. Love it. The second thing I was going to mention
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:58.000]   quickly is that Apple also announced on Friday, they're, I think it was actually, it was probably
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:01.760]   Wednesday, Wednesday. I'm losing track of my days, but they announced what they're doing for
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:05.760]   product red this year. And Apple has been a big contributor to product red for a while. And Tim
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:08.800]   Cook said that, you know, Apple believes that, you know, they're, they're manifest, they're good
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:12.640]   will through products or they're work through products. And that's the best way they feel like
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:18.640]   giving back. So they have a whole line of product red devices already. You can see it from iPods to
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:22.800]   Apple watch straps. And they announced a few new ones. I picked up one of those and that's the
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:29.520]   product red Apple smart battery case, which I've been using on my iPhone seven all week. I had
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:33.360]   it with me in Petaluma as a matter of fact, because nothing destroys my battery more than
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:38.560]   roaming on a different network. It just, it just ramps up the radio and that drains the battery away.
[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:43.360]   And this battery case, yes, yes, it has a hump, but it also has some really, really smart engineering
[01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:48.080]   so that, for example, it doesn't cover up the not only does it not cover up the radios, but it
[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:52.320]   has radio enhancers. And one of the problems with a lot of battery cases is that they cover the
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:56.640]   radios. And that means the radios have to amp up to get a signal and that eats a lot of the power
[01:58:56.640 --> 01:59:01.120]   that you're trying to put in through the battery. And also it, it doesn't fool it into thinking
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:05.200]   it's connected to a wall outlet. It reminds, because they have a lot of integration, it reminds
[01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:09.280]   it that it's still mobile. So it doesn't do a lot of the background networking and processing tasks
[01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:14.000]   that also eat up into battery life. So you end up getting, you know, dead are the days that no one
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:18.080]   cares how much milliamp hours it has anymore to battery. It's how about the efficiency. And this
[01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:21.920]   ends up being a much lighter battery that gives you a lot more power. So if you're interested in
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:26.240]   product red, this is new, there's a couple of beat speakers that are new. There's an iPhone SE case
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:30.720]   that is new. The products themselves aren't new, but the product red aspect of them is new.
[01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:34.880]   And I think Apple's donated over a hundred million already to product red. And they also
[01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:38.240]   announced that with Apple Pay, they're going to they're going to match up to a million dollars.
[01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:42.160]   And I think there's a bank that's going to match that as well to product red. So it's a great way
[01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:45.840]   to get great looking products and serve a really important cause at the same time.
[01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:50.880]   Very good. Yeah, this is the last day of product red, right?
[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:55.680]   I think so. Yeah, the entire app store went red a bunch of really popular games,
[01:59:55.680 --> 02:00:01.120]   gave you special download features. So if you can, like you can get red gem packs and some of your
[02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:07.120]   games. Yeah, everything's red on the app store at the top. Yes, it's kind of cool. And Apple's
[02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:13.280]   donated huge amounts of money, I think, to. Yeah, I think it's close to half of what product red
[02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:18.000]   I think is making it as comfortable. Yeah, it's really that's really yeah. And of course,
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:24.400]   it's it's world AIDS day. It's to benefit. Yes. To create AIDS free generation. Tim Cook said the
[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:28.000]   gift of life is the most important gift anyone can give thanks to the vision.
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.160]   And they get dedication of product red and AIDS free generation is within our reach. We want to
[02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:36.000]   leave the world better than we found it. That's why our longtime partnership with red
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:42.320]   remains so important to us. Apple is going to donate up to a total of a million dollars.
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:50.160]   And every purchase made with Apple Pay at an Apple store on apple.com or through the app store
[02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:56.160]   donates a million dollar toward that million to product red. And it's really Tim Cook's
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:59.280]   Apple means Steve Jobs did do a lot of charity. He just didn't believe in talking about it. He
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:03.280]   didn't believe it like he called it pimping your car. He just didn't believe in it. But Tim Cook
[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:06.640]   really believes that you can motivate others through doing it. It's two very different sides
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:10.640]   of the argument. But I think it's in it's one of the biggest changes he's made to Apple is that
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:15.440]   they do corporate matching now for donations and that they're very much in front of of their
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:20.160]   charitable efforts. Also free iTunes download of the Lazarus effect that documented
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:27.200]   documentary about the product red. And 100% of US proceeds raised from the killer's holiday
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:31.760]   album Don't Waste Your Wishes which is exclusively available on iTunes goes to the global fund.
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:37.840]   So there's a you have the product reds you've showed that battery case that's yeah if you if
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:41.600]   you want something that really looks sweet that's pretty sweet. I suppose some pictures and if
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:47.120]   you look at it in P3 you can really see the red. There's also a iPhone SE leather case on
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:54.800]   Red Leather Case on Apple. Andy Inaco your pick of the week. Mine is a free app. It's a free game
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:59.760]   as a matter of fact. It's the flight gear flight simulator. You can download it at flightgear.org.
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:05.120]   It's an open source flight simulator which means that you think about how obsessive compulsive
[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:10.320]   lot of members and developers in the open source community are and then match it to the obsessive
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:15.760]   compulsiveness of people who like to do simulators. This isn't this isn't like Grand Theft Auto where
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:22.640]   you can just hop in the cockpit of a 777 and just like flick a few buttons and you're in the air.
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:27.680]   This is like wait you know you can't fly yet you haven't you haven't done the 20 minutes worth of
[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:32.400]   plea free flight like button pushing and switch flipping and then you have to wait for like the
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:37.280]   little dolly to like pull you out from the terminal and put you on the runway and then you have once
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:43.280]   you're on there you have to wait for it's there is a certain type of meditation of effect of saying
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:49.840]   no when do I get to like try to do a loop-de-loop and and and dive between the spans of the of the
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:55.520]   Golden Gate Bridge no no no this is real time here is every trying to simulate the physics as
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:03:01.440]   greatly as possible for every airplane that's in there the flight dynamics are modeled as closely
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:07.680]   as possible weather systems also closely as possible real world airports with all of their little
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:13.360]   quirks and all the little foibles also done as accurately as possible and you got to say that
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:20.800]   there is a there is a certain satisfaction when you start off with that first like little student
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:25.840]   Cessna the one that's like really easy to fly the first time you manage to actually make a smooth
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:32.480]   landing you forget how ridiculous it seems that you've spent so much time learning which which
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:36.960]   which buttons to flip and what and how to get the fuel system online and all this other sort of
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:42.560]   stuff and there's also kind of ridiculous fun available as well you can get a space shuttle you
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:49.600]   can get uh x planes you can so you can get planes that are capable of getting right to the envelope
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:55.600]   of the the margins of space and back again and part of the fun is knowing that you're not just
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:04:01.280]   watching a movie in which you get to control a joystick and decide where it goes up or down
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:04.960]   there is a certain amount of realism and no this is what you would have been going through if you're
[02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:10.160]   actually trying to land the space shuttle without uh assist without any assist from the computer at
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:17.040]   all um so again it's it's not for everybody this is this is why i like the the the free aspect there
[02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:22.400]   are some really amazingly good flight simulators like like uh uh i think it's called one's called
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:28.160]   x plane uh makrashoff flight simulator still has it's uh it's called and it's it's still being sold
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:34.560]   it's hard for me to lay out 60 bucks for something that's going to spend three hours going up circling
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:39.840]   the airport once and then landing again uh but for free it's kind of a fun little background thing to
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:46.720]   do and it also cuts through one of the problems i have with uh games that take a long time to play
[02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:54.880]   um uh it's they've never really set their hooks into me because if i'm going to spend like three
[02:04:54.880 --> 02:05:01.440]   weeks on this game and i finished the game and all i've learned is how to control this mechanized
[02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:07.200]   battle suit that is totally fake and doesn't exist at least now i know that i have least i am not the
[02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:13.680]   dumbest person on board this commercial flight that i would not be the last person able to land
[02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:19.840]   this plane if a sufficient number of people got sick from from the fish in the in-flight meal uh so
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:24.000]   you feel like you're learning something about here's what it's like to actually learn a flight so
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:27.920]   not that it will save my life and those of hundreds of others but just make sure you don't need the
[02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:31.520]   same meal to co-pilot eats and it'll be okay yeah have lasagna
[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:40.400]   but always a good idea on any flight that's cool how much is that's free free it's open source so
[02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:45.760]   it's uh it's uh maintained by the community and uh you can you can you can tell it's it's not
[02:05:45.760 --> 02:05:51.520]   it's the only it's it's only uh it's kind of typical for a lot of open source uh commercial
[02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:56.240]   type projects in that it the the only disadvantage compared to what you would pay money for is that
[02:05:56.240 --> 02:06:03.120]   it looks like it's maybe one year behind in like the imagery uh so it doesn't look bad at all it just
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:08.480]   doesn't look like you it often doesn't look like it often looks like a game as opposed to a photograph
[02:06:08.480 --> 02:06:14.000]   of an actual plane uh in actual weather uh but if you can give up that you'll have 60 bucks in your
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:19.440]   pocket and you'll have a lot more uh a lot more invitation to keep playing it also it also bears
[02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:25.360]   mentioning that this is routinely updated uh the it's not as though this was released in 2011 and
[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:30.240]   then just sort of light light fallow ever since it's routinely updated the last last update was
[02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:35.360]   actually just a few weeks ago as a matter of fact nice well ladies and gentlemen we've come to the
