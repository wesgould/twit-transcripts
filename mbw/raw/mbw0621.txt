[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. We are minutes away from Apple's quarterly earnings report.
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.200]   Renee, Richie, Andy, and Alex, Lindsey, and I will all talk about what to look for, what to expect.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.700]   Is it going to be a good quarter? Is it going to be a bad quarter?
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.200]   And how goes the race to $1 trillion up next on Mac Break Weekly?
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.100]   Netcast, you love.

[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.600]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.600]   As happens every three months, the latest news from Apple happens right after the show is over.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.600]   Renee Ritchie from iMore.com, you'll be doing your usual sitting in on the analyst call, I presume.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.600]   Yeah, I mean, we'll hear what's sold more than they expected, what's sold less than they expected, in the collective panic, no matter what happens.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.600]   Also, hear Andy and I co from nyco.com. Hello, Andrew.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.600]   Hello.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:54.600]   You'll be studiously avoiding it. You'll probably be out in the beautiful weather, strolling the Boston Common, forgetting life.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.600]   I will be looking through window as I ponder how many thousands of words I need to complete by the end of the week.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   And Alex Lindsey, who is still using his 2015 MacBook Pro.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.600]   You just want to wait for that, Mac Save.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   I mentioned last week I got the one from LineCo.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.600]   They make docs and stuff.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.600]   And they just sent it to me, which was nice.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.600]   And it works great.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.600]   All the type C stuff works, the video, everything works through it.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.600]   And so I leave it plugged into my machine.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.600]   My whole thing right now is that I don't need my portable machine to be that powerful.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   So I don't do as much production on the road as I used to.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.600]   So now at home, I have an iMac that's pretty fast and I still need it.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.600]   So I haven't had a need to update it.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.600]   I should lend you this one.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.600]   I don't want to know. See if you like it.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   People are lost the ties.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.600]   This thing is not going back to mine, but right now it's fine for what I do.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   I'm actually trying to move more and more away from my laptop.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   So now I'm spending more.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   All iPad?
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   I try to take, well, I'm not all iPad, but I am definitely taking my iPad out more and more often.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.600]   And when I come from work, especially when I'm in DC, which I'm most of the time, when I go back, I just take my iPad.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   And then I'm just trying to see where the drop off is.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.600]   You find little things like, can't select multiple things.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.600]   I'm glad that you're doing this so you can report back to us.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.600]   I don't have to.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.600]   No, it's just been forcing myself to do it.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   There's definitely things that I go, "Okay, well, I really need my laptop for that."
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.600]   But there's more and more things that are iPad-able that I thought.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   You know, that I thought it wouldn't be.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.600]   You can't do multiple selections on iPad on the iPad with the keynote.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   That is the thing that drives me.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.600]   That's what takes me back.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.600]   I can't finish a keynote on the iPad because I can't select multiple objects.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.600]   If you try the gesture read, you're holding down one and adding to the selection with another finger.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   I haven't tried that.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   Oh!
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.600]   See, there we go.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   You should be able to tap, tap, tap stuff into the stack.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   Oh, okay.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   Because I tried to select it in a lot of different ways.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.600]   But I didn't Google it, so I didn't look at it.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.600]   The flip side of wanting to have as few visible controls in the interface as possible is that
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:28.200]   sometimes for the last 20% of apps features on Apple's iPad apps, you really do have to
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   go download the PDF that shows you how to do absolutely everything.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   There are the number of times I was about to say, "Oh, isn't it terrible that sheets
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.200]   does not do..."
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.200]   Yes.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   In section 12 it does say, "Oh, sorry."
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.200]   And I think I'm probably ready to watch all the movies and read the manual again, which
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.200]   I haven't read since it first came out, because especially for the iPad, because you know
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.200]   that I'm like, "Apple's so committed to this.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   I'm sure it probably does it, but I can't quite figure this out."
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   And I have to say that it is once you get good at pages and keynote, especially on the iPad,
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.200]   it's life-changing for someone who does a lot of pages documents.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.200]   You write all your text, and then you're just drawing in little sketches of where you want
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   pictures for into pages.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.200]   And it just makes it so much faster to kind of move through the creative process into a
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.200]   finished product compared to what I used to do on a laptop.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   So let's see if we can do this.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   I've added a turkey triangle to this.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.200]   Very.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   So you're saying, "I should be able..."
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.200]   Andrew, "Oh, look at that.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.200]   Look at that.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.200]   Drag the turkey into the..."
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   I know, but can you just select them all and move them as the question?
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.200]   Like move them all in concert.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.200]   Hold one down, then tap the other one.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.200]   Oh, there you go.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.200]   It's a little hard to get registration out of it, but now I'm moving them all.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.200]   There you go.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.200]   Okay.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   With my middle finger, which is not ideal, but okay.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   There we go.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   Look at that.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.200]   There you go.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.200]   Okay.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   I sent correct it.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   All right.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   That's great.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.200]   Yes.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.200]   It's all one.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.200]   And actually, the other yes is I just before the show began, installed iOS 12 public beta
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   4, and I wasn't sure if it would be done, but it has finished.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.200]   So the developer beta 5 came out today.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.200]   And as you mentioned, Renee, one behind for the public beta.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   So we're up to beta 4 now on iOS.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.040]   It sounds to me, and by the way, my phone is still installing.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.880]   It's only about a 400 megabyte install.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.440]   It's not huge.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.200]   Sounds to me, though, for a public developer beta 5, we're pretty close.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.720]   I mean, it's not that you're one behind is that they don't give you the first one because
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.200]   it's not really fit for civilian.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.200]   Oh, so we're caught up then?
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.200]   It's the same bill.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.200]   It's just the public number is one behind because you don't get the nasty one.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.200]   It's with the BDC.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.200]   That seems fair.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   Yes.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.960]   It seems to me that you're not going to.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.920]   How many betas do you do before you gold master it?
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.840]   Once in a while, they do a spurt of them, but most of the time recently, they've just
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.400]   stopped like three weeks a month out and there's been nothing.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.000]   That's usually a good precursor that they're backing down all the etches before.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.400]   So just about everything's working.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.400]   I mean, I don't run into that many things that crash.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.720]   Occasionally, when you're jumping in photos, you jump from one section to another, it dumps
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.200]   out and marketplace doesn't work.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:22.920]   I forgot that I have gone to beta because I've been using it on my main phone and iPad.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.920]   Nope.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.200]   I think the last update really fixed the issue with the maps, which was that it really didn't
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.200]   know where you were.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.960]   I mean, it was constantly guessing.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.960]   The GPS issue.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.960]   The GPS issue.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.480]   It was like miles apart from where it was supposed to be.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.040]   See, I didn't notice that and I'm playing Pokemon all the time.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.760]   Well, I didn't have that one, but I had the one where it didn't know any of your contacts.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.160]   They just gave you numbers and email addresses for everyone for two weeks.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.560]   It's like every year we get that one for one of them.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.200]   That wouldn't be good, but now my contacts are okay.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.920]   I feel like maybe I just lucked out, but I feel like it's pretty solid right now, almost
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:57.040]   ready for delivery to the masses.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.880]   All right, so quarterly results.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.640]   Oh, first of all, happy birthday.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.320]   Oh, thank you.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.640]   Can't leave that in the lurch.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.560]   Now Alex got cupcakes.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.080]   I don't have really anything to offer you, so.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.080]   Oh, that's okay.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.880]   I've got all your emotional and mental cupcakes.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.880]   Exactly.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.680]   I'm sending you emotional cupcakes.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.680]   It's wonderful.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.680]   Thank you.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.680]   Show title.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.520]   And I did send you a Pokemon Go gift.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.520]   You did.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.760]   And I traded it with someone who got a gift from Bulgaria.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.080]   So we was like a maximum distance.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.080]   Wow.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.000]   And what do you get extra if you do that?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.920]   Well, so you have to get this right down a rabbit hole again.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.680]   If you get to a million miles, you get a pilot medal.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.040]   Oh, nice.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.840]   So we got like 20,000.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.240]   And you get miles for trading with somebody distant.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.240]   Yes.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.240]   All of those miles.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.240]   Wow.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.240]   Yes.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.240]   It's fun.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.200]   So the first thing I've got is the best thing I've got.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.560]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.160]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.400]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.200]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.440]   I've got to be the best friend.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.440]   The market took $150 billion of its value.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.440]   Kick them, knock them down and catch them while they're down.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.440]   Because there's no better time to kick a company than once.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.440]   But he points out, and I think he's -- I always -- I really trust Ben's judgment on this one.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.440]   He points out that really what it is is the market isn't looking at past performance,
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.440]   which is what a quarterly report is, is how we did last quarter,
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.440]   but at the guidance for future performance.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.440]   And it took a hit because the guidance was, "Hey, we're not going to grow as fast.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.440]   We're running out of people."
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.440]   What is Apple's guidance going to be and how will that affect the stock market,
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.440]   you think, later today?
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.440]   I mean, I'm terrible at judging what they're going to pick on guidance,
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.440]   because for Apple, it can be anything from currency -- currency headwinds,
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.440]   which is what they like to call them, to component costs.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.440]   You know, sometimes RAM is exorbitantly expensive and it affects them.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.440]   And then, of course, we're going into the holidays.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.440]   So right now, there's usually a lull because people stop buying iPhones between --
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.440]   I mean, not everybody, but people who watch shows like this,
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.440]   stop buying iPhones between the months of June and September.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:41.440]   So I think next quarter is a relatively slow one for Apple Q4, traditionally,
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.440]   and then you start ramping into the holidays again.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.440]   So I think people know that, though.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.440]   I think Apple guiding low for the in-between quarter is not uncommon.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.440]   That's already in the price. Everybody knows that.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.440]   That's all priced in.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.440]   So there's anything unusual.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.440]   Like with Facebook, it wasn't just that -- because Apple's hitting the law of large numbers, too.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:04.440]   But with Facebook, also, they're expending a lot more money on things like European privacy policies
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:09.440]   and on tightening security and on hiring people to do a lot of the sorting and filtering work.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:16.440]   And that's all massive expenditure without a commensurate income to go.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.440]   And that's against what they're earning.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.440]   And I think that is also what bothered the stock market a little bit.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.440]   He said he became aware of it because of Apple.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:29.440]   And Apple's great results not affecting the market at first.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.440]   It has, though, since then.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.440]   I mean, that's potential for earning, right?
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.440]   It was that Apple's making money.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.440]   Amazon hasn't yet made money, but they will one day.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.440]   And boy, do I want to be there when Amazon starts making money.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.440]   You're buying the future.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.440]   That makes complete sense to me.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.440]   And Amazon is doing what a lot of investors in some ways want to see them do,
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.440]   which is that they're spending all that money back on growth.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:57.440]   And they're looking at 20 or 30 or 40 years of growth as soon as they get to wherever they want to get to, if they ever do.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.440]   They just take the foot off the gas and start collecting cash.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.440]   And as I said, we don't cover the stock market, but when you read whatever happens this afternoon,
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:12.440]   and the market's so jittery, I wouldn't be surprised if Apple's price went down based on something, you know, Luca says,
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.440]   "Well, we don't anticipate great growth in K-4."
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.440]   Well, you also sell on good news.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.440]   You buy on bad news.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.440]   It's not intuitive at all.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:25.440]   It isn't really a comment on the future of the company or its rep.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.440]   You know, this is what Ben points out.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.440]   He says, "Facebook is in great shape financially.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.440]   It's doing great.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.440]   It's going to be a great business for years to come."
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:39.440]   And I think there's no question my mind, Apple, is, so whatever the market does this afternoon isn't necessarily.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.440]   It's an acceleration game.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.440]   It's like you can get from zero to 100 on the highway super easy, but going from 100 to 200 is hard.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.440]   Going from 200 to 300 is almost impossible.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.440]   And when you're going that speed, they just start to look at and go, "There's no way for you to go faster."
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.440]   And they start penalizing you.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.440]   They also penalize sometimes people for doing the right thing.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.440]   Twitter did the right thing.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:09.440]   This quarter got rid of a million bogus accounts, bought accounts, and the market punished them 19% in value because their growth slowed or went down.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.440]   And that's a shame because when Facebook and Twitter do the right thing, it's a shame that the market doesn't reward them.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.440]   It really incentivizes them to do the wrong thing.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.440]   Well, that's how you get into a lot of these things is that you don't want to -- you're on that railroad.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.440]   You're on those tracks and you don't want to get off the track.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.440]   You can't just say, "We're going to do a correction."
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.440]   There's so much pressure.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.440]   When you're speculating in stocks, you're not betting on who wins the horse race.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:37.440]   You're betting on how other people are going to bet on the horse race, which complicates things.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:45.440]   The commonality between Twitter and Facebook is that there is also this extra degree of uncertainty about is the U.S. government.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:55.440]   Going to force these two companies to remake their business plan based on how upset they get or how far behind one party or the other is in the midterms.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:00.440]   So you see how much disruption the EU can create by simply saying, "Guess what?
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.440]   If anybody wants to suddenly move all their data someplace else, you have to let them do that."
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.440]   And guess what?
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:13.440]   You can't -- all this sort of stuff that now the EU is being able to apply and now is becoming sort of fashionable at least for the United States government to talk about.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:30.440]   The fact that there's -- that the Congress people are even publicly raising the incredible idea of saying, "Well, but if -- remember how, like back in the '90s, we said that Facebook and Twitter-type companies are not responsible directly for the content that strangers post on their service,
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:37.440]   what if we said that you are like a hotel or you are like a newspaper and you are responsible for things that -- that turn up on your side?
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.440]   Why shouldn't we discuss that?
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.440]   And that would be -- that's the sort of thing that says, "You know what?
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:47.440]   Maybe we'll -- maybe let's invest in the tin foil. Let's invest in window futures.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.440]   Let's see what we can do outside of Facebook and Twitter."
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:59.440]   Of course, one of the other meaningless numbers that we'll be bandied about today is the race to a trillion dollar market valuation.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:03.440]   Apple's pretty darn close, the closest of the big companies.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.440]   Neil Seibart writes about it this week in "Above Avalon."
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:17.440]   And one of the things he points out is that when it comes to the market, Apple is viewed as very susceptible to faltering.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:23.440]   There continues to be a significant amount of doubt regarding Apple's ability to keep coming up with new products that people love.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:32.440]   But he points out, "This skepticism has surrounded Apple for decades and is being used by the company's effect or motivating employees to surprise the world."
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.440]   Well, do you think -- I'm not that it matters. Not that it means anything.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:41.440]   It's just another joke. Did you see it? They said, "If Apple announced iOS 12 blockchain, it would be worth $2 trillion."
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.440]   That's probably true.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.440]   It's the word -- not even anything. Just put the word in the press release. That's all you need to do.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:53.440]   So Apple is currently $924 billion, so it wouldn't take much to get to $1 trillion.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.440]   Amazon behind it at $848, alphabet $814.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:02.440]   It's really interesting to see these five tech giants, Microsoft, and Facebook rounding out the group,
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:11.440]   and mounting to so much value on the market. Again, I don't know what market cap has to do with anything, but I guess the conference.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.440]   It's Vanity Metric?
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:17.440]   Yeah, it's a Vanity Metric. Anyway, all of these things will be news this afternoon.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:23.440]   Well, I think that Apple -- one of the things that they've been pretty good at is building this ecosystem where when they release a new product,
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:29.440]   there's a certain amount of guaranteed, you know, purchasability that a lot of companies don't have.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:35.440]   If you look at how Apple just entered subscription services with Apple Music,
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:44.440]   and to get to $40 million users, it's half of Spotify, but they came into it out of nowhere.
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.440]   They're not the only ones.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.440]   I mean, Google hasn't been as successful. Microsoft was a disaster.
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.440]   So it's not that they have a built-in audience to do that.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:59.440]   And I think that if you look at if they actually come out with a car, that's probably going to be worth a lot of money.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.440]   You know, I think that that is a -- because there's a lot of people that will buy it.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:10.440]   You know, like, like, sight unseen, there's a lot of Apple users that the folks that are buying the iPhone X are going to at least go try it.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.440]   Well, no, that's not an incredible opportunity.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.440]   True, so I think that's why people buy Teslas is that sense of, I don't care. I'm going to buy it.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.440]   Because a lot of times you can't even test drive a Tesla before you buy it.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.440]   You just have to buy it.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.440]   I'd say I bought the Model X on faith.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.440]   Right.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.440]   You can't test it.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.440]   You just buy it on faith.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.440]   Cybart writes about Apple as a case study.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.440]   He says Apple's management is well aware.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.440]   They're trying to do the seemingly impossible, remain relevant.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:40.440]   Aside from a few luxury brands, very few companies have been able to avoid what appears to be the inevitable fall from Grace.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.440]   He says their future won't be determined by the current stuff.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.440]   iPhone, Apple Watch services.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:51.440]   But by their ability to come up with tools, valuable tools for people,
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.440]   he says Tim Cook has misunderstood many have been grading him as if he's a product visionary.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.440]   He's not.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.440]   He's tasked with managing something more important than any one product.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.440]   He's in charge of the process used to develop products.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.440]   They're visionaries inside that can do it.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.440]   He talks about AI and machine learning.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:15.440]   He says Cybart also writes this isn't his above Avalon blog, which is often very, I think, very astute.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.440]   We also see Apple moving deeper into owning core technologies.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.440]   A bet that will likely give the company competitive advantage measured in decades.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:30.440]   Core technologies being maybe transportation, as you mentioned, Alex, maybe AI.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:39.440]   Putting John Gendrea in charge of this is a scene by us anyway.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:44.440]   I would bet by the market is a very astute and good move.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.440]   I definitely have thought at first I thought that the way Google was going after things with the Waymo
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.440]   and everything without any without any steering wheel and everything else was crazy.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.440]   But the more I think about it, the more I really think that you're going to end up getting into a van
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:03.440]   or some kind of like a lorry style car and you're just going to get into the back and you're going to have a big screen TV
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.440]   and you're going to watch.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.440]   You don't want to have a steering wheel or a pedal.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.440]   You don't even see what's in front of you.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.440]   You know, it's just going to be.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.440]   When you ride the mono rail, of course it's on a track, but when you ride the mono rail in Las Vegas,
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.440]   there's no driver.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.440]   Does that bug you?
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.440]   No.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.440]   I don't want to get in.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.440]   I mean, it is on a track.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.440]   It's not like it's there's anything.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:27.440]   It's not just it's not just that, but the the the each one, none of these are under independent,
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.440]   even though they're there are economists, so to speak, they're not under independent control.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.440]   There's always God.
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.440]   There's always the eye in the sky, right?
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.440]   Aware of where each one of these things things are.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:43.440]   And it's not as though someone boards pops it pops a hatch and uploads new software because they want their mono rail
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.440]   to go faster and be able to pass other other mono rails.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:50.940]   What are you guys looking at this for this quarter?
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:51.940]   What will be your bellwethers?
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:55.440]   I mean, just to go back to what you said previously with John Gendre.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.640]   I mean, whenever there is a core part of the company, if you don't have a single person
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.040]   in charge of it, it's trouble.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.040]   It's problematic.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.840]   Even the app store for so long when you had shared responsibility that was just never one
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:05.840]   person in charge.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.120]   And that's improved now that Phil Schiller's taken over.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.720]   And I think that was key to Apple because machine learning computer vision, all these
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.920]   technologies, it goes together with autonomy.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.600]   It goes together with a lot of what you need for AR ingestion.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.840]   It's just critically important that having that one person in charge is invaluable.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.960]   If it is a serious subject, it needs to be taken seriously and it needs to be taken seriously
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:25.960]   in charge.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:32.120]   Last quarter, they reported $9.2 billion in services revenue, which was a big increase,
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.600]   27% increase.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.720]   That's one I'm going to watch.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.720]   What is services?
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.720]   Was that amazing?
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.280]   I went back because it was the app store's birthday and I went back to Steve Jobs's original
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.560]   introduction where he was talking to Walt Mossberg and then I think it was Walt Mossberg.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.680]   But he said, "We don't intend to make money on this.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.800]   We just want to run it so that we can afford to have all the free apps on it because they
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.800]   add extra value."
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.800]   It would be like iTunes.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.080]   It's basically like subsistence content.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:59.160]   And then you look at it today and it's half, if not two thirds of their services revenue.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.920]   It's like $4, $5, $6 billion and growing.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.240]   Yeah, he was asked how important the app store would be.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.240]   Who knows?
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.680]   Maybe it'll be a billion dollar.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.440]   Business is more than that now, right?
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.920]   At some place and time, that doesn't happen very often.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.360]   A whole new billion dollar market opens up.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.000]   $360 million in the first 30 days.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.640]   I've never seen anything like this.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.680]   He clearly had high hopes for it.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:30.560]   I would not, when 30 days after the app store opened, users had downloaded 30% as many apps
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.040]   as they did iTunes titled.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.120]   It might be like 500 apps at lunch.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.760]   The numbers they were talking, you thought were so small.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.320]   He said, "I would not trust any of our predictions because reality has so far exceeded them by
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.920]   such a great degree.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.160]   We've been reduced to spectators just like you."
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.720]   Now remember, Steve's a great marketer, so this is market speak too.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.360]   It was so much bigger than the Mac.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:54.640]   I mean, they probably had high expectations, but it was exponentially bigger than it was
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.640]   exponentially bigger.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.560]   That hockey stick was such a hockey stick.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.560]   Now this is 10 years ago.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.840]   Here's the thing he said that I thought was prescient.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.880]   I think there are a lot of people, and I'm one of them, who believe that mobile is going
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.160]   to get quite serious because there are things you can do, obviously, mobiles with you all
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.400]   the time, but there's services you can provide with mobile that obviously are not relevant
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.720]   on a desktop such as location-based services integrated in your application.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.440]   This is before Uber existed, but he's absolutely right.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.000]   I mean, he was right.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.880]   That was, I think in my opinion, the big, it's not the size, it's not the apps.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.520]   It's the fact that it's mobile and location-based and always on internet.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:42.960]   That was the confluence of all those great technologies all into one small packet.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.400]   An Apple had been thinking about it for a long time.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:50.440]   I mean, since the '90s, they've had time to think about it longer than a lot of other
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.920]   folks had, and so they just took a little while to get there.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.040]   I mean, I think a lot of it's just the technology coalescing with the idea.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.000]   The journal has made the 45-minute audio interview.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Nick Wittenfield did in 2008 with Jobs available for download.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.400]   So be well worth downloading it and listening to it.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.240]   I guess you have to probably have to have a subscription.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.240]   To the journal.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.960]   Either Wall Street Journal or because it was done in collaboration with the information
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.400]   because Wittenfield is at the information now.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.400]   He did the interview.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.560]   He did it while he was hired by the Wall Street Journal, so they collaborated on releasing it.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.560]   Nice.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.560]   Okay.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:32.080]   Yeah, it's really great because new Steve Jobs interviews continue to surface, and it's
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:37.480]   really great to get these and hear them and listen to his voice again.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:43.240]   And hear his insights 10 years ago as to where the App Store is going.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.560]   But 10 years fast forward, clearly Apple's making a lot of money.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:52.360]   That's one thing I'm going to be looking at is they don't break down services, but App Store
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.360]   is one of them.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.680]   But I'm going to be looking and seeing growth there.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.200]   I'm sure they'll mention Apple music
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.740]   'cause that's a great story for Apple right now.
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.520]   Probably this will be the quarter they surpass Spotify,
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.380]   at least in the US and paid subscribers, right?
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.400]   Did they already do that?
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.960]   - No, no, I think that Spotify is pretty far ahead.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.500]   I think they'd have a hard time.
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.480]   - I think internationally, Spotify is internet.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.480]   - International international, yeah!
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:13.840]   - That's less than in the US, yeah.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.980]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:15.820]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh no.
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.380]   Spotify is like 80 million paid subscribers,
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.560]   it's a massive 70 or 80 million, that's gonna be it.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.400]   But I think Apple's getting close, actually.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.040]   What is the current Apple music paid subscribers?
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.680]   Do we know, is it 50?
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.520]   - I don't remember.
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.760]   - Last I heard it was 40, but I don't,
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.600]   but it could have been.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.600]   - So that's another one to be looking for,
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.000]   is what number, 'cause they do like to tout
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.040]   the good stuff, right?
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.600]   They like to say, you know, they don't have to break
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.920]   this stuff out, which is always bothered me.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.640]   - It was a major music distributor, not Apple,
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.080]   or anyone else who said that Apple music is now 40 million.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.880]   - 50 million, 50 million is the number, yeah.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.360]   So look for that, see if they say anything about that.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.160]   They might see, simply say, 50% growth.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.240]   - Right, right.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.040]   What else do you, what else?
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.520]   - The Bezos graph.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.240]   What else are we looking for?
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.080]   - Others, always a fascinating category,
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.840]   because it has Apple Watch, Apple Watch, AirPods,
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.640]   but also anything that's not a Mac and iPod,
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.720]   an iPad or an iPhone, gets lumped into there.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:12.560]   It's all the other hardware.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.400]   - But they don't?
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.400]   - It's like services, but for Braddock.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.200]   - That's another one where they don't break it down,
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.080]   and they'll say something like,
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.360]   "We had the best quarter for Apple Watch we've ever had."
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.200]   - Yeah.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.040]   - Meaningless.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:22.880]   - I mean, given their drawers,
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.960]   I think they would have rather,
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.080]   if they could go back in time and never report iPad sales,
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.480]   I think they'd do that now too.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.440]   - Are they stuck to in that?
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.360]   They do have to say Mac, iPad, iPhone.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.240]   They do say those anyway.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.720]   - Yeah, and I think that the watch has been interesting,
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.900]   to watch it grow.
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.680]   I don't see a lot of other things on people's rests.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.120]   - You know, it's either a traditional watch
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.400]   or an Apple Watch, but you rarely see them.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.040]   - You rarely see them on Apple Watch.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.560]   - Apple Watch is Apple Watch, Apple,
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.800]   are you wearing an Apple Watch?
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.640]   - Apple Watch.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.840]   - No, I see Apple Watch.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.760]   - I see Apple Watch.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.120]   - I see plenty of high-end Fitbits.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:58.960]   I see plenty of those.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.360]   - I do see a lot of Fitbit devices.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.720]   - I have to say that.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.400]   - I guess we forget that this part of the important
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.400]   selling point of a design of this sort of thing
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.760]   is that I noticed the Fitbits because it's that weird,
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.760]   like emerald-shaped design.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.560]   And so I don't register it as,
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.800]   oh, someone's wearing a fitness watch.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.320]   It's like, oh, someone's wearing specifically that model.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.480]   And so I noticed it a lot.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:25.280]   But yeah, it's definitely more than I see other devices,
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.080]   but they don't own the market yet.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.280]   The people that people are seeing,
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.160]   people are really embracing like the lower line,
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.000]   like $100, $200 ones.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.880]   I was talking to somebody at a public event a few days ago
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.000]   and asked them, well, why did you go for like this
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.360]   Garmin device that goes for about $150 or whatever
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.560]   instead of an Apple Watch?
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.920]   And said, oh, well, I didn't have like $500
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.120]   for an Apple Watch.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.120]   And this was a new device that I needed to tell them,
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.440]   oh, well, you know that they're down to like $250 now.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.280]   If you want to get the base model, he didn't even know that.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.280]   - Yeah, and I think that it's to Apple's advantage
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.840]   that they don't have a majority stake
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.200]   in a lot of these things because it keeps them well
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.280]   out of antitrust positions.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.840]   I think that Android is the best thing I've ever had.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.400]   I know that Apple may not say this,
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.600]   but Android was the best thing that ever happened Apple.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.760]   'Cause otherwise they would definitely be dealing
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.280]   with antitrust.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.960]   - Actually so funny 'cause Apple was the best thing
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.080]   that ever happened to Microsoft.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.000]   Microsoft kept Apple alive partially for that.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.960]   Just because they didn't want to get the antitrust,
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.600]   now it's the shoes on the other foot.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.200]   Anything else to say about the results
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.040]   anything else to look for?
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:36.880]   - I like the questions.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.360]   I mean, blessed be that Gene Munster is in Katie Huberty
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.360]   isn't everybody because sometimes they ask
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.280]   like the most boring question imaginable.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.360]   And sometimes they know that Tim Cook
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.800]   will never answer the question,
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.720]   but they try to find increasingly creative ways
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.680]   to ask it.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.400]   And once in a while, like he'll just say,
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.920]   like he talked about AR way before it was a product
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.040]   which was unusual.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.600]   And he talked about autonomous technologies.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.280]   And you just never know once in a while
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.800]   they get the magic spot between his interest
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.680]   and their really obfuscated question
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.080]   and we get a little bit of magic.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.520]   And those are my favorite moments.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.080]   - What's your question?
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:08.920]   - What's your question?
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:12.280]   What would you ask Tim Cook if you could get on that call?
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.760]   - Oh, I don't know because I'm no good
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.880]   at making those Gene Munster asked,
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.240]   are you gonna make a television set?
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.640]   - In 900 different ways.
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.480]   - Yeah.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.320]   - And I could barely think it too.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.480]   - Yeah.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.560]   - No, that is definitely a real thing.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.360]   It's like the party game where you have to get someone
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.360]   to say the word watermelon without,
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.920]   and here you can't use the word fruit,
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.160]   you can't use the word summer, you can't use.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.240]   So, but, and it's sometimes you feel as though
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.320]   you're both like understand the,
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.680]   sometimes I'm talking to even someone at Apple
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.640]   and I can hear them basically thinking,
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.480]   I'm willing to answer,
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.120]   if he asked this in the right way,
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.800]   there's something I can tell him,
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.640]   but I have to wait for him to come up with a question of,
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.240]   not what are your immediate plans for the Mac Mini?
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.840]   You can instead say, do you think the market is leading
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.800]   more towards consumer as opposed to pro these days?
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.320]   And then you might get something out of them.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.480]   But these calls are always really important
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:13.400]   because this is not only is this a really rare opportunity
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.440]   for someone to simply ask a question of the CEO,
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.640]   and they're in a position where they're going to
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.040]   almost have to answer,
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.360]   but also there's a legal component with this
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.360]   because this is advice to shareholders.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.240]   So if they obfuscate, if they use,
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.280]   if they are really awfully selective,
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.360]   if they, Apple is certainly not going to downright lie,
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.280]   but there's always, so there's always going to be
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.480]   that liability that if they indicate that the app store
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.920]   is doing better than they thought,
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.520]   or that there is a product coming in AR,
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.560]   that isn't then that could actually become a legal issue
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.320]   for them down the line.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.720]   Rest of the light, if they lied to me or Renee,
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.760]   who cares?
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.640]   All right, nothing more, nothing more we want to look for.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.800]   Yeah, just the projections, I mean,
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.880]   that's probably going to be the biggest piece
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.720]   everyone's looking at is what they say for next quarter
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.320]   and the general outlook.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.800]   I am keen to see if they use this opportunity
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:13.080]   to talk about sales of the new Superduper MacBook Pros.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.160]   They might, if there's exceptionally good news to say,
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.120]   they certainly wouldn't hide it right now.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.000]   But none of the results though,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   but they might just mention it anyway.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:30.320]   It wouldn't be a case of,
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.360]   so if they don't say anything,
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.440]   it doesn't mean it's bad either.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.080]   They just, they try to highlight things that are kind of
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:35.920]   a section.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.640]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.400]   they used to say bad news, no, they used to say like,
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.720]   they used to put out like a special press release
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.320]   over the weekend to say how much pre-orders
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.360]   and then how many sales they were back
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.400]   when everything was exploding, but not so much.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.720]   That's such a high price ticket.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.600]   You're not going to have big numbers on it.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.600]   I have to say, just anecdotally,
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.440]   I'm super happy with the I9,
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.200]   a hot so-called hot MacBook Pro.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.600]   I got top of the line and with everything,
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.520]   but the hard drive and I just adore it.
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:09.480]   It is so, it is noticeably faster in almost every use case.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.040]   Lightroom is finally usable,
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.240]   which is a big deal.
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.160]   The hard drive to me, I've been editing with abandoned.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.080]   Like I used to so carefully have external drives
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.680]   and delete all the cat, because Final Cut is so great.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.960]   Did you buy the four terabyte?
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.320]   No, no, when they announced it, I was like,
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.400]   oh God, I have to have that.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.000]   Then when I saw the price, I was like, oh God,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.160]   I can't afford that.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:31.880]   So I'm with two terabytes, but it's still way more than,
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.680]   it's enough for me to be able to do two, three videos,
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.280]   live on the machine any one time.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.040]   And before it was struggling to do one,
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.440]   because my old machine was like 512 or something.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.840]   Yeah, I actually am happy with the one terabyte.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.960]   I still have 750 gigabytes left.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.400]   And I had bought this with the two and I decided not to keep it
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.200]   and I kept the one and I'm actually, that's fine for me.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:58.160]   I bought one of those Samsung T5 mobile backup devices,
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:03.120]   one terabyte, I bought a new one.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.840]   I had the old one that was a USB Type A connector,
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.000]   but I got the Type C, so it's fast.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.840]   And I just use Superduper and every few days,
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.800]   I plug it in, Superduper launches when it sees it,
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.520]   backs up any changes, it's bootable.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.720]   It's golden, it's golden.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.720]   I bought the same size of my internal, so then I have a back.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.240]   - I'm a 13 inch, on 13 inch,
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.800]   all the ports are now full bandwidth,
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.320]   which wasn't the case a lot. - I love that too.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.160]   Yes.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.000]   - Yeah.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.760]   - I should already showed you the dongle I got.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.840]   So I'm kind of, I feel like I'm happy.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.080]   I don't need, I have no, and by the way, keyboard,
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.320]   'cause I know Andy hates it and Renee loves it.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.960]   And I was in the hate camp
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.880]   and I've moved into not the love it camp
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.800]   but the can live with it camp.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.640]   I think those things--
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.480]   - I like it slightly less,
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.880]   but everyone else seems to like it less.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.040]   I'm obviously built, well, it's just a slightly mushier.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.040]   And I was this. - Enjoy.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.360]   - That's why I like this one.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.760]   I know, I'm built backwards.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.880]   I just, I don't know.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.440]   - You're missing the ticket attack.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.280]   Yeah, I don't like the ticket.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.760]   - Andy's looking at me with a mix of pity and despair.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.960]   - No, no, I can't, I can't, again,
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.560]   I, you never have to defend liking what you like.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.960]   That's a maximum. - Oh, thank you.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.840]   I'm just saying that, and I'm glad that Leo loves,
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:10.800]   loves his new purchase.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.800]   I'm just saying that I don't, I can't imagine any,
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.360]   but any, anyone on Apple on a promotional video
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.480]   in front of a white screen saying,
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.920]   we honestly think you will learn to accept this keyboard.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.400]   - No. - No.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.760]   - No. - It's, yeah.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.480]   - Let me, that's not aspirational, this one.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.600]   (laughing)
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.400]   - I don't aspire to love it.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.840]   I aspire to be able to use it.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.400]   Touch bar, every once in a while, I hit it,
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.080]   and I'm so mad at myself 'cause the screen will turn off.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.080]   (laughing)
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.560]   You know, and I'm still not a fan of the Touch bar.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.400]   I am a huge fan of Touch ID though,
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.600]   so that, that kinda maybe makes up for it.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.560]   As I mentioned last week, better Touch tool helps a lot.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.600]   I don't use the Touch bar as a controller,
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.400]   but more as a informational.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.440]   So put the time there, I put the battery life there.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.600]   That's a good place for it.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.400]   And, - I use it as a scrubber
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.320]   just because it's like a visual,
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.480]   I don't know if it could fit just,
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.680]   yeah.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.640]   - 'Cause they just don't let you scrub everything
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.160]   on the trackpad for some reason,
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.760]   like tabs on a browser,
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.240]   but they let you scrub it on the Touch bar.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.800]   And it's so fast to go through that stuff.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.600]   - Another thing I should mention that to watch for
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.400]   is Apple Pay, they announced that eBay
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.600]   is gonna start taking Apple Pay next year.
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.480]   Apple Pay is, you know, it's one of those things
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.920]   where it was everybody understood
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.720]   that it's a big deal when they announced it,
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.920]   but it was also one of those things
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.240]   that's gonna be a little, like a train leaving the station
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.840]   slow to gain speed.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.840]   I think it's starting to gain that speed now.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.520]   - I have to admit that I ran across my first website
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.480]   that really just like an independent website
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.760]   that just supports Apple Pay.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.600]   - It's really nice.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.520]   - And I just clicked on it
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.160]   and then my phone vibrated and I touched the thing
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.000]   and it was done and it was,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:46.840]   - It was a little too easy.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.200]   - And it had my address, it had everything,
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.300]   it just went whoop, and I was like,
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.800]   oh, okay now.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.000]   I used to be, I didn't wanna order anything other
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.840]   than Amazon because I just don't wanna put all my information
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.680]   in again and everything else.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:58.160]   And now I was like, I only wanna have to pay.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.320]   - And that's another reason why Touch ID on the laptop
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.920]   is really great 'cause it supports Apple Pay.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.400]   I have the same experience 'cause I'm, look,
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.000]   I don't know, I have this problem with Instagram,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.240]   I buy stuff on Instagram, I don't know why.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.160]   Those ads seem to get me, maybe I'm a weekend state
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.480]   in the middle of the night when I'm a bad guy.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.320]   - I can't even register a tweet.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.160]   - I can't even register a tweet.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.200]   - I don't know, I just bought pants on it.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.000]   I had something wrong with me.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.280]   But the thing I always hope for is,
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.880]   oh God, I hope I have to enter data into buy this
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.040]   'cause I'm not gonna do it.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:26.880]   - Right, right.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.120]   - And the thing that always gets me
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.960]   is if it supports Apple Pay, I'm screwed.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:30.800]   I'm gonna buy it.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.440]   - So if you're a merchant selling online,
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.560]   it's probably a good tip.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.360]   - Even, I went to New York, I got out of the cab
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.880]   to cap to cap to pay, I went to the hotel,
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.800]   the vending machine, the hotel took cap to pay.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.160]   It was just, it was like living in Canada all over again.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.600]   - Again, NFC payments and the same is true,
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.600]   I think, for like Android NFC, where,
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.680]   it's like the day, there's a, thank goodness,
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.480]   there's a vending, the vending machines
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.280]   at my local community rail station,
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.880]   again, they take tap to pay
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.800]   because the times where I don't have $1.25 on me
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.160]   because I'm paying, I'm even paying for my train tickets
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.840]   on my phone app, like, oh thank goodness,
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.400]   I do get to get a diet, Dr. Pepper,
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.240]   for this number one.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.840]   (laughing)
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.680]   There's gonna be a time where people,
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.840]   just like there was, it was unbelievable to imagine
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.240]   that there would be a generation
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:19.880]   that would not know how to write in cursive,
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.720]   but then it happened, and now there's gonna be
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.080]   a generation of kids who don't really understand,
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.440]   who have to have like a little card,
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.320]   to remind them like what the different size coins are,
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.240]   and what they mean, and how much they mean,
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.080]   because--
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:34.920]   - I can barely-- - I can barely
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:35.920]   let it check anymore, Andy.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.560]   - Yeah, well, and I always think about,
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.320]   I look at the guys at the hotel,
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.440]   and all those tip-based things don't work anymore
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.440]   because I never have any cash, ever.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.000]   And at first, I felt really bad about it,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.800]   and I'd go through this process of trying to make sure
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.280]   I had cash, like a tip, the folks that are,
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.960]   all this stuff, and after a while,
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.680]   it just became this thing like, okay, I can't,
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.960]   I can't keep on managing this, someone else's.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.600]   - But it goes the other way too.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.400]   It's like, I still remember the first year
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:04.320]   that sometimes I'm at a Comic Con,
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.360]   and I kinda like this person's sketchbook,
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.840]   but it's really not worth like $30 to me,
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.680]   but I don't want this person to think that,
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.480]   oh, I have sampled your wares and found them wanting,
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.840]   good day, sir, and I would say, oh, well,
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.080]   it's still the first day of the show,
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.400]   if I still have like cash left over,
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.480]   I still have to save up my cash,
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.440]   if I still have cash left over, maybe I'll see it,
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.680]   I'll come back at the end of the day,
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.520]   said, oh, well, I do have square,
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.720]   I can't take a credit card, and I'm like,
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:34.760]   do I want to say, no, I just think your sketchbook
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:38.480]   is overpriced, or do I say, yes, that's wonderful,
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.320]   yes, I will take your sketchbook,
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.960]   I have been caught like, no, I can't use that lie anymore
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.760]   because at the street fairs, you can now use your card
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.000]   for everything, which again, is another lovely thing
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.400]   because it means that instead of going to the MIT
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.240]   and the weekly market and saying,
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.640]   I'm going to take $100 with me,
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.400]   and I know that when my wallet is empty,
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:00.040]   I'm done buying things, now I can say,
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:05.160]   I really do want a Kim one, and $300 is not that much
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.880]   to spend on a Kim one.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.200]   - Yes it is.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.440]   - And yes, it's $200, well, okay,
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.480]   this was a Kim one in a rack,
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.520]   but like every, it was being used like the control experiments,
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.600]   and it was, oh, it's gorgeous, gorgeous.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:23.040]   - Hey, to each zone, we all have our needs.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.000]   Again, you enjoy your, your, your,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   - My five minutes. - Your five minutes.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.080]   - Get a keyboard.
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:32.080]   I will enjoy my 1977 computer.
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:36.680]   - Let's take a break, and then we'll come back with more
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:41.160]   Andy Inaco, birthday boy, Renee Ritchie, Alex Lindsey,
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.000]   talking about Apple.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.640]   I am so thrilled to welcome Masterclass
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:49.360]   as a sponsor to our shows on Twitch
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.880]   because I'm so thrilled that Masterclass exists.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.240]   If you've not, if you don't know about Masterclass,
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.800]   you've got to find out about Masterclass.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.960]   Imagine learning investigative journalism
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:05.080]   from Bob Woodward, or acting from Samuel L. Jackson.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:08.320]   Malcolm Gladwell teaches interviewing,
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:11.800]   Annie Leibowitz teaches photography, Ron Howard,
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.040]   teaches directing, and on and on and on.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.360]   You want to learn how to shoot a hoop from Steph Curry?
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:22.120]   How to cook from Thomas Keller or Wolfgang Puck?
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.120]   This is Masterclass, the best,
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:29.160]   most expert, the geniuses of our era,
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.080]   for the first time ever,
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:35.320]   on camera teaching you their skills.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.200]   It is absolutely amazing.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.240]   I mean, imagine watching a scene,
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.000]   I did this the other night from Pulp Fiction,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.880]   having Samuel L. Jackson walk actors through it,
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.640]   bit by bit explaining the diner scene.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.360]   No, no, you got to understand this,
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.600]   you got to understand that.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.160]   That is worth the price of admission alone,
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.120]   but it doesn't stop there.
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:00.520]   Now, Masterclass, as there's my friend Steve Martin,
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.080]   want to learn comedy from the greatest comic of all time?
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:07.040]   And by the way, even if you're not interested
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.160]   in learning comedy, sitting and watching Steve Martin,
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.160]   it's hysterical, it's fun, it's the best TV show ever.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.840]   Jane Goodall on conservation.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:19.000]   Mark Jacobs on fashion design.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.480]   I mean, Gordon Ramsay on How to Yellow People.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.240]   How about astronaut Chris Hadfield?
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.080]   He's talking about going to Mars,
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.280]   about space exploration.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:34.040]   And the thing that's great about Masterclass
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.480]   launches for space with the face.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.840]   Is it so well produced?
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.240]   And you had, now Alex, you told me,
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.080]   you actually subscribed to this.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.280]   I almost from day one, it's like watching a filmmaker.
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.600]   It is really good stuff.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:46.680]   And I think that one of the things that's really interesting
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.160]   is they're just getting ahold of people.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.480]   I mean, I don't even know what's about this.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.880]   They're just working on screenwriting.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.040]   Yeah, and the interesting thing about this
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.480]   is that they're just getting all these people
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.280]   that you don't want them to leave the world without
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.920]   leaving behind what they're bigger than.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:00.680]   Well, can I ask them?
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.080]   'Cause I talked to them yesterday, Masterclass.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.800]   I said, off the record, it's not gonna be off the record
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.880]   'cause I'm gonna tell you the answer.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:07.880]   Off the record.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.720]   How the hell do you get these people to do this?
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.480]   And he said, you know, you'd be surprised.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:16.640]   People want to pass it a forward, pay it forward.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:20.280]   They want people to know how they do this stuff.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.440]   It's exactly what you said.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:25.320]   They don't wanna leave the world without the secrets.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.080]   And what they've proven is that they're gonna take
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.360]   a good care of your idea.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.680]   You know, they're not, boy do they.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.600]   You know that if you're a Gordon Ramsay
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.520]   or you're a Serena Williams or, you know,
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.480]   you know that they're gonna do the right thing
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.240]   and have you look good.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.080]   You're not gonna, it's not gonna be this kind of,
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.160]   I'll never be in Annie Leibowitz for portraits.
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.760]   But I don't care to watch Annie Leibowitz
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.600]   talk about her technique, her craft,
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.660]   what she does, how she thinks.
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.640]   That's worth, it's better than a documentary.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.040]   This is awesome.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.840]   And yes, now you could try it free for a week
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.800]   every one of these.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.480]   So if you have any question about whether these are amazing,
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.120]   Deadmau5 takes his hat off.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:08.720]   He takes his, I've never seen his face
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:12.040]   and teaches the secret of electronic music production.
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.920]   Unbelievable.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.880]   It's more than just the video though.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.440]   So Annie Leibowitz, I'm gonna give you an example.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.920]   15 lessons.
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.720]   There's a workbook you can download
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:25.720]   with lesson recaps, assignments, additional resources.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:29.200]   There's office hours, so you can have a question
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.320]   and get feedback.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.520]   She'll select student questions and answer them.
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:36.520]   And there's of course a great discussion group too.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.320]   So it's a social network of other people
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.600]   taking the class.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:44.360]   This is, I mean, I just wanna say thank you
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:47.480]   for existing masterclass and inviting you
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:52.480]   to try it free for a week at masterclass.com/macbreak.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.200]   It's enough to take a whole class or sample a bunch of them
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.240]   and I guarantee you you're gonna subscribe.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.960]   Can I also point out, if you have a family member
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.280]   and I hear this all the time,
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.080]   there are a lot of people who have kids
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.680]   who wanna be photographers.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:11.480]   When I was talking to somebody who gave his nine year old son,
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:14.400]   another radio host, gave his nine year old son
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.040]   a filmmaking class.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:17.880]   Right.
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.040]   'Cause this kid was in the movies.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:23.560]   And to see how Ron Howard sets up a shot.
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.760]   And I've been setting up for my kids
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.520]   'cause my daughter, literally, my daughter's a little geeky
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.000]   and they never think that one of my kids be geeky.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.840]   She's like, I just wanna watch more documentaries.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.120]   I'm like, oh my God.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.440]   You wanna celebrate that.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.280]   So it's a great--
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.160]   Have I got something for you?
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.640]   It's great for yourself.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.800]   Get the whole family.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.800]   Kids love R.L. Stein teaching how to write young adult fiction.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.640]   Right.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.240]   Or James Patterson teaching how to write thrillers.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.920]   He was one of the first, they did,
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.480]   that's the other thing they said happens is
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.760]   once you get James Patterson and Steve Martin
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:55.360]   and Wolfgang Puck, you get a few,
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.360]   then the other people, everybody knows everybody
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:00.360]   in Hollywood and go, oh, you know, this is pretty good.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.600]   Okay, we're gonna do it too.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.760]   And they do make it look really good.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:05.000]   As if something does production, it's like--
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.480]   Yeah, made them look good.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:08.560]   They just, David Mamet, you were saying--
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:09.400]   Oh, David Mamet.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.400]   They just added David Mamet.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.560]   That's teaching writing.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.760]   He's so nonchalant and just kind of like,
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.400]   oh, that's how you do it.
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:16.680]   Yeah, he's got this kind of--
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.160]   To get to, by the way, just to get to see his writing studio,
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.200]   'cause these are shot on location.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.760]   They're not in a boring studio.
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.160]   This is Mamet where he writes.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:29.400]   That's by itself, that's awesome.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.400]   They've got lots more coming.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.160]   If you go to the bottom of the website,
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.760]   you'll see the more they've got planned
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:38.280]   and they said they don't want me to tell you what they've got,
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.800]   but there is a little bit coming up
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:40.800]   and there's a lot more.
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.000]   They're getting some really amazing people.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.480]   Spike Lee is coming.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:47.480]   Margaret Atwood, you wanna learn poker
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.280]   from a world champion?
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:53.360]   Daniel Nagrano, I mean, this is great stuff.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.560]   I don't, this should sell itself.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.400]   I don't need to tell you.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.120]   If you've never heard about it,
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:02.320]   okay, I think the Samuel L. Jackson is pretty special.
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.800]   You go into an acting class with Jackson.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.960]   - I know he works that are weird.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:11.440]   - And you get to learn how to act.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.280]   - It's in the movie, it's trying to accomplish something.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.360]   Do all the things that you have in your mind
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.200]   that will inform the audience
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.360]   when they see this character,
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.560]   well, oh, that's who that is.
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:22.400]   - I mean, you just--
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.160]   - And by the way, when they show a little behind the scenes,
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.120]   the best part of Masterclass is it is a Masterclass
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.520]   in how to shoot interviews.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.360]   - I know.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.600]   - So when you see the behind the scenes,
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.520]   it's actually, I love watching the behind the scenes stuff
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.800]   because you're like, there,
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.920]   but here's the diner scene.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:39.040]   So he's working with these students in the diner scene.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:44.880]   - And to the audience, the truth is you're the weak
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:48.040]   and I'm the teary.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:48.880]   - What is that?
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.720]   What is he?
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:50.640]   - Isn't this awesome?
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.000]   So even if you're not gonna be an actor,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.880]   it will enhance your enjoyment of movies
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.240]   so much to know what's going on.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:00.800]   I don't know, I could go on and on.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.200]   Masterclass.com/Macbreak.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.960]   My only problem is when I sit down,
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.240]   which one am I gonna watch tonight?
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.080]   - Yes.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.720]   - I'm a big chess fan to get the world champion,
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.600]   Gary Cusbarov teaching you how to play chess.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.200]   I know that's kind of a niche one,
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.920]   but that's incredible.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:17.760]   I can go on and on and on.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.040]   - I've gone on to a long string of the cooking ones.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.080]   - Yeah, the cooking's good.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:24.000]   That's actually my, I was talking to my son, Henry.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.840]   And he wants to be a cook.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.560]   He said, oh yeah, I subscribed.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.760]   But I'll watch anything that Gordon Ramsay does,
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:32.960]   I'll watch this because it's a mixture of like,
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.280]   it's not that hard and he's really precise.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.880]   - You know, like it's, there's like,
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:37.720]   - Yeah, yeah. - Keller?
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:38.720]   - Wolf, gang, puck.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:43.120]   - We've done streams with Keller and he is amazing.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:43.960]   You know, I have one.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:44.800]   - Yeah, it's that one, yeah.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.920]   - One of the greatest chefs in America.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.920]   I'm next to my agenda, Malcolm Gladwell,
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.600]   'cause it says Malcolm Gladwell teaches writing,
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.400]   but it's actually, he talks about his interviewing
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.520]   and I'm always trying to get to be a better interviewer.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:55.720]   - Yep, to your previous point, Leo,
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.080]   there was a George St. Pierre,
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.120]   most famous Quebec mixed martial artist of all time.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.640]   He went to do gymnastics class
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.280]   and they said he'd never be a good gymnast,
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.120]   but that wasn't the point.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:03.960]   To be a good gymnast,
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.600]   you'd have to give up everything else he did
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:06.600]   and just do gymnastics,
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.880]   but learning the gymnastics made him so much better
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.120]   at what he did and that's what I feel like with these classes.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.680]   I would have, like to be like Danny Leibwitz,
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.400]   I would have to only do that as often as you did that.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.240]   - It's not gonna happen.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.960]   - But it can make me so much better at the enjoyment
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.240]   that I get out of doing that,
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.840]   that it's so beyond worthwhile.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:22.680]   - Yeah, yeah.

[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:51.360]   that you might be familiar with, Cyber Paint,
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:52.840]   to work on VR.
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:57.760]   - You see this drip from Apple on VR.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.600]   You know, they're definitely not ignoring it.
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:03.760]   - Sterling Crispin, I haven't used Cyber Paint.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.240]   I've used tilt brush.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.040]   - I haven't used mostly medium.
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.840]   That's what I've been most familiar with.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.160]   - Yeah.
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:13.640]   But Apple, it's not just serenity Caldwell.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:16.240]   Apple's hiring the best and the brightest.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:21.240]   And I feel bad for Imore when serenity leaves
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:24.520]   and goes to, and you especially 'cause now you gotta,
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:27.160]   somebody's gotta transcribe those calls, not serenity.
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.000]   - Like a sergeant.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:28.840]   - Oh, Micah's gonna do it.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:29.680]   You don't have to do it.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.640]   - Okay, that's good news.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.200]   But it's my, I went to talk to them about health.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.320]   And I think nine out of the 10 people in the room
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:40.040]   were doctors, almost all of them still had 20% patient loads
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:44.240]   at famous, like, like Mayo Clinic and yet,
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.880]   famous hospitals.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.600]   And they were, 'cause there's been a few articles
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.600]   about Apple's too arrogant to consult
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.840]   with external experts in these fields.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.800]   But it's that Apple, it's like the pro workflow group.
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.960]   They would rather hire them and have them on the team.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:57.800]   - Amazing.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.000]   - That way, they don't have to worry about like,
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.800]   Lucasfilm being upset, they're looking at advanced
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:01.640]   copy of "Star Wars."
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:03.480]   But also they have these people there every day.
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:05.840]   And Steve Jobs famously was critical of consultants
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.480]   because they come in, give their advice and leave.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.040]   And who cares if it works or not?
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.720]   But when you're leading the project,
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.320]   you are so vested in making sure that it works.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.360]   You have no option.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:16.200]   And that's why I think they love to build
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.800]   these expert groups internally.
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.840]   - Well, and I think also that there's always a risk,
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.200]   especially when you're doing something new,
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.800]   that you're teaching, if you're teaching an outside person,
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.800]   and you're asking, no matter what questions you ask,
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.920]   you're setting them up to understand a lot more
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.440]   about that subject matter,
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.360]   that now that knowledge base may go to another company.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:37.000]   You're basically paying, they get a lot smarter
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.360]   because they're working with you about that technology.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.840]   And then they go work for one of your competitors
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.160]   and consult for them.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.880]   And that means that you wanna get them after
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:46.200]   they have that information, but not,
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.000]   you don't want to give it to them
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.520]   and have them go somewhere else.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:51.520]   - Is this an Apple patent?
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:56.520]   - The comfort profile patent, Apple Insiders says,
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.840]   Apple's self-driving car system could change how it drives,
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:02.200]   not just outside sensors, but inside sensors,
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:05.240]   by detecting passenger stress levels.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:07.160]   - Oh, don't steal Georgia down next, please.
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:10.240]   - Georgia's on her way.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:14.200]   Comfort profiles is filed in March published on Thursday,
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:17.480]   describes how an autonomous driving and navigation system
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:20.200]   can move through an environment with motions governed
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.120]   by a number of factors set indirectly
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:25.160]   by the passengers, a sensor,
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:29.640]   could monitor people in the car, their anxiety level,
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.160]   by looking at your eye movements, body posture,
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.760]   gestures, pupil dilation,
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.240]   blinking body temperature,
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.760]   heartbeat, perspiration, head position,
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.800]   and then decide, I don't think we should slow down
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:41.640]   in this area.
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:42.800]   - Well, I think one of the things that I think
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.200]   is gonna be interesting as we go to autonomous
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.680]   is that I know that with Uber,
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.680]   I don't care, I mean, I don't care that the Uber,
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.840]   unless I'm really, really late,
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.440]   but usually I'm not because it's not that complicated
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.880]   to just get in the car and let it go do its thing.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:56.880]   And you get in a little earlier
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.400]   because you can keep on working.
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:50:59.560]   There's all these things that'll happen
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:01.120]   that I think that in a lot of ways,
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:03.560]   we're gonna have cars that aren't necessarily going faster,
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:06.320]   but actually going slowly and more--
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.480]   - I wouldn't find that.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.880]   - But the whole thing is, is that I don't care if it's going,
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.600]   it doesn't need to go 70,
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.200]   'cause what happens is you give yourself more time
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:16.480]   because you're not rushing to finish something at home
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.240]   and then get in the car to the airport,
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:19.440]   you're like, "Well, I'll just keep on working on it
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:20.880]   "and I get in the car."
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.360]   And so that is, you leave earlier,
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:24.840]   you know, all those things happen.
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.040]   And so I think that, I don't think we're gonna have cars
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.240]   going faster, I think they're gonna have actually,
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:32.400]   just become more deliberate.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.240]   - Well, you're also talking about things
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:37.240]   like they're people who get cars sick very easily,
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.640]   and you could basically say that take those curves
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:42.840]   much, much more gently, don't accelerate quite as quickly
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.160]   as you normally would.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.000]   - Right.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.160]   - It would be really, really good to be able to tell the,
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:52.200]   to tell my creative, to have control of a driving profile
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.960]   where I can say, "Here's what I prefer."
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:57.200]   Like I would much rather be, take me,
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.640]   take me, don't, don't, don't, don't,
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:02.520]   have me going in and out of huge bright sunlight.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:05.760]   Please don't, actually drop me off about a half a block
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.560]   away from where it is, 'cause I don't want to be making
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.840]   like a big presentation of where I am.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:12.600]   It's, there's a lot of interesting things here
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.480]   that don't, it's not just gun it, gun it, I'm running late.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.040]   Just gun it, take the sidewalk if you have to.
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.920]   - I hate to, I don't like rumors, on the other hand,
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.840]   I know there are a lot of people sitting and expecting that,
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:28.520]   I mean, it's only a month or so away for an iPhone launch
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.440]   and an iPad launch, maybe, well first of all,
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.040]   will it be September for the iPad,
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.280]   or will they do, as they've done sometimes in the past,
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.080]   separate the iPhone and iPad announcements
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.880]   and make the iPad announcement in October?
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:40.880]   - It's hard 'cause they have their own,
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:42.680]   they have control of Steve Jobs Theater now,
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.720]   so they could, but it's still a massive effort
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:45.680]   every time they do an event.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.320]   So I think if they have their brothers,
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:48.960]   it's a big September event when they announce
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:51.160]   the iPhone and Apple TV and Apple.
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.120]   - Do it all at once.
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:54.600]   - Yeah, I think that's, everyone likes that better
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.080]   'cause you don't have to travel to it.
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.520]   - But as we pointed out, and it was clear with the MacBook Pro,
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.640]   Apple doesn't announce anything until it's ready
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:06.080]   and they're not gonna be guided by, you know,
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:09.520]   an event calendar to, if it's not ready, it's not ready.
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.640]   But here, now, tell me if you trust Mac Otakara,
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.880]   it's a Japanese Apple enthusiast site
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:19.920]   because they have a very extensive iPad Pro rumor.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:21.240]   Is this trustworthy?
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.600]   - They are once in a while occasionally, okay.
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.080]   - Okay, 'cause there's some things that scared me,
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:28.880]   like the disappearance of the headphone jack?
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:29.760]   - Well, I mean, some of it makes, like,
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.600]   when you actually read it,
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:32.080]   and I know it's translated from the Japanese,
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:32.920]   but when you actually read, like,
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:35.160]   they talk about mic fusion and then it goes into the head,
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:37.600]   it's possible they'll get rid of the headphone jack,
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.080]   the headphone jack, they got rid of it famously
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.440]   in the iPhone, they didn't in the iPad and the Mac
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:44.360]   because pro audio users still use the hell out of a,
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.040]   a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack.
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.200]   - Also, there's a lot of space in an iPad.
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.640]   - Well, that's the thing is that,
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.360]   that's gonna change because we have all these people
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.000]   who keep saying delete all the bezels,
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.080]   but there's a bunch of components,
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:58.560]   very comfortably put in those bezels.
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:53:59.520]   And if you remove them,
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:00.960]   which is what it sounds like they're doing,
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:04.600]   keeping screen size the same and removing the extra bezel,
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.440]   but it doesn't really matter
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.640]   'cause you can expand screen size,
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:07.760]   but then the screen display,
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:11.520]   that's not lying on top, that goes deep into the device.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.600]   And if there's no bezel around it,
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.720]   they have to start moving the 3.5 underneath the screen,
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.160]   which changes the whole look of the,
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.760]   so I mean, I can believe that part,
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:22.120]   it was the rest of it that was super confusing.
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:24.400]   - Well, also you can't make the bezel too big
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:26.520]   because how do you hold the iPad?
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:29.120]   I mean, it's not like a phone you can hold in one hand,
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:31.040]   it can have bezels all the way to the edge,
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:34.640]   but a tablet, you need to hold it with your hands,
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.840]   you need somewhere to put your fingers.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.840]   - That can work because there's a lot of intelligence
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:41.920]   going by an edge rejection.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.200]   That trying to figure out, did he mean to be tapping
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.400]   this edge of the screen or is he just holding it wrong?
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.760]   However, there'd be, I think there's a problem
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.800]   when you start to get into the issue of,
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:53.000]   are you, is that thumb gonna be covering up something
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:53.840]   that's important?
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.680]   Or do you, as the user going to be kind of okay
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:58.600]   with blocking part of the screen
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:54:59.880]   by having no place to hold it?
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.720]   Or more importantly, having no place
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:04.400]   that is safe from fingerprints anymore?
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.680]   And so I think that it's an interesting question
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:11.120]   to solve getting back to Renee's comment.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:13.560]   That sounds like an Apple problem to solve
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:15.840]   and not a consumer problem to solve,
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:19.680]   as I'm pleased to usually say.
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:22.600]   And they, if you think back to the time
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.680]   where at some point they decided people are not,
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:27.000]   people are asking for all these features,
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.880]   but they don't want, they don't want,
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.800]   the sacrifices have come into them.
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.200]   Apple had to make a lot of changes
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.200]   to get that .55 millimeter keyboard,
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.480]   no one was asking for it, but they did it anyway.
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:39.640]   So I feel as though if Apple were to delete the headphone jack,
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:41.880]   they are completely 100% on the hook
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.760]   for making a choice that's going to inconvenience
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:44.600]   a lot of people.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:45.440]   - I agree.
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:47.160]   - You can't blame the hardware design.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.000]   It's totally 100% on Apple.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.560]   They chose to not have, they would have chosen
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:53.840]   not to have a headphone jack.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.760]   - And I still use my headphone jack on my iPad
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:58.440]   because I don't have one on my iPhone.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.760]   So I often play music on some of my iPhone.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:02.360]   - Just imagine like a DJ who needs now a lightning splitter
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.040]   that goes from lightning charge to,
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:05.880]   because you don't want to charge it while you're using it
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.440]   and the jack.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.080]   - So the other thing--
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:11.080]   - Also, where's the touch ID go?
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.080]   If they're going completely non-bezzled--
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.080]   - A-C-D.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:14.920]   - Yeah.
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:16.360]   Okay, that's another thing.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:18.960]   So, and this is one that's really controversial.
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.680]   They claim that the smart connector,
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:22.800]   which is used to power keyboards,
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:26.040]   has now moved to the bottom of the iPad,
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.480]   which means-- - So you can't charge
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:28.600]   while your keyboard is down.
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:30.240]   And also you gotta move the speakers now.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.440]   They've gotta be on the landscape as you--
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.680]   - This is not true.
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:35.600]   - No, I mean, never say never, but it makes no sense to me.
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:36.440]   - Yeah.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:38.360]   So I'm gonna ignore that one.
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:40.080]   They also say that the face ID,
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:42.200]   and this one I would guess makes sense,
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:45.440]   is gonna move to where the camera is already.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:49.000]   But I think that will require,
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.360]   I think a not-so-hard solution of sideways face ID, right?
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.360]   - So they're saying it's impossible.
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:56.720]   My understanding is, again, it's a neural network.
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.440]   And when a neural network, you train it.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.280]   It's not code.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:00.840]   You train it like you would train a pet,
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.720]   which is horrifying or spectacular,
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.160]   depending on your point of view.
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:06.960]   But you, and they chose to train it in portrait
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.560]   because it was too complicated
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.480]   for the first iteration to have it do both.
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.760]   Because then you gotta have a branch in the neural network
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.160]   and train for the two different conditions.
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.440]   And it adds complexity,
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:16.800]   and they were trying to get it out the door.
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:17.640]   Fine.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.960]   They already started adding alternative appearances.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.240]   So obviously the system can expand.
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.960]   By some stretch of the imagination,
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:27.880]   let's just say that portrait and landscape orientation
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:28.720]   aren't working.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:29.800]   There's some race condition
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:31.960]   or some training problem they're encountering.
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:33.760]   They could just make it landscape only
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:35.000]   the same way the iPhone.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.160]   There's no way that it can't be landscape.
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:38.000]   Right.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.280]   People said that the dot projector may not reach it,
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.800]   but the dot projector you're already holding it
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.480]   at arm's length from an iPhone.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:43.840]   Holding it at arm's length from an iPad
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:45.880]   is not, at least, I understand physics,
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:46.880]   it's not that different.
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:48.360]   You gotta be able to solve that.
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:50.760]   And why wouldn't you want to solve that?
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:52.600]   You want to make that face recognition
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:54.440]   working in as many orientations as possible.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:57.160]   And they say they're gonna put the smart keyboard vertically.
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:58.680]   And that makes no sense.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:57:59.880]   That's not gonna happen.
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:02.240]   Yeah. Sorry.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:05.360]   It's really, really hard.
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:08.760]   You can count on people using an iPhone
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:11.320]   in vertical orientation almost all the time.
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:13.160]   You really can't count on that with an iPad.
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:16.040]   When it comes to an iPad Pro, a large screen,
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.840]   it just isn't natural for people to work on it
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:20.240]   in vertical orientation.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:23.160]   Remember, one of the launch accessories for the iPad
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:27.880]   was a dockable keyboard that forced you to have the iPad
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:30.680]   in, again, sheet of paper sort of orientation.
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:32.440]   And it was really super weird.
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:35.600]   It was like being working on a Xerox star.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:36.760]   It was very, very weird.
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:40.000]   So there's a lot of problems that are very, very subtle.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.320]   And a lot of them go away if you simply decide
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:45.720]   that perhaps no bezels is not a great solution
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:47.240]   for this sort of thing.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.280]   Either that or you decide to put cameras
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:51.320]   in multiple locations and that will
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:52.320]   eject the cost off.
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:54.920]   I don't know if Apple's interested in doing that either.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:56.760]   So we should probably just ignore,
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.240]   is the silly season for rumors since we're in.
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:01.440]   I did a whole video on why I thought it was dumb yesterday,
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.920]   just because I thought it was like--
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:03.440]   But--
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.960]   The late headphone jack is a silly one
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.840]   that I would maybe support because it's just stupid enough
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:09.480]   for Apple to want to do that.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:13.840]   Do you think there will be Face ID on the next iPad?
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.760]   They want it.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:18.800]   It's like Touch ID.
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:21.000]   It's a core strength.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.880]   It's a signature feature.
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:25.760]   And they would be-- especially on $1,000 device
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:27.480]   that they're saying, this is don't
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:30.920]   buy an inexpensive Windows laptop by an iPad instead.
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:33.880]   And your Windows laptop, it's Face ID--
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:37.280]   excuse me, it's lowercase Face, lowercase ID,
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.520]   is not nearly as good as this.
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:42.520]   Now, I think DRAMBO found code already in iOS 12
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:45.160]   for the LAN for the Animoji on iPad already.
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:45.920]   OK.
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:46.960]   OK.
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:49.600]   That's a little bit of work to go to if you're not going to use it.
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:52.080]   I know it's Samsung.
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:54.560]   I know it's this in the iPhone.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.480]   But I have to say, I love the ingenious.
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.720]   They're funny.
[00:59:58.720 --> 00:59:59.360]   Come on.
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.000]   There's a new one on multitasking.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.280]   I always just wonder what Samsung components feel about this.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.720]   Because a lot of times they just things
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:06.920]   that were actually on it.
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.280]   Right.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:07.800]   Samsung.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.800]   Samsung.
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.200]   Let's look at this one.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:13.640]   This is-- ingenious is making fun of--
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.600]   So I want to know how to do the split screen.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.960]   Because my sister was just doing it on her Galaxy S9.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:19.720]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.920]   So what you're going to have to do is open up the app store.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.160]   Go ahead and open it for me real quick.
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:23.960]   No, no, no, no.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:27.440]   I want to use two apps on the screen at the same time.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.360]   I don't want another app.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.160]   OK, I get that.
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.880]   But you have beautiful news.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:31.320]   Thank you.
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:31.960]   They changed color.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.120]   They multitasked too.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.760]   So your name was multitasking?
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.400]   What's your phone, doesn't it?
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.040]   Upgrade to Galaxy.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.080]   They've made fun of a lot of Apple features.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.760]   I don't know if that's fair.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:43.600]   She's using a phone.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.680]   You can split screen on the iPad.
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.320]   Always fair.
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.960]   Samsung did these great commercials,
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:53.720]   like the hipster kind of commercials a few years ago.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.600]   And I thought they were hugely successful.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.200]   And then inside baseball, but Samsung Korea
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:00.640]   got upset at the success of Samsung America.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:01.440]   Isn't that funny?
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.080]   He's watched the complaint.
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.400]   Because of the components?
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.840]   No, because they were upset that the American team was
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.680]   doing something that they had not succeeded in doing.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:10.800]   Oh, how funny.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.960]   It's just so petty.
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.720]   And a bunch of people left.
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.320]   And they sort of had terrible ads after that,
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.840]   because they were going back to their old playbook.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.000]   And now it looks like they're starting to be willing to actually
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.560]   do good stuff again, which--
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.280]   My favorite.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:22.760]   It's great.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:28.040]   My favorite, though, is the notch family in the ad.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.240]   They all have--
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.080]   It's very quick.
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.480]   You actually have to freeze the video if you want to see it.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:36.680]   But it's mother, father, and son.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:40.040]   And the son, by the way, has air pods in his ears,
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.000]   all with notch haircuts.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.880]   I loved him on Star Trek.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.160]   Really?
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.200]   He's from Star Trek?
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.960]   No, but that's a look they would give some of the--
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:47.960]   It is.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.280]   It's very spocky.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.040]   Very spocky.
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:51.960]   Look.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.800]   All right, I just want to throw that in, because it's silly.
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:02:00.760]   iPhone 8, the number one selling phone in the US of A,
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:04.200]   in the second quarter of all phones.
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.520]   No, of iPhones.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.480]   It was number one selling iPhone.
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:08.560]   But I don't think we could say.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:11.880]   Can we say that the iPhone 10 is a failure?
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:12.080]   No.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:15.320]   iPhone 8 plus 10, the new generation,
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:18.720]   are 54% of US iPhone sales in the quarter.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.920]   There's a famous saying that if you double your price
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.600]   and you don't lose half your users, you're making money.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.120]   That's not only a saying.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.080]   It's math.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:26.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:27.160]   Totally.
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.480]   So if the ASP goes up on iPhone and Apple doesn't lose,
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.480]   the percentage of people that overcomes that ASP,
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.520]   they are making money.
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.600]   And it looks like they're probably
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.600]   going to make money on iPhone 10 again.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:40.360]   I asserted, maybe incorrectly earlier today on iOS today,
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:43.400]   that actually Apple's success with the iPhone 10
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.600]   is a bellwether for the phone market.
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.800]   The people will pay more than $1,000 for a small phone.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.760]   It has some expensive phones coming out in China, too,
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.800]   which is counterintuitive to people who don't live there.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:52.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:56.680]   But on the other hand, the other thing we have to notice about this
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:01.240]   is that the top featured phone that Apple makes
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:04.160]   is no longer the top selling phone.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:07.560]   With people who have imagined that Apple users,
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.320]   they are known for having more money
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.040]   than the rest of the market.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.840]   But even there are saying that, again, the iPhone 10
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:15.760]   is of huge success.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.240]   Anybody who says different is just wrong.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.680]   But nonetheless, it didn't displace the iPhone 8.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.360]   It didn't displace the sweets.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.240]   Whatever price people are paying for the iPhone 8
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.640]   and the iPhone 8 Plus seems to be the sweet spot.
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:30.120]   It seems to be the amount of money
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.160]   that they are comfortable spending on an iPhone.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.040]   So it means that Apple will--
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:37.120]   if it means anything, it does mean that Apple will still
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:40.400]   have to market the iPhone 10 as the special extra expensive
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.600]   one as opposed to here's the one that we think
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.760]   that everybody's going to buy.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.600]   I do think the things that around the depth sensor
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.400]   is important and the extra features.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.480]   Because I know that I love the MIMOG and I
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.640]   love all the little bits and bops.
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.920]   And they don't work with it.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.640]   You see someone else saying, oh, you have an 8.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:56.200]   I was like, I can't.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:56.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:57.400]   I don't have anything to--
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.760]   You have an iPhone that I want to do that.
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:02.600]   I'm like, well, you do that with an iPhone 10.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:06.520]   So we haven't talked about it.
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:10.080]   What do we think Apple's going to do next month, almost
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.480]   next month in September?
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.280]   I think they're going to read the phone.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.480]   The dummy is already being leaked.
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:17.120]   There's video up now of the--
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.920]   So it's three phones, all iPhone 10 style, right?
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.920]   So what happens is the Scabatic's get leaked manufacturers
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:27.440]   who make like cases who want to be there exactly
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.760]   when Apple launches, get their hands on the Scabatic's,
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.520]   build out dummy units so they can size test their cases.
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.680]   And those dummy units end up on YouTube.
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.600]   So you get a good look at what--
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.560]   Sometimes they're wrong, like with the fingerprint scanner
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.960]   on the back of the iPhone 10.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.120]   And then they heavily blow it.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:44.080]   And they have 3,000 cases that don't--
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.080]   Well, that happened.
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.640]   That happened famous for one year, too.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.840]   They made the teardrops design.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:51.320]   So three designs, three designs.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.120]   One of them is LCD, which is using a new active LCD
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:54.720]   technology.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.960]   Because a secret, one of the things that Apple
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.760]   displayed it that was kind of clever
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.400]   is they folded the screen back on itself
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.080]   so that it could really go edge to edge.
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.360]   There's not even a chin on the iPhone 10.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:07.040]   And that's because the display actually folds back around
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:11.360]   and then plugs into the power supply and the driver
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:13.080]   and all the components.
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.880]   And that was hard to do with LCD.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.240]   I forget if it was sharp or somebody showed that off
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.240]   like a year ago with an LCD.
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.880]   It uses an active LCD panel.
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.440]   And apparently that works now, too.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.960]   So Apple can do it with LCD this year.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.000]   And we're going to get the 6.5, I think, which
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.760]   is the lower--
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:31.440]   the 5C version of the iPhone 10, which
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:34.160]   is going to be more colorful and slightly lower price
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.880]   and have fewer features, but it'll be more mass market.
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.600]   And then we'll have the replacement for the iPhone
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:41.080]   10, which will be very similar but amped up,
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.520]   especially with cameras for the iPhone 10
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.480]   and then the iPhone 10 plus, which
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:48.280]   will be the same thing but for people who really want--
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:49.840]   the iPhone is their primary computing device
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.440]   and they want as big a screen as they can possibly have on it
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:55.040]   up to and including it being a really tiny tablet.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.800]   That one's a 6.5 inch screen.
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:01.880]   Looks basically like according to these probable renders,
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:05.400]   probably accurate renders, just exactly like an iPhone 10,
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:06.600]   just bigger.
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.640]   Yeah, the same size as an iPhone 8 plus,
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.200]   but with--
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:12.800]   There's like an iPhone 10 and iPhone 8 had a baby.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:16.600]   Or you put the OLED edge to edge screen on the iPhone 8.
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:17.520]   That's what you get.
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:20.520]   So the 5.8 is pretty much the same size just beefed up.
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:25.000]   And then the 6.1 inch screen is just the less expensive LCD.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.440]   And I'm hoping-- I don't know if it's ready yet,
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.040]   but I'm hoping that we'll get--
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:30.320]   famously Apple's been working on AR camera stuff.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.560]   And we see it now for the first time in FaceTime
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:35.200]   and in the Messages app, but it's not in the Camera app,
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.600]   which surprised a lot of people.
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.960]   But I think that's because it's just
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.080]   on the front facing true depth camera.
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.720]   And when the back gets true depth,
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.760]   if that happens to be this year, and maybe it will be,
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.200]   because it's been a couple of years,
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.400]   they've been working on it, then you'll
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:50.120]   start to have that real AR camera experience front and back.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:50.600]   I think that--
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.200]   Some rumors that there'll be three lenses, is that why?
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.320]   I think that's next year.
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.920]   Next year, OK.
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.520]   There may be, but I think that--
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:58.680]   it could be this-- it's hard to tell
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:01.200]   because some of the stuff is, if it's ready on time,
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:01.720]   it'll shift.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:04.360]   If it's not ready on time, it's next year.
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:04.680]   Prices?
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:11.160]   They're going to keep the same lineup.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:15.240]   I think they're experimenting a bit last year
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.800]   in the year before with what happens when we sort of create
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.200]   a broader spectrum.
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.320]   And I think that the numbers that they got
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:22.600]   say that they are--
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.240]   stay the course.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:27.240]   I still think you're going to be spending about $650 to $750
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:32.120]   or $800 for your basic OK phone, and still about $1,000,
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.160]   a little bit more for the next level up.
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:37.040]   No SE style, though.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:40.560]   I think it's still in the works, but it looks like the iPhone
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.320]   10, they're not keeping around the same way they didn't keep
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:45.760]   the iPhone 5S around because it's too expensive to manufacture.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.800]   So that drops away, and the new LCD phone
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.760]   takes its place at $100 lower.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:55.200]   So where the iPhone 7 and 7 plus are now,
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.880]   and then the new iPhone 10 and 10 plus take the place
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.000]   of the iPhone 8.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.560]   I don't know if they'll-- they've been subtly bumping
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.800]   that price over the last few years, like 20 bucks more
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:04.560]   when it got the second camera.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.040]   So who knows where it'll finally fall,
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.600]   but I think it'll be below what the car and iPhone 10 is,
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.160]   around what the iPhone 8 is, and then the new lower cost
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:14.400]   version will replace the 7 at the $100 minus mark.
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:18.160]   Rumors that Samsung, at least, has perfected fingerprint
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:24.760]   reading through glass, so can have a full screen experience,
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:27.280]   no bezel experience, but still have a fingerprint reader.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.200]   Any chance that Apple will be able to do that?
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:33.240]   Or question it, will they want to do it?
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.760]   They have Face ID, and the thing is they have real Face ID,
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:38.440]   where you don't have to hold it.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.280]   You don't have to intentionally look at it.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:42.080]   It works incredibly fast.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:45.560]   At this point, having a Touch ID would be kind of superfluous.
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:48.160]   So if I'm an iPad owner who loves Touch ID,
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.000]   you're saying, because that goodbye too?
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.920]   Well, I mean, the thing is, and I think they were being candid,
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.080]   they said that they literally-- in order to get Face ID done,
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.520]   they had to burn the boats behind them.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.760]   And if they gave themselves Touch ID as an opt-out,
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.160]   then they would never be under the pressure
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.240]   they needed to get Face ID done.
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:02.960]   Bye-bye, Touch ID, even.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:06.040]   But we still have this ironic, because we still have
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:09.160]   headphone jacks and Touch ID on the MacBook.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:11.280]   It's so hard to get this technology to scale.
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:12.680]   It'll be the same thing as Touch ID.
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.760]   Touch ID went from iPhone to iPad,
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:15.840]   and then it went to Mac.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.680]   And Face ID is going to go from iPhone to iPad.
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.440]   And then next year or the year after, it'll go to Mac.
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:22.680]   So everything will be eventually Face ID.
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.280]   So people love the idea of security,
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:26.720]   but they really want convenience.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:29.240]   And Touch ID was more convenient than a passcode.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.600]   And when Face ID works, it is even more convenient
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.800]   than Touch ID, because it feels almost invisible.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:34.920]   And eventually, we'll get to the point
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.840]   where all security is passive, and it's just
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:38.960]   bio-reading us all the time and letting us in
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.920]   if it's at a sufficiently high trust level.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:41.960]   But we're not there yet.
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.800]   But all this stuff is-- the gapple will tell you,
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.240]   the point was never to make Touch ID,
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.240]   or never to make Face ID.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:48.080]   It was to make security more convenient.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:51.600]   And whatever best does that is what they're going to implement.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.960]   And I think that all the other things
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.400]   that come with the depth of camera,
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.800]   which I think they have to put in everything over time,
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.080]   because they want people--
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.040]   If you want AR to take off.
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.520]   If you want the AR, if you want the emoji stuff to work,
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:06.280]   they spend a lot of quality time at WWDC keynote
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:07.560]   talking about memojis.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:09.160]   They don't do that if they're not planning
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:12.200]   to keep on rolling that process out.
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:15.920]   And I think that we're just getting started with those things.
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.240]   If you look at the technology that people are working on,
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.680]   whether it's Cinema 4D, you put out their own app,
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:25.320]   and there's a Face track, which we've talked about before,
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.000]   eventually Apple, I think, will do that,
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.520]   where you can scan yourself and build your own little memo.
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:34.320]   Have the emoji be created just from looking at your face.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.400]   And I think that those are the kind of things
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.200]   that they're going to keep on rolling out.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.600]   But to make that really work, they have to make it ubiquitous.
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:45.000]   They can't have a phone left out or the laptop.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   But it probably will take another two years to do that.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.480]   Did you love Time Bandits?
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:50.280]   I did.
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.240]   Who didn't?
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:52.240]   I loved it.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.280]   Except for the last minute of it.
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:55.800]   I loved it.
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:58.080]   See, my memory of the last minute
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.800]   disappeared by the memory of the first few minutes.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.720]   One of the most amazing opening sequences
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:06.080]   of any movie in history, if you ask me.
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:09.280]   Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits 1981 movie,
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:12.480]   now apparently going to be made as a TV show for Apple.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.720]   The very interesting choice.
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:17.200]   You look at what Apple is kind of clumping together,
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:19.600]   and there's definitely a grand scheme to it.
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.800]   But that was the first one I was like, wow,
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.680]   I don't understand that one at all.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:24.600]   I love it.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:25.680]   I love the idea.
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:26.360]   And maybe that's it.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.840]   Maybe they figured out that, you know,
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.280]   who their target market is.
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.000]   But I look at it just going, I don't understand
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.640]   like how that fits into the--
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.440]   Fantasy works very, very well.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:37.760]   You can get lots of really flashy effects.
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:38.960]   Yeah.
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:42.040]   Terry Gilliam will be a non-writing executive producer.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.640]   So that means they're going to give him some money
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:44.240]   for the rights to--
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.280]   And finally, Terry Gilliam will have a movie that actually
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:47.040]   gets finished.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:53.120]   Pretty amazing movie, I have to say.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.840]   And I guess somebody at Apple just really loved it.
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:57.400]   Exactly.
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.200]   That's all I can do.
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.440]   Hey, what else can we throw some money at?
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:00.240]   I got an idea.
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.480]   Let's do dime bandits.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:02.680]   I like Brazil better.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:05.080]   Somebody that chat with Robert Mike says, Brazil was better.
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:06.520]   I did like Brazil a lot.
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:07.720]   That was an amazing movie.
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:10.440]   But a little dystopian.
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:13.280]   You have the ability to-- there are holes in the universe
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:14.840]   that allow you to travel through time.
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.960]   That means that you don't necessarily
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.960]   have to have a beginning, a middle, or an end.
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.920]   You can just basically keep jumping through holes
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.440]   and keep going through other places.
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.960]   It seems like it's tailor made for this.
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:25.760]   You're right.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.640]   It's basically Stargate with a sailing shoot.
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.760]   Or what was the time traveler one that was in--
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.160]   Quantum Leap, yeah.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.280]   There have been a lot of them.
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.520]   The time tunnel.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.400]   This is actually--
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:39.080]   I mean, Quantum Leap, you leapt finally into Star Trek,
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:41.640]   and then the very into Star Trek, you leapt into NCIS.
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.720]   I think that's fine.
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:46.280]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.920]   And your picks of the week are next, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:51.280]   as we continue with Mac Break Weekly, Renee Ritchie,
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:52.920]   Birthday Boy.
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:55.720]   Is this your big 3-0, Renee?
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:57.600]   Let's see many, many anniversaries.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.520]   Let me get 3-0.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.360]   Happy birthday.
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:00.920]   What are you playing?
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:01.440]   Is it today?
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.840]   Is it actually today?
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:03.720]   Yeah, it is today.
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:06.000]   But I'm spending it with you guys, and then with Apple
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:06.360]   earnings.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:07.720]   So a little bit.
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.040]   Oh, oh.
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.800]   No, there's almost nowhere I would--
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:14.840]   see, maybe like a deserted island.
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:16.720]   But there's very few places I'd rather be thinking.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:18.760]   We're about 20 minutes away from the earnings,
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:21.040]   so we wanted to get out of here before Renee
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.600]   had to start working on that.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:25.960]   And as you said, Mike Asargent taking over Serenity Caldwell,
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:27.160]   he'll be transcribing.
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:28.800]   So that's one of the great things I'm more does.
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:29.440]   I've always loved.
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:34.120]   You can read the notes of the analyst's call directly
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:34.840]   after the fact.
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:38.800]   And of course, Renee's analysis of everything
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:41.080]   they said at imore.com.
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:44.440]   And Enoco is also here from Enoco.com.
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:48.560]   Enoco on the Twitter IHN, A-T-K-O.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:51.120]   And from the Pixelcore, it's Alex Lindsay.
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:52.800]   We're going to get there, picks of the week in a second.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.680]   But I'm going to give you a pick right now.
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:57.800]   Every business ought to be using LastPass, period.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.440]   We do.
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.120]   I'm sure you're aware of LastPass.
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:03.000]   It's the password vault.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.400]   Keeps track of all your passwords, generates strong ones.
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.640]   Make sure your passwords are secure.
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:09.760]   It's the last password you'll have to remember,
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.600]   that one that unlocks the password vault.
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.640]   It is the right way to go for an individual,
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:18.440]   all the more important for the enterprise.
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:22.440]   With that, we adopted LastPass here a few years ago
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:23.000]   for our business.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.800]   I've been using it for more than a decade.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:27.880]   Since it started, I was really pleased a few years ago
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.520]   when Steve Gitzman got to interview the founder and creator
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:32.840]   of LastPass, Joe Seagrest.
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.280]   We talked to him on the show.
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:36.080]   Joe also showed Steve the code.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.600]   Steve gave it his thumbs up seal of approval.
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.720]   In fact, Steve, I know, uses LastPass.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:44.720]   It's more than making it convenient.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.440]   It's making it secure.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.160]   And usually, there's a trade up between convenience
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:48.720]   and security.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.360]   But I think what your employees start using LastPass,
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:54.840]   they'll embrace it because it's easy.
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:59.400]   It fills in the password form on websites, on your phone.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:02.440]   It works everywhere you are.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:06.560]   We really felt like because certain employees need
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:09.880]   the passwords for important things like our bank account
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:13.240]   and our servers, it's important that we keep it secure.
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:17.120]   LastPass lets you set more than 100 policies,
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:22.120]   including things like requiring two factor, which we do,
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:25.080]   changing the password regularly if you want to do that.
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.680]   We do that because of employees coming and going.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:31.880]   SSH keys can be stored there with software licenses,
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:36.440]   database logins, all your important business information.
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.280]   It's all stored there.
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:41.160]   By the way, I get to use my personal LastPass and enterprise.
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.920]   I log in to enterprise and it knows my personal LastPass.
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:47.120]   So I have access to both faults with one log in.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.760]   And I keep credit cards in there.
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:52.040]   I keep my driver's license, my social security, my passports.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:55.760]   When I travel, it's nice to know that my phone has my passport,
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:58.760]   an image of my passport that I can use in case it gets lost
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:00.240]   to get a new one.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:02.280]   But it's there securely.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:05.600]   It's not something that's easy to access for anybody else.
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.320]   And of course, when employees leave
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:08.760]   or they don't need access to an account,
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:11.160]   it's very easy to restrict their access.
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:14.760]   We have folders with different levels of access.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.760]   You can even share a password without the employee even
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:20.760]   seeing it, knowing it, or able to change it, which is great.
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:22.920]   We make sure multi-factor authentication is in.
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:26.040]   You can use a hard key like Google found.
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:28.200]   By the way, 85,000 Googlers received
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:30.240]   Yubikis a couple of years ago.
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:31.880]   It eliminated phishing attacks.
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.600]   So that's we do require two factor.
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.240]   That's huge.
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:37.520]   LastPass has a password generator.
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.200]   Because you don't want your employees coming up
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:40.440]   with their own passwords because it'll
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:43.080]   be their dog's name and their birthday.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:44.320]   Now we know Renee's.
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.720]   So you know.
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:48.400]   Oh, dog, dog.
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.560]   And now, employees can log in last pass
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:53.360]   with their Microsoft Active Directory credentials.
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.400]   That makes it even easier.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.400]   Now you just-- one password to rule them all.
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:00.360]   Of course, LastPass data is encrypted with trust
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:01.080]   no one encryption.
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.960]   LastPass can't see your passwords.
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:06.200]   No one can see them except you.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.240]   They're decrypted at the device level only.
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:12.440]   For easy onboarding, password auto fill.
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.520]   LastPass makes it easy for business
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:17.520]   to take control of passwords and reduce the threat of breach.
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:19.720]   There's LastPass premium for you.
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:20.520]   Your personal use.
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:22.680]   There's LastPass families for your family.
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:25.720]   LastPass teams for small groups of 50 or fewer.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.280]   And the one we use LastPass Enterprise.
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.600]   10 years old this month.
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:34.120]   Congratulations to LastPass for its 10th anniversary.
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:36.400]   I've been using them just about as long.
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.960]   If you haven't, you better.
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:41.480]   And if you're using it but your business isn't, tell the boss.
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:43.920]   Where the 13 million people trust LastPass,
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:47.160]   it's the number one most preferred password manager.
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:48.600]   It's the one we use.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.880]   It's the first app I install on any new device,
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:56.800]   LastPass.com/twit to find out more in LastPass.com/twit
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:57.520]   to find out more.
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.400]   Alex Lindsay always has something--
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.320]   We use LastPass.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:02.520]   Of course you use LastPass.
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:03.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:04.360]   Of course you do.
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:04.720]   Way to go.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.240]   Well, and you need it because you be people
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:07.960]   coming going all the time.
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.400]   You have a lot of interns.
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.000]   Well, we also work with a lot of clients.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.760]   And I don't want to necessarily pass all those passwords
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:14.680]   around.
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:16.480]   Because it's not just the password.
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.240]   Yeah, they may change the password.
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.240]   But if you start getting lots of passwords from a client,
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:23.600]   you start to get how they create passwords.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.100]   Right.
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:25.800]   And what you want to do is not know that.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:26.300]   Yeah.
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.480]   Or not have other people know it.
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.560]   You don't want to start showing anything that
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:31.560]   can be figured out later.
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.760]   That's why when I need a password,
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:36.080]   I use LastPass to generate it.
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:41.840]   So my pick is the economists for the iPhone.
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:42.680]   That's expensive.
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:43.920]   It is expensive.
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:46.520]   I've been taking it easy on everybody,
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:48.240]   but I'm going to come back to this one because--
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:49.080]   It is good.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:50.040]   I don't read it ever.
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:53.000]   So here's the funny thing is I don't read the economist ever.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.600]   You used to-- I remember traveling with you.
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:55.920]   That's the first thing you do.
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:57.400]   Well, no, I used to stand at the airport
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.720]   and you'd buy a copy of the economist.
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:00.400]   Yeah, I used to read it all the time.
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:01.760]   I don't read it anymore.
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:02.680]   I only listen to it.
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.880]   And here's what's so great about the economist
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:09.080]   is that every single article is read out loud.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:09.680]   Oh, wow.
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:11.880]   So you basically hit download the audio.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.560]   And this has been this way for a long time.
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:14.640]   I just realized I hadn't.
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:16.320]   But I listen to it all the time.
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.480]   And you can pick all your stories.
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:19.720]   I actually have a challenge where
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:23.280]   I try to listen to the whole magazine each week
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.680]   before the next one comes out.
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:27.360]   But I think every magazine should do this.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:32.960]   I mean, I think that this is just beyond it being a--
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:35.000]   the economist being good and being able to listen to someone
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.640]   with a nice English accent and tell you about the world.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:38.800]   It doesn't get much better than that.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:39.440]   It really is.
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.880]   It's more than just a financial magazine.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:42.960]   It's a great news magazine.
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:43.440]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:44.640]   You get a lot of things.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:48.920]   And as long as you take all the news in Africa
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:51.280]   with a grain of salt because they're from England,
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.160]   you're OK.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:54.520]   You know, you kind of go, oh, yeah, OK, those guys.
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.720]   So but outside of that, it's pretty good.
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:02.200]   But I think that it is a great model for how everybody--
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.240]   all these magazines, if you want to stay relevant,
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:06.560]   making an audio version of what you do,
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.320]   or anybody that's doing something in front of you,
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:09.560]   making an audio version of anything
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:12.040]   that is longer than about 500 words.
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.560]   My whole thing is like, after that,
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:14.800]   I'm like, oh, it's too many words.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:15.560]   This needs to be audio.
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:18.720]   I need your help because there's the economist classic.
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:19.720]   There's the economist.
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:20.880]   I think you just get the economist.
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.600]   And these economists express so, which
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:25.240]   is designed specifically for phones.
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:29.720]   I have to admit, I use the economist classic
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:31.560]   because I bought it through iTunes
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:35.360]   and I can't figure out how to log into the regular economist.
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.640]   I've had it for so long.
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:37.800]   I've had it since it came out.
[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.080]   And so I use the classic one.
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.040]   But I think if you got it new, you would just
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:41.960]   get the regular economist.
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:44.000]   But they all have-- I mean, the economist and the economist
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.040]   classic both have the audio piece.
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:48.800]   And that's what really makes it work
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:51.640]   is the fact that you can have--
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:54.640]   that each week you're going to get all these audio files.
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:57.240]   You can turn them on or turn them off.
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:59.640]   If you don't want to listen to all of them, you don't have to.
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:01.320]   But it is something that when you're driving
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:03.240]   or you're doing whatever, you can just
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.040]   have them playing in the background
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:08.320]   and just kind of absorb a lot of information.
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:12.040]   But now, I did subscribe because it's only $3 a month
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.360]   through the espresso.
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:16.840]   But that does not have the thing that you like, which
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:18.000]   is the audio thing.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.240]   It's really espresso designed for quick and fast mobile.
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:23.320]   I don't like reading on my phone.
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:24.600]   I mean, I don't like reading anything from--
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:26.240]   It's only eight stories total each day.
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:30.000]   So $3 a month is cheap, but you don't get the full economist.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.560]   And you don't get the audio, so that's good.
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:35.920]   No, but if I could get--
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:38.920]   yeah, foreign affairs this way and an economist--
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:39.760]   No, every magazine should do.
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:41.000]   Wired.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.800]   I'd be pretty set.
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:44.880]   Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:46.040]   It's one of the great magazines.
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:48.400]   I still love magazines.
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:49.320]   I love listening to them.
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:51.440]   I don't like reading them anymore.
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.440]   You know, you travel with me.
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:54.240]   I used to always--
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:55.240]   Yes, yeah.
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:56.240]   --break the magazines.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.080]   I'd read them in the thing.
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:59.440]   And there's just something about it that I just--
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:01.720]   I think when I became digital, I started thinking, well,
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:02.720]   I should get them on my iPad.
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.480]   But once I put them on iPad, I didn't read them.
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.280]   And then I just kind of expected--
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:09.760]   I've just found that I will read short things
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.840]   and if they're not audio after a certain length,
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:12.720]   I'm like, oh, it's too many words.
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.040]   That's interesting.
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:14.720]   That's just a game.
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:16.400]   That's really, really interesting.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:19.000]   Apple bought the magazine app that we like.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.280]   But I don't--
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:22.640]   Do you remember if Texture had the economists?
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:23.360]   I don't think it does.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:26.080]   There are a few magazines that just want to go their own way.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.320]   They don't want to--
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:28.360]   And I have Texture.
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:31.080]   It's not like-- and I don't do it with things.
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.600]   If I hear about an article, I'll go into it.
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:35.800]   But I don't really just sit and browse the way I used to.
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:36.720]   I really like to just--
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:37.720]   Somebody should do--
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:38.640]   I just really like to listen.
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:41.000]   --a Texture Audio version.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:41.520]   Yes.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:43.520]   Apple, if you want to hire me to help you out with that--
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.400]   There we go.
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.600]   Or Alex.
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:46.440]   I'm ready.
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:48.560]   We're ready to join the evil empire.
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.000]   I mean, the--
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.280]   Oh, God, I just ruined my chances.
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:54.880]   Andy and I go, you're picking the week.
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:59.800]   More of a tip, a listener sent me an email
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:03.240]   and alerted me to a discussion on Apple's support forums
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:07.240]   about MacBook Pro screens spontaneously breaking
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:08.920]   or something along those lines.
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.480]   The new ones?
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:12.360]   Well, going back to a couple of years,
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:14.960]   the modern design that has the flat keyboard.
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.480]   And so a lot of people are saying, oh, look,
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:17.760]   see, right at the bottom of the screen,
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.280]   this is just like spontaneously broke.
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:20.000]   And I see this crack.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.040]   It wasn't-- I didn't drop it.
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:22.120]   I didn't do anything like that.
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:23.440]   Now, Apple won't fix it.
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:26.200]   And I thought it was-- it's worth reading,
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:27.040]   because it's interesting.
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.280]   I don't think it's a defect.
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:31.480]   I think the problem is that if you compare the design
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:35.680]   of these current class MacBooks with their predecessors
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:39.640]   from 2015, you notice that the hinge for the screen is actual--
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.640]   the pivot point for the hinges right
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:43.120]   at the bottom of the glass.
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.800]   Whereas the previous generations,
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:49.240]   the pivot point was about a centimeter on an L-shape out.
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.800]   So that means that if there is anything right at that hinge,
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:56.840]   like even if you're eating like a bagel and like a big seed
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:59.480]   or something gets in there, once you shut it,
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:02.920]   now you've got so much more force crushing--
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.840]   crushing that edge of the screen that I think
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.000]   that's what's happening.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.720]   There have been a number of times where my keyboard's
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:10.560]   been a little bit dirty, and I close the thing,
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.400]   and then I open it up and thought, oh, look,
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:15.120]   there's a-- there's like a fragment of an aspirin
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:15.720]   that I crushed up.
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:17.800]   OK, I guess I should have cleaned up a little bit more.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.720]   I just don't think there's-- I think the problem is
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:25.000]   that there isn't as much leeway now for a potentially
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.040]   screen ending injury, particularly if something gets
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:33.840]   worked into, again, the very, very bottom on that hinge.
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:35.440]   Again, I don't think it's a defect.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:38.120]   I certainly don't think it's a problem with the glass itself.
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:40.280]   I think that if it were a problem, we certainly would have heard--
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:45.080]   there would have been a bigger outcry well before now.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:48.840]   It's just an indication that be very, very careful cleanup.
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:53.240]   Clean your keyboard, clean the protective of that hinge.
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:55.760]   Maybe it's not a bad idea to have things in a slip case.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.240]   And the other thing worth mentioning
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:02.200]   is that this also affects mobile device screens.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.760]   People that understand-- sometimes people
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.240]   understand that if you drop your phone,
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:08.400]   it looks like nothing happened, and you've got away with it.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:09.840]   Maybe it didn't.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:11.120]   Maybe you didn't get away with something.
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:13.000]   There can be micro fractures.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000]   That means that the next time that you drop it,
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.720]   you're definitely going to be losing the screen.
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:19.840]   And sometimes you get sort of fractured
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:22.360]   that kind of migrates with continued use,
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:25.240]   continued putting your phone in your pocket and out.
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:28.680]   So that can sometimes lead to a phone that
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:31.960]   looks like it spontaneously shattered when actually you
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.040]   dropped it twice over the past year and a half.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:34.880]   You've got away with it.
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.040]   You forgot about it.
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:38.160]   And then the last time that you were at a hotel
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:42.680]   and you just sort of tossed it six inches onto the nightstand,
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:43.760]   then the screen broke.
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.920]   No, it doesn't mean there's a manufacturing defect
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:48.160]   that means that this film will break after dropping in six
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:48.680]   inches.
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:52.760]   It means that your phone-- you've got your two free passes
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:53.480]   and another third one.
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:54.320]   That was it.
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:57.320]   And temperature change can do that too.
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.240]   To like if you've already stressed it the way you're
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.080]   talking about it, and then you go through something that's
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:03.000]   really cold back into something really hot,
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.080]   it may-- it's not built for that anymore
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.520]   because it's broken somewhere.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:09.920]   It's just not apparent.
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:11.760]   It's not a big performance.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.200]   It's not affecting the screen.
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:14.680]   But the damage is there.
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:17.800]   It's like the-- you think that if you skateboarded a lot
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:19.760]   in your teenage years and your college years,
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.120]   then you thought you got away with every single time you--
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:24.200]   every single time you ditched on the concrete.
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:25.560]   And then you get to be four years old,
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:29.160]   and now your knee just absolutely hurts every third day.
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:30.200]   No, you really did.
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:31.600]   Keep injuring your knee.
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:34.120]   It just took a while for it to actually develop.
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:36.160]   And it's something that affects your ability
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.120]   to live on a third floor apartment.
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:40.680]   That is why I bought AppleCare on this one.
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:42.560]   Actually, I bought it because of the keyboard.
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.320]   But now I'm happy that I have it because of the screen.
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.360]   So yeah, I don't usually buy AppleCare
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:48.960]   because I feel like it's self-insurance,
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:50.440]   and I don't mind self-insuring.
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.760]   But in this case, I buy it all the time.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:54.240]   For the keyboard alone, I bought it.
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:56.320]   Maybe now I'm glad I got it for the screen.
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:58.240]   Renee, your pick of the week birthday boy?
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:02.600]   My pick of the week-- Ken Kishinda may not be a household
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:06.040]   name yet, but he was one of the first members of the Safari
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:09.040]   Day, I think him and Don Milton were hired on the same day
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:12.280]   to build Apple their first web browser.
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:15.280]   And he and Richard Williamson joined them soon thereafter,
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:18.200]   and they settled on Conqueror and KHTML and KJS.
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:21.040]   And the rest literally was history.
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:23.200]   And then after that, he worked on some other projects,
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:27.280]   and he eventually built the first keyboard for the first iPhone.
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:29.800]   And when you hear Apple sometimes get grumpy about how
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.560]   other people wound up on the same solutions as they did,
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:35.680]   when you realize the amount, like the months, the days,
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:38.280]   the hours, the minutes of agonizing work
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:40.780]   that went into producing what we all now just
[01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:42.980]   think are the normal and intuitive behaviors,
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:45.840]   you start to understand the type of individuals that
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:48.280]   do this stuff and the process they go through.
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:50.280]   And that's what makes this book so interesting.
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:51.920]   It's available now for pre-order.
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:54.640]   I was lucky enough to get a review copy early,
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:57.360]   and I read it, and then I promptly read it again,
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:00.060]   because there have been so many terrible books about Apple
[01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:00.560]   over the years.
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:03.760]   And this is probably the best one that I've ever read,
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.920]   because it caters to my interest.
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:08.720]   It's from a design and engineering point of view,
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:12.340]   but he tries to distill down what allows Apple
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:16.660]   to year after year ship great products and great software.
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:20.060]   And regardless of how you feel about this bug or that bug,
[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:22.300]   when you look at the state of software and a lot of consumer
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:27.140]   electronic devices, it's smart TVs, for example.
[01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:28.300]   It's just not good.
[01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:32.140]   And he distills it down, but one of the major thesis
[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.380]   is creative selection that Apple has this culture of,
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:37.580]   you build something, you demo it, you take the feedback,
[01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:38.540]   you make a better demo.
[01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:40.160]   You build it, you get the feedback,
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:41.200]   you make a better demo.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:43.600]   Things that are bad ideas, no matter how precious they are,
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.600]   are thrown away, and you make a better version,
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:49.060]   because back then, Henri Lomara and then Scott
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:51.040]   Forrestault and then Steve Jobs were going to be the ones
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:52.280]   that you were demoing to.
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:54.120]   And it's got to be great.
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:57.920]   And just how everyone drove towards simplicity and intuitiveness
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:02.280]   and relentlessly sort of built these products.
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:04.960]   And even at the very beginning, when they were making Safari,
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:07.640]   Steve Jobs had one mission, and that was fast.
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:09.120]   It had to be fast.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:12.240]   And that one word ended up defining their whole methodology
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:14.920]   because no code check-in, no feature check-in,
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:16.960]   could reduce the speed, not by one Iota.
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:19.320]   And that sort of gives you a clarity of purpose,
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:22.760]   but also a way of getting to your destination.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:25.680]   And he goes through making the keyboard, making Safari,
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:28.120]   the lessons he learned, the good and the bad,
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:30.360]   because he had some down moments as well.
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:33.880]   And it's just, it's a fascinating read from beginning to end.
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:37.040]   - I'm putting it on my audible pre-order,
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.720]   'cause there is an audible, or will be an audible version,
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:41.520]   comes at September 4th.
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:46.240]   Creative selection, Ken Kosienda,
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:49.000]   former principal engineer of iPhone Software at Apple.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.920]   Well, that's good.
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.600]   I'm definitely pre-ordering that one.
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:54.600]   That looks really, really good.
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:56.600]   - And he's so good at explaining,
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:58.560]   like, just, I'm not a coder.
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:01.640]   So like he explains, if you're writing lines of code,
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:03.840]   get the mustard from the refrigerator
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:05.520]   versus get the mustard from the store
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:06.680]   are both the same length,
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:09.000]   but are considerably different amounts of work.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:09.840]   - Right.
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:12.920]   - He has a ton of examples about how to optimize code
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:15.440]   and sometimes optimizing it early is the worst thing you can do.
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:16.920]   It's a learning when you need to optimize.
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:19.040]   Just the whole thing was really good.
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:21.720]   - Very nice, good recommendation.
[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:24.320]   Always looking for something to, I knew to listen to.
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:25.160]   - Yeah.
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:26.600]   - And if you say that's the best book about Apple,
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:30.480]   he was there 15 years, so he went through a lot of stuff.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:33.200]   - Started making Safari, and I think,
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:34.520]   I'm not sure if he was an Apple Watch
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:35.320]   or what he was on at the end,
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.440]   maybe he was back at UIKit.
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:38.200]   I'm not sure, but you were tired.
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.880]   - He's not there now, so he can talk.
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:40.720]   - Yeah.
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:41.560]   - He can speak.
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:42.400]   - Yes.
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:43.600]   - Okay, good.
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:44.600]   Good to know.
[01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:47.600]   Although it sounds like he's still got some connections
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:49.880]   back inside the mothership.
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:50.800]   - Well, I mean, he still lives there,
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.640]   so they'll see him at the coffee shop if he does that.
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:53.640]   - Right.
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:55.240]   Renee, you are awesome.
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:57.120]   I hope you have a wonderful birthday
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:59.240]   and we thank you for being here on your birthday.
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:02.480]   Go get going, you got a couple of minutes.
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:03.400]   - For earning a Palooza.
[01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:06.000]   - For earning a Palooza, imore.com
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.880]   slash vector, I bet you you're gonna get
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:11.240]   Canon vector at some point.
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:12.480]   - It might be in the works.
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:13.800]   - Yeah, I might be.
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.920]   I'd look forward to listening to that.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:18.960]   Renee is of course joined as always by Andy Inako
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:21.960]   of the Chicago, formerly of the Chicago Sun Times
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:24.080]   now, Vinako.com.
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:27.320]   - And I'll be on the WGBH at Boston Public Radio again
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:30.240]   on Thursday from about one to 130.
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:33.000]   - I'm gonna start calling you WGBH's Andy Inako.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:33.840]   Is that okay?
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:37.480]   I'm an official paid consultant, excuse me, contributor.
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:38.320]   So yes, you can do that.
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:40.360]   - All right, WGBH is Andy Inako.
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:41.800]   I like saying that.
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:43.560]   That is a nice ring to it.
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:46.480]   And from the Pixelcore Alex, Lindsey Alex is best
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:49.920]   to follow on Twitter, A-L-E-X-L-I-N-D-S-A-Y.
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:51.600]   That's where he lets you know what he's up to.
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:52.600]   Anything coming up?
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:55.720]   - No, not really.
[01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:57.640]   I'm gonna be, well, okay.
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:00.600]   I'm gonna be, we're gonna be putting some more stuff
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:03.320]   on sale as we get rid of some more old stuff,
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:05.640]   but it's still good stuff in good condition.
[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:09.280]   - So I bought a camera from him and I couldn't be happier.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.280]   - I got quite a deal.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:13.160]   - Yeah, so we're gonna, we're getting pretty aggressive
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.040]   'cause we're trying to make more space.
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:16.480]   - They're blown it out to the bare walls.
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:17.480]   They gotta move.
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:19.240]   - Well, we have this huge space in Santa Fe,
[01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:20.400]   we wanna use it for things.
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:21.720]   And we just need that we're like, okay,
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:22.560]   we're not using this stuff,
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:23.400]   so we gotta get rid of it.
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:25.280]   So we're gonna be moving a bunch of stuff.
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:29.360]   So if you follow me on Twitter, I'll post a link
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:30.880]   where you can get on the mailing list
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:33.080]   and we'll put more stuff out over the next couple weeks.
[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.200]   - Thank you, Alex.
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:35.920]   - Thank you all for being here.
