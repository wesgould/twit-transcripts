[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.400]   The hangover edition. After a crazy week. This is the this is kind of limbo, isn't it? Where we're
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.320]   waiting where between the announcement and ordering of iPhones and the actual arrival, which is Friday.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.120]   Andy Inako is here from Chicago, sometimes back in his lair.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.720]   Hello everybody. I just I know I might have built this up too much on Twitter, but how can I
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.160]   build this up too much? I'm debuting a brand new breakthrough technology right now. Now there's a
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.720]   little you see I've got a little bit of a different angle here in my home studio. That's because
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:34.560]   this is being shot with my new innovation. Crane Cam 3000. The future unfortunately.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:43.760]   You can't see Crane Cam when Crane Cam is being used. Whoa, it's a it's a gym. It's a gym.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.680]   No, no, it's not a it's not a gym. If it were a jib, Leo, I'd call it a jib. It's Crane Cam 3000,
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:57.120]   the future video podcast. Okay. Okay. TM and the eye. Yes. Very nice. Very nice. We'll be we'll be
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.000]   incidentally looking at some of the features of Crane Cam 3000, the future video podcasting
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.520]   throughout the show. I don't want to make a big deal about it. I'm just very proud because I
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.160]   invented Crane Cam 3000, the future video podcasting just 10 minutes before the show was supposed to
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.800]   start to solve a simple problem when I decided to switch out the chair that I normally have for
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.000]   chair and a table. But it caught, you know, again, just like moldy bread, led to penicillin and the
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.120]   saving of millions of lives, switching chairs has led to the creation of Crane Cam 3000,
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.840]   the future of video podcasting necessity is the mother of Crane Cam. I'll let you start that.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.520]   That's just I'm just very pleased. Yeah. Crane Cam 3000, the future video podcasting. That's all.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.120]   Is that by the way, is that Crane Cam intercapped one word intercapped?
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.120]   No, no, no, it's it's one word. Well, it depends on the country of origin. I've got in the past,
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.840]   we were a little bit late starting. So I did have time to start the trademark IP stuff going.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.440]   So we'll depend. Well, we're still workshopping it, but it will be Crane Cam 3000,
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.880]   future video podcasting in your local country of origin, pursuant to local law.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:04.400]   Also, how are you going to follow this? I can't. I can't. I can't. It's all down hill from here.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.760]   That's why I'm saying hello to Renee Richie in Montreal back home. I'm sorry. That was me.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.400]   Do you have a crane Cam? No, I don't. I don't. I have a Cam on a tripod. I have a try Cam.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:24.000]   Try Cam 1000. That's good to see you guys back home. Did you have fun here in the Bay Area for
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.240]   your brief visit? It was great. And then I started writing my iOS 8 review. Now 20,000 words into
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.400]   the weeds and I and there's no end in sites. Well, good. Well, here at least 10,000 of those words
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.760]   coming up also from his new office in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and looking mighty fine. It's Alex
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.840]   Lindsey. Of course, he's looking fine. He's the king of streaming video. Hello, Alex. Hey, how's
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.880]   it going going? Great. So this is it. This is the new place. You're going to get a backdrop or
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.360]   anything. It's like, yeah, yeah, no, no, um, you know, me, it will get much more complicated.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.840]   Complicated. This is just give me a couple of weeks beta. This is going to be a 70 inch
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.000]   monitor behind me. And then I'm having a rate of monitors. You can't like crane Cam 3000. Take
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.200]   the, uh, no, the honest for two men. Most of you control 4,000. I believe you meant to be
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.040]   great in 3000, the future video. Sorry. T. Can we just say T F O V P? I know, you know, I've
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.600]   been saying I watch all week two. It takes a while for
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   All right, everybody now settle down, settle down. Um, gosh, I don't know where to begin.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:34.960]   Tomorrow iOS eight ships, you know, I was kind of surprised when Sarah told me that yesterday
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.720]   on iPad today, they didn't mention that at all. Did they in the event or did I miss it?
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.240]   Yeah, they announced it. They said Wednesday you'll get iOS eight. Yeah. And they've been doing
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.160]   that for several years. iOS two came out the same as the iPhone orders and that turned out to be
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.800]   a bad idea for everybody. Yeah, move it to the one couple of days earlier. Is it ready? Is it
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.120]   baked? Or you know, you've been, you've been writing 10,000 work review of it. Yeah, no, it's, I
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.200]   mean, it's ready. There's always going to every zero zero version of iOS comes with
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.760]   his own slew of brand new things because there's no QA in the world that can equal 100 million
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.920]   users hitting your software. So I'm sure there's going to be things. There'll be, we'll get battery
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.840]   life complaints and we'll get, you know, features that don't work exactly with anybody predicted.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.960]   But it is as it is as ready to go as any version of iOS and quite a bit red here than iOS seven
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.440]   was when it dropped. And I guess that that's really what my question is. Should people
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.240]   install it tomorrow when it's available or it would be prudent. It sounds like to wait a little bit.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.400]   If you're a nerd, you install, but if you're a nerd, you're already running the gold master
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.400]   build. If it's always good to wait, if you don't absolutely have to run it on day one,
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.120]   then let other people hit those day one issues. I guess I'm not a nerd because I always
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.960]   wait for iOS till the actual release and usually install it that day.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.280]   Can you open your Christmas presents on New Year Leo? Really? Yes, really.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.520]   Well, because you don't want it to bring your thing to its knees, interesting, the shots of iOS 8
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.400]   on apples page apple dot com slash iOS 8 are featured in an iPhone six. I guess that makes sense.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.720]   Instantaneously that whole site changed. Yeah. Yeah. So is the look and feel different?
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.560]   It's not as different as iOS seven was. It's it's continued continuation of iOS seven.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.920]   So iOS seven was the complete visual redesign where iOS eight is a huge functional redesign
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.000]   because you have continuity and you have extensibility and you have all the frameworks for developers
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.320]   like HomeKit and Touch ID and things like that. Well, not so fast Canadian man. It looks like
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.560]   continuity is continuity going to be available day and date? No, they're waiting until next month,
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.960]   aren't they? Well, no. So it's so continuity is several things. Continuity lets your devices
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.000]   all work together. So the stuff that involves the Mac has to wait for Yosemite and SMS specifically
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.960]   has to wait for October. But anything, for example, continuity handoff between iPhone and iPad
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.280]   is currently working. So all the iOS functionality will work. Yeah. So you can answer calls on your
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.560]   iPhone. You can continue sorry on your iPad. You can continue emails from your iPhone to your
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.760]   iPad. So all that kind of stuff is going to work. That's nice. And it's interesting what they say
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.000]   on the on the web page, huge for developers, massive for everyone else. They really are saying
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.720]   this is an under a lot of this is under the hood. Things like extents and ext was extensibility
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.760]   extensions. Extensibility is the system extensions are what I'm excited about the individual parts.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:17.040]   That to me is something that we've needed for a long time. The ability for apps to interoperate
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:23.760]   better within each other. Yeah, it's super it's on a super secure way. So it's actually really
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.400]   interesting a couple of years ago, Apple ported XPC, which is their cross app communication platform
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.880]   from Mac to iOS. And then they broke springboard into springboard and backboard. And then they built
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.560]   this little daemon that runs and basically coordinates all this. So the apps never really
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.120]   talk to themselves. You have a host app and a container app and iOS intermediates everything so
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.720]   that your data is always private to those applications unless the developer makes it available to share
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.360]   and you you actually do an action to choose to share it. So it's secure. It's private, but it
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.320]   lets you do all the the workflows cross app. So it's really cool. It would be remiss of me to
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.080]   not point out that anybody who's been using Android for a while is going to look at these list of
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.880]   new features and go, really? You didn't have that. I mean, Android L's big feature was, you know,
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.960]   system wide animation. Right. So it means both started different and we're catching up.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:16.640]   Yeah. Right. But but things, for instance, like a keyboard keyboard suggestions is something I had
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.640]   on my blackberry, I feel like I feel like that's that's been around for a long effect. I was kind
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:27.920]   of surprised to learn that I have iOS didn't have that. All of this they're doing all this in one
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.800]   way. So extensibility makes all this functionality possible. And because they wanted to do it all in
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.480]   the same way, and even make sure that you're doing exactly the same way on the Mac, it would have been
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.920]   easier to do separate systems, but they wanted to make sure it worked in one way, so developers
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.600]   can target it in one way. So that means they had to wait until all of that was ready to do all of
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.520]   it. So two, the other thing is, I don't think that Apple is really, you know, they don't really
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.680]   special class in doing they do some things first, but I think a lot of times what they're doing is
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.840]   that I mean, they're attempting to do things right. I mean, having a feature list and having it work
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.960]   well or to vary. Some people say Apple specializes in not innovation, but refinement.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.120]   Is that fair? And I think that they do that often very well. I mean, sometimes they don't get it
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:12.400]   right. And sometimes they do still do put things out, you know, first and broken. But I think that
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.200]   one of the things that they probably do better than anyone else is look at what everyone else
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.160]   has done and really isolate the things that are working and not working and throwing away a lot
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.240]   of stuff and really focusing on just a handful of things that really work. And some people don't
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.520]   like that because it's very controlled and it's very slow moving in some ways. But I think that
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.960]   there's obviously a lot of people that don't want to think about it, they just want it to work.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.320]   You I mean, the whole package works fine. I think if you go to the list of things that are quote
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.560]   Android first, unquote, you will see a bunch of things that don't work as well as they probably
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.960]   should have and other things where you like the way that apps can interact with each other that
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.120]   makes you wonder, geez, I mean, this is it works great. It's incredibly easy to use. It really
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.440]   extends the functionality of the device. Why did we have to wait so many years for this on iOS?
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.280]   Yeah, I don't want to foster this kind of silly religious war. You use what you use. Exactly.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:05.040]   And if the if the if the if the iPhone were not a better total package for people,
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.080]   it would not be selling quite so well. It's not people are not buying. I just agree.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:14.000]   They that's that's completely untrue. Look at the look at Samsung sales, which are driven
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.360]   entirely by marketing. I think it's this completely fair to say that Apple has its adherence,
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.000]   but whether they're doing that based on a full and complete knowledge of the choices or because of
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.960]   superior marketing is not clear. Well, well, that's okay. I'll agree that it's not your now
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.120]   you're never going to be able to break that down by category. But I don't think that it really
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.600]   again, look at me. I was unhappy with iPhone. So I switched. I also know other people who don't
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.680]   have the benefit of being able to test Android phones all the time to find out what that's like.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.840]   It's more like, damn, I really wish we're easier to move a file from one thing onto my phone. I
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.160]   really wish we're easier to put something into Evernote. And then they hang out with people in
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.440]   their office or in their personal lives who are doing this thing. And then that's what kind of
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.880]   makes them curious about other things. But they might say that gee, I but I tried a Samsung Galaxy
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.680]   S4 and it felt cheap. It felt it didn't have all this crap on it. It makes all these stupid water
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.840]   noises when you move your fingers across it. I think as much as I wish I had that one feature,
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.480]   I'm willing to accept what I have with the iPhone. We're very fortunate because we get to try them
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:18.960]   all and have a probably better kind of global view of this than most people do. I think we're
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.320]   now at the stage and it's very much like the PC market was 10 years ago, where people have made
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:29.120]   a choice. They've gone with the platform Android, Windows Phone or iOS. And at this point, they're
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:35.040]   just going to carry on. So the discussion that Android, you see a lot of Android, especially
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:41.760]   Samsung fanboys posting those Samsung ads saying, hey, we've had this for two years.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:48.560]   But that's to put to the normal user, that's not really germane because they weren't going to switch
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.880]   to Samsung anyway. There's an interesting, I mean, Apple is also a very patient and sometimes
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:58.480]   stubborn company and they could have made big phones years ago. They know how to manage that.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.080]   Yeah, they could have made extensive Apple had projects, very similar to extensibility that
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.880]   they started years ago and they did not like the compromises. I mean, this at the end of the day,
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.960]   this runs super similar to OS 10. They could have turned on multitasking the first version.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.800]   They could have turned on interrupt communication in the first version, but they waited to get
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:19.040]   the technology right. It's very similar to how Android L does a lot of things that people say,
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.040]   oh, iPhone had that in version one. Sure. But if you talk to the Google engineers who had to
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.280]   implement the GL stack and had to talk and had to get all the graphic optimizations done,
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.040]   it took a long time to get it to the point where it works the way it does in Android L.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.360]   None of these things are as easy as us who, and none of the resources are as unlimited as us who
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.480]   says, why don't we just take all these phones and mash them together and they'll all do everything
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.160]   brilliantly. They're all choices about what we can do today and what we're going to choose to
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.640]   wait to do when we can do them the way that we want tomorrow. Let me see this ad because a lot of
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:51.920]   people have seen it and a lot of people will see it. Is Samsung making a mistake saying this?
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:57.680]   Galaxy Note launched in 2011. It was ahead of its time. And naturally, when things are new and
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.240]   different, sometimes people aren't ready for them. Experts saw the bigger screen and were like,
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:08.400]   you look like you're talking into a piece of toast. The note is an unwieldy beast.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.720]   Now it's not being dismissed by competitors. It's being imitated.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.440]   BGR, boy genius report. The truth hurts Apple fans. You could thank Samsung for your big new
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:27.280]   iPhone displays. It's more than big. It's about being more productive. Wait for it. I like the part.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:33.760]   More innovative. Oh cool. And notice they're showing things that you still can't do on the
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.960]   iPhone 6 Plus. That's also the use of these. They use an app that rips off DJ, which I think is an
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.560]   odd choice. Yeah, that is a bad choice. It looks just like DJ. It's, you know, Apple thinks they're
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.760]   both. They showed side by side tables are predate smart phones. But they showed off active
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.680]   stylists. They showed two apps in a pen and apps working side by side. Is Samsung,
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:58.000]   is this preaching to the choir? Somebody asked me about this on the, I think it was on the radio
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.240]   show. And I said that you have to understand this is for teams. This is for the team Samsung,
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:08.480]   because people choose teams now. This is for the team Samsung people say, don't worry. It's okay.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.240]   You don't, you know, the iPhone isn't giving them anything you didn't already have. It's
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.120]   a really, it's an ad not to sell stuff, but to reassure people.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:20.960]   Well, it's, it's a really good. Samsung, I think, is very aware of their reputation as well. Of
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.640]   course, all they do is they copy stuff that Apple does. So when they have a case where they can
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.440]   legitimately say, no, we had this years before and everyone said that we're stupid for doing it.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.600]   But it became so successful that Apple said decided they wanted to have a phone exactly this size.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.960]   So you can, you can certainly argue as to whether it's really productive to spend ad dollars and
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.440]   the attention of your audience talking about how, hey, now the thing we've had for three years,
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.840]   now the really famous style company that's known for doing things incredibly well has the exact
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.360]   same screen size. So maybe you don't want to buy ours. Maybe you want to buy the Apple one now.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.600]   Maybe that's not a smart thing to do. But it's certainly legitimate, legitimate operation.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.440]   Although I do want, I do want to say one thing about something that Renee said earlier,
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:04.720]   there is sometimes Apple waits to get things right. Sometimes it's just a case of they just
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:10.400]   don't have enough interest in doing that as good as this idea is as easy as it would be to implement.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:17.520]   Because the only reason why I want to make a mention of that is that I think too many people
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.920]   talk about, I'm not talking about Renee, I'm talking about the broader blogosphere.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.240]   When they talk about, well, see, Apple got it right. That indicates that well, so that the rest of
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.800]   us who've been using larger screen phones, we're idiots for using the phones that did big screen
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.600]   wrong. No, they didn't. For the past couple of years, at least, the Galaxy Note gets fine battery
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.560]   life. These 4.7 and 5-inch Android phones, they certainly have no compromises whatsoever.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:45.040]   This was just a case of Apple deciding that when we're going to have to respond to this market
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.200]   eventually, do we want to do this right away or do we want to take our time doing it? And they
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.600]   simply decided that, well, we're just not going to rush into this. It was the same with LTE. I
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.080]   mean, the Thunderbolt had LTE long before the iPhone did, and they were willing to make certain
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.960]   account compromises. The big screen Android phones, they used Pentile RGB layouts because they couldn't
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:09.280]   do proper RGB screens or they went with SAML-E. I mean, what I'm saying is that the people,
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.640]   I love that they do that. I love that SAML-E. I love that they've done six generations of
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.120]   smart watches and we'll do six more before the Apple watch ships, because I might want a smart
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.280]   watch now. I want a pebble. I want a pebble because I'm not going to wait. And I like that we have
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.360]   the choice to get cutting-edge technology today. And I like the company like Apple has a very
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.480]   particular idea of what they want to want and they're willing to wait for that. And I think we,
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.920]   as consumers, benefit by having both philosophies in both companies.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:39.040]   Yeah. That's fine. Android is just in the Apple doesn't have the ability to do that stuff,
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.960]   not because they're silly or not because they're arrogant, but only because they are the only
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:48.480]   makers of iPhones. And if they want to make a big screen phone, that is going to be 50% of all the
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.920]   brand new 2014 model iPhones that are ever going to be out. So they really have to do that a lot
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.600]   more carefully than a maker who can say, "You know what? This is a good idea. Let's just do it."
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:04.080]   All I want to chow. All I want to put into the discussion is that, again, the first LTE phone
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.800]   was junk, but it didn't take very long for them to be not junk. And now you're just not having LTE
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:14.400]   because you don't, that's not at that point in the roadmap for the iPhone. So I think I've seen
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:20.000]   some people not Renee use this as well. You know what? I'm glad I didn't have to use that crappy
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.840]   Samsung Galaxy Note 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, and 4, because finally this is the big screen phone that's
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.800]   worth having. It's like, "Well, no, that's not true. That's just your buying into the logo there."
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:37.600]   And I want to think that also, you have lock-in. I mean, you know, there's a lot of people like me.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:42.240]   I mean, I have both. I have both phones. I have an Android phone and an iPhone and I use them both
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:47.360]   every day, almost every day. And but the problem is that almost all my apps, I mean, all the apps
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:52.000]   that I paid for are on my iPhone. I'm a little resistant to starting to build up a whole paid
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.040]   library on my Android phone. And so... It costs a lot less than your phone. I got a
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:02.080]   audience, maybe 50 bucks. You're not going to spend that much money. Your phone costs a lot more
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:07.120]   than the library of apps. Unless you have some very unusual apps. I've got a pretty big library.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.120]   So I got some expensive apps in there. I've got a couple apps that...
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:16.640]   I didn't get that one yet. That's $1,000. But I have a couple of them that are in the 50 to...
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:21.280]   And there's a couple high-end film tools that are there. So anyway, so the point is, is that I
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.320]   think that I look at the Android right now, still as something I really like my M8, actually. I mean,
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:31.840]   I definitely enjoy using it. But I also... It's still the sidekick because most of my apps that I
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.040]   use it on a day-to-day basis are on my iPhone. I think that's going to be... That's the lock-in
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:39.840]   that Apple continues to be able to build because also because Apple users buy more apps than
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:46.560]   Android users where they are getting... Again, yeah, maybe that they're a fraction of the cost of the
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:52.000]   app. But you still think about it. I've got $200 or $200 or $300 worth of apps. And I've got data in
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.080]   there. And I've got all these other things. And so both sides, I think, have a certain level of lock-in
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:02.880]   from that reality. We're going to take a break. When we come back, Apple has confirmed to the
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:08.640]   call to Mac that the NFC chip in the iPhone 6 will be locked down and only usable for Apple
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.720]   Pay. That kind of eliminates my pick of the week I was going to show off these cool NFC rings. But
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.240]   they're no good to me now. That's why they did it, Leo.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:23.280]   Protecting you from yourself. I'm really curious what you guys think about this. Don't say anything.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:28.320]   Save it. Think about your position. We also have... Just before we get to that advertisement,
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.480]   just on the wire, the other advertisement for Creme Cam, the future of your 5th-day. Oh my god,
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:38.160]   it's already... Andy, you bought apps. That's the crap 2K model.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:44.960]   Creme Cam 3000, the future video podcast. Who did that? Who did that? Is that F&D?
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:50.400]   No. This was very much the Apple to that Samsung. One second. That's the Samsung Creme Cam.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:59.520]   3000. There we are. Again, you see how quickly they have to copy what the market leader is doing.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:04.400]   It's almost sad, really. Their attitude towards intellectual property is very disappointing,
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:11.040]   I might add. Our show today brought to you by our friends at ITProTV, Tim and Don. And I mean
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.360]   friends. They're great guys. They came by the studio. They've come by many times.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.200]   What I didn't know at the time was to steal our ideas, but that's okay.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:26.000]   No, we very freely shared with ITProTV. Tim and Don have been teaching people how to get out of
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.840]   their IT search, how to polish their IT skills for more than a decade. They're really good IT trainers.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.920]   And they saw what was going on here. They were fans of tech TV and they said,
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:41.360]   what if we built a kind of a twit for IT professional so they could get their
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:49.040]   certs easier, have more fun doing it. And that's why they created ITProTV. And it is
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.840]   absolutely, as they say, an easy entertaining approach to online training. I'm going to log
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:22:01.680]   into my ITProTV account so I can show you just what you'll get as a user of ITProTV.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.320]   First thing you'll note at the top of the page, there's an on-air button and it's blinking red.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:11.120]   That means they're live right now just as we are. You can watch them live. They've got a program
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.920]   guide on the right. You can chat with them just as you do with us. Hey, there's Don. And it does
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:21.280]   look a little bit like, see those high LPR 40s in the background? They got a Tri-Caster. They
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.080]   got everything. They got the same lights. They got everything we do. But what's different is this is
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:32.400]   unabashedly IT-focused stuff, which is really great. You can watch on your computer. They have
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.960]   a Roku app, which means you can watch on the big screen. There's Tim on the right, Don on the left
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:43.360]   and I guess they're getting ready to do a show. A plus episode coming up, they said, in just a
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:50.480]   little bit. Hundreds of hours of content on the course library, they do 30 new hours a week, much
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.960]   as we do. And if you look, there's free content. So you can see a guided tour sample episode. It's
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.840]   got an idea of what ITProTV does. They have lots of Apple stuff now. This is something they've been
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:05.680]   adding integration basics for 10.9 management basics. Apple certified support professional,
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:11.840]   Apple certified technical coordinator. So if you're a Mac fan, you can absolutely get your Mac
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:19.920]   certs, Windows, Linux, OS 10. You see, there's the CompTia stuff, including security plus
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:26.000]   MCS, AMC, SE, Cisco. These are the new ISE square to the new security certs. And they've got a
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.960]   really great new trainer doing the security stuff. Really enjoying that office. Certified ethical
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:40.000]   hacker. Yes. I want that cert. Certified ethical hacker. That's coming up in the first quarter of
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:47.360]   next year. Project management, VMware. They are Citrix Zen server, Microsoft's Hyper-V servers.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.680]   They're really, this is a wonderful resource. If you're an IT professional and you want to
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:59.520]   polish your skills, if you are looking to get certs so you can get a job, visit itpro.tv/macbreak.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:06.080]   Now it's very affordable. I mean, $570 a year, $57 a month. But we have a special offer because
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.680]   they understand that they stole everything that we do. And they're, they're, they're, they're,
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:18.240]   they haven't yet started doing fizzes. That's, I'm glad to see. No, they actually asked. They
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:23.200]   were very nice. And I said, gosh, that's a great idea. I hope you do do this. And we're very pleased
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:27.040]   that from day one, we've been, they've been a part of our family and we've been a part of theirs.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:32.560]   They have a special offer for Mac break viewers, Mac break three zero, the offer code, you'll save
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:37.760]   30% off for the lifetime of your account, not just monthly or yearly, but forever.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:43.040]   That means it makes it's less than $40 a month, it's $399 for an entire year. That's less than
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.160]   buying the materials, you know, the reading. Oh, you look at that as you get the measure up practice
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.240]   exams too. That's so you can, when you get your subscription, you can actually take the exams as
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:54.400]   you take the courses and see how you're doing. So, so you know what you need to polish up.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.880]   They divide the courses into actual chapters and questions on the exam. So you can really
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.440]   focus your study. There's a no hassle, easy cancellation policy when you do get your cert.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.360]   Although I think a lot of people just keep it because it's a great way to stay up on new technologies.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:15.600]   It pro TV, it pro dot TV slash Mac break, use the offer code Mac break 30, you'll say 30% off
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:21.200]   for the life of your account. I really go on on, they have a virtual virtualization lab. So,
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:25.600]   if you've got any HTML five browser on any operating system, you can go in there and set up
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:31.280]   Windows servers and set up clients and break it. And it's fine if I break it every time I use it.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:36.000]   And then you just log out and you start over and it's all fresh. It pro dot TV slash
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.320]   Mac break. We thank them so much of their support Mac break weekly. I guess I shouldn't be surprised,
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:47.840]   but Apple has confirmed the report at cult of Mac that the NFC chip and the iPhone six and six
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:55.280]   plus will not do things like pair to speakers. Will not let you integrate NFC tags into your apps,
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:01.360]   will not work with things like this. This is an NFC ring that I will use to unlock my Moto X,
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:07.440]   but won't work with an iPhone six. They're locking it down. So it's just for Apple pay.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:13.040]   In fact, that since Apple pay comes out next month, it won't really do anything when you get
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.760]   your iPhone six this week. What do you think?
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.160]   There's a weird story because a lot of the stuff that they say it won't do is stuff that Apple
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.560]   would have to enable anyway, like on like Bluetooth trusted object or NFC trusted object.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:30.000]   All of those features would still be dependent entirely on Apple. So it's not really locked down.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.880]   And the other features, some of them NFC does a little wait a minute though.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.240]   They don't turn it on is the same as they prevent it.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.880]   I mean, so, so absolutely. So the thing is like touch ID came out last year and it was
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.800]   it was constrained only to the two tasks that Apple gave it. And part of the reason for that
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.800]   is that Apple basically sprints to their release deadline every year just to get the functionality
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.880]   that they ship and touch ID is an example. They didn't have a my understanding is they didn't
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:57.520]   have a way to secure the yes, no token so that they couldn't prevent developers from spoofing
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.840]   those tokens if a malicious developer made an app. So it took them an extra few months to build it
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.880]   all into key chain and now key chain handles that and the yes, no tokens are safe. And my guess is
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:12.400]   that NFC, they had time to build it into Apple pay and to get all the partners on board, but they
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:17.600]   haven't had time to build out an API and to Apple's credit, they take their APIs really seriously.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.120]   They use them themselves. They make sure they're rock solid. And then they support them for a
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:26.080]   really long time. They don't tend to deprecate them too quickly. So my guess is that we're getting
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.480]   this is Apple's way of testing NFC and they're testing it on themselves. And when they're happy
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:35.280]   with it, they'll build it out and probably WWC next year, the same way we got touch ID API this
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.680]   year, we might get an NFC API next. Actually, you make a good point because they did show the
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:43.920]   Apple watch unlocking a hotel room door and they said that this is going to be supported
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:49.520]   in the what was it, Starwood group hotels. Although they did say that was NFC that could have been
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.920]   Bluetooth. I mean, they're it might as well have been NFC, but they didn't explicitly say
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.120]   okay. All right.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:28:01.680]   I think that they may make an argument that because the Apple pay is so important to them,
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.200]   they don't want to do anything that would open it up at all. That's reasonable.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.960]   A security perspective, you know, just saying like, here's the deal. This is what we think this
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.200]   is what you use NFC for. We want to make it totally locked down and totally secure. And we never
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.680]   want to have to deal with other people possibly using that NFC because it's so integral to
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:24.080]   the Rio market that they see for NFC. And also Apple can make the argument that
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.200]   name us something you would like to use NFC for. And then they'll say, well, we've got a better
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.640]   solution for this even, but it doesn't require you to tap a ring against something else.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:37.920]   Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's reasonable for Apple, Luke Pruden. And if you've chosen the Apple team,
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:44.240]   if you're on team Apple, then you use to this. Well, and I want to point out, by the way, that we
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:49.520]   try, we really try hard not to be on a team here at Twit. And it's not always easy.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.120]   We'd be picked last anyway. So it doesn't really. Yeah. Right. We want them to be on our team. We
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.200]   want, we don't want to fight over them. We want them to fight for us. I'm on team user. And so
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   one of the advantages we have is we can try all this stuff and we hope to give you a fair
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:06.400]   unbiased look at all of it through all of our shows. It's a long people tuning to Mac break and
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.920]   say, well, Leo, you're insufficiently worshipful of Apple. And that's not, I don't consider that
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:19.200]   to be our job. So, but I have, I do have to say on the NFC front, well, it is great that NFC is
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:25.200]   supported by other phones in, in its entirety. I also understand it. Look at, if you're on team
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:30.640]   Apple, you're used to this Apple pay not till October, the rest of continuity not till October.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.920]   Photos, right? When is that coming out? Isn't that next year?
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.720]   Yeah, for the Mac next year. For the Mac next year, is it going to be on iOS eight right away?
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.320]   I've heard conflicting things about it. It was in the betas and now it's specifically labeled
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.760]   beta outside of the beta. So we'll see. So in other words, this is
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:52.880]   whether because Apple, I think some of it could be argued that Apple has constrained resources
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:58.880]   there and and just can't. And by the way, it's not a lack of money or a lack of office space.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:03.440]   The constrained resource is brilliant programmers and great program.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.240]   It's working in Cupertino. Who are willing to work? No, I think Apple would open an office in any
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:13.040]   city in the world if that's where they needed to go to get the people who would write this stuff.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:17.440]   But there just is a, I think that that is truly a constrained resource. They want to do it and
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.280]   they want to do it right. So I don't think that that's, I think that's when you choose team Apple,
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:27.280]   that's what you choose. You choose to not necessarily be on the cutting edge, but you choose to be
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:33.040]   refined, which makes it all the more upsetting when Apple fails to be refined. And that happens
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:38.160]   from time to time. Right? Because you chose, you chose team Apple because you wanted it to work.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:42.400]   I'll give you an example. Maybe and maybe Peter Cohen says, I am full of it.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:49.520]   But this you two thing seems to me to be a fiasco. It's certainly not the story that they wanted
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:57.360]   to have come out of that event. So I love the posting people put up of you two in 19,
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:04.400]   maybe it was 2007 says, people are stealing our albums. We are not getting easily. And then eight
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:09.040]   years later, and eight years later, they have to put out an app to show you how to get the free
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:15.360]   YouTube album off of your iPhone and iPad. Can you imagine the conversation as they're planning
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:20.240]   this out? And saying, okay, we're going to actually do this. Great. Now, but before we actually pull
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:25.840]   the trigger on this, is there any way whatsoever we can imagine anybody being upset about getting
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.000]   a free album? No, okay. You know, I wouldn't be doing my job. I'm headed and asked, okay,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.520]   let's go ahead with this. And now the people are so desperate to find something to say that Apple
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.120]   did not think of this and something. No, I will defend. I will defend these people. I think this
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:43.440]   is what Apple did was wrong. So Apple gave away the album. But now normally when they give away
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.360]   free stuff, you go to iTunes, you click the button, you say, yes, I want that free thing. They did not
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:54.960]   do that with you two. They put it on my iCloud boom. And if I have my phone or iPad set up to
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:00.720]   auto download any new purchases, I have a YouTube album I didn't choose on my iPhone or iPad. And I
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:05.360]   have no good way to get or had they've had to fix that. But there was there is no good way to
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:11.520]   delete music without having to attach it to your. So that's absolutely wrong. They pushed that
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.880]   album to people. But where but what does this qualify for the word fiasco? Does this qualify
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:21.040]   for the word nightmare? This is I think they could have qualified for the word spam.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:28.000]   Also, also this precedent for this Amazon's music service does this Google's
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.960]   mean service. What are you talking about? No, it does not. I have never if I want a free album on
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:38.560]   Amazon, I have to click it and buy it and then it comes to my phone. It does not appear on my phone
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:43.440]   automatically. My next is a camera transformers the movie. Well, that's it's comparable to that. That's
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:49.520]   spam. I'm not I'm not saying first of all that that has happened on or on the at least on the early
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.280]   days where they're they have free giveaways. And now there's stuff in my library that I didn't
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:58.160]   download, which is not offensive. It's just that, okay, now a piece of music that I don't like my
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:02.240]   turn up on shuffle play unless I get rid of it. So I certainly agree that they could have thought
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.800]   another step ahead and seen given that Apple has never done this before. And also they are
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:11.360]   not the same way they can away free and also that they're not the company you associate with.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.920]   Something I did not ask for has suddenly appeared in my library. Apple gives away free music every
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:22.160]   week. They know how to do it. And they decided intentionally not to do it this way. Yeah, I bet
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:27.520]   that must have had something to do with you too. You two getting paid for each copy and it doesn't
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:32.400]   work unless people are it doesn't count unless people actually are. It also so you too could say,
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.960]   Hey, two million people downloaded our new album. Yeah, I'm not sure if I haven't seen it yet. I've
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:41.680]   been looking for whether that that's going to be recorded in the billboard charts, you know, whether
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.640]   you do I bet you it is right because it because it should be that should be a, you know, attract
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:52.000]   item of how many people downloaded it on iTunes. And so I think that the thing is is that I don't
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:58.960]   know if this one actually worked. But I think that if you know, the music industry should pay really
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:03.440]   close attention to what Apple just did there because they are they are whether this one worked
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:09.840]   or not. This is a shot across the bow. This is we will roll you into the ground if we feel like
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:14.720]   it. If we can distribute an album to 500 million people and pay whatever they paid you to, but I
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:20.240]   mean, they can pay a lot of bands, one million, five million, 10 million dollars for the album.
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:24.640]   It's nothing to Apple to do that. And you know, they could really position
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:28.480]   iTunes in a level. You know, now that there's all kinds of antitrust questions and everything else.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:33.440]   But there are, you know, this is the, you know, the stuff that I've been talking about for at least a
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:39.680]   little bit, which is that when it comes to movies and and comes to music, Apple has a huge distribution
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:44.320]   pipe that they're just barely barely utilizing. This is the first time I've seen them really
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.400]   show, you know, what a fully operational battle station. And now they need to understand that
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:53.280]   that is considered by many users spam. And Apple had to, I think, it's embarrassing that Apple had
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:57.520]   to publish a page with a button that says, Oh, Oh, here's how you get rid of that.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:01.840]   Absolutely. Is it spam or is it, I think it might be deeper than that. I think we're starting to
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:06.640]   understand what it is to have digital content and digital possessions and digital territory.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.560]   And that there are some people for whom that was an invasion the same way Amazon pulled
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:15.360]   1984 out of people's Kindle libraries, Apple push. That's an invasion. You can't do that.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.680]   Yeah. I mean, it's not, I mean, it happens in a million ways. You get pre-installed apps on your
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.240]   phone. I books came with the Winnie the Pooh thing. My Nexus seven came with transformers. Yeah,
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.120]   it is different. My bandwidth to download on my phone. Absolutely. And that's, that's what I
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.320]   like about this discussion. And there, there is an argument that, you know, we pay more attention
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.000]   to this stuff than we do to incredibly important social issues that exist beyond our digital
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.680]   domain. But I think this is very personal. Those are devices are very personal to us.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.280]   And we have to figure out, I mean, there's stuff going on about ownership when you pass away what
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:47.520]   happens to your digital library. And all of this is making that issue tangible. I mean,
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:52.320]   we have licenses to songs and companies can push and pull them from our devices. And we need to
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:58.320]   figure that out. And I have to say, I would feel less upset about this if this was the mechanism,
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:03.840]   but it is not how Apple has distributed free music in the past. They have a very good mechanism
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.600]   for doing that. And they elected intent. And I cannot think of any other thing to say,
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:14.080]   but intentionally not to do it. It also underscores the issue with Apple devices of how hard it is
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:18.160]   to remove content from your device. Although I think it's easier with iOS 8, you can swipe in.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:22.320]   Yeah, it will be. And that's good. And that's a huge improvement. I also wonder how much of this
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:26.080]   is you too. Like if it had been a hotter bad, like a more modern, hotter bad. Absolutely.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:31.840]   Absolutely. And by the way, I love you too. And I have all their albums. But I think also it's,
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.840]   it's a, it's a less controversial band for them to test this. If you're testing something,
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.840]   testing an idea, you know, if they had done arcade fires,
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.840]   oh, yeah, you can a lot of people that are really excited. But my parents would be much more like,
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:48.480]   why is this on my phone? You know, you know, and so I think that you too is a more known entity.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:52.320]   If you're going to test a system like this using someone with that popularity and that
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:56.800]   broad spectrum, I mean, obviously there's people that are upset. I'm going to bet that it's less
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.840]   than half a percent. And I should point out everybody saying, well, you didn't have to have
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:04.720]   voted to download, turn on. I didn't, and that didn't download on my phone, but many, many did. We
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:08.240]   don't know how many of those too many endowments were automatic and unintentional.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.800]   And it's a natural thing to have auto download turned on. I don't think any reason, you know,
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:19.440]   it says auto download is if I buy an album on the iTunes store, I want it to appear on my phone.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:25.200]   You have every right and expectation that that would be only if I buy an album. And Apple to use
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:32.000]   that to spam people's phones is wrong. Period. Okay, but can we, can we have perspective here? We
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:40.480]   have, we have Google's, Google's fiasco is the public is actually, well, I'm saying that is it,
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.200]   does it make it not wrong? Because Google did something?
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:48.320]   I'm does it qualify as a fiasco? Does it qualify as someone should get fired from this?
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:51.520]   Because as a qualified as late night comedians need to be talking,
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:56.160]   they need to make this the lead off monologue joke for four nights about this. No,
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.680]   I just wish that they were a little bit more perspective about it. I'm shocked that this was
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.760]   as opposed that this is not anything more than okay, that was stupid. That was hand fisted the way
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.280]   they did that. And I'm just chock we're using the word fiasco when it comes to this.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:11.440]   I don't know if it's a fiasco. I think it's embarrassing for Apple to have to make it very
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:15.360]   it's embarrassing to say how to remove something from your phone that they put there. I will say
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:19.760]   that in the at the keynote, I expected that the way they would deliver this is that the next time I
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.680]   open the I the iTunes app on any device or be Oh, by the way, here's a free album. Click on this,
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:28.080]   and you'll get that free album. So I agree with you. It's it's death by a thousand. It's death by a
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:34.400]   thousand cuts. No, it's not a big deal by itself. But but Apple hubris and I think that it's it's
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:40.000]   an example of kind of a widespread mindset at the Apple campus and I and that bothers
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.840]   hubris or the real I realize there's there's sometimes is a fine line between hubris and
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:49.680]   Schadenfreude. That's homestead. That's really and that's our show title ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:55.120]   You're mixing Greek and German, but I don't care Leo Leo Leo and I are going to be our
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:01.600]   music called double high. I'm I'm hubris. I'm John Freud. We've got James and Jones for you.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:06.320]   No, I don't look. Hey, I did I raise this on any other show on this network? No,
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:12.480]   but it is an issue on Mac break weekly because it's a strange thing to do. Agreed. I'd and you know,
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:16.880]   I there were apologists who said and Peter Cohen on I'm more is one of them and said,
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:22.640]   Oh, come on. No, it's not. No, no, no. He's not an apologist. He's a grumpy SOB. I love Peter.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:26.880]   By the way, Peter knows I hope he knows I love him and he just couldn't he understood. He just
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.920]   couldn't believe that given all the other stuff that we could be yelling each other about that
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:34.320]   that was top of people's list. People say that. Yes, I know, you know, there's horrible things
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:39.600]   happening in the world today and we could make all our shows about Isis, but we are in fact not
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:44.400]   and there are topics that each show covers. Well, I mentioned this previously, Leo, but
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:48.000]   like this is funny because Canada is a very relaxed country and all this stuff happened and
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.720]   we didn't say anything. But when we got the iPhone 3G and data was still $200. Oh, yeah,
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.160]   I remember that we took to the streets. Yeah, we didn't take the streets for war. We didn't
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.600]   take to it for financial reform. We didn't take to it for Medicare. We took to the streets over
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:04.400]   data for our iPhone. We have a very interesting barometer for what's important to us and the
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:08.160]   people and the people in Jefferson come on. It was a gift get move. Yes, you could say that if
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:13.200]   you're a spammer as well. Hey, I said you a gift email Santa Claus came down my champion chimney
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:19.200]   put it under my tree came into my house. Yeah, well, I believe in Santa Claus. That's true.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:23.920]   I didn't see I have yet to see I tried to Tivo and didn't record Tim Cook's Charlie Rose
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:30.160]   interview. I understand it is now up for free viewing. It's good. Yeah, tell us about it.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.000]   I didn't see it. What do you say? A lot of it was talking points, but it came off very
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.520]   sincerely. I mean, some people have said it was unscripted and I couldn't believe that because
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:43.760]   he's absolutely adept enough at talking on interviews now to do that. But he was very
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:47.440]   mea culpa about maps. He said it was a mistake that it shouldn't have launched the way it is.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.600]   There's the thing I'm surprised we're still talking about.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.880]   Well, no, because Charlie Rose asked him because you know, and Tim Cook said that when you run as
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.240]   fast as Apple does, sometimes you fall down and sometimes you fall on your face and you have to
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:00.320]   get yourself up and you have to do everything you can to make it right. And you know, he was very
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:05.360]   candid about that. He was he spoke about how you could still take every prop product Apple makes,
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:10.000]   put it on a table and that generates hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue for them.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.840]   And it puts them in a unique position to be able to pick and choose sort of the categories
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:18.000]   that they want to enter. Overall, I was I was impressed with the way he conducted him.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.920]   Part two is on tonight on Bloomberg TV and some PBS stations.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:28.240]   I mean, I thought one of the interesting things that he said between the lines was that and I
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:32.960]   can't I don't remember exactly the word, but it was basically that what Apple wants to continue to do
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:37.920]   is just make great hardware that works. And you know, it's kind of an open ended statement.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:42.880]   And I think that when we look at, you know, the home kit and a lot of other things, I mean,
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:48.480]   these are really, you know, and Apple Pay, these are really setting up for an awful lot of opportunities
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:51.520]   for a lot of people, but also for Apple when it comes to hardware development.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:55.520]   He put lie to the rumor that Apple might be in the market for path. He says, no, we're not
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:01.360]   paying was enough. We're not doing social networking. And I think that's wise,
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.960]   Apple has enough trouble with networking period. I think that it'd be silly for them to have an
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:09.360]   Apple, although. Well, it's arguable what he said. I mean, he said Apple's not making a social
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.880]   network. And you could arguably take features from path and include them in messages without
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:17.440]   having to turn it into a social network. Messages is in a way a social network. In fact, I tell you
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:22.720]   one of the things that that I have an iPhone on order, of course, of both versions of the six,
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:28.720]   and we'll have them on Friday. But one of the things that makes me nervous, and you can reassure
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:35.600]   me here about using the iPhone is messages. Apple does not foster going back and forth between
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:40.480]   Android. Once you start using messages, you kind of, isn't it going to be an issue for me?
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:45.440]   It depends how you use it. We'll assign you to Apple servers. And if you don't
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:50.800]   unassign yourself, then people who are also on iOS will be sending you things to your Apple.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.640]   That I won't see you on my Apple. Yeah. So you'll have to go turn that off.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:58.640]   How do you is there a way to turn that off? Yeah. I thought you had to call Apple support.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:03.760]   There's actually a switch in the settings. In the press for that account, there's like,
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.200]   hold on to the here are different. Here are all the different ways that this any user can contact
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:11.360]   you and their phone numbers or email addresses. And you just have to go and check off everything,
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.080]   except for that one phone number that's attached to that one SIM card.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:19.360]   Okay. Every time I use messages, I get messages on all my Apple devices. You've just signed up
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:26.240]   another email. It's like 80 emails now. Yeah. And it makes me, it just, I feel like there's something
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:30.160]   so one thing that scares me is that it all this stuff is instant. Now when I was doing messages,
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:34.560]   you know, back in the old days, you wrote something or you inserted something and then you hit send,
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.880]   but thanks to all these new sticker apps, you just touch something and it goes and iOS is like that.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:43.280]   Now you, you do the sound thing, you move your thumb up and it sends you tap location and it sends.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.560]   And I get scared because I think I'm just horribly embarrassed myself.
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:51.120]   They do that. Everybody does that. The stickers on Facebook Messenger, you don't have to say,
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:55.200]   okay, now send a sticker, you just choose it and boom that somebody's got your stupid sticker.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:00.240]   Terrifies. Yeah. I honestly think that if anybody made a messaging app that was literally called
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:05.360]   the mommy and daddy message, this is for if you're over the age of 30, here's the message,
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:12.560]   it will be just like SMS. It will verify things for you. Because honestly, messages on Mac OS
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:17.440]   has always and even on iOS has always been like the coleslaw that you get in a in a diner.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:21.520]   It's always there. It's never very good and there's no way to solve the problems that it presents.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:25.200]   Because I've, if Apple just simply said, we're not going to reinvent messaging,
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.880]   we're going to give you an SMS app. And then we're also going to give you a chat app and there
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.480]   will be two separate apps. And one will work well for what you want it to do. The other one will
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:36.480]   work well and predictably for these other things you want it to do. That's, I mean, I'm with Renee.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:40.160]   It's like the number of times that I've been using like beta software or certain something.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:44.400]   And I've typed a message saying, wait a minute, is this about to send it versus not to send?
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:48.640]   And I've actually hit, okay, how about if I hold down the command key and type Q
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:53.040]   just to make sure the next thing I do does not send just some random text to some place I don't
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:59.520]   believe I'm sorry. I've been using messaging for like decades. I should not be this confused.
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:05.760]   Or scared. There's only a handful of people that I even use iMessages with anymore. I mean,
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:10.320]   there's a couple of holdouts in my company and my wife. You're a Google Hangouts guy, right?
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:16.480]   So the newly empowered Hangouts, is that your choice for messaging? So yeah, 99% of my chatting
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:22.240]   with everyone is with Hangouts because I'm on any desktop that I'm logged into and I, and it all
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:25.840]   shows up there. So I'm right back into the conversation is if I need to cut and paste something into
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:31.280]   a router. I think it's easy to go back and forth between Android and iOS except for that.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:35.680]   If you use Google services, it's really easy. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So if you're using, yeah,
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:41.280]   so what happens is I'm if I'm lying in the world since I used to like, guys, is it gonna be all right?
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:49.360]   Leo, take our hand. We've been here before. We know the way out. Yeah, well, that's it. I count
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:54.800]   on you guys exactly. Cook also said iCloud wasn't hacked. He called it a phishing expedition.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:46:00.960]   That's reiterating Apple's press release of that week. He said he didn't see it coming that he would
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:06.560]   become CEO. He said he knew that it was in the long term plan. I don't know how you don't know this.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:12.240]   Doesn't jobs at some point. He's he's not in good shape. He's dying. Go to Tim Cook and say,
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:17.760]   you know, kiss the ring. I would like you to be the next king. You just not then. He didn't think
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:22.160]   it would be that day. Oh, I think I think I think that he was holding out of hope that. Okay,
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.360]   Steve is certainly not going to be getting a lot better, but he's not going to be getting a lot
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:28.720]   worse for you're not going to be getting worse in the media because there was an interim where
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:33.120]   Steve stepped down, let Tim run the company. And that always was the thought he'd come back. He
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:38.480]   did come back and then he died. So Tim knew that he would be running the company, but he just
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:42.000]   didn't expect him to die. Is that and he thought that jobs would be chairman for a long time.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.400]   I think it came to you too. Yeah. He said he always bounced back in the past and he thought he would
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:53.360]   bounce back again. Also, I love this tidbit jobs office is untouched. Yeah, I would. I
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:47:01.680]   must be something, huh? Have you anybody ever been up there? Never. No, I think it'd be weird to
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:05.280]   break it, break it down. You could think I think you kind of feel like you just kind of want to
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:10.320]   seal it off. You know, I know that it seems like a little bit of a, you know, I don't know,
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:19.760]   but but I think that it's it is it would be odd to take his office out of Apple. Although,
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:24.000]   I guess they will. Will they shut down one infinite loop when they open the big spaceship campus?
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.440]   All right. No, I think they've already said that even the big spaceship campus won't hold
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:32.080]   everybody. So they're going to keep one infinite loop. I'm pretty sure Jeff says when I die,
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:36.160]   they're going to do the same for my studio. Would you would just leave that there just as if I might
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:41.360]   come back at any moment at time? The qualification there is like asbestos. It's better to seal and
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:48.960]   contain the private move. Just put some some this queen over the door and tape it down real good.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:53.760]   No, no, don't don't turn left. That's the Chernobyl ring. It's it's worth it.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:59.920]   It's worth pointing out that iOS eight the GM release also closes all those back doors that,
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:05.520]   you know, Jonathan blogged about this last week. So the file relays and the packet sniffers,
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:09.840]   all of those interesting all the things that Jonathan Jodarski had talked about in his
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:16.640]   speech at 2600 hope. I've been all of them have been fixed. Apple because he had those
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:20.080]   questions for Apple at the end of his talk. Sounds like Apple responded.
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.800]   They didn't remove the services. They just made them impossible to get to for anybody.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.080]   That's what you want. Yeah.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:27.760]   Now, is it still going to be the case that once I authenticate with a computer that
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:31.040]   that phone is authenticated with that because that was one of the issues?
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:35.120]   I believe so. But now having that token doesn't really get you anything because all of the stuff
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.080]   that you could get to previously is totally secure. Nice job.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:46.160]   I think it's generally the the belief despite this iCloud fishing scheme. It's generally
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:52.400]   felt by most people that Apple is more secure that this trusted security token and all of that is
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.640]   better than anything else out there.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:59.600]   I don't know if it's that they're more secure, but they made a very big point at the watch event
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:03.120]   to say that their business model doesn't involve our personal data. So for example,
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.960]   with Apple Pay, they don't they don't care what you're buying. How much it costs and who the merchant
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:12.880]   is. They're not giving the merchant the number and some companies find that data incredibly valuable.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:16.800]   A lot of companies find that marketing information and that'll be valuable. Apple makes their money
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:21.280]   on the devices. So they have the luxury of saying, we don't care about that. And including that as
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:25.040]   a differentiator in their message. Yeah. I think the big differentiator for them is though,
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:29.360]   is that this is one area in which really controlling the whole widget is the only way that you could
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:34.640]   put payments on a phone and I would absolutely trusted completely because it is locked up very,
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:39.680]   very tight. The path is very, very closely guarded. It is true that I would trust Apple
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:44.880]   more than most companies. But it is interesting that this is a part of the part of the
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:50.160]   ongoing messaging of Apple that remember that we're we want to sell you new hardware. We want
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:54.000]   to sell you services. We are not in the business. We are not in a position where having that
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:00.160]   information benefits us in any way, which is an important differentiation. But sometimes I've
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:05.040]   been again playing with the Android stuff and also playing with the the the MotoWatch with the
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:10.400]   notifications on the from Google now. And sometimes it's kind of okay to give information to a service
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:15.120]   to a service if they can turn that into wonderful experiences. But I think Apple is very, very good
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:20.400]   to make sure that this is something that different as we get into a world in which the differences
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:25.680]   between what Apple does and what Google does become more of an apples and oranges sort of thing as
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:31.600]   opposed to Apple versus newer fresher, better, more tasty, more nutritious Apple. I think Apple's
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:35.920]   going to have to really make these points about how philosophically we are different from this
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:39.920]   other companies, not just features. It's not just hardware. It's not just what we're doing this year.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:45.040]   Phil esophically, this is what we're about. I think that's a smart way to position themselves.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:50.480]   He does say in this interview that Google is Apple's top competition. I think that was said
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:55.520]   with with a lot of respect to I didn't I didn't hear there was no hatred in that it was no, we are,
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:59.520]   you know, we are pop I am blue, though we are equally matched. We could basically keep fighting
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:02.880]   till the heat death of the universe because we are the two most powerful in this space,
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:06.400]   any space that we operate in. Yeah. And the fascinating thing to me is and John
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:10.000]   Guru pointed this out last week is that Google has so many people's big competitor now because
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.520]   they're in Apple's business, they're in Microsoft's business, they're in Amazon's business. It's hard
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:17.760]   to imagine any tech company that Google isn't directly competing against. Well, and it's gone
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:24.480]   back a little bit to the pre pre Steve Jobs thermonuclear war era where Eric Schmidt from Google was
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:29.520]   on Apple's board and there was this kind of great collegial competition. And as a user,
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:35.360]   that's what I want to see. I think the competition is very healthy, but it can't be lawsuits and
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:42.320]   invective. It has to be on the ground innovation. Who's going to make the better product? Let's
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:46.800]   see. Let's do it. But I think that all of that, of course, was collegial before Google released
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:53.840]   the phone. No, that's when jobs went thermonuclear and but that's fine. Look, Google's going to do
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:58.480]   things that are right there in apples. I don't think we'd have a five-inch phone. I don't think
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:02.800]   we'd have a lot of the features that are on the iPhone if if Android didn't exist. I think where
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:08.880]   we all benefit from that. Yeah, absolutely. I'm also really cheered to see them see this at the
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:13.120]   highest level them referred to as a competitor as opposed to no, they only got where they were
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:17.360]   because they have us to copy from and steal from. And that's a very good way to talk yourself into
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:20.960]   being lazy and saying they're not very smart. They're not innovative. They're not creating
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:24.880]   come up with great stuff. They're just copying us. We don't have to challenge ourselves at all.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:28.960]   So, yeah, I mean, this is this is such a great time to be into technology. This is such a great
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:34.720]   time to be in the market for great stuff because we have two people, two organizations that really
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:38.960]   want to out dazzle each other and really move things forward. It's a wonderful time. That's
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:42.960]   so exactly the right attitude. I agree with you 100%. That's the message.
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:47.520]   That's what Ken was on. Yeah, he said they made a phone. No, on my tablet.
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:54.320]   They made a phone shaped object. It will. Ben Heck also made a phone if you were watching his video
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:53:03.360]   series. Yeah. Tim tonight on the show will say quote, "Our business is not based on having
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:09.920]   information about you. You are not our product. Our products are these and this watch and Max and
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:14.560]   so forth. And so we run a very different company. I think everyone has to ask how do companies make
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:20.240]   their money follow the money?" I've said this for years. And if they're making money mainly by
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:25.440]   collecting gobs of personal data, I think you have a right to be worried. I might disagree with that.
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:30.400]   I think you should understand that. He says you should really understand what's happening to that
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:34.720]   data and the companies. And I think should be very transparent about that. And I agree with him 100%
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:41.520]   on that. Yeah, but I agree in broad strokes. But sometimes as I've always believed, at least modern
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:46.240]   Google has always been about the transaction between yourself and the company where here are the
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:50.560]   services they can provide to you. And here's how great those services can be if you let them see
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:56.000]   part of your life, you have to decide. But also realize that their profile of you is what funds
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.520]   all that free stuff they're giving you. If you're okay with that, great if you're not okay with that,
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:03.920]   that's fine too. I've heard I've heard that people inside Google have the same sort of arguments
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:08.080]   about personal data and things like that that we do, which is reassuring. But people at different
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:12.400]   points in their lives find different things valuable. And you pay with money if you can afford money,
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.520]   if you want free software, you pay with time because it takes you a while to compile it and
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:18.640]   build it yourself. If you want, if you don't have either of those things, you can pay with
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:23.440]   attention or you can pay with data. But you're just choosing what you find a value and you're
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:27.360]   giving it to somebody in exchange for a good or service. Well, I'm telling your choice.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:32.560]   But the good or service? Did you say that? You want me like, like some follow your subsidized
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:35.440]   because you're willing to take on because you're willing to share data with them. There's all
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:39.360]   sorts of ways in which you're paying for things. You can't say anything is for your choice.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:44.560]   I make that very clear in my mind. I make that very clear transaction. I'm giving Google a lot
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:49.360]   of information. But because I value Google now and having the watch tell me, you know, it's a five
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:52.880]   minutes to work, but there's traffic and all of that. Some people just want to save 10 bucks on
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:57.040]   email and they're absolutely happy to have Gmail save them that less. Yes, absolutely.
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:59.600]   I think there's also a lot of us that just don't think we're that interesting.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:04.000]   You know, like I'm not that worried about them. I mean, I just don't do very many interesting
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.320]   things. Well, I mean, there is a difference. And we've got we talked about this at nauseam. So
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:12.480]   won't I won't belabor it. But there is a difference between taking that information and selling ads
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:17.360]   against it versus taking that information and giving it to an insurance company or the federal
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.960]   government. Those are lines that they, you know, we don't want them to cross.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:25.360]   Race of the billion. And I think Tim is exactly right. They need the companies need to be absolutely
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:29.280]   transparent about what data they collect and what they do with the data. Absolutely.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:36.480]   That's yeah. That's why again, this isn't the Google defense show, but it's usually
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:41.360]   when so it's okay. Yeah, exactly. So it's it's it's surprising that when you find that there's a
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:45.040]   piece, there's a piece of delay that you're shocked and horrified that Google is collecting on you.
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:49.360]   Actually, there is a panel where you can go and say, Oh, well, stop collecting that information.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:53.760]   Right. Oh, okay. Oh, and there's another button underneath that delete all the information you've
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:58.400]   collected about me about the so far. Right. Oh, okay. It's not it's not it's not always the case
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:02.320]   and it's not always satisfactory. But it's good to know that they're not like Facebook where it's
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:06.720]   like, okay, well, you don't don't use us. Right. Don't don't don't. Don't see the part. Don't see
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:10.800]   the photos from your niece's college graduation party. We're fine. I turned off web history and
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:14.800]   that turned off Google now, which I was sad about. I know you need to you know, I'm going to get
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:19.920]   some of those tools. That's the price you pay. That's literally we're a good. Yeah, we're
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:23.760]   going to take a break. I want to come back. We haven't talked about the watch at all. Almost
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:29.040]   said it. But I didn't the Apple watch at all. Watch. I want to talk about the Apple. We got
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:32.800]   and we've got some great questions maybe after the break. Oh, let me tell people about that because
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:38.560]   we haven't mentioned it. If you go to titt.to slash MBW four to zero, that's this episode four
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:44.320]   twenty. The question engine is working and you can go there and ask a question or more importantly,
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:49.120]   go there and vote questions up because pretty much all the questions have been asked probably by
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:53.120]   now. But it's a question of picking the ones you want us to answer. We'll answer the most up
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:57.840]   voted questions in a little bit. Thank you, Alex Lindsay for providing that question. Again,
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:06.880]   question engine, twit dot T O slash MBW four twenty. Our show today brought to you by our good buddies
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:13.360]   at squarespace.com. We use squarespace for our twit blog. And my phone's somebody's calling me. So
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:18.880]   I apologize. My wrist is buzzing. Or is that your heartbeat, Alex Lindsay? You're sending it to me
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:28.000]   from now. Now everything's ringing. Our show is brought to you by squarespace. Better websites
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.480]   for all at the best place to make your website. One of the things you'll see right there looking
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:37.200]   on iPhone, your website looks great, but it also looks great on an iPad is also looks great on a
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:42.720]   twenty seven inch iMac. That's because all squarespace sites are automatically mobile responsive. That
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:47.920]   means they you don't have a different site for mobile. You have one site that fits every possible
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:54.160]   screen size. And that is beautiful. It's just a simple example of how squarespace makes it
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:59.040]   easy for you to create a website. It's web hosting so that they have that they host your site.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:03.440]   By the way, the best hosting I've ever seen never goes down always robust, always reliable.
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:09.120]   Tied to the best content management system, the best software. And that tight integration means
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:14.160]   they can give you stuff. No one else can. Plus they've got great developers and they and they're
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:19.600]   constantly improving their technology. This is hard to do. It's not it doesn't take long before
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:26.320]   a web system like this could look outdated. And a lot of them do. There are other places you can go
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:30.240]   to get web hosting and software and so forth. And they don't keep it up to date. They don't have
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:34.400]   the best engineers. They don't have things like mobile responsive design e-commerce on every
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:39.760]   single template. The templates are constantly being improved. Beautiful code if you ever look at the
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:43.920]   code. You don't need to know CSS or JavaScript of course, but if you do they have a developer
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:50.080]   platform that means the sky is the limit. You start by going to this is something else that no one
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:55.600]   else offers absolutely free two week trial. No credit card required. Just visit squarespace.com.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:59.680]   Click the get started button. Choose one of these gorgeous templates. It doesn't really matter
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:04.000]   which one you choose. So don't agonize over. Just pick one. You can import content from your
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.080]   existing site including all the images, all the links still work and everything. And then
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:14.560]   change the template. Change it again. Change it again. Mess with it. Update it. Put in widgets.
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:19.520]   All of that stuff it's there for you. And the content's never tied to the template or the
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:23.360]   design. So you can always move around. It's really nicely done. This is just modern
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:26.880]   state of the art needs some support. Don't worry. They've got the best support in the business
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:31.760]   right from their own offices. They don't outsource their support. They also have a great
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:36.160]   support website for you to take webinars, view videos, get all the information you need.
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:42.160]   Squarespace really is doing it right. They know how to do it. They know what you want. And they're
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:48.640]   offering it. And by the way, it starts at eight dollars a month. Wow. For all of this including
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:54.560]   e-commerce. And if you register for a year, you get the domain name for free. So that's good.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:59.200]   squarespace.com. I want you to try it right now with the offer code. Actually, you don't need
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:03.440]   an offer code to try it. But if you decide to buy, use the offer code backbreak to get 10% off
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:11.040]   your new account. squarespace.com. Better websites for all. We love them. Another company we've been
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:16.560]   with since almost the beginning. This was always kind of my vision for Twit is that we would have
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:22.000]   partners that we work with that are, I know that perhaps a lot of you who watch all of our
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.880]   shows have seen these ads and they know, you know, all the stuff I'm telling you. But I love the idea
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:34.400]   of growing with a partner. And I just feel like that's free for you guys. That's the right way to do this.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:43.520]   So watch. Now, I have to say, when I was watching the event and you guys were as well, you were there.
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:49.040]   I got excited. I'm always excited by new shiny things. But some of that is worn off
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:56.320]   over time. And I'm a little concerned that this watch a does not live up to the promise
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:01.200]   Apple has of taking an existing category and reinventing it so that it suddenly makes sense.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:08.720]   I don't feel that they did that and be refining a product. It looks more like a
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:15.200]   almost shovelware. They put in so many odd features, like the heartbeat, the drawings,
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:20.480]   the animated emojis that I had to kind of ask myself,
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:26.880]   have they made this better or just different? I'd love to hear what all of you think. You guys,
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:33.520]   Renee and Andy touched it. Yeah, we even tasted it. Well, I can't speak for any. Did you lick it?
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:37.680]   As you know, and this was true when this was true, by the way, when the iPad came out, a lot of
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:41.680]   people who didn't touch it didn't get it. But those of us who did really said, Oh, you know,
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:47.520]   this is there is something here. And we should also remember that this is several months away
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:52.160]   from being released, just like the iPhone was released that way the excuse me was announced
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:57.840]   that way the iPad was announced that way. I do think that Apple's announcement was
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:04.160]   a little disconcertingly vague, but that's the same was kind of true with the iPad where they kind of
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:09.600]   knew what they were showing off, but they knew that not until developers were writing apps for it,
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:14.320]   where did really emphatically say this is what the iPad is and what it's about. That said,
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:19.440]   I really was left remembering. Whereas I left to the iPhone and the iPad announcements feeling
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:24.960]   really revved up and excited about this thing with the iWatch. I'm more of a cooler, calmer sort
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:30.160]   of reaction of looks very interesting. Let's wait for them to tell us more of this story.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:36.160]   There's a lot that's very, very weird. I thought that I wrote their head right wound up writing 6,000
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:40.720]   words about the iWatch and two different articles last week. And one of the one of the concerns is
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:47.120]   that you hear you have like a device, it's a watch and it's a small, small screen and it's not
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:50.720]   probably not designed to be something that we spend a lot of time just walking around actually
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:56.560]   focusing on. And yet it has how many different controls does it have? It has a tap, it has a press,
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:02.320]   it has a scrolling wheel, it has another clicky wheel. And that's to say nothing about on screen
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:09.360]   gestures. They chose to show us the application launcher, which is this immense constellation of
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:15.360]   dots that's so dense that you have to scroll in and then scroll around to tap what you want.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:23.040]   I felt I'm coming to absolutely no conclusions whatsoever, but it did leave me with a lot of
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:29.040]   questions as to does Apple think of this as a device that is going to be an immersive experience
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:32.880]   where here is another screen for your attention, but it's in a much more convenient location.
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:37.360]   Or is it going to be something more like Android where the idea seems to be no,
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:41.440]   this idea is that the idea of this device is to make sure you spend less time looking at screens,
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:46.240]   not more. The last, I'm sure Renee has a lot to say, so I'll just wind up by saying that
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:51.040]   the signature thing that really left me confused on the ride back from Cupertino up to San Francisco
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:57.440]   to my hotel is that, geez, they showed us navigating through photos, the ride cloud photos on this watch,
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:03.600]   which is here you see this essentially this smudge of color that you scroll in, you zoom in on it,
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:09.600]   turns into like a patchwork of all your photos organized by time and in place. And I'm thinking,
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:15.840]   okay, that's nice, but this requires an iPhone. My iPhone is definitely in my pocket while I'm
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:23.120]   zooming through photo land. I can't think of a single situation in which I would want to select
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:27.760]   a photo from my watch. The only thing I could barely come up with is, well, what if you want to
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:33.280]   message somebody a photo and then I think, well, no, for that, I would probably still take my phone
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:38.960]   out of my pocket because it's a much the given that we didn't get a chance to try out the actual
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:43.120]   interaction of these other hardware. It seems as though it'd be much easier to pick out a photo
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:48.480]   and SMS it from my phone than it would from the watch. So I'm just left not skeptical and not
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:54.080]   with a negative impression, but thinking that, okay, I now know what it looks like. And I now
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:58.560]   know what some of the features are. I'm going to have to wait several months before I can have a real
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:06.640]   opinion on it. Ben Klimer, who is a watch blogger, was invited to the event and he wrote about
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:12.640]   it on his watch blog, Hodynke, which is great. And he said some things I agree with, which is that
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:19.920]   Apple absolutely nailed the bracelet. Yeah. That this is this was very clever. It's easy to change
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:28.400]   the bracelet. They did. One of the bands is something that I just really love, which is these
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:35.120]   this link band that actually is what is the name of that? Because that's Milanese. I love a Milanese
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:40.560]   band. You don't see him anymore. That that would buy the watch just because of the band. My grandfather's
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:46.480]   retirement watch in the 50s has that exactly. The great thing is is that that is that everyone's
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:52.080]   going to get to say one of these bands is the one that I love. But I feel like the watch they
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:06:00.160]   completely stumbled on. Well, and you're right, Andy, we'll know when we get it. It's not going to
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:04.480]   be cheap. So it's not going to be something I'm going to be happy about buying. I'm going to get
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:10.960]   a night watch, Leo. Huh? 350 is them. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Renee, go ahead. I was making a
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:14.960]   dumb joke. I said you're going to get a day in a night watch. You can get a day in a night
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:19.680]   bracelet, which is good. Yeah. And they're easy to swap out. So that's where all the fashion stuff
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.520]   is going. That's why I think that part of this design is really, really smart because I realized
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:27.360]   that it's impossible to come up with one wash design that everyone's going to like. So they came
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:33.360]   up with a rather bland design for the $350 part of it. But then for the fashion part of it, you can
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:37.440]   have a band for workday. You can have a band you swap into when you're growing out at night,
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:40.880]   another band you wear for a three day weekend elsewhere. And you can easily swap them out.
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:44.640]   I thought that was very, very smart. I'm really disliking the watch part. But I love
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.080]   I'm going to buy the Milanese band. There's a lot to unpack here. I mean,
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:51.600]   some people think that it's complicated for an Apple product, but you get two choices of size,
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:55.120]   like with the phones, you get three choices of finishes, just like with the phones,
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.400]   and you get a bunch of choice of bands just like you do with the cases. So I mean,
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:03.120]   in terms of an Apple product, it is more fashionable, but it's not really more complicated.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:07.360]   I understand a lot of what Andy is saying. Like there was not that moment, like when the iPad
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:11.440]   was introduced and Steve Jobs stood there and he said, this is a MacBook and this is an iPhone,
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:15.520]   and we have to prove to you that they're the tablet deserves to be in between that it does
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:19.680]   some things better than the MacBook and some things better than the phone. And we didn't have that
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:24.880]   moment. We didn't have that statement from Tim Cooker saying this is the the res on that for the
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:29.600]   for the watch. We got a list of features. Some of them I was absolutely expecting like some of them
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:34.880]   make so much sense like the logging for health and fitness, the notifications and
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:39.360]   glanceable widgets, the authentication and things for Apple payment, which is super clever because
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:43.520]   it uses a sensors to maintain contact with your skin. And if it breaks it, then you know, you have
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:48.880]   to you have to re authenticate. There's a lot of things that they just do in there. The communications
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:53.040]   thing was a big wild card for me and it's got a dedicated so that double tapping that button
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:57.760]   brings up payments, single tapping it brings up your contacts. And that to me was the wild card.
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:02.080]   That was the only thing wherever for an Apple product relaunch. I thought maybe they did too
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:05.280]   much instead. Usually it's always like they did too little, but I'm sure they'll get to more of
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:10.880]   it in the next version. That was too much. But it's interesting. It's interesting. All the
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:16.880]   things you could do. Yes, the emoji look like Yahoo circa 1980 and the heartbeat thing. You're
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.160]   probably not going to use that with too many people because it would just be awkward. It's cute.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:24.800]   Yeah. I don't even want to use it with my girlfriend. I mean, it's just, yeah, I feel also,
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:29.600]   I have said this is a bit of a joke, but it's somewhat sincere that this was a watch designed for
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:36.000]   Japanese schoolgirls. Rich Japanese schoolgirls. If the minimum buy in is $350. I remember that's
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.240]   the minimum. But maybe the truth and the negative truth in that is that this is aimed at a younger
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:47.280]   generation that has a different idea of what a watch is. In other words, no idea. For the price
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:50.400]   though, I mean, you can read the Hadeki blog and I met him there. John Gruber and I had the opportunity
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:54.800]   to meet and speak with him for a few minutes. Fascinating, really smart guy. This is incredibly
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:09:00.000]   valuable for the price. Apple is not surcharging here. I believe he said you just can't get watches
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.360]   at this quality at that price. No, that's true. And it'll be interesting to see because there's a
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:09.600]   full, there's a solid gold, 18 carat and rose gold watch and you could Rolex's can cost tens of
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:14.000]   thousands of dollars, even for stainless steel, let alone gold. So we're just gonna see what that
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.800]   price point is. But I don't think anyone, and I don't think I do say this, but this is expensive
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:23.120]   in terms of consumer electronics, but it's not expensive in terms of watches. The difference,
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:27.680]   the huge difference is though that you can buy a Rolex and 100 years from now, that's still gonna
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:31.840]   be a great role. That made that point. It's not an early one. It's gonna be out of date in two years.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.640]   Yeah. Yeah, it's great value for the money, but the longevity of it. And we don't know if they're
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:40.960]   gonna make a new one every year like iPhones or every two to four years like Apple TVs. There's a
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:46.880]   ton of questions. Which you both of you, I presume, put it on your wrist. To the person looking at
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:52.720]   the photograph, it looks like a metal pillow. It looks big. And it isn't physically big. It's
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:57.600]   light and it's not much bigger than an actual watch. It just feels like a, I something, did it feel
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:04.160]   clunky on your wrist? Didn't feel clunky on mine. The stainless steel one is heavier than you
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:08.480]   would expect it to be because I think in your mind, you're thinking digital watch and not stainless
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:13.120]   steel watch. But when I compared it to real like Omega watches that I've had experience with,
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:18.080]   it's definitely within that bandwidth. It is thick for a watch. I just think it's definitely
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:22.960]   within the bandwidth of what you could reasonably expect a watch to be in terms of size. It will
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:26.960]   be thick. It will be a little bit heavier. We'll be a little bit larger, the 42 millimeter size.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:31.200]   Anyway, then you might expect. I mean, here's here is my previous Apple watch,
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:36.640]   which I wasn't able to find until I wanted to wear this at the event.
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:42.800]   It's talk. It's it's Claris. And so a lot, see, the thing is a lot of people are used to wearing
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:48.720]   like smaller watches like this. And when that's the case, a larger smartwatch like this is freaking
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:54.880]   huge. But I feel like the Moto 360 style wise is great. Yeah, exactly. I think this is considerably
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:59.920]   lacking in features, but the style is great. Yeah, I mean, this is like the ultimate like,
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:05.920]   it's just a blank slate. It does not try to impress. And it's very minimalist. And so this,
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:09.680]   I think that the Apple watch might get a little bit more attention maybe than this,
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:14.640]   but only because really only because it's square, not because it's so big. It really does. I've
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:20.000]   always been the guy who, because I write so much about phones, I like to see what other people are
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.680]   using and how they're using it. So I'm the person who's like, I'm reading my book on the subway,
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.840]   but I'm glancing to see, okay, you're using a Samsung. It's not a G says. Oh, it's an S.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.920]   No, it's not S five. It's an S four. Oh, gosh, she's using it in landscape mode. That's interesting.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:35.600]   Now I'm actually on the, especially on the flight over to Cooper, over to San Francisco and back
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:41.120]   again, I was really paying attention to the watches on people's wrists. And I saw women's watches that
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:46.400]   was even bigger were even bigger than this. I saw men's watches that were gigantic. I saw some
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:50.960]   that were tiny. I think that saving grace is just going to be that there is such a variety of
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:56.720]   wrist watches out there that you can have a watch that looks a little bit weird and it won't really
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:00.960]   take much attention. And it doesn't feel to you. It doesn't feel with again, it's a little
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:04.800]   the stainless steel one, the 42 millimeter is rather heavy. But again, if you're not used to,
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:09.760]   it's within the bandwidth of what you'd expect normal about navigating with that stem.
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:13.360]   That seems very non apple to me. I mean, that's a very strange. It's very quick.
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:17.840]   Leo, it's a very. So the basic thing with that is you it is still a multi touch display. It has
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:22.160]   a new force touch, but they didn't think that pinch sort of gestures or multi touch like multi
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:26.080]   finger gestures were good on the small screen or that they'd obscure the screen too much. They
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:30.400]   went back to the click wheel idea of you move the control off of it and almost, you know, like how
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:35.360]   a Mac works with a control is is intermediate is intermediate from the screen. And you can use that
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:41.040]   to sort of do the brute force navigation and then multi touch it. But I forgot to mention something
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:45.040]   earlier that I wanted sort of conclude with. To me, the case to be made for this watch is
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:48.960]   convenience and they did hit on the features, but I don't think they sort of wrapped it together.
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:52.640]   For example, my sister already, she leaves her phone in her office when she does rounds at the
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:56.720]   hospital and just has her watch with her because that's the paging system. My mom already wants to
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.080]   get it because her phone is in her purse and I assume we have a bigger phone. It's going to stay
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:03.600]   in the purse much longer. And she thinks she misses calls and messages. But on her wrist,
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:08.240]   she won't do that. Tim Cook mentioned controlling his Apple TV with it. There's home kit coming
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:13.120]   to be able to control all sorts of accessories and appliances. So the idea that this can be
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:18.320]   a much more readily available instrument than your phone or certainly your tablet,
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:22.240]   I think is the big selling point for this. I just don't think that they made it as plain as they
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:27.840]   had with iPhones or iPads. Did you catch Tim? Did you catch Kim saying Tim saying, Oh, also,
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:33.360]   I'm controlling music on my computer on iTunes, which I think was the only even oblique mention of
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:37.760]   controlling stuff actually on your desktop. Oh, yeah, you can run with this. You can leave your phone
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:41.120]   at home and run with this. It has local music. It does. It doesn't have GPS, but it does almost
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:44.880]   it does a lot of things locally does payments locally. So you don't have to be bound to your phone.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.800]   Well, and I think also, you know, how it interacts with the entire home is going to be very interesting
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.840]   with a home kit. So when you have, you know, you're not going to have to have your phone,
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:56.640]   you walk into your house and then there's a lot of interaction that's possible there that could be
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:01.520]   a could be very, very interesting. Yeah, I'm just I'm just worried that they,
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:06.240]   if of the list of things that I may be a little bit concerned about or the questions I really want
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:11.520]   to have settled next year is that did they actually over design it? Did they say, again,
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:14.960]   there's so many controls on this. I was also a little bit concerned when they were talking about
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.640]   it. Here's why the click wheel is such a good idea because it allows you to navigate the interface
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:24.240]   without blocking the screen. And again, I'm thinking, but again, this is a watch that I'm going to be
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.880]   not really going to be staring at for 10 minutes at a time. Is it okay to simply put a simple control
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.240]   here on the face? Then I tap that control to make it do the thing that I want it to do?
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:37.040]   Or do you really envision me standing there on the side of the road just like this for five or 10
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:40.960]   minutes and grossed in this task that I'm supposed to be doing? And I was seeing the
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:45.360]   demonstrate maybe running had a different experience, but I was watching the demonstrator operate it
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:49.760]   and there were times when he was going like this and then that and then this and then this and then
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:56.160]   this and then that and then this. So again, I'm I really am looking forward to my first hands
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:00.160]   on experience because it seems as though I'd much rather have fewer controls on a touchscreen,
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.680]   but that's the only thing I ever have to deal with than okay, this is a scrolling thing. Nope,
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:07.200]   this is a tapping thing. Oh, no, there's a tap and press thing. Oh, no, and I got to tap this one.
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:12.320]   Wait, do I have to double tap that or do I press and hold that? It's I'm not used to seeing that
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:16.960]   much stuff on an apple device, particularly something that that's small. And a lot of it is
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.640]   dictated by the variety of things you can do with the watch. I almost feel like they tried to put
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:27.120]   too much into it. Well, we'll see. Of course, everything I'm saying is predicated in the notion
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:33.360]   we haven't don't have it yet and won't have it for a few months. But but I'm concerned and I don't
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:41.120]   feel like looking at it, Apple has somehow magically solved the watch issue. Well, I think that I think
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:45.120]   that the watch is something that it's an important vertical that they have to get into. They have a
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:50.000]   they have a market for it. I mean, they're going to sell a lot of them no matter what because people
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.760]   are going to experiment with it. They're already Apple users and and they definitely have to play
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:58.000]   with the wearable market. I think there's a lot of people who are wearing Nike wristbands and would
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.400]   prefer to just have it all in one. So I think the biometrics was key to making sure that it really
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:06.720]   solved a couple problems and why people are wearing multiple wristbands. And so I think that that
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:10.960]   takes some of that out for some people. And then I but I think that it also, you know, allows them
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:15.360]   to start to see what's going to work in the market. I think that the advantage that Apple has it going
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:19.440]   slowly is they get to think about it a lot. But this advantage is they have a very low iteration
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:23.360]   rate. And so I think that it's important for them, unlike, you know, all these while the all the
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:28.000]   you can wait for a certain period of time. But all these other manufacturers are getting real data
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.120]   about how users use the product. And I think that Apple had to put something out there and just
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:37.120]   start to see people like it. There'll be another version in another year and it'll look different
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:43.200]   based on that. I mean, are, you know, where the new sixes is light years different than, you know,
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:48.160]   the original iPhone. Yeah. Someone on Twitter mentioned something that I wish I were clever enough
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:53.440]   to have spotted immediately that one reason it's interesting that they that the icons are not in
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:57.520]   a grid. They're in sort of a honeycomb sort of configuration. And one of the reasons for that
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:02.880]   must be that because that way you can get more icons, with brown icons, you get more of them per unit
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:07.760]   unit. But someone also pointed out that she that would also fit better on a round display in the
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:12.000]   future if they decided to do that. I don't know if that means anything but it's like, oh, that would
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   be true, wouldn't it? He's one of the one of the things maybe I don't know if we learned this that
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.200]   Apple didn't learn was that the demand in at least in Android Wear was for the round watch, not for
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:26.240]   the square watch. And I think we were doing the event. You were of course in the event, but we were
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:31.120]   talking and during our live telecast, that was the first thing that came to mind is it's not round.
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:37.120]   We thought that we thought Apple would go round. It's so hard to I think the 360 does a good job
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:41.360]   with it. But nonetheless, if you're trying to do something that has a little bit more ambitious
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:46.240]   of a user interface, you lose a lot by losing those corners. Now suddenly all of your buttons
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:51.600]   really have to be round. You really can't do it. It's it doesn't naturally fit into this scroll up,
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:56.160]   scroll down, select sort of motif that they've got there. So I can certainly understand it. Again,
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:01.200]   I think it works well in the 360, but it really does take a certain knack to design a device that way.
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:05.920]   I will say that the fitness stuff works. I think that was the only thing that they really showed
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:11.280]   start to finish. And no wonder because boy is that impressive. I would love to have this on my wrist
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:18.160]   because just like I got an I got an MPG meter on my car a few years ago, and it absolutely immediately
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:23.440]   changed the way I drive because now I have a score for how carefully I drive now. And I could,
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:28.720]   as I'm watching these demonstrations, these poor, poor, incredibly good looking, incredibly fit people
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:33.200]   who have to like be on a tread on treadmills, like all all afternoon long demonstrating how well
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:38.400]   these watches work. I could really see how that would get me to motivate it to try to get out of
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.560]   the chair a little bit more to exercise a little bit more because it turns it into a very simple
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:47.280]   Nintendo like, you're three circles, you want all these circles to be complete by the end of the day.
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:51.120]   And here's how far you are on this circle. You're doing great on this circle, but you want this circle.
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:53.680]   Go to it. Go Andy, go.
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:57.760]   We haven't even talked about the phones.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:05.760]   They're phones. Phones, four million sold in the first 24 hours. That's a record for Apple, right?
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:11.840]   Yeah. And boy, I tell you, I was up at midnight on Friday and Apple Store was not.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:14.880]   Man, two a.m. Man, two a.m.
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:18.800]   You know, I know a lot of people were complaining about that, but I have to say when I grow up,
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:23.920]   I want a company that shuts down all of the phone companies in my own giant website. I mean,
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:26.960]   that's that's what I want for a product. That that is what you want for product launches.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.600]   But not the what you want, but that's not not a bad problem.
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:33.520]   I do feel like Apple should have opened the store at midnight, whether it was working or not.
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:37.840]   It wasn't even open. It's like they said they were going to open in a minute. They should have opened
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:43.120]   it. I mean, the link's like if you got it. If you got a direct link, it worked. It was just a front
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:47.280]   page. Yeah. So I got I got my reserved almost immediately because I knew the link right to the
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:54.320]   car. I tweeted it. I didn't I didn't hog it for myself. I share. So that's interesting. So it was
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:59.760]   maybe a failure of the servers on the due to the onslaught of people. It went up and down a couple
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.440]   time. I had to reload several times to get to the I thought they just didn't bother opening it
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:08.800]   for a couple hours like, Oh, you know, we're getting lunch got some pie. We'll get to it.
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:14.640]   So it wasn't that it wasn't open. It was open. Yeah, and Fitzen's just jammed. I went to all the
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:19.360]   US carriers bought one on sprint for my mom. I was able to, you know, sprint was up and down,
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:25.200]   but I was able to get at least through the process bought one for myself from Verizon,
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.720]   which seemed to have pretty snappy servers the whole time.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:33.280]   AT&T up and down T mobile didn't open for a day.
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:38.480]   They couldn't. The problem was that T mobile got I decided to move to T mobile.
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:41.440]   Everybody unlocked T mobile. That's the way to go.
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:46.160]   Well, and I think for me, it was Wi-Fi calling. You know, I decided, well, that I've just had
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:49.840]   it with AT&T. I just couldn't take it any longer. Even though I had the free
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:54.480]   grandfather version of everything, they just slow you down. Anyway, once you get a lot of
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:59.360]   them anyway, it wasn't worth it. And you know, no matter how much I ask AT&T not to turn my phone
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:05.040]   off when I'm overseas thing, I know they do T mobile from three unlimited overseas calling,
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:11.040]   texting, and data. I was 2G data, but still. All the phones at the all the iPhone six is in the demo
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:15.520]   area. We're running T mobile. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think that's for me, that's going to be
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:19.600]   the way I'm going to use it. And actually the two most. Oh, good.
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:24.560]   I was just quick, quick postscript that they're all they also all had the beat zap on it.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:28.960]   Yes. Yes. Really? And John LeGera had an open bar. So.
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:35.360]   Is that true that all the iPhone sixes will have beats? All the all the demo phones that were
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:39.840]   on that area. And the beats happen. So we'll know we'll find out Friday. Yeah. And I probably will
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:45.360]   do an unboxing depending when it arrives. The one I was able to get from Verizon was the 4.7.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:49.200]   It looks like the 4.7 did not sell as well as the five and a half inch.
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:53.520]   Five inches is very constrained. There was just there were fewer of them. Yeah.
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:57.360]   Okay. Yeah. And also, I think a lot of people just assume that the most expensive iPhone was the
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:03.040]   best one. They had to have that. Not 50 bucks. I don't care. I don't know how many people like
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:06.800]   Apple people are funny because you know, we work in the business or we've all tried galaxy notes
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:11.280]   and we've all tried galaxy Megas and HTC giant heads, whatever. I forgot what those ones called.
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:14.800]   I actually see Matt, whatever they were. We've tried these big phones. We know what they feel
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:18.480]   like. We know what they mean. But I think a lot of people who have only bought iPhones,
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:22.800]   they don't really understand how big a phone like how big a big phone is. And they just bought
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:26.320]   it because it looked like the new flagship and they're just going to see the reaction to it when
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:31.360]   it arrives because the iPhone six doesn't feel that much bigger because it's thin. It's round
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:37.040]   and it's light. The iPhone six plus is a bigger phone. Yeah. It says big as my one plus one,
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:45.200]   which because we've made Burke made up the iBirk six and six plus. And as a lot of this was the
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:50.000]   thing to do. Our technique put out PDF templates so you could and I know a lot of people who are
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:56.480]   carrying around on Thursday, both sizes just to see which one they could live with. The 4.7 is
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:00.720]   already bigger than the existing iPhone, but the five have Nexus seven in my pocket. I'm not
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:05.280]   afraid. I'm not afraid either. This is exactly the same. The iPhone six plus exactly the same as the
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:11.920]   one plus one, right? And I got the note to which is almost exactly the same size. It's a little bit
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:16.000]   wider and a little bit shorter. So I know I can live with them. Yeah. It's I think it really is.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.320]   I think the feature set wasn't the same either. I mean, for me, I mean, I got the plus, but for me,
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:25.680]   the most important feature on the phone is the camera. Oh, I yes. And so the yeah, so the optical
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:30.320]   image stabilization is exactly why I bought the six plus not. I probably would have bought the
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:35.040]   smaller one if all the features were identical. Oh, I think I probably would have gotten the smaller
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:39.760]   one. What? The battery life is way longer on the six plus two, which will be good. Yeah. And these
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:45.360]   are actually, by the way, the most popular questions that we have on on the question engine is about
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:54.160]   the iPhone six. Aaron Mayler asks, what are your thoughts on apples going with 1664 and 128 and
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:24:00.880]   dropping the 32 in the memory on the iPhone six? That's our most popular question. People want to
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:05.280]   know. I just think it was probably the you either get the smallest one that's cheap,
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:10.560]   or you're going to go for something. Well, it's pretty obvious. They wanted to have a starting price
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:18.480]   that looked low. So they made a 16, but they don't expect anybody to buy a 16. And that's there was
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:23.200]   really no real the real question is why is there a 16? Not why is there not a marketing? There's
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:28.480]   always three marketing tiers, right? Right. That's the real question. And I agree a 32 for a lot of
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:33.760]   us would be exactly right. I got 64. Yeah. Really? I think it really is the difference between
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:39.040]   economy, business class, and first class, where there has to be there has to be I'm not sure that's
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:42.800]   going to be as unpopular as people might think it is. There are people who just need how are they
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:47.840]   are on a budget. They have $199 to spend. And they're grateful to get this this phone as cheap as they
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:52.320]   can possibly get it. Once you get once you get a step over that, there are people who don't have
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:57.920]   to necessarily be on a real budget. So why not buy something that has a real step up four times as
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:03.040]   much memory as opposed to just an extra 16. And then there's first class, which is money is really
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:08.640]   no object. I'm willing to spend as much on an iPad as I as I would on this phone. And that's where
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:13.120]   the 128 comes in really. I couldn't believe I was I couldn't believe that you know, I went to T
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:18.480]   mobile so it's unlocked and I just paid the full price up front. And I was like $949 for
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:22.560]   one for a phone. This is the same as a computer. I guess it is a computer. But I mean, I'm just like,
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:26.080]   I got interrupt you because we're out of time. I want to do a couple of quick question engines.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:29.200]   We got another ad and then we're going to do a fix. But there's no way we can get this done in
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:33.520]   seven minutes. So let's do a couple a couple of quick. Okay, here we go. Question and here we go.
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:40.160]   Speed round. Next one is from Jim M. And he says, Renee or Andy, how heavy did the iPhone 6 feel?
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:44.000]   Does the thinnest make up for some of the huge size and weight? And he's from Jim from
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:49.360]   later ago? It feels pretty light. The round edges, I think, really what make it feel light and thin.
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:53.920]   I did not feel as though the six plus was obnoxiously heavy. I have I have them both in each hands.
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:57.440]   And I did not feel as though the six plus was super super super heavy compared. No.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:04.880]   You're handy. Next question is from Mike Ren. He said, what are your favorite iOS optimized apps
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:12.400]   that will be released day one? Oh, yeah, exactly. I'm about to say. Absolutely. I'm not allowed to
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:16.880]   talk about. Oh, interesting. So there's stuff we haven't seen. There's one of the things Tim Cook said
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:21.840]   on the how about the Swift keyboard, which is now which is I can talk about is awesome.
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:27.440]   Yeah. And once you once you once you once you the first time that you that you use the sort of
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:32.400]   keyboard where you're just sliding for one place to another. Oh boy, that is the fastest way to type
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:36.320]   it blows away. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, you will love it. Yeah.
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:41.840]   And I hope last past does extensions as well, because I would like to be able to fill in auto
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:48.000]   fill and stuff. I think they said they would. And you want another one, Leo? Or do you want one more?
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:51.120]   One more last last question is from Eric.
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:54.000]   Dickari Dicara Dicara.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.320]   So it's a very
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:02.480]   Nashville. He said, will we finally see an update to the Apple TV this fall?
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:10.000]   The spring next spring. This is the top questions will always be Mac mini Apple TV.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:17.520]   And will we see an event in October? I think if the Mac stuff is ready, we will.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:23.440]   Yeah. The iPad stuff, the Mac stuff. The iPad or touch ID. I mean, they're not as they're not
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:29.440]   mean, they're going to be nice new iPads, but it's the iPad's toxic. It's the talk cycle for the
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.040]   iPad. So it's not going to be as big a deal as it was last year with, you know, retin iPad mini
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:37.360]   and why even do it. That just press the new Macs are there. Then you can do the iPad and then you
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:42.960]   Max and the new Max are Broadwell. I mean, is there what is the new? It's the new chip Intel chip set.
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:47.760]   Yeah, new Mac mini. It's not even whether they're ready. It's whether Intel's ready.
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.200]   Yeah, frankly, I don't even want to get in the Mac mini at this point.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:58.720]   Or Apple TV. Apple TV. I don't think it's going to be this year, but new Mac mini. I'm ready.
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:03.360]   I'm ready to just get a press release tomorrow saying they've updated. I'm ready for a big event
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:09.040]   in October. I'm ready to wait to 2015. I absolutely don't know makes they have to update it soon,
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:13.200]   but I know anyone is I'm going to throw in one a Leo question from the question engine.
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:20.960]   Tim Cook said to Charlie Rose, there is stuff we have not announced. There is stuff no one
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:27.600]   he's even rumored. Gentlemen, what do you think? Absolutely true. No, no, not yes or no.
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:32.320]   What is it? Well, I mean, you said it really well. There's things that they're never going to
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:36.000]   release like they've had television sets in the labs for years and they've chosen not to release
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.880]   them because they don't think that that's a good one. Maybe not never, but you know, they don't
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:43.360]   think it's a good product yet. The iPad was not released. The iPhone was then the iPad was released.
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:47.040]   I mean, they they almost anything you could think of that you that Apple could do,
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:49.680]   they have tried and then they make decisions based on the product.
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:55.680]   How do we feel about the bump? You know, I'm talking about the camera bump.
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:59.680]   I wish it was bigger with a bigger chip. You want a bigger bump? Yeah. I just want a big
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:03.280]   bump. I want a big chip in there. You know, they I don't know if you saw Panasonic was released
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:09.200]   to basically a one in sensor. You know, wild on a on an Android device. Isn't that wild?
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:13.920]   Like a man, that that phone has a bump. Yeah, it's got a baby bump.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:17.920]   If Apple gave us a version of that, I would be the first in line. Okay.
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:22.160]   And if anyone got in front of me, I asked the wrong person, obviously. Sorry.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:27.040]   Of course, Alex wants a bump. Great camera. Do you think people will,
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:32.480]   it's not that big above that people are going to be you got you got to be a really turbo design
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:36.640]   walk to complain about that. That's just like iPod touch from last two years ago.
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.000]   What it had a bump. I didn't even notice. Yeah.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.760]   Can't make thing cameras do not like being fit. They're going to bump.
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:48.000]   Right. You could ask yourself, why not make it just a little bit thicker and just make it,
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.560]   you know, and incorporated. But who cares? Who cares?
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:54.720]   Our show. We got the weight. Our show today brought to you by the Good Buddies.

[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:08.080]   All right, everybody, it's time for your picks of the week. We're going to start with Mr Andy
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:12.400]   not cool. Okay, let me just show off one of the other features of crane cam 3000.
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:19.920]   The video podcast. Oh, I have. Oh, there you go. See, I have been sort of interested in
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:27.680]   blown away. You're right to be blown away. I have been super interested in in
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:34.480]   folding Bluetooth keyboards ever since I knew that there was going to be a a a
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:42.160]   iPhone six coming. So I have ordered a one of these. This is off of this just arrived today.
[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:46.320]   Sorry, cream can 3000 is still emerging technology. This is the this is the foot this is the
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:51.840]   iWorks folding Bluetooth keyboard. Here we see the footprint basically of the iPhone six. I was
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:56.080]   looking for something six plus I was looking for something that was roughly exactly that same size.
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:33:02.240]   And it comes in this little slide off case right here that doubles as a stand. So you put that
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:08.080]   right about there, unfold it like this, and then drop your iPhone six right there.
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:13.760]   And it's not optimal because it has this gap in the middle, but I was actually writing a bit
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:19.520]   with it this morning because it arrived kind of around 10 or 11. And you can actually get a good
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:24.480]   fast type on it. The fact the nice thing about it is that this is multiple operating system. It
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:29.760]   will work Android windows or iOS. But the nice thing about it is that it has a really nice space
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:35.200]   bar here. So as you're sort of getting used to the split keyboard, you can at least keep your thumbs
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:41.680]   right where they need to be. It's not like this other one that I had in storage that I was pulling
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:48.000]   out. This is made by verbatim. It's also available on Amazon. And it's much bigger, which is nice.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:56.080]   But the thing is that that key that space bar is not quite as big. So this is a nice it's nice
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:00.880]   because you can really take a risk take a flutter on it, take a risk on it, because this is only about
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:06.560]   30 35 bucks. It's made out of metal. It's well done. It has this really nice little carrying case
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:11.440]   with it. So that you probably won't dent the metal as you're carrying this around. And as I
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:15.760]   said, I'm looking for something that's almost exactly the same size as the iPhone six. So I can
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:22.560]   just basically have this as a sandwich. And so I will continue to look because Lord knows that
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:26.960]   back in the days of Palm, there was some really amazing double folding keyboards out there.
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:32.960]   But for now, this is my pick. If you want if you've got an iPhone six plus coming and you're looking
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:39.440]   for that alluring idea of I want to be able to travel maybe for the day or or an overnight with
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:44.080]   just writing and working on my iPhone six plus and not even take an iPad with me,
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:50.000]   this might be the nicest easily available solution that's out there. Very nice and a good price.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:56.080]   I works under 30. I works a blue folding Bluetooth keyboard live from the crane cam 3000.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:01.360]   The future of video podcast. Thank you very much. Thank you.
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:02.880]   Yeah, man. Do not go.
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:12.320]   I W. A. R. K. Z. Right. Exactly. Okay. Renee Richie. Well, Andy's adjusting the crane
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:15.120]   cam 3000, the future video podcast. I'm going to suggest these javus.
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:20.320]   Good. I want it was a great shot.
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:29.600]   Renee Richie has these fix of the day. So I'm coughing out a little bit here because as I was
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:34.000]   going through all the choices, I realized that all the really exciting stuff is coming to
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.480]   tomorrow. Some of them are slipping out today. Like I got an update for some language apps that
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:44.240]   are already installing widgets. So you can find some iOS updates today, but the flood of them is
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:48.160]   going to come tomorrow and almost every major app that you can imagine is going to have a new
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:51.520]   version available for you and they're going to do widgets. They're going to do keyboards.
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:55.200]   You know, Andy already mentioned a swift key is going to be flexing. It's going to be all sorts
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:59.680]   of fantastic apps. One password has shown off theirs. It's hard for me to keep straight,
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:02.640]   which ones are announced, which ones aren't. So I don't want to make any mistakes. But
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:08.640]   my pick of the week is going to the app store tomorrow. Once you have iOS 8 installed and just
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:12.800]   updating everything and then enjoying all the sharing extensions, the action extensions, the
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:17.520]   widgets, everything that iOS 8 is going to give you with those because it is really going to be
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:22.000]   like having a whole new phone. Very cool. Well, well, you know, we're going to be back next week.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.840]   I'm going to have to pick from all those. Leo's going to be really hard. We'll have
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:33.680]   ML all have, I hope. Did everybody get iPhone ordered but in time? Yep. I'm going to have to wait
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:39.440]   for a while. I mean, I ordered it, but I was late. Somebody said that it's not till Thanksgiving
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:44.080]   now if you order a six plus. I'm not that way that way. I think I want three or four weeks.
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:48.960]   That's depressing. American Thanksgiving. Yeah. We America not even Canadian things.
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:52.320]   American Thanksgiving. I was thinking October. That's not too bad. Oh, wait a minute. Oh,
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:57.280]   November late November. My birthday. Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:05.760]   So we have this issue a lot that where we are working in one place in the world and we need
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:09.360]   something to be edited in another place in the world. And so a lot of times the way we manage
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:13.120]   that is and needs to be done like overnight needs to be done really quickly. So we'll compress this
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:18.720]   down to H.264 and then we'll put it on Dropbox and then someone also pull it down on the other side.
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:24.240]   And the issue is then reconverted it back to Apple ProRes or to DNx, depending on who's
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:28.640]   grabbing it. And so the question is, how do you do that? And a lot of people just use compressor
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:34.480]   to do that. We have found I've been testing this new piece of software called EditReady. It's by
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:40.480]   Divergent Media. And and EditReady is a it's an application that all it does is just convert
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:46.320]   your media back to back to something that you can edit easily with. And so while all these
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:50.480]   applications, we'll talk about this, this is something that and you know I divergent sent it to me to
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:54.640]   test it. I've used almost a lot of their other software. And you know, it took me a little while.
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:58.160]   I've had it for a while. I was like, I don't know if I really need this and everything else. But
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:03.600]   there's two things that have happened that number one is being able to pass that back and forth and
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:07.280]   send it over to someone having reconverted to Apple ProRes and throw it into the rest of the pipeline.
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:12.720]   As well as there are some files that I can't get quick time on a Mac to open. I don't know why
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:18.960]   there are MP4s that are written by appears to be the Adobe, you know, compression suite.
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:23.920]   For some reason, they just won't open. You see they open up and you see just a white screen and
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:28.480]   for you know on Mac on QuickTime 10 and also on QuickTime 7, which we still use.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:34.080]   We can't get it open and we find that EditReady is a great way to convert that. So if that ever
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:40.240]   becomes a problem for you, it saved our our bacon last week. But but anyway, so EditReady is the
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:43.280]   is not very expensive. I can't remember. Sounds like something we need.
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:49.440]   Doesn't it chat? We get files and all kinds of all the time. And when you just mentioned 50 bucks,
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:54.000]   having having some sort of video file that you can't play, I record on a PC. I need to give
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:00.160]   files to someone else all the time that happens. So anything that that all that QuickTime, it'll
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:04.160]   convert back to Apple ProRes. So it doesn't really it's not like we know you just work up or moving
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:08.800]   away from ProRes obviously because we're going to Premiere Pro, but it supports Premiere Pro format
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:13.520]   too. So it's a great little lamp, great little utility.
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:18.320]   What is what is the format for Premiere Pro? I imagine it can read ProRes.
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:26.560]   Maybe we don't need this. It feels like we do need this. I mean currently in our in our Final Cut Pro
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:32.320]   7, we use ProRes for that. We need something like EditReady. And that's why we use the
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:37.040]   Sound Devices recorder because we're recording to ProRes on that. But I believe the Sound Devices we
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:40.640]   bought will record also to an Adobe format that we can use.
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:44.320]   Well I think that Adobe on the Mac, I think if you're using a Mac, I think we'll still
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:46.720]   know PC. No, Apple ProRes. You're going to go to PCs.
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:48.880]   Yeah, we already bought them. Wow.
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:54.880]   A couple of weeks we're going to be fully converted to Premiere Pro on Monster PCs.
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:40:00.800]   I know I shouldn't even be doing Mac break weekly anymore. Here I am with an Android phone and
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:04.480]   our editors use PCs. You're the perfect person to do it Leo.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:09.680]   I love my Macs and I can't wait to get the iPhone.
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:13.840]   I have one company that's a premiere only and another company that's in Final Cut 10 only.
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:15.360]   So it's just depends on what you're doing.
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:19.440]   I couldn't bring myself to buy those cute little Mac Pros for all my editors.
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:24.160]   We really did. We were stuck on the old Mac Pros and we needed new computers. So
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:26.880]   saved us about $60,000.
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:28.800]   Where's that?
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:29.360]   There's that.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:35.600]   I was going to talk about these NFC rings. I was all excited now that the iPhone has NFC.
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:39.760]   You can use these NFC rings to do absolutely nothing with it.
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:48.080]   This was a Kickstarter project that was really cool. The idea is you put an NFC chip in a ring.
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:52.880]   I've got this is the one I like the best because it actually looks like an NFC chip in there.
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:41:01.920]   These range in price around 50 bucks. When I get my Moto X, I'll be able to unlock my Moto X
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:06.640]   just by swiping it over the ring, which is really cool. You can do all sorts of things.
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:12.160]   You can use it to unlock your door if you have a Bluetooth or rather an NFC door lock and that
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:18.000]   kind of thing. But it won't be any good for your iPhone users. So that's not my pick.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:26.160]   In a drawer. Stick it in a drawer. I got a lot of them. NFC ring.com.
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:34.880]   I was so excited. I'll be able to unlock my iPhone. Well, I ordered the new Moto X this morning,
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:38.720]   so I'll work with that. I have 10 rings of the Mandarin, like one French phone.
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:44.080]   Well, you know, you can. I could put one on each hand in each finger. I got 10 rings.
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:45.520]   And you got 10 phones.
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:50.400]   And I do have that many phones, so this is going to work nice. And I'll just have to use a passcode
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:52.800]   for my iPhone. You look like you're ready to screw over Pete Best.
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:42:01.120]   It's so sad that your fingerprints got burnt off in that fire. You can't use that
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:06.080]   fingerprint sensor on the iPhone. Actually, you're right. I don't need an NFC ring.
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:09.120]   I've got a fingerprint. That's right. No, that's a good point. Don't need a finger ring.
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:14.880]   You have a finger. That's you've got a very good point. Our show is over, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:54.720]   We thank you for joining us. Thank you, Andy Inako, Chicago SunTimes. Back to work you go.
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:43:00.720]   You just did you find your Moto X review? It's going to go up probably tomorrow. I'm actually
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:05.680]   finally today. Unfortunately, I got distracted by three different iPhone and iPhone. I love these.
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:14.880]   Gam 3000. The future of video podcasting. Asperate by name. Thank you, Alex Lindsay, for joining us
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:19.440]   for the first time from your new offices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It's a pleasure.
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:26.720]   People want to see our latest experiment with all kinds of interactive events. Go to bit.ly.
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:37.120]   Bit.ly/FCPVUGVUG. So FCPVUG3, our third Final Cut virtual user group. We built on other table.
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:42.000]   I'm really loving these tables. I go next door every day and there's something else.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:49.680]   We've got six Wacom tablets now. It is like John Madden on steroids.
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:58.640]   Anyway, if you want to see what we're doing there, just check out bit.ly/FCPVUG. FCPV is in boy.
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:05.040]   V is in Victor. Virtual user group. And the number three.
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:12.400]   Okay, I got to type that in correctly. FCPVUG and the number three.
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:16.880]   And there it is. It's a oh, this is cool. There's the table.
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:20.000]   Well, if you click on the little, yeah, you can see the table.
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:27.200]   And we have decided that we're going to change it again. So the next one will be different.
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:31.360]   A different table. Can we have the old ones as you as you as you go through those?
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:34.560]   Yeah, you can have the old one. So the, so we're done with it.
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:38.080]   I feel like there's some good plywood in there that we really hate to.
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:42.640]   It's a really nice table. Keith, Keith built it. It's a really, really nice table. It's just that
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:46.160]   we've decided that we need five instead of six because it'd be easier for our camera angles.
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:48.720]   If you click on any of those little buttons on the side, by the way, this is from
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:51.360]   Hazu. It'll take you right to the that question.
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:55.520]   Oh, that's neat. So you can go right to a question in the, oh, that's really, this is nice.
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:59.360]   You can't fight in here. This is the war room.
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:05.440]   It does look like that. It's very strange, lovey and so.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:09.840]   And thank you so much, Renee Richie. I'm more.com. Please tell Peter Cohen. I'm not,
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:12.320]   I'm not hurt. And I hope he's done. He's a big boy. He can take it.
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:15.200]   I love Peter. He's great. He was a great acquisition for imore.com.
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:18.960]   I don't know if you heard, but we have to turn it to Caldwell joining us at the end of the month.
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:21.040]   Sorry. Damn it. I've been trying to hire her for months.
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:24.960]   She said no again and again, is she moving to Montreal though?
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:27.600]   No, she's in Boston where all the cool people are.
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:30.240]   Actually, I guess is she was she what part of the Macworld layoff?
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:33.280]   No, she actually, yeah. Sorry, Andy.
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:36.000]   No, she actually put it in her notice a week before.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.640]   You know, we didn't mention it on the show and it's a great tragedy.
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:46.560]   Macworld magazine, which started with the Mac in 1984, is no longer going to publish a print edition.
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:50.800]   They will stay online at Macworld.com and continue to put content out there.
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:54.400]   But as a result of the loss of the print edition, almost everybody working at Macworld
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:56.800]   has left or lost their job.
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:58.560]   Jason Snell has left serenity left.
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:04.400]   And so there's a lot of people on the market today who are good Mac journalists and I really
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:05.760]   need to get on the horn with them.
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:09.520]   Well, I'm glad you got serenity. Damn it.
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:15.040]   We could work something out. You don't mind if she does podcast, right?
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:17.760]   Well, it's something, you know, it's it's it's serenity's game.
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:19.520]   She makes her own decisions her game.
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:23.920]   I'm sure if you know, I'm sure if you you and Renee wanted to get into a bidding war for her services.
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:26.400]   Right right here live.
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:31.360]   No, actually, this is a chance for I'm more to snap up some really good people,
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:33.120]   some of the best Mac journalists in the world.
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:36.640]   It's a tragedy, but you know print magazine and by the way,
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:42.080]   I'm not so happy because the New York Times blames CNET and Twit for the demise of Macworld.
[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:42.880]   How dare you Leo?
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:49.840]   Well, but the point they made, which was germane was it's hard for a monthly print publication to keep up
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:54.400]   when you've got CNET, Twit and all these other people doing, you know, filing regularly.
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:57.440]   But quick kudos to Jason Snell on the rest of the team because they
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:01.760]   what they very quickly they they very quickly realized that well, we now we really have to be
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:04.400]   a web magazine that also publishes print.
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:06.080]   They weren't just doing incidental stuff.
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:10.000]   So that's why losing so much of the print team, me, there's such a big loss to the brand.
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.400]   So I'm very, very sad to see this happen.
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:13.760]   Yeah. And we've talked to Jason.
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:16.880]   Of course, we're going to see a lot more Jason on our on our network because he just lives down
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:18.880]   the road of peace. And he has his own podcast Network.
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:20.400]   And he wrote a wonderful piece, Chris Breen,
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:22.320]   what a wonderful piece. There's some really good stuff out there.
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:26.640]   It is just a sad moment. We should probably a moment of silence for Macworld.
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:34.160]   Okay, that's it. And now, uh, no, I read Mac, you when you got Macworld free,
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:37.920]   when you like a first edition, you got free with your Mac.
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:40.400]   And that's the first Mac world I got was with my new Mac.
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:44.960]   And I'll never forget them. And they really were a very important part of the magazine for so long,
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:48.400]   as was Mac user magazine, which threw into town a while ago.
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:55.200]   So yeah, that was definitely that was the thing that that I learned what was coming up next.
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:59.040]   You know, I waited for every, everyone loves those magazines.
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:47:59.440]   Yep.
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:00.400]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:03.120]   Thank you for joining us for this edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:07.440]   You got to get back to work now because you know what, right then is over.
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:10.040]   (upbeat music)
[01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:12.620]   (upbeat music)
[01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:15.200]   (upbeat music)
