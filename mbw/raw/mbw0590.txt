[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. I hope you had a wonderful Christmas in Hanukkah and Kwanzaa and Winter Solstice.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   We are not here right now.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   It's an imaginary Mac Break Weekly, except I'm joined by Renee Ritchie from Montreal, Merry Christmas Renee.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   I'm not here, Leo. I'm sitting on a throne of lies. I reek of meat and cheese, but I wanted to wish everybody a happy holidays anyway.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   And Alex Lindsay is in Pittsburgh right now.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   It looks a lot like the Twit studio, but it's amazing things with video. I don't know how he does it.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   He needs things.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Andy Inaco, who's suveeding a turkey even as we speak.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I am trying to see if any of the fudge or cookies that my aunt sent me are...
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Do I have any of it left?
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Probably not, but if so, that's my breakfast.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Nothing like fudge crumbs for breakfast.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Mmm, mmm, good.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Good.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Box shaking.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   So we actually recorded this ahead of time because what we did is we mentioned all last few months, we were looking for best clips from the year.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And we have some fun ones and we thought it would be fun to gather the gang together to introduce those clips.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   In fact, we begin in January.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And remember, this was the 10th anniversary of Steve Jobs' original iPhone announcement.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And I think we all had a good time reliving that fabulous memory you can watch it right now.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Yesterday was a day that will live in infamy January 9th, 2007.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   The birth of this little doohickey here, the iPhone.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   You've got yours, Renee's reaching over to get his.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I charged mine up.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And what's amazing is it still works.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   It's still so pretty, isn't it?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   It's Andrew?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Andrew?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I thought I grabbed for another handheld device with rounded corners and a highlight center button.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   This one came out two or three years before that.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Too many buttons.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Too many buttons.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   They're so easy to...
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Oh, there you go.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   That's the one.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Sorry.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   All of us have this old phone collection lying around.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I was disappointed.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I don't know.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I lost it in a move.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It's in some box.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   There's some box.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I didn't want to give it up.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I was disappointed neither.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I guess even then we knew it was historic.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I was disappointed because I had erased the contents I was hoping to find pictures from 2008.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Two megapixel pictures.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   So I'm trying to remember Alex.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Were you with me in the room when Steve made the announcement?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I know Scott Born was.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I think you were.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I think you were sitting next to me.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Yeah, I think I was.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   It was you on my left.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   You were there.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Scott Born on my right.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I don't remember if Merlin was there or not.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   The original Macbreak team.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Scott, I remember Scott Born had been talking for two years on Macbreak weekly about how
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   he couldn't wait for the iPhone.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.520]   Then he throw his trio on the floor and stomp on it as soon as it was announced and then
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.000]   find out it was six months away.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Yes, I think he did.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Let me get the Steve Jobs iPhone announcement up here for you.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   What a great, I rewatched it again.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Yes.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   What an artist at the height of his powers.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   I think absolutely Steve at his absolute best.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   I'm not sure which will be.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   It's chiefly just.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Here we go.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   James Brown.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   James Brown.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Good God.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Skip ahead a little bit to about a minute in on this.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   This is him just coming out on the stage.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   This is during Macworld Expo.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   So he's at the Moscone West, the giant auditorium there.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   He's throwing with us as 2006.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   It's one minute and a little bit back.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   There be a glowing apple.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Oh, actually no more than one minute in on this.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   You were there.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Go backwards.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   No way back here.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   You were way far ahead.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I don't, maybe not.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Oh, they're still using the same.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   You know what?
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Let me do it.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   You know, template.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Go to, yeah.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   But we didn't do this alone.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Okay.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   So I'm sorry.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I thought you had a cue.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   We did this with lots and lots of lawyers.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Lots of lawyers.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Lots and lots of lawyers.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   So I'm going to pause for refreshment.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Well, I put the link in the show notes.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Thank you.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   There we go.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   What I was going to say is that the real thing is like you could see that he has been dying to give this keynote for a year and a half, two years, and he's just excited as anything, just to finally be able to show this thing off.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   But there's a backstory because we also know that this was a very unlikely to succeed demo and the engineers were all sitting in the front rows with a bottle of liquor.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   And each time the engine, your sponsor for any responsible for any part of the demos section passed successfully, take a shot.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   And they ended up in drunk.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Anything involving a radio was not good.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   There were only a few, a handful of working iPhones.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   There was he had two on stage in case the first one failed.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And there was one exact and only path that Steve can take through the demo that would work.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Anything else would guarantee to crash it.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Here, let's watch.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Because when you know that Steve's presence and centeredness is remarkable given the risk he derritranies about to enter.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Well, he knows he's not going to get fired.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And Apple has been, well, first of all, one's very fortunate if you get to work on just one of these in your career.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Apple's been very fortunate.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   It's been able to introduce a few of these into the world.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   In 1984, we introduced the Macintosh.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It didn't just change Apple.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   It changed the whole computer industry.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Although it's coming up pretty good.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   I'll let him continue to.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   It's fun to watch this.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   A master in his prime.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   He's not ill at this point, right?
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   He's very fun.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   2001, we introduced the first iPod.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And it didn't just change the way we all listen to music.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   It changed the entire music industry.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Yeah, now if you look healthy here.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Well, today, we're introducing three revolutionary products of this class.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   The first one is a widescreen iPod with touch controls.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Let me pause for a moment and ask you, Renee, you weren't in the audience.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   You were probably 12 years old when this happened.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   No, right before I started working at iMOR.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Andy, you must have been, though, right?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   You were going to Mac.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Yeah, I was there.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   So Alex and Andy, we all thought there was going to be an iPhone, right?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   But no confirmation.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Of course, this is back when Apple really had the lid on things.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   So there was no sneaky rumor, right?
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Well, I think I had this feeling when this part happened.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   I was like, "Oh, no, we're not going to get the phone."
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   He was talking about an iPod.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   I was like, "IPod."
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   My screen was iPod.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   It was an incredible build up.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   In fact, the applause at that point is a little lukewarm.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Yeah, they're like, "What?"
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   We thought there would be a phone at this announcement, though, right, Andy?
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   We were pretty sure there was a...
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Yeah, that was pretty much a lock.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   But they had a really good leash down on what the details of that device would be.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   And I don't think anybody was expecting anything like the iPhone.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   They were expecting something much better than something that looked like this, say.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   But no one had the forethought to say, "No, it's going to be an all-touch screen thing.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   There's going to be only one mechanical button."
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   So there's an immense amount of excitement because every...
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   But it's not that, "Oh, well, maybe we'll finally get an update to the iMac this year,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   or maybe we'll get the touch bar on the new MacBook.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   There's going to be a brand new product that we've absolutely never seen before
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   and nobody knows exactly what form it's going to take."
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   There was an immense amount of excitement.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   I think we thought that.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   I do.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   And I think Scott Warren, as I remember, was saying he called it the iPhone,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   but nobody knew even what the name was going to be.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   That just seemed like a placeholder.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   So I'll skip back just a second so you can hear the applause when he says...
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   The first one...
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   is a widescreen iPod with touch controls.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   There's some good cheering there, but I don't know...
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   This is one video of the brand new on that part, so...
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Okay.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   The second...
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   is a revolutionary multi-factor.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   That's the cheering.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And now that confirms what we'd suspected.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   There's a phone.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   But we're still buzzing.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Go ahead, Renee.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   If you think about it for a second, that very first slide took Apple's most successful,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   most profitable product of the day and deprecated it to an app.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   In one sentence.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   That's a good point.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   And the third...
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   is a breakthrough Internet communications device.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   People a little more puzzled at this point.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   But look at that now.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Okay.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Now, by the way, Renee, no one knew at the time whether this was going to be a success or not.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I mean, Apple fans, we were all very excited and wanted it, but there was...
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   even Apple didn't know how big a success it was.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   People thought it wouldn't be an success.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   And one phone on one network for $600.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Right.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Well, we didn't know that yet.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   And the phone companies were telling us how complicated it was.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Go ahead.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   The phone companies were like, "All the phone companies that make phones,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   they're like, "I don't think that Apple understands how complicated
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   the phone is.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Well, they're going to learn."
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   I thought that.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   I thought, "Why would Apple want to get in this awful, horrific business?"
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   So three things.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   A widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   and a breakthrough Internet communications device.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   An iPod.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   A phone.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   And an Internet communicator.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   iPod.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Oh, now we start.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   That's...
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Are you getting it?
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   These are not three separate devices.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   This is one device.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   And we are calling it iPhone.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And that was it.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   That was it.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   I'll never forget that moment.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   And I'm sure Scott porn was at that point and jumped, had leapt to his feet.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   So first, what is APFS?
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Apple.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Apple file system.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   So it's Apple's new file system.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   We've been rumors about this for years.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   There was some talk of them adapting suns,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   ZFS.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   ZFS.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Because there's a whole bunch of advantages to it,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   but that didn't work out for a variety of reasons.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   It's called a cow file system, which is...
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Yes.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   I think copy on right is what it stands for.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   But the basic benefits of these...
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Apple's file system is 30 years old.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   HFS is 30 years old.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   The basic benefit of these newer file systems, Windows doesn't have it.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Apple doesn't have it yet.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   But you could put it on...
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   And even Linux, most of the time you don't use it,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   you might use a cow file system if you use BTRFS.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Or if you use EFS and some Linux is let you do that.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   It'll take snapshots.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   It's big on data integrity.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   It actually looks at every byte of data and does a hash on it to make sure that there's
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   no change.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   So you can kind of guarantee that your data is intact on the hard drive.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   It allows you to do great recovery stuff.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   For data integrity, it's fantastic.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   There's a clone.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Like you said, snapshotting.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   There's all sorts of really, really handy things that just make data integrity and
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   data preservation higher priorities than they were on the original file systems.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   And we just, we need to kind of join the 21st century.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Also with Flash storage.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   And the size of Drive School, so every system has to be tricked to access a terabyte hard drive
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   because the geometry is, they just have to lie to it.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   The controller says, "Yeah, I have 1,024 cylinders.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Yeah, sure."
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   So that's one problem.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   And now we have SSDs and they really don't behave the same way as spinning drives.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Encryption is built in.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   I mean, I guess that's, we've had encryption, but even better encryption.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Right.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Metadata so that if during, if the power goes out, that's what copy on right does.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   If the power goes out during a right, it doesn't matter.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Better than journaling.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   This is like journaling plus directory sizing is fast.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   It's just a big, it's a big improvement.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   The underlying thing is that all this is stuff that you get for free by virtue of the fact
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   that you're running this file system as opposed to, okay, let's have clever engineers implement
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   these features on top of the existing file system.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   It's really, it's baked right in.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   And that means that not only is it not only is it going to be more reliable and also more
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   accessible to more apps, but also if something, God forbid, does go wrong, it's easier to
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   diagnose and fix.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   So this is just a big win from start to finish in long delayed.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   It is designed for SSDs, so it kind of makes sense that you'd use it on iOS because all
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   iOS devices are using SSDs.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Also, iOS is a much more controlled environment.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   And so they get Apple has a better idea of how people, how developers might screw things
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   up by trying to be as clever as Apple's own engineers.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.200]   So this is a really good way to let's start off in the shallow end of the pool before
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.000]   we implement it worldwide on the Mac OS.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   It's easier to see target.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   It supports trim natively and does it all the time.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.500]   So when you delete a file or you reclaim your reclaimed free space, it trims immediately,
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.500]   which speeds up the SSD considerably.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:24.080]   And there's all sorts of theoretical advantages, even on iOS, where things like backups, the
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.880]   way backups are handled, the way cloud backups are handled, you can do incremental backups.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.280]   I mean, there's just this significant advantages, which is as follows as to me even on something
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.560]   like the Apple Watch, which is why I think they're going from their smallest device all
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.800]   the way up to their biggest.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.560]   So they told us at WWDC that this was coming.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.560]   Yes.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.000]   I just, I'm surprised it's coming.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.800]   I just really didn't think that it's just always coming, but never quite a ride.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.620]   I just thought it was going to be another one of those promises.
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.620]   And it's not Apple.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:53.220]   I mean, every company's done this, you know, Apple teased this with ZFS a couple of years
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.220]   ago, maybe Apple.
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.020]   Or storage, other teas.
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.020]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.780]   So it's better for bigger drives.
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:02.900]   You got snapshots, which is really a valuable backup.
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.700]   Much more efficient.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.300]   Here's this kind of interesting one.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.380]   Space sharing allows multiple file systems to share the same underlying free space on
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:14.460]   a physical volume, which I guess would only be valuable.
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:20.340]   If you're using a virtual machine or, I don't know, I don't know exactly how that would
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.080]   be used.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.360]   This is really, really great.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.880]   I'm just thrilled to see this coming.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.340]   Got protection as far as files.
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.340]   So you did it.
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.840]   Is your phone okay?
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.320]   Yeah, phone is fine.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.560]   I mean, like, I feel like, you know, we have to take the punch first just in case because
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.600]   you can warn people if there's a problem or you can reassure them if there's not.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.240]   Well, but yeah, it's working fine.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.140]   Well, in this case, I'm not doing it because you're taking the punch.
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.140]   Yes.
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.140]   So you're taking the punch for me too.
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.140]   Yeah.
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:58.380]   So, and again, like this is a way more targeted, way more controlled, way fewer variable environment
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.380]   to test it on.
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.380]   It's something like a Mac.
[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:01.380]   People can do all sorts of things.
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:08.620]   When they announced this, they had all these big like warnings at WWDC because developers
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:15.400]   have been able to provisionally do this on their Macs since June.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.940]   All sorts of, you know, don't do this, don't do that.
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:19.940]   Make sure you back up.
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.100]   It won't work with this.
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:26.880]   It doesn't work with the Apple file, you know, the AFP.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:33.660]   So, and they said 2017 as a bootle file system on the Mac OS.
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:37.420]   Does the new Mac OS beta have it?
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:42.100]   I can't tell because it's not in the notes and I wasn't able to install it because I'm
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.100]   using it right.
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.060]   It would be in the, they would make a deal out of it.
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.060]   If it, if it did, I would.
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.540]   Yeah, I think you'd see warnings all over the place.
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.540]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.660]   Like this is, this is going to be horrible.
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:54.140]   And I would actually prefer them to test it on something like before they roll it out.
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:18:00.060]   At WWDC, they promised non-destructive upgrades from HFS plus to APFS for all boot volumes
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.580]   when it ships.
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:02.580]   Yeah.
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:10.260]   So, and if you want to go back, you have to format the hard drive, which will erase all
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.260]   your data.
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.980]   But this is like the kind of cool thing that we've been talking about for years and that
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.300]   there is no obvious next.
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.580]   Like Apple, Apple can't get stuck again because there's no magical operating system and founder
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.580]   to go and get back.
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.500]   They have to move their technology stack forward.
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.460]   And even though they're keeping OS 10 and iOS very different, sorry, Mac OS and iOS very
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.020]   different on the interface level, there's a whole swath of technology that both of them
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.180]   already share and they can make that technology better.
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:37.720]   So whether it's Swift or as Apple File System, they can work on these giant projects and
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:43.340]   roll them out at a multi-platform scale and really start to, because HFS plus, like you
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:49.300]   said, it was like the MacGyver level of gum and toothpicks holding it together.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:53.020]   And this really helps them push forward again for another decade.
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:19:01.220]   One thing missing that's in ZFS is kind of native low-level RAID capabilities.
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:08.500]   One of the reasons I love ZFS is you can easily add a volume and turn on RAID.
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:16.380]   Apple says there's no file RAID built into APFS, but you can use Apple's own RAID with
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.380]   it.
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:22.980]   So that's just something that's something that's a little different from ZFS.
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:27.380]   This is all really good news and something to look forward to.
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:32.500]   So let us know how good it is on the Apple.
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.100]   Good luck to you.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.260]   And I hope you and the guys are fine.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.340]   I'm checking to see if my photos are all backwards.
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.900]   Yeah, really.
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.580]   Who knows what's going to happen.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.500]   So big news.
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.500]   Apple has updated the MacPro.
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.500]   Ish.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.500]   Ish.
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.500]   Ish.
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.900]   So what do they reset the counter?
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.500]   Yeah, they reset the counter.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.860]   What do they do to the MacPro?
[00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:58.300]   Can you reset the counter?
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.460]   I mean, they're giving you what were the upgrades essentially at the base level price
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.460]   now.
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.020]   So it's not like they didn't put the latest eons in.
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.220]   They didn't put the latest GPUs in.
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.540]   It's just the higher end version.
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.180]   But they at least updated.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.380]   I mean, it's still the trash can.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.620]   We're not saying anything about that.
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.660]   But they at least updated the graphics card.
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.020]   But you're saying it's not the latest, latest stuff yet.
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.220]   I have to double check it.
[00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.780]   But it looks to me like what you could previously get is upgrades.
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.220]   It's like the number of cores went up.
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:28.500]   But I don't think they're using-- they're not using anything approaching what AMD is shipping
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.500]   now.
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.260]   And I think they mentioned this in the-- well, the group of missions in the article is that
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:36.460]   they sort of got trapped by their own thermal core in that that machine requires the triple
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.900]   balance of a CPU and two-- sorry, a CPU and two GPUs.
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.540]   And they were betting heavily that the two GPU model would take off.
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:47.260]   The general computing would take off that things like OpenCL would take off and turns
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.580]   out not so much.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.660]   And you can't just throw a giant Nvidia 1080 card in here because it would destroy the
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.340]   thermal balance in the machine.
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.940]   So they went the wrong direction.
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.340]   And it's going to take them a while to recover.
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.940]   So this is sort of the highest end they can put in the current casing for the same base
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:01.940]   price now.
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:05.380]   So basically what they did is they dropped the price of 1,000 bucks on the high end,
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.220]   but the highest end model.
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.220]   That's a new style of upgrade.
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.540]   It's just like, hey, we gave you the same thing for less.
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:23.060]   The 39.99 model with the 8-core BTO and the dual D700 GPUs is the high end stock configuration.
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:31.260]   And the former high end model with the 6-core E5 Xeon and the dual D500s and 16 gigs of RAM
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.100]   is now the base model, 29.99.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.980]   So you can go as high as 8-core E5.
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.460]   But as you point out, Renee, that's still the E5.
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:41.460]   That's the processor that--
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.460]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.060]   --shipped three years ago with the original Mac Pro.
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.220]   The D700--
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.420]   I don't think the processor's such a big deal for people, honestly.
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:55.940]   I mean, I think it's the GPUs.
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.580]   The three-year-old GPUs are ancient--
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:04.340]   Oh, and also if you're talking about a pro platform, really, AMD--
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.140]   I don't know.
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.780]   There's a lot of us that don't really consider AMD a pro platform.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.940]   I mean, they do have some pro cards, but Nvidia really owns that market.
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:17.460]   There's just a lot of different definitions of what constitutes a pro user.
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:21.380]   And I think where a lot of people were being left behind is the point in which you're
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:25.340]   buying a box where you're expecting that you'll be able to make it faster, where you need
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.140]   to make it faster.
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.780]   So you can't just plop another GPU, where you need it.
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.820]   You can't just plop a CPU upgrade where you need it.
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:36.660]   You really have to upgrade it the way that Apple was planning for you to upgrade this--
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.100]   the Quaker Road's box style Mac Pro.
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.060]   And this was just not a machine that was designed to do that.
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:46.780]   So, like I said, one of the money quotes from Craig Federighi was, "We boxed ourselves
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.020]   in with a round design."
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.020]   It's really--
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.020]   Yeah, that's funny.
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.340]   But thank you Phil Schiller for innovating his ass off.
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.180]   I think some people have long memories.
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.180]   I have a long memory because I do--
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.180]   I bought one!
[00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:07.540]   I'm saying that of the five people who were at that table, two of them decided to say,
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.860]   "Turns out that can't innovate my ass, turned out to be exactly correct."
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.460]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.020]   So this was unprecedented, I think.
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.020]   Correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:21.260]   But when an Apple announced the new Mac Pro, I think they knew immediately that there would
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:26.940]   be howls of pain and that the immediate conclusion we and everybody else would jump to is that's
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:27.940]   it.
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.540]   Apple's done with the Macintosh.
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:31.540]   Look at this.
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.500]   This is their idea of a pro update.
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:39.620]   So in an unprecedented-- I think, unprecedented move, they had a journalist come to Cupertino
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.580]   and at a roundtable where they explained.
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:49.060]   They explained to them why this is the best they could do right now.
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.820]   Yeah, they really did outline why.
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:57.940]   Some of the reasons why you didn't see that many updates because, like Renee said, it's
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:05.460]   a triangle inside there with different subsystems on each side of that triangle, vertical triangle.
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:11.260]   And the idea is that each one of these sides of the triangle, as this computer was engineered,
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.300]   can't-- has to be generating about the same amount of heat as the others.
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:18.940]   So it's not-- wasn't going to be as easy as if the weaknesses, the GPUs, if they just--
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:23.860]   they guessed that the secret to greater performance is going to be distributed processing across
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:29.620]   multiple GPUs when it turns out that the direction that everyone was going since 2013 was one
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:33.060]   big beefy CPU, a GPU that keeps getting updated.
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:38.020]   And so they couldn't plop in one big beefy GPU because now one side of the triangle is hot
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:42.620]   enough to fry three eggs on and the other two, with all the passive thermal stuff, can't
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:46.300]   really get cooked, good, colder in order to compensate for it.
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.180]   So they were absolutely stuck.
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.180]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:50.180]   Thank you.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:53.260]   I am mere $3,000 and three years later.
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.260]   Thank you.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.780]   Yeah, there's a lot of good stuff.
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.820]   This is why I've always been hoping that Apple would be more open.
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:00.820]   This is right.
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:01.820]   Well, they had to.
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:02.820]   There was no choice at this point.
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:09.220]   I mean, there was no reason for anybody to assume that Apple has or had faith in the Macintosh
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:14.540]   if they're not updating the Mac Pro for substantially in three years.
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:19.740]   They come up with a new-- no updates to the iMacs, no real updates to the Mac Mini update
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:25.660]   to the MacBook Pro that makes it more like a MacBook Air than a special MacBook Pro.
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:30.980]   Unless you-- in that vacuum, people are going to make whatever decisions that then speculations
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.140]   that they have to.
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.060]   Silence is not an answer.
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:35.380]   It's like the life of the citizens.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.540]   We tried doing nothing and that hasn't worked.
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:42.820]   So you have to say that, OK, here is exactly why you haven't seen in the updates and it
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:47.140]   has nothing to do with how we feel about the Macintosh just because, again, we put ourselves
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:48.940]   into a corner with this design.
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:55.260]   Well, if you want to judge how this new briefing strategy worked and you need to go no farther
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.940]   than the Fox News of Cupertino daring fireball, which--
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.980]   OK, that's very low.
[00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.540]   No, I think it's exactly right.
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.540]   I hate to tell you.
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.860]   No, no, no, no.
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.500]   I challenge that.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.660]   I read all five.
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:15.060]   First of all, Grimmer was the only one to specify here are the names of the other people
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.020]   who are at that table and also linking to all of them.
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.780]   So it was easy for someone to click all the links and read all the different coverage.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:22.780]   Yeah, but--
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:23.980]   And they're up to five, they're two or three or three.
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.460]   Here's his lead.
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.580]   Let's not beat around the bush.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.780]   I have great news to share.
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.380]   Well, that is good news.
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:33.620]   Yeah, well, OK.
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:34.780]   I guess it is good news.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:35.780]   I thought he'd come back with a word.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:40.100]   He buries the part about, but this is going to be another year or so.
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.380]   It's like comparing anybody to Delta Airlines.
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.820]   I have to say, OK, stop.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:44.660]   All right, that's mean.
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:45.700]   All right, good.
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:46.380]   It was mean.
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.700]   I admit, it was a cheap shot.
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.740]   No, but for me, his was the easiest to follow.
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.900]   A lot of them had very small articles or short articles that they were broken up a lot.
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:54.020]   And I find them really hard to follow.
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.460]   John, to me at least, was very well organized and narrated.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:00.340]   And I sort of put you at-- not exactly the table with them, but in the table-ish.
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:01.860]   So who was at this table?
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.940]   Who were the five people at the table?
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.820]   John Paz from Buzzfeed.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:07.980]   TechCrunch was there.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.220]   Yeah, TechCrunch, MapHans Arena.
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.220]   TechCrunch Buzzfeed.
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.660]   And Lance Olaf from Buzzfeed.
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:12.380]   Mashable.
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.380]   OK.
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.340]   Interesting group.
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:20.100]   And also, again, that's why that's a big part of the story, to find out who else was
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.740]   at that table, given that all these people weren't--
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.420]   you don't have the New York Times, you don't have the Wall Street Journal.
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:29.540]   These are clearly people, particularly Gruber and TechCrunch.
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:34.340]   And these are sites that are really well positioned to talk directly to developers, directly to
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.340]   pro users.
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:40.260]   So clearly, Apple wanted a certain segment of the Mac community to hear about this.
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.140]   This wasn't a stock price saving phase.
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:45.620]   This wasn't a part of the marketing push for the Mac.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:51.180]   This was-- so it really adds credibility to the idea that we really want to try to say
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:55.380]   that anybody who is thinking of switching away from the Mac specifically because they
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:59.500]   don't think that we're supporting a pro Mac users, at least give us another year or
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.380]   so to come through and promise we've made.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.380]   I think it's really--
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.140]   I think the griddle is getting pretty hot for Apple.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:11.100]   I think that the issue is I have never heard-- not just me, I've never heard so many pro
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:15.340]   computer users talking about moving to a PC and trying to figure out how they're going
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.780]   to do that and trying to figure out what that's going to look like.
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:23.340]   I mean, to have that many people concerned about moving, I mean, this is a core audience.
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:27.380]   And if you don't think that it affects Apple's overall brand, look at when they switch to
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:35.520]   the Final Cut and Conan O'Brien's edit crew in protest made a whole-- made fun of Final
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.520]   Cut.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:41.780]   And that definitely affects the overall brand for the core audience who is deeply tied into
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.340]   the entertainment industry to be jumping chip.
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.380]   -Ena, freeze now works for it.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.940]   -Go ahead, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:51.100]   -So I think it's also pretty clear that Apple did not want to have to do this.
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.260]   This was not in their plans.
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:56.460]   My guess is they started working on these a while ago and it was kind of funny because
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.660]   last year there were articles about Apple abandoning the Mac.
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:02.820]   They've been working on this new MacBook Pro and the new Pro upgrades to the iMac for
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:03.820]   a while.
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:07.180]   And if I had to guess, I'm thinking that these are delayed-- not delayed, but they're not
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.980]   going to be ready anywhere nearly as quickly as Apple hoped.
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.980]   And that sort of fed into this situation because if they could have announced the spring, the
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.620]   new Mac Pro, the new modular Mac Pro, then a lot of these problems, they don't go away
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.940]   but they don't have to have meetings like this one to sort of say, "Don't worry, we
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:20.940]   have new Mac Pros on the way."
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.700]   It's more like, boom, here's the new Mac Pro.
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.700]   We know you've been waiting a while but we think is worth it.
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.740]   And when you start to find out that it's not going to be ready for a variety of reasons
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:32.860]   until next year, you've got to decide, are you going to keep quiet and risk exactly what
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:33.940]   Alex is talking about?
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.940]   People not just discussing switching to Windows but actually switching to Windows or you're
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:42.380]   going to step up and say, "Look, we don't usually discuss future plans but we have them
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:46.620]   and we're not abandoning the Mac and try to do as much damage control and perception
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.700]   work as you can do."
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:53.020]   And also, they have to be careful of not rushing it either because then you end up with the
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:59.980]   Mac Pro which is a lot of Pro users like myself are pretty upset with.
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:01.860]   We don't want a whole bunch of USB-C's.
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:02.860]   Just USB-C's.
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.900]   There are things that this makes a whole lot more complicated.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:10.900]   And if you want a fast laptop and you're a business user, it's probably great but for
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:16.740]   Pro users, it's not necessary, a large number of them, it wasn't great.
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:21.820]   So I think it was a mixture of a false start on the laptop along with no updates on the
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.180]   hardware on the desktop.
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.500]   Created a situation where they had to respond.
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:31.300]   So I apologize because I really didn't do this very well.
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:36.780]   Let me give you the news because we're analyzing it and I don't think I really coherently stated
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:37.780]   the news.
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:43.380]   The news is, and I'll do it in Groobers Order, everybody really led with the fact that Apple
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:48.380]   is going to rethink the Mac Pro and come up with a new design.
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:53.220]   It sounds suspiciously like the cheese grater, a modular design that will allow upgrades
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:59.620]   to the CPUs and the GPUs and other hardware on a regular basis.
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:05.940]   The bad news is the existing Mac Pro's get a kind of a non-update, update, a minor update
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.660]   including no USB-C, no Thunderbolt 3.
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:17.540]   Really no change at all to the Mac Pro form factor and it still won't support the 5K display.
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:25.020]   The other bad news is these new Mac Pro's won't be out for some reason until next year.
[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:32.220]   They are going to ship new iMacs later this year with Pro configurations but the iMac
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.220]   isn't upgradable either.
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:38.140]   It's the reason Alex said they want to get them right and getting them right now is not
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.100]   as important to them as getting right at this point.
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.140]   How could that wait a minute though really?
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.060]   How come it takes that long?
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:49.860]   Because I think they were going one direction and realized that that one direction might
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:50.860]   have been more.
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:55.420]   So you're saying if you started today it would take you to next year to come up with a redesign
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.420]   Mac Pro?
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:57.420]   Yeah.
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.420]   Why?
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:59.420]   Obviously so.
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:03.820]   Because they're not just talking about mass production of hardware and then refitting a
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:09.660]   factory and then they built a whole factory around this round trash can.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:14.100]   So now having something else that they're going to have to actually produce.
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.420]   By the way I would have been totally happy if they had left the cheese grater in place.
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.020]   I'm going to call BS on all of this.
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:23.500]   It took them three years to figure out they couldn't upgrade the Mac Pro and they only
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:28.780]   decided in the spring of 2017 oh shoot we realized we can't upgrade this thing we better
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.380]   work on a different model.
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:31.380]   It took them that long.
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.380]   I call BS.
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:34.020]   I don't buy any of this.
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.020]   I don't think this is going to happen.
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.020]   They were pretty candid about that.
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:39.820]   This is trying to keep those people that Alex is talking about who are about to leave the
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:46.060]   fold in sustainable suspended animation for another year.
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:49.260]   That only pushes off the inevitable another year if they don't come up with something.
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:53.300]   And I think that I think the opportunity for Apple if they really want to hear the Pro
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:58.620]   users they're going to they're going to give us something that is rack mountable that is
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:04.020]   modular that allows us to swap out just about every component you know there but do it in
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:08.140]   an Apple way which is that when it's rack mounted it looks great.
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:11.340]   When you slide things in and out it's not a bunch of little wires that you're all doing
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:15.260]   a whole bunch of crazy stuff with it's actually you're just actually sliding things in and
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.260]   out.
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:21.420]   You know those are all the opportunities that Apple has to show their design skill is not
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:28.260]   to ignore what works for professionals it is to find a way to make that experience elegant.
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:33.260]   You don't think that there's a significant rinse this is vaporware and Apple's just trying
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:38.460]   to keep you from switching to Windows for another year and then they're going to say
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:42.340]   you know what we figured out it's the iPad Pro that you really want.
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:44.260]   No but the problem makes it much harder to do.
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:47.180]   They don't want that and if they did that all they're going to end up with maybe maybe
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.940]   it's pushing you down another year but if they pushed if they did that what you'd end
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:53.580]   up with is just a bunch of people because there's just a bunch of people not buying a lot of
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:56.220]   computers and they're going to make a decision in another year maybe.
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.820]   Well I agree you know you're pushing your kick in a can down and in a year you're going
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:02.940]   to have even more angry people if you don't come up with something so.
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:06.620]   I just think I just think that would be an insane thing to do for on Apple so I don't
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:07.620]   think they're they're they're they're.
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:11.060]   I think the same thing to do is to make a new Mac Pro and not updated for three years
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:15.300]   and then and three years later say whoops we can't make it this can upgrade this so we're
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.900]   going to start over.
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:17.900]   That's insane.
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.340]   That'll make it four years.
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:23.460]   I think Renee was about to say what I'm about to say so when I say I think you were
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:24.460]   about to say.
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.460]   I say it then.
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:26.460]   All right.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.780]   Well there's a couple of things so maybe I'll hit on one of them but one is like I think
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:32.380]   Federique spoke to this where he said that it was a mixture of them trying to fix it
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:35.900]   not getting it right and I'll go as far as to say denial and I think he might have used
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.820]   that word to where they're trying to fix the Mac Pro that they have to see what they
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:42.180]   can do with it and then they have other priorities and it's like any human thing.
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:43.540]   Apple's a remarkably human company.
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.540]   You can distract.
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.540]   Oh I've got to get that basement that deck said done you know I've got to get the but
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.660]   look I have to fix this car and you're very good at ignoring problems but that does not
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:54.820]   make them go away and I think that they tried to ignore and a little bit fix this but they
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:58.260]   had iMacs and they can say iMac sell better we'll focus on those and yeah we'll get back
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:01.100]   to fixing the Mac Pro and oh look we got to get the iPhone out and yeah we'll get to the
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:05.300]   Mac Pro and that just it becomes years and years and the pressure and the problem builds
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.460]   and builds and at a certain point I think probably a year or so ago they realized that
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:12.220]   you know that was just going no further and they started working on something new.
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.500]   How long does it take Windows?
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.500]   It's manufactured.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:18.500]   So it's not long that is that well so Leo it's not just that is that they have to get
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.860]   the new iMac out then you the new display out the new iPhone out the new iPad out the iPad
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:26.620]   didn't ship yet the iPad Pro update didn't ship yet and they have to get the Pro out so
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:30.780]   they're building this in amongst the turbulence of getting all those other things shipped.
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:35.220]   It's unprecedented I think it's unprecedented for Apple to communicate like this and so
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.700]   I do want to commend them for at least communicating.
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:42.820]   It's also unprecedented for them to admit make such a huge this is a huge admission of
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:47.500]   failure and mismanagement and mismanagement.
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.300]   Have you seen this?
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:55.620]   This is a great new YouTube channel the unofficial apple hard drive subtitled God help my heart
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:59.980]   I mean unofficial Apple archive God help my hard drive.
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:09.380]   It is loaded if you're an Apple fan as I'm sure you all are with old Apple ads videos.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:13.500]   This is this is really a treasure trove.
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:19.620]   Steve Jobs talking about the blue box story Apple's power Mac commercial which one should
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.940]   we there's so many good ones here.
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:26.580]   I don't know where to start you have a favorite you'd like to see again.
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.220]   Here's to the crazy ones.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:33.940]   Oh yeah that would be fun to see again let me see if that's here you want to watch it.
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:37.420]   Oh you know what this is the bet so there's a Richard Dreyfus version which is the one
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:44.260]   that aired on TV but famously Steve Jobs went into the voice booth to record it originally
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:49.220]   so this is here's to the crazy ones with Mr. Jobs doing the narration.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:55.940]   Here's to the crazy ones.
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.700]   The misfits.
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.540]   The rebels.
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.580]   The troublemakers.
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:05.180]   The round pegs in the square holes.
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.340]   The ones who see things differently.
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:14.020]   They're not fond of rules and they have no respect for the status quo.
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:20.100]   You can quote them disagree with them glorify or vilify them.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:25.300]   About the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things.
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:29.980]   They push the human race forward.
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:33.700]   While some may see them as the crazy ones.
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:34.700]   We see genius.
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.140]   Yeah this is all a great mission to make.
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:41.940]   Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world.
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:44.540]   Are the ones who do.
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:49.020]   That's hard not to get shows when you see that right here.
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:53.100]   Yeah that's just again a brilliant mission statement and one that I hope that we keep
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.980]   seeing over and over again.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:38:03.580]   If you do if you do a get info on the text edit and look at the sample document.
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:06.940]   Sorry the opening text of that is actually part of the icon.
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.980]   That's how important the user was.
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.900]   Yeah unfortunately that every I wish that Apple every.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.140]   Apple video site was we're still up.
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:17.940]   It's actually went down almost immediately after we talked about it.
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:19.620]   Yeah it's gone.
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:24.740]   That's why if you love an app you run down and you download that YouTube video.
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:25.740]   Get it quickly.
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:26.740]   Yeah.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.900]   Coming up lots more but before we do that I want to thank our sponsor.
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.180]   We had a last minute edition to the show and we're thrilled.
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:38.540]   Folks that go to webinar said hey we'd like to we'd like to support Mac break weekly.
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:39.540]   We love go to webinar.
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:40.540]   I've used it.
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:44.820]   I gave a webinar on protecting your teenager online things like that.
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:48.580]   What's great about go to webinars you could do these live and you can have from one to
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:53.140]   six presenters you can see their faces but you can also see their screens or an app or
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.900]   you know presentation whatever but then you can have kind of unlimited number of people
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:01.740]   watch typically you're going to have hundreds maybe thousands watched initially but the webinars
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:05.300]   recorded and then it's got a long life.
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:09.420]   So this is great for company training for a presentation you would be giving over and
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:13.900]   over again the recorded ones are just as interactive as the originals because you can
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:19.620]   create 20 up to 20 polls per webinar with up to 20 questions per poll and you can do those
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:23.900]   ahead of time and you probably should make some just because it engages the audience.
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:27.100]   It gives you some idea about them you can use it to generate leads things like that but
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:31.420]   you can also use the polls in real time as you're giving a presentation if you're if you're
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.700]   thinking maybe this is too complicated to people want to know more you could throw a
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:39.660]   poll up really quickly and easily and easy is the primary word with go to webinar it's
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:45.660]   easy to start a webinar they have custom email invitations you can automatically request
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:50.820]   confirmation so you know who's showing reminders to because even after people say yes often
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:54.380]   they forget so you want to remind them they have automated email templates that make the
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:59.020]   whole thing a snap and you can do that on your phone it's completely mobile friendly
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:04.860]   iOS and Android schedule webinar and edit a session but most importantly track your performance
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:09.540]   and I love the analytics and go to webinar you can always find out you know I'll click
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:15.580]   away from qualified leads or metrics and feedback that helps you make the webinar better next
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:21.980]   time around it's all encrypted 128 bit AES end to end point to point which is fabulous
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:27.740]   let's see number one in customer satisfaction do I need to go on let me just tell you where
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:33.860]   to go turn your next presentation into a conversation with go to webinar for more information visit
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:43.420]   go to webinar.com/podcast that's go to webinar.com/podcast we thank go to webinar for adding
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:50.300]   a little holiday cheer to our end of year episode let's go on this was a hack remember
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:59.500]   this when a hacker group named the Turkish crime family yes claimed that they were they
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:03.340]   had act what was it Renee they had access to a whole bunch of iCloud accounts right
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:07.700]   yeah and they wanted money to not turn them over and what did Apple say here's some Turkish
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:15.620]   delights yeah they had access to some third party something really yeah it didn't in fact
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:19.180]   Apple didn't I don't think as far as we know he didn't even talk to him they just ignored
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:26.740]   it and nothing bad happened right here's the story the Turkish crime family the best
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:30.980]   nay hacker group name in in the world they're probably from north London which means yeah
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:36.180]   they're from England yeah they're from England they're not a family boy I'm gonna call him
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:43.900]   family no I'm sorry I always end up putting me on the side Mary Poppins anyway so April
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:49.140]   7th they said they had more than half a billion now they went up to like 637 million I clap
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:54.780]   out accounts and they said if Apple if you don't pay us we're gonna wipe phones and wipe
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:42:00.460]   Max and I haven't heard any word about wiped phones and wipe Max and so the question is
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:10.100]   was this all BS or did Apple pay the Turkish crime family said Apple paid they told SC magazine
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:18.340]   in the UK that that they got a Bitcoin payment of four hundred thousand dollars it was something
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:24.740]   was paid and it was a 401 Bitcoin early in the evening of April 7th it was from an obfuscated
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:32.980]   Bitcoin ID so we have no proof that it was 10 we have no proof it was Tim or Apple but
[00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:40.380]   wow that's kind of interesting it sounds like maybe Apple after downplaying this all actually
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:43.380]   paid the Turkish crime family which would not be a good president would you pay because
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:46.660]   like you pay them and then they're just gonna release it like you have no terrible precedent
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:54.380]   terrible precedent I doubt it I doubt it also they they stick they really stuck their their
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.100]   neck out saying Apple's took their neck out saying that we're not gonna you know this is
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:01.260]   not how we do business right so they would have they would have had the ability to start
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:05.140]   just on the shnide saying you know what we we check one of the sofas and one of the lounges
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:09.420]   we found six hundred thirty thousand dollars so we pay the 400,000 and bought pizza for
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:13.780]   everybody we can consider the case closed but again once you go and say that we're definitely
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:20.020]   not gonna do that yeah you better not do that yeah.
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:24.500]   A number of people pointed out well one you know if you really wanted to prove you could
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:28.980]   do what do they do in James Bond movies right if you as a supervillain want to prove that
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:33.860]   you could blow up the world you do it you do a little demo they could have white defoner
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:38.860]   to right and said oh so what happens is coincidentally the Turkish crime family is throwing a big
[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:45.380]   party that night and they rent a car they make a big idea and he gets an invitation to
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:51.380]   that party no it's because it's Tim I was taken not stirred yeah and he infiltrates it
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:58.500]   and Johnny does some kung fu and gets the list and they that's how it works right so a Turkish
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:02.840]   crime family spokesman told SC magazine the funds might take a while to transfer no funds
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:11.560]   had appeared in the wallet that they proposed however they did post a payment of 401.731
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:19.680]   bitcoins in the early evening of April 7 so where did that come from did apple pay the
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:27.320]   politicians politicians terrified us you can actually release this maybe I don't know
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:31.080]   everything we wanted to ban turns out we did it and it's in iCloud and we're to prepare
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:37.320]   for a terrifying great article by Troy Hunt who is a Microsoft regional director and MVP
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.560]   how here's where the apple account hackers are threat here's where the apple accounts
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:47.680]   that hackers are threatened white came from and you know he's talking about the dump that
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:57.280]   Zak Whitaker and ZD net got of sample data and and going through it's actually really
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:02.440]   fun to read how this did by the way the top 10 passwords in this data number one football
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:14.800]   95 with 2,345 a damn it I'm vulnerable Disney one and 800 was 1270 accounts blank was 841
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:21.400]   accounts I love people and their passwords 123456 was 773 accounts you know these people
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:25.760]   could be wiped I mean really if your password is one one one one one one one one one one
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:32.760]   one one one one of the best ways to get somebody to choose a better password is just to simply
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:43.240]   email them or text them a link to that doc that says here is in 2017 here's what the 100 most
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:48.040]   common passwords as reported by system administrators were and you don't have to shame them but say
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:52.880]   if your password is on this list realize that you're not if I have that this access to this list and
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:57.440]   you're not if I have that this access to this list and you have access to this list the bad
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:02.120]   people also have access to this list it's really funny when I was setting up my iPhone after
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:05.760]   updating I wiped an iPhone and set it up as new and it asked me for a pin code and I was in a
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:09.120]   rush just to get screenshots so I just typed in one one one one it goes I'm sorry that's a
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:13.120]   commonly used pin code I'm like I just need to take screenshots to to to to to to that sorry that's a
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:17.720]   commonly used and because I'm a stressful situation for me to find something that I just lose
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:22.560]   respect for you really yes so it's not going to stay that way I just had a document the
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:28.280]   no no I'm saying I'm saying that's where the phone says I think that you all sorry time out I'll
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:34.720]   let you I'll let you read Troy's article and follow his logic but the conclusion is the the
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:38.640]   the it's see he says it seems most likely the list of Apple accounts wouldn't isn't in fact
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:43.720]   hundreds of millions it's instead less than 53,000 he has good logic behind this and it's
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:51.160]   predominantly compromised of evany accounts and a small handful of others but so that's
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:58.360]   interesting you know once you put it through the put it through his funnel you know it's a
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:05.320]   it's a much smaller number nevertheless I mean even if it were 53,000 people Apple would I think
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:12.520]   be concerned about this I don't know anyway there's the Turkish crime family by the way good
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:18.680]   looking fella good looking fella probably not the Turkish crime family I should point out there you
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:23.800]   go that's a much better that's a that's a much better Turkish crime we're looking at their Twitter
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:31.440]   Twitter profiles Apple had to invite four or five hand-picked journalists to the campus so that they
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:37.840]   could had in hand explain yeah you know how we introduced that Mac Pro about being so awesome
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:44.640]   maybe we screwed up on that one we're sorry about that and so they've made a really really big attempt
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:52.720]   to adjust that one than WWD C keynote by talking about brand new Pro Max and upgrades to upgrades
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.680]   old ones now the ones that we're already familiar with the iMacs and the Mac Pro's they all got
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:02.880]   the expected some generation KB like processors some upgrades to GPU some upgrades to disk speeds
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:10.000]   but obviously the centerpiece the centerpiece the whole thing was a brand new black were space gray
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:17.200]   black enough in my office after with my lighting you'll be black enough the iMac Pro with up to
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:26.520]   with a 27 inch 5k display up to an eight up to 18 cores of xenon xenon CPUs radion Vega graphics up
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:34.920]   to 11 teraflops the CPU process up to 22 teraflops 128 gigs of RAM now this was the one audible gasp
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:40.400]   for some reason in the audience that 120 gigabytes of RAM they I think even the speaker was kind of
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:47.120]   this was hit back by that as well as I think four terabytes of internal graphics also they I think
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:51.920]   they made it when they showed you the cutaway they also made a big point of saying we decided
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:58.160]   that maybe fans are a good idea like having some fans some sort of active cooling system so that
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:02.200]   I don't know three years later we'd have to apologize to people because we couldn't put more
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:08.160]   process more powerful processors because our passive cooling system could not handle it five
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:14.560]   grand in its base configurations gonna be available in December this was a preview and the kids
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:19.800]   seemed to like it I was on Facebook a good friend of mine is a colorist for DC Comics which means
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:27.440]   that she does nothing but essentially rig light and color every single page of every single of all
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:32.440]   the comics that she does and she said I asked her ask for her permission to use this quote why does
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:42.720]   the word teraflops make me so tingly so this is so this is definitely very much up her alley I'm
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:52.200]   I'm this did seem like a new wave of respect for the Mac Oliver like given that what's who's buying
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:58.040]   one I'm gonna say I'm gonna put it to you first because you have you have probably the biggest
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:04.160]   excuse to buy one given what your company makes and can you buy two and hire me as a consultant
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:14.320]   let me borrow it for a year yeah let's talk about that of Andy still my idea of course we're gonna
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:24.720]   have of course we got we're gonna get one or maybe one more and I'm looking forward to see how well
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:36.360]   it actually performs so recently I did a live stream in Berlin and the room was very hot so I used a
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:47.440]   new one of the newer Macbook pros and it has this logic built in that you know reduces the
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:55.120]   processor power if some if it's in danger of overheating or something or that and if you do a live stream
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:04.200]   that happens quite fast so after about 10 minutes or so suddenly the Macbook Pro doesn't have 3.4
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:12.040]   gigahertz anymore it just tunes down the processor to 1 gigahertz and then that kind of made me a
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:22.040]   little bit that experience made me a little bit cautious about you know small you know thin
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:30.760]   pro machines so they have Apple acknowledging on the stage that there is a cooling issue and
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:37.320]   they have and they claim they have solved it with iMac Pro I'm a little bit cautious about that
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:47.240]   other than that the machine specs really really sound exciting I mean it's the dark gray itself
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:55.640]   it's gonna it's gonna be giving you 20% more performance yes because because of course it's
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:52:01.320]   absorbing light and therefore getting more energy from from the the solar solar flares and such I
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:06.280]   suppose although I can't imagine it being much more powerful than this they kept underscoring about how
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:11.320]   well this is gonna be great for like VR content creation all these GPUs is gonna be great for
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:16.360]   machine learning most of the machine learning development is being done on GPUs these days so
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:22.440]   I don't I don't think this is gonna be this will probably a little bit overkill for like watching
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:29.800]   Hulu but it will probably do a great job watching Hulu especially the 4K stuff is any of course I
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:38.840]   can't of course I can't drop 5 grand on on this my car is not worth 5 grand but is this is this
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:45.000]   and that's and that's the entry level of configuration exactly who wants that yeah you know you want
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:50.920]   to make you course and I think if you I think I'm gonna go for that to say we can can safely assume
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:57.640]   that you can multiply the you know what's the base configuration 6 4 so 18 course is gonna be three
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:05.080]   times that much and then you don't want 128 you know you want the three terabytes
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:14.760]   as is good as it could be like thank you way past 20 grand so yeah it's gonna be like buying a BMW
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:22.600]   where it's like oh you got a BMW oh you got the 320 model okay that's hey hey it's still a BMW
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:31.400]   you know I'm different I needed the M5 but hey good good for you it's good that you mentioned
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:38.440]   that because I think Apple really borrows from the German car makers where you know you buy and
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:45.560]   you buy a BMW and it comes without the steering wheel you have to buy a steering wheel extra so
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:50.760]   that's a different trim package yeah the most famous thing from the keynote of course is the
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:54.680]   HomePod they Apple ended with it I thought that we'd start with it because I don't think anybody
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:54:00.760]   wants wants the keynote to end with the most exciting and interesting thing so the HomePod is
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:07.480]   what the coneheads used to refer to as their house but it's also their intelligent smart awesome
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:15.240]   speaker we were all anticipating something like a Siri speaker like Google Home or like the Amazon
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:20.920]   Echo but this what they gave us is they're really really hammering home the point that this is a
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:26.760]   this is redefining home audio this is a totally new home audio component oh my god the home audio
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:32.360]   so it has a custom really huge custom woofer that has been designed by Apple it's got seven tweeters
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:38.760]   all around it and the and also an a8 processor which is the same CPU that's in the Apple TV
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:43.160]   and older phones so there's a lot a lot of processing power in it and it's not being used
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:50.040]   necessarily for Siri according to the demo that they gave the big upshot of this is that it will
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:55.720]   I assume using the tweeters as a form of sonar with all the array of microphones to figure out
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:55:01.240]   where the speaker is in the room figure out okay I'm actually at the back of a room next to a wall
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:05.720]   and there are two walls equidistant from my left am I right great so I'm going to shape the sound
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:12.040]   so that it doesn't matter that I've been placed in a somewhat somewhat awkward location and there
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:15.960]   was also a long bit where they're trying to explain that not only that but the
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:22.040]   CPU is actually also going to kind of it's not as though it's going to tear apart the audio that
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:27.640]   you're playing and sort of remix it it will find out okay here's the vocalist we will put the vocalist
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:32.280]   here and because there's it's a big ceiling we're going to have to really boost the vocal track
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:37.400]   here here are the drums here's some really deep bass we're going to have to mute that but also
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:43.640]   increase this the dimension of it the idea being that you're spending 350 dollars or roughly three
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:49.000]   times the cost of a of a google home but you're getting a really really really super awesome speaker
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:55.400]   and I wasn't thrilled about the price of it myself because once again the what I love about the my
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:56:01.240]   smart speakers is that it's not so I don't really buy it to have a really awesome home audio experience
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:05.800]   I buy it so that I'm in my bedroom and I can turn my lights off without getting out out of bed
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:10.680]   and then when I go downstairs to the kitchen I can listen to music while I'm washing the dishes
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:15.480]   and set a timer for something I would much rather have the three google homes or the three
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:20.040]   Amazon Echo or the two Amazon Echoes then the one really immense really wonderful speaker no
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:28.440]   matter how great it sounds why don't you just buy a clapper I could borrow from my aunt she probably
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:35.240]   still has one the the other the other stuff to know is that it's it was not compatible with Bluetooth
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:40.280]   is compatible with Airplay too so it will technically work with any streaming service that you can stream
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:47.240]   off of your Airplay compatible device but it will only directly access Apple music without some sort
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:52.920]   of intermediary which is I suppose is necessary but I would love I would have loved to at least
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:58.200]   had Bluetooth as an option I guess I'm not even gonna have like a headphone jack I can I can
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:05.640]   plug my tape player into uh so so Kelly tell me why you know Andy is yes they don't put in his own
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:10.520]   headphone jack anymore that's not a thing now correct it's really me I should I should be happy
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:15.960]   that the there are even speakers in this thing yes well I thought the speaker was really interesting
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:22.760]   but what I wanted from Apple and I don't know if I'm alone in this but what I wanted from Apple was
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:29.640]   a series speaker the way I can have an Amazon speaker or a Google speaker which is to say the
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:35.800]   point of it is not that it's a speaker like I don't feel like Apple's going up against the
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:40.920]   Echo unit or the Google home unit with this with this device I feel like they're going up against
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:47.320]   stuff like Sonos and I think there's a Bose system that works kind of the same way but I think they're
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:50.920]   going up against those sorts of things I don't think they're going up there it doesn't seem like
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:55.960]   they're gunning for the assistant because it's like they built this amazing speaker that happens to
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:01.160]   have Siri it was like Siri was almost the afterthought when they when they talked about it they were
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:05.560]   like look at all this amazing stuff and Siri will answer you but look at all this stuff and
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:14.200]   not did they did they announce anything about HomeKit being available with or working with this
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:19.320]   speaker yeah they did they did announce some some updates to HomeKit like including wireless speakers
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:24.760]   into into AirPlay 2 as part of HomeKit part of AirPlay 2 is support for wireless speakers so
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:29.320]   perhaps you could have they didn't mention anything about the Sonos compatibility but there's still
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:35.880]   a lot that happened between now and September but so in theory perhaps you could have Siri working
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:41.880]   across because HomeKit is all tied up into the same into the same Rice Krispy Street so maybe maybe
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:49.880]   one of the things that is hidden inside the speaker is like the being the hub for the HomeKit stuff
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:59.640]   talking being able to talk to HomeKit devices I think the A that built in processors maybe an
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:08.280]   indication of that so that it's like a mesh network of you can put a speaker in every room and then
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:14.600]   the speaker will talk to the HomeKit devices that you have I don't I don't know if they
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:20.680]   if it works that way but I would I would assume that that is sort of like the idea
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:26.600]   yeah my problem was it was I have awesome speakers I already have awesome speakers
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:31.000]   there's these two guys bowers and Wilkins and they make fantastic speakers and I have a bunch of
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.560]   them in my house and we spent a lot of time and a lot of research we set them up and they're amazing
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:41.800]   and I have a receiver on the two levels where I have serious speakers I have a receiver that
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:46.520]   does airplay and so I airplay to those speakers when I want to hear stuff out of those speakers
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:53.560]   so having the I see the chain he really really agrees with you just having the awesome speakers
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:59.080]   wasn't wasn't the part of that I wanted like yeah because we had this conversation in my house
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:04.760]   like a year ago now hey Best Buy has the Amazon unit on sale the Echo unit and then
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:10.120]   uh mr kelly said okay so when is apple gonna come out with one of these and I said I don't
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:14.520]   know if they're ever going to and the rumors that we're hearing don't really say anything
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:19.880]   that would lead me to believe that and then he said okay I guess we'll get one and see if
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:24.920]   we like it because they still have like a 30-day return policy at Best Buy so he brought it home
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:29.800]   and it's still here and I have no interest in the new one he has no interest in the new one because
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:34.040]   we already have great sound systems set up wherever we wanted a great sound system
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:38.680]   so for people who are maybe getting into this there may be a market for it but I don't see it
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:44.680]   well part of me that the bothered me about watching the keynote was you saw all this amazing
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:49.400]   stuff where he's talking about like AR and updates to metal and talking about all this futuristic
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.760]   awesome stuff and then at the end he's like we've saved our most important announcement and we're
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.400]   talking about apple music and it was just like oh god Tim quit trying to make apple music happen
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:04.760]   it's not that I'm just I'm so sick of every single keynote every year ending you know like after we
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:08.040]   see all of this amazing awesome stuff it's like okay we're gonna end on our most important
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:15.240]   announcement and it's apple music it's just like great at least it wasn't carpool car okay
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:20.440]   guess what's Thursday
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:32.280]   beginning of our sales it is a very big day Thursday June 29th 2007 actually it wasn't
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:37.800]   a Thursday thing what happened what happened we got our iPhone we waited in line for hours
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:42.280]   and hours and hours and hours we'd heard about the iPhone in January at mac world expo
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:46.440]   we'd stood in front of the plexiglass case with the guards on either side
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:55.880]   ooh looking at it but it was June 29th 10 years ago I remember getting in line here in petaluma
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:02.280]   at the AT&T store and it was actually not too bad it was about a three-hour wait what's cool
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:07.640]   what in the apple lines back then in fact that one especially if you were in line waiting for
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:14.120]   an iPhone that you were a cool person I mean the I met two guys from google who had spent up all
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:22.040]   night making I think it was google reader or gmail work on the new iPhone and it was so cool we all
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:31.160]   had our little you know seats our little our little you know ballpark chairs and and I waited
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:35.880]   in line and I was praying because I knew it wasn't an apple store I was praying that AT&T had enough
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:44.760]   but I was like 16th in line and yes I came out with this kind of looks small and thick at the same time
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:50.440]   so small small so it's beautiful though I mean it's just iconic at this point oh yeah it was
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:57.880]   scumorphic and I was talking on my trio because that's what I had before my eye I'm waiting in line
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:02.120]   I'm gonna get this new thing called an iPhone and then remember that picture of scott born
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:09.400]   we should have gotten scott on the show today he's been he's been very nostalgic for all
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:17.080]   or no born he's been very nostalgic in the last few weeks on facebook posting you know pictures of
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:24.120]   him getting his new iPhone and you know how he had the most popular one time iPhone podcast in the
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:29.160]   world and oh it's so cute did you see when scott forest all said he never heard the words
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:34.360]   gomorphic for him it was photo photo illustrative and oh yeah you did by the way thank you you did
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:40.120]   a great summary of that video at the computer history museum john mark off interviewing all these
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:45.800]   great people let me just I'm at scott's page see if he has that picture of him uh he's been
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:53.160]   by phone vest his iPhone vest yeah wow there it is yeah uh 10 years ago I was hosting the most popular
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:58.600]   iPhone podcast in the world everyone was telling me I was crazy they said the iPhone was a fad
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:08.520]   and would never take off scott was a believer scott was a believer he he knew and he was so
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:15.240]   excited I want to get that find that picture of him coming out of the store holding his iPhone up
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:21.160]   high remember that yeah oh well tell me your story Renee you were in Canada so you might
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:27.400]   have the word yeah yeah no I couldn't I was stuck with on a trio uh 680 and a trio pro or something
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:32.840]   just looking at the rest of the world we're looking at the u.s with abject jealousy I brought I took
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:38.040]   one I brought one of these for amber macarthur this was probably a few months later when somebody
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:43.000]   had cracked it so that's when I got mine yeah you could use it in uh in Canada on rogers or
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.840]   tellster or not tellster that's australia and it was two hundred dollars for a hundred megabytes
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:51.240]   of data in Canada back then yeah I brought up to her she never used it I was I found that later
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:56.840]   uh she was she liked her blackberry she wasn't uh wasn't gonna use it I think blackberries were
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:01.800]   the last holdout because there was a lot of reasons that people used their blackberry and um also
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:08.200]   Canadian we still see a couple of times you see them in some uh uh government areas I traded in my
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:14.520]   that was my last smartphone before the iPhone was um the pearl the blackberry with the pearl yeah
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:20.840]   what was your story Alex how did you get your first iPhone I remember sitting in WWDC with you
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:26.680]   and scott we were excited it's it forward today we're announcing three new products
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:32.280]   we already went through that in January but you know an internet browser
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:38.840]   a uh was an internet device a music wire screen iPod and a widescreen iPod
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:45.160]   well and and a phone and a revolutionary phone a break on internet communicator and I was like
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:49.640]   hanging on my widescreen iPod my old phone wasn't working I was like I am not buying a new phone
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:53.640]   because apple's releasing a phone I they're gonna release a phone and so I'm not gonna buy a new
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:06:01.240]   phone nobody believed it yeah oh I had I had the the angriest I ever got with with uh with uh AT&T
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:07.240]   got me in such a state that I had literally hang up the phone after two weeks of trying to
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:14.120]   solve this problem with them and thinking that I really feel the need to cancel and say I AT&T
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:20.280]   but at this was like eight months before the announcement of the iPhone and I said the best
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:25.480]   information I have right now is that AT&T either has already signed a contract to be the exclusive
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:32.280]   carrier of the of the apple phone or they are very close to it and are you willing to cut off your
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:39.000]   nose to that extent so you're gonna have to sign up with AT&T again sometime next year to get the
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:46.360]   phone or are you going to eat mud on this issue give give them the pay them the 75 dollars that
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:51.400]   you are absolutely not required to pay them for and extend your contract for a year which you are
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:56.920]   not required to do yeah okay fine I'll have to eat spit but I want I want to let them I want to
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:01.800]   let them know that it's because I know that they're getting the iPhone that's the only reason why
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:08.120]   I'm putting up with this garbage Andy was it hard to do Alex Lindsey who was on so this is
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:18.040]   Mac break weekly number 46 June 29 2007 we and we called the name of the show was iDay it was
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:25.000]   Merlin I know was on it yeah Alex was on it netcast you weren't on it yet Andy right people you trust
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.160]   I guess not oh no I was on that I was on that show were you well it says so but that's because
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.200]   episode 46 yeah ignore this
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:45.400]   let me skip ahead Alex Lindsey is here from pixa I have a he has an iPhone Scott born is here from
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:52.040]   applephone show.com he has an iPhone Merlin man is here from 43 folders.com in the Merlin man show
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:57.960]   he does not have a phone but he did a great segment all that about the iPhone he only got him later
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:03.720]   presenting the hold out. Yeah I'm not necessarily a munch of just a hold out and I think there
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.800]   are quite a few holdouts I think a lot of people in fact it was my advice to anybody who isn't
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:14.040]   a fanatic a lot of people did hold out I'd say wait for generation two is that what you're
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:19.560]   waiting for generation two yeah exactly well this one we're actually made him not bad because
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:27.160]   this does not do 3G right yeah remember that there's so it didn't do cut paste it didn't have apps
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:33.480]   didn't have an app store it had it had a keyboard they had the first all glass fake keyboard
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:38.600]   that if you'd used it you were shocked and delighted at how easy was to use if you had not used it
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:43.720]   you're gonna be like I'm gonna I'm spending four hundred and fifty dollars for a phone that doesn't
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:51.000]   have a keyboard okay well also it was hard to it was for the longest time I couldn't type my name on
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:58.520]   an iPhone it didn't have brick breaker I kept having to tell having to tell people the secret is to
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:05.080]   don't don't think just type yeah I think just screens were too small and it just never loport
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:10.200]   just never came out right yeah I don't know why but I just it was very hard invented auto correct
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:14.200]   is the same person who created Internet Explorer Dean Hachimovich from Microsoft oh that's interesting
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:19.160]   yeah I have to say that launch day was a little bit heartbreaking for me because
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:26.520]   whenever people try to try to understand exactly how excited people were about the iPhone I tell
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:32.920]   them about how look I got I had a briefing right after the keynote in January was introduced and I
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:36.840]   got to like hold one of what must have been I now know we're like only like two or three
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:43.080]   functioning iPhones and use it unrestricted and it was like what what news from gallery you you
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:48.920]   you actually touched the the hem of Jesus what hand was it what hand did you hold the iPhone is
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:54.680]   can I touch that hand as well like oh the scrolling was smooth it was like like like the like the
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:00.360]   waves of a calm tranquil ocean lapping toward the shore by the way I got so many meals off of that
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:04.840]   that's how that's how excited people were oh yeah just to get stories of what it was like to use an
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:11.880]   iPhone was solid gold currency back then oh I tell you I can I'll never get enough of the of
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.760]   the 10th anniversary iPhone and now of course we have yeah we have it yeah the iPhone 10
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:23.400]   and you know here we are what a month's in it's it's the greatest isn't it it's the apple said it
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:27.480]   was the best one I've ever made and I think they were truthful love it I love it keeps getting
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:32.440]   better yeah it's amazing but yeah you can watch Jimmy Jimmy Hendrix let's sight fire to his guitar
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:36.520]   time and time and time again I can watch Steve Jobs introduce the iPhone yeah I thought it was
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:41.800]   my son yeah it's and I think Steve would be very happy with what's the what's happened to that
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.600]   ecosystem over the ten years and this 10th anniversary hard to picture him happier than he was in this
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:51.800]   video I'll tell you one thing he would not be happy about at least in my opinion
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:58.520]   planning of the apps what was that I forgot it already oh that by the way we should say before
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:03.480]   we look at our review of Planet of the Apps the one of the first original I might have been
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:09.800]   the first I think was the first original programming which they wanted to be a billion
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:15.400]   dollars apples gonna spend but big big news that just came in last week apples doing a deal with
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:21.080]   the creator of the battle star Galactica reboot yeah Ronald Moore and it's amazing because they're
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:26.120]   doing what if the space race had never ended which just sounds all shades of awesome especially
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:30.920]   with that sort of credibility behind it kind of the man in the high castle history revisionist
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:36.360]   history but way cooler the Russian starship the American starship oh I can't wait yeah he did such
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:40.600]   a good job with Galactica and one of the things I loved about the modern Galactica
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:48.760]   what and I don't remember this in in that crap TV show but was the the reason Galactica survived
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:54.040]   the attack of the silence this isn't a spoiler it's the first episode is because it was antiquated
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:59.800]   it was hard-line it was all hard on sense the phones and wires coming at I just love that
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:05.640]   yeah wonderful so like Steve Gibson was the admiral I have to commend apple I think that they
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:09.640]   they've they've learned from the planet of the apps fail let's let's watch our review
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:15.800]   has it have you watched is everybody watch now the new apple original apple music programming
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.320]   the uh
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:23.000]   uh I know I know how that ends the apps we're gonna we're gonna manly a
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.120]   Apple element sexy I mean I I guarantee that we're gonna do this but it's just not a
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:33.960]   magic I wish there was a better show in a leprechaun it's so crazy it's I it's the idea I'm sorry go
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:38.680]   ahead I'm sorry go ahead you have to be a member of apple music right to I'm just saying that they
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:44.120]   lost me the moment they lost me the moment I realized that oh my god this is really happening
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:49.720]   they have to give a 30 second pitch while actually riding an escalator and they have to finish the
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:55.320]   pitch by the time they get to the bottom so an elevator would be claustrophobic Andy oh my god
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:00.520]   I mean I guess we're and it gets and they sure that guy they sure lock that I really said
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:07.560]   yeah apparently the guy who was showing off an AR app had put his heart and soul into the whole
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:12.680]   thing and and then and then the entire the the third for the whole episode like they're gonna
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:17.080]   show now that I've now that my mentor has gotten on board she's gonna explain to be the well maybe
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:21.880]   we should use the AR technology and license to other people and people and people will sell to
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:26.360]   catalogs will sell it to and see yeah because no one can duplicate this it's so hard to do AR
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:34.280]   and I'm like oh dear oh honey so it's Jessica Albrecht Gwyneth Paltrow Gary Vaynerchuk and Will
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:40.760]   I Am or the judges yeah and they don't make any point of like why any of these people are qualified
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:44.440]   I mean I'm not saying they're not qualified I'm saying that they don't at least at least in
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:48.680]   Shark Tank they start by saying this person started with nothing and now they have their
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:53.480]   own real estate empire this person was a cleaning person and she decided to start selling things
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:58.120]   on QPC it's like okay so they understand something about the business that they're trying to build
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:04.360]   for these people it's like I designed a really freaky looking car that's based on based on a
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:10.440]   DeLorean that Alba has a has a very successful honest right honest cosmetic line for
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:16.840]   a particular Paltrow as goop but they don't explain what do they understand about the software
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:21.960]   development and app marketing right really they're not again here's the escalator that you have to
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:30.280]   write it's like and Gwyneth Paltrow has Ironman armor so but it was what was crazy is that the
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:37.240]   production value is three or four times as good as Shark Tank which is based based on over over
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:43.640]   you know and and it was I mean I will say it was incredibly well executed but literally by a third
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:47.160]   of it a third of the way in I literally had to shut it off because it made me so angry watching
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:52.600]   it like I just couldn't get the production the production value is not as good it's really really
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:56.840]   awful it doesn't understand that so it walks in they give a pitch that you don't need an elevator
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:00.920]   you don't need a special lineup floor that says who's interested in who's not it really is going
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:05.800]   to be about the pre these four people talking to this would be entrepreneur about their product
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:09.720]   or their service and why they should how the deal should be structured this is the least
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:15.240]   interesting explanation at least interesting articulation of this idea possible they it's a
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:20.120]   perfect bingo they could not have made this less interesting right no and what I'm saying is the
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:24.760]   production value from my perspective is the he's talking about the cameras the graphics
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:30.200]   the graphic you know like I think what you're saying Andy is the is the design of the show is a
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:36.520]   is a is a failure well and also it's they don't I would I mean you can't it's you can make a
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:41.560]   fascinating movie about how hard it is to as an independent developer to bring something to market
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:46.280]   was that was that documentary on two documentaries on indie game development I think it's called the
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:50.280]   indie movie or the indie indie planet something like that and this fascinating watching this
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:55.720]   people inside their homes but working with the focus of the team making the iPhone to try to
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:00.840]   create try to create this amazing amazing games and that's where the interest is and they're not
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:05.880]   even really showing the difficulty of building an app and finding an audience it really is about
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:09.960]   the fake meeting they're going to have with the with the investors that they're going to be lined
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:15.880]   up later on saying we if we we decide that if you're going to pivot you see the use the word pivot
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:22.200]   to expand our audience and then market profile like it's it's so they could not again they could
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:28.680]   not have figured out a less interesting way to have a show about about people who build apps this
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:35.480]   yeah and actually the truth is I kind of I was I thought that when I first heard about it I
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:42.200]   thought this is not good this kind of trivializes uh what's involved in app development uh and
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:48.520]   popularizes it in a way that's going to not the good news is nobody's going to watch it it's I
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:56.760]   have yeah it's uh it's not going to be a mass appeal show so uh let's talk about the iPhone 8
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:01.400]   because I think if this the analyst and probably everybody else who's highly bullish on apple is
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:11.160]   expecting a you know very exciting new release um one of the rumors coming from not just Ming Chi
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:17.320]   Kuo who of course has great sources in the supply chain but now Mark German is kind of is saying
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:26.120]   the same thing it may be that the high-end OLED uh bezel this iPhone won't have touch ID
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:35.000]   mmm that's a sound of shock that sounds like that sounds like half of a story that sounds like
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.400]   someone knows that the touch the sensor that they were they were expecting to see is not there
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:45.080]   uh but which is not to say that apple has not put touch ID someplace else or or they have not
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:48.840]   replaced it with something that they think is just as good but I can't imagine what that could be so
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:55.960]   well so the rumor is that they have tried putting the fingerprint reader in other places and
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:02.520]   not been happy with the results however what apple will do and actually this sounds very
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:09.320]   appily uh is put in 3D sensing for facial recognition we know that these cameras will have more
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:17.160]   capabilities and iris scanning and that their of the opinion this is more secure than a fingerprint
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:23.560]   it would happen it's interesting in that it's it's a it's a very that's a very Samsung
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:29.560]   sort of way to approach uh authentication it kind of ignores the fact that uh touch
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:34.200]   ID is something that you can activate while you're just basically moving your phone into position
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:41.720]   if they can do real 3D face sensing it'll be a breakthrough for such a device if they can do
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:46.040]   iris scanning in such a way that it's not oh what time is my what time is my flight
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:54.120]   align target widen eyes look hold on okay my phone is my my plate is on time that will also be
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:19:00.600]   unprecedented in this space i'll believe it when i see it yeah so i think i think i think that i
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:08.120]   think that more people will use the the 3D facial stuff for selfies and their snapchat um
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:13.160]   stuff that i will i mean if you think about what it will do to selfies i think i think it's gonna be
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:18.280]   more uh impactful to people buying the phone is it'll suddenly have a 3D of the phone and
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:21.800]   we thought the tracking was good before just imagine how good it's gonna be when we've got a 3D
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:26.360]   version of your head yeah i mean i think no i mean nobody questions go ahead Renee
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:31.000]   before Renee has not been able to know no no no no it's um the the way the way i look at it at
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.280]   least is that apple has finished this like as far as hardware is done this phone is this phone
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:38.920]   is finished they're not lingering at the you know trying parts in like lego it's too late now try
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:43.720]   this yeah yeah so this this one is done the only question we are three to six months behind apple
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:47.480]   like they live in they literally live in the future because they're working on the next two or three
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:51.080]   iPhones so we're just trying to figure out basically information we have which one of those options
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:56.680]   they chose now their goal was to get the the most infinity of infinity displays onto this phone
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:01.160]   like this much glass and as little bezel as possible and that meant changing the way a touch
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:05.160]   idea worked because it just wouldn't work with a screen like that and they've tried technology
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:09.160]   that works under the phone and maybe or maybe not that worked and they tried putting it on the back
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:13.560]   and maybe or maybe they didn't like that but touch ideas is just a feature it's not a thing
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:18.040]   unto itself it doesn't have to be there it was one way to solve making authentication more
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:22.440]   convenient because it's not really a security it's more of a username than a password and if they
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:26.760]   feel like they can do what they said is a better they can get more points of identification off of
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:30.840]   3D scanning then they can get off a fingerprint their job is evangelism the same way people were
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:35.640]   dubious about touch ID in the beginning they'll be dubious about face scanning in the beginning
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:39.400]   but they have to solve several problems to make this work this is not an easy technology either
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:43.480]   Samsung famously makes you choose between iris scanning and face scanning at the beginning
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:47.560]   and one works in low light and one works in bright light and one can be fooled by photos
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:52.040]   another one can't be fooled by photos that's a tough problem to solve but apple is uniquely
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:56.440]   positioned as a company that has a lot of resources and has full control of everything along the
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:00.600]   stack to sort of bring that sort of technology to market the same way they did with touch ID
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:05.480]   when the previous sort of generation of fingerprint scanners weren't really ideal either so if if
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:09.720]   they did in fact go with facial scanning because touch ID wasn't workable it's just because they
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:13.720]   believe that it's just as good if not better a solution and the biggest question to me is like
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:18.200]   do you get banks and credit unions to go along with it without ever seeing it work in the real
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:23.000]   world or being tested in the real world saying okay yeah we're fine with apple pay anyway we trust
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.680]   you guys to do this or do we have to wait you know until it's been on the market for several months
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:32.040]   before they get back on board and and and andy and i both know that the touch ID on the back works
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:37.000]   where fingerprint reading on the back works quite well on google's phones but doesn't mean apple
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.960]   would necessarily like it it's not that it wouldn't work but as you said quite this could be accurately
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:48.920]   phrase yeah and that would be the thing you know while it i mean so right now the thing the face
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:53.640]   recognition we've seen and and microsoft has it with windows hello in some of their systems
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:22:01.160]   and and other people using windows and sam song has it in their galaxy s8 the ones we've seen are
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:07.560]   slow or yes and you have to position the phone properly i believe they're 2d i'm not sure if
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:11.720]   they do they don't use same technology that's right so these are contamination of regular
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:16.520]   regular cameras on infrared to do to basically trying to fool of static photos right although
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:21.320]   we know that this we the sam song galaxy s8 has been spoofed both of the apple one is
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:25.880]   a scanning the apple one is supposed to do points of identification the way a fingerprint does and
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:30.040]   then also do it in milliseconds which is way faster than i think a lot of them so that would
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:35.160]   be the two issues of course it has to be at least as secure preferably more secure than
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:41.720]   fingerprint because apple pay relies on it uh and it has to be as convenient and as fast
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:48.040]   or faster which means you shouldn't have to with the galaxy s8 you have to position the phone in
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:52.600]   fact they even put little eyes right so supposedly doesn't this one you could do it on a table
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:56.760]   apparently that would be the key of various angles it just knows it's me and you know i don't
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:00.600]   have to do anything it just knows and that would be better than fingerprint because i wouldn't have
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:04.920]   to do anything it would just know well i also think that there's there's an opportunity i mean if
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:10.600]   they include a fingerprint or iris or uh backup almost a two-part of authentication with these
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:16.040]   biometrics you you could theoretically not necessarily be forced to do it this way but we have the
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:21.080]   option of saying i want to know that my watch is on that you know i'm in vicinity you're going to
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:25.960]   look at my face and i mean and there are some people that would really prefer to have all of those
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:31.800]   things added to it to make it you know very very secure right and as you get to a point where you
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:35.880]   really feel like it's really working like right now i still have time a handful of times when i need
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:41.000]   to actually still use my keypad rather than my my fingerprint when you feel like it's
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:47.720]   rock solid you could theoretically either make a much longer keypad entry or or get rid of it
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:54.920]   so here's mark german's quote so ming qi qo you'd expect to know uh something because he has good
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:24:01.720]   supply chain sources and as you pointed out rene the phone's done they're are they making it yet
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:06.360]   probably right i think they're for order yeah they're going to start getting component orders in
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:11.400]   yeah so they're tooling up the factors are tooling up prototypes exist so it would make you go program
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:14.920]   against that hardware like you can't just keep moving hard and again i might be totally wrong
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:19.160]   maybe people laughing at me at apple right now but i believe you can't you can't just keep changing
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:23.640]   the hardware and expect the software team to catch up yeah they didn't ship a product so here's german's
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:30.600]   quote uh he says they're testing uh face recognition the company's also testing i scanning to augment
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:36.200]   the system the sensors speed and accuracy are focal points of the feature can scan a user's face
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:41.640]   and unlock the iphone within a few hundred milliseconds the person said german has really good sources so
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:47.240]   you know consider that it's designed to work even if the device is lying flat on a table
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:52.760]   rather than just close up to the face we got to explain to mark that there's been laying and
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:58.040]   lying but that's okay lying flat on the table lemberg editors they have bloomberg at least yeah
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:02.600]   no they don't have nobody has copy editors anymore the feature is still being tested and may not appear
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:08.520]   with the new device that's an important sentence number people sent me that or tweeted me that when
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:12.920]   they when i first reported this story they said the feature is still being tested and may not
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:19.400]   appear with a new device however the intent is for it to replace the touch id fingerprint scanner
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:24.360]   apple of course refuses or declines that would have to be there though i mean like you can do
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:28.200]   something like enabling a feature like portrait mode after you ship it but you can't go in and
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:32.760]   retroactively put the sensor in the case yeah yeah the hardware this is hardware stuff as well as
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:38.680]   software um i know i wouldn't mind if it's fast and maybe this would only appear on the high end
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:42.600]   oleb iphone the other ones could continue to have touch id
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:48.520]   also with a given given the the short and time frame are they going to take the chance that
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:52.280]   everybody's going to get them on the same day at the same time are they going to have to deal with
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:56.600]   somebody got there's a day before someone else and then someone else is saying hey i was wondering
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:00.040]   if mine's in the mail uh oh no you've got to email them you're right yeah
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:05.800]   uh they did release thank goodness they put it out i'm sure your travel agents happy rene they
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:11.000]   put it out a little bit earlier than they usually do um a week and a half early instead of a week
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:16.040]   early yeah and i always think that south bay is going to make things easier and south bay never
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:22.920]   makes things easier no how about how i don't know why we're stuck are we stuck the tricaster
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:28.360]   stuck on any any i mean what did you just one of them yeah everything we say just lip sync it
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:31.400]   will you if you had a choice of being stuck on somebody would be andy too
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:37.480]   certainly knows he knows how to use that extra screen time one question we got yesterday
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:46.440]   is uh when will ios 11 come out will it come out that day the gold master if apple follows
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:50.440]   the previous patterns the gold master for all four oasis will be released that day and then
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:56.200]   developers will have uh eight days to work on it and then the tuesday or wednesday before the
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:02.600]   hardware launches i'll be pushed out so you get it before the new hardware and and then yeah i think
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:07.800]   i found i found three three g was the last one that did it the same day and all the servers crash so
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:13.400]   now they do it like two two or three days early so it would be the 20th or 21st i'm not laughing at
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:19.480]   your name laughing at andy if you're listening an audio it just sounds like i'm insane but uh
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:23.960]   andy's really got the lip sync andy has a canadian beaver no he's not a beaver's a groundhog right we
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:30.280]   we figured out the tail issue last time yeah he doesn't have a paddle yeah no well maybe he can
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:35.720]   he can switch it or do you want to reboot the tricaster or something or okay andy you could put
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:46.840]   the rodent down thank you just thank you ernie you're welcome i appreciate the camera time hello to
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:55.160]   all my new fans check out my instagram support my work on patreon i've got
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:28:03.640]   series of videos about things that are almost relevant but not quite so basically i'm a youtube
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:14.840]   superstar bye bye pictures are uh coming up of uh the steve jobs theater this is from um it's kind
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:20.600]   of interesting a spanish language mac magazine uh had these pictures apparently discovered in
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:27.320]   google maps somebody's been uploading to google maps uh so so we're getting images uh and neil
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:37.960]   cybart tweeted uh based on the drawings uh that there is a demo area right and if it's a top floor
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:41.320]   yeah you'll have to walk through it but maybe it'll be all covered in black when you go in
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:46.120]   oh so we're assembling the products when we're downstairs you think the demo area will be in
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:55.480]   the lobby the upstairs lobby yeah interesting yeah it is it it is a gallery space so this so this is
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:29:02.520]   the only part you see above ground that's the round world's largest carbon fiber roof and this
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:06.520]   is glass all around so i mean there's and there's no hide and what's inside i mean if somebody
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:10.680]   sends a drone over they're gonna see so yeah cover it with actually that'd be exciting wouldn't it
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:14.920]   for the press arriving they'll go there they'll get they'll get their badges here they'll have their
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:21.240]   you know traditional crawler and a cup of coffee and then descend the escalators uh down
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:25.800]   and set the quarterback's in on the way notice this notice this here let me see if i get this
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:31.800]   any bigger this says exhibit space right here underneath underneath underneath so it's like gi
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:37.560]   joe's secret headquarters it does temporary space storage you'll walk you this is really cool you're
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:44.440]   gonna walk in the auditorium doors are here this is the this is the uh the stage area is just a
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:49.720]   slice here this look at how much backstage and loading dock area there is the loading dock must
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:54.360]   have a big elevator because it's underground everything's underground except for the lobby
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:30:02.760]   uh so the loading dock has an elevator obviously the backstage is as big as the theater the back
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:09.880]   stage is massive and uh of course because that's where the executives are that's where they're
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:13.960]   staging everything they have a secret entrance in the back that goes right from the that doesn't
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:19.240]   and the i don't know where Neil got these by the way do you know i i don't know where he got these
[01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:23.320]   drawings because the city plans oh yeah they would have to wouldn't they for permitting
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:32.200]   and then uh let's see so this is the theater here they've got um stadium seating in the back
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:40.920]   this this says here it says meck area underneath so or they keep the mecca the meck
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:47.000]   the if you don't like it the meck are under here just remember at 209 right it didn't go
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.680]   at 209 bad this is kind of i mean this is really evil genius material here this is the underground
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:55.560]   layer well that was the big thing it's like are they gonna get us all in there and then just flood
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:59.800]   it say we're tired a few people and then just flood the whole thing andy i think you and i
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:05.480]   lucked out on this one here's a here's a cross section uh from an aerial cross section gives you
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:12.440]   a better idea this is the stage area all of this is backstage yeah but but realize that
[01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:18.680]   that they are building a theater theater it's not it's not a place they built specifically to give
[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:23.960]   product demos oh though again well what else do they have here plays well remember there's
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:28.760]   they well they could remember that this is this isn't something that again this isn't rental space
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:32.920]   they're not being going to be there for five years they're going to be there for 10 20 30 40 years
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:37.960]   and the with they're putting this is the one space you can get to without having to pass through
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:43.800]   apple security and there are a lot of companies in the area actually everywhere where they do have
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:49.640]   they did need a big presentation space but they can also do things like rent it out for functions
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:53.960]   or if there's a function that they're doing where they just they want to host like an academy
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:59.480]   screening or they're there is just some sort of a speaker that they really like and they really
[01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:07.640]   really endorse uh they can have it in this is this is the ultimate case of renovating your building
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:12.680]   and thinking that all i want to do with the kitchen is getting new appliances but then you
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:16.120]   thinking well look i'm not going to be able to renovate the house for another 10 or 20 years this
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:21.960]   is probably the last time i'm going to do this maybe i should pay the extra 15 000 dollars to have a
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:26.760]   solarium attached to the kitchen and then a conversation area attached to that i i when i see things
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:31.560]   like that in the backstage area i'm thinking that this looks typical for a real theater where if you
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:36.680]   want to do live presentations you need to have a wide backstage that can handle pretty much anything
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:41.000]   and that's i've been saying for the past year two since we've been talking about this new thing
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:47.400]   that this is a this is also a theater that was designed specifically to get to host this sort of
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:53.320]   event particularly well so i've absolutely no doubt that there is it was designed with the idea that
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:58.600]   there is a demo area that can be not just blocked off but pretty much invisible to people who are
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:04.280]   coming in at the start of the event or if they want to do something uh in the in the atrium area
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:11.720]   a easy ability to quickly do a load in in that area over the course of an hour so it's it's it's
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:18.440]   it's like when you yeah it there's this is this is a tuxedo that was built for a magician there
[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:22.920]   are going to be all kinds of hidden pouches and double linings that you don't wouldn't be in anything
[01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:27.160]   else but are exactly for the sort of act that apple wants to pull off it's it's gonna it's gonna
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:33.240]   be fun if if i were attending i would be just as interested to document this thing looks like it's
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:39.000]   a wall but it's probably not a wall and oh there's i just saw somebody who was standing by this area
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.840]   and there wasn't a door there and now they're not there anymore this must be the place where
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:48.040]   people can quickly quickly slip out take a phone call then come back in again here's the uh so
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:52.440]   this is a great tweet thread by the way niel sibert of from above avillon has a lot of information
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:58.120]   here meeting rooms meeting room meeting room meeting room uh this is this says exhibit space but
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:03.800]   when you look at the cross the uh cross section you see it says exhibit space down here so i'm thinking
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:09.080]   that escalators come down and there's a large exhibit space that is not visible to the public
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:15.000]   here he also says some other things quotes the sanose mercury news in an interview in the san
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:24.280]  ose mercury news that the theater costs fourteen thousand dollars a seat according to uh somebody
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:31.240]   bordon that the uh there's also a thousand seats it says clearly on the plans here compared to
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:36.440]   sixteen hundred at bill graham for iphone events but much bigger than erbogway in the center seven
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:40.920]   hundred sixty and the apple town hall three hundred and that's the cool thing too is that
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:44.360]   they used apple town hall for a lot of things it wasn't just for press meetings it was for
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:48.600]   everyday company meetings yeah i mean i think that is a company university was there and they
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:52.600]   did a lot of meetups and some of the stuff they used to do in the center court of infinite loop
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:57.240]   like when they had bigger meetings and they could at least stage quasi-bigger meetings like when
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:00.360]   they have disclosure meetings or they have meetings to show off new app like things
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:04.840]   internally projects that are done internally uh and the really cool thing about all this too is that
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:09.960]   the previously to andy's point they would spend like a million dollars to make a platform that
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:13.800]   rose up and turned around to show off the new iphone and then have to throw it away or they
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:17.560]   would spend you know millions of dollars to bring air conditioning into bill graham and then have
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:21.320]   to you know basically scuttle all that money where here they can purpose build all of those
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:25.480]   displays and all of those those you've been mechanics exactly we want it and then keep them
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:29.080]   it'll save them money i'm sure i mean this is what apples always wanted to do i'm sure
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:34.200]   actually i hear you guys are going to maybe maybe not me but some people get back to go to
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:39.880]   go back to the steve jobs theater apples announced its investor meeting for this year will be held
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:46.760]   in there i have a by one you don't have to be by one share i don't know this is how i'm getting in
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:54.120]   and wow right because if i have a share of apple stock i can get in can you i think anybody as a
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:58.040]   shareholder can get in well then we got some we got seeds and i don't think you're going to be
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:01.240]   able to eat like a hundred and sixty eight dollars for the catering you should try the
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:06.600]   seventy four fifty four as we record this it could be two hundred by the time the show airs
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:13.320]   uh anyway moving moving right along um and i hope you enjoyed any the ventriloquist uh somebody
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:19.400]   said that was a favorite his favorite moment of all time on mac break weekly uh the iphone
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:25.000]   ten notch this is right after the iphone team came out and i you know uh the only person who
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.320]   touched it was you rene and what we thought of the iphone ten notch
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:37.000]   i'm glad that we i'm glad you had a week because i've assumed that by now after physical therapy
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:42.520]   and emotional therapy your eyes and your psyche have healed from the experience of having to look
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:47.960]   at an iphone screen with a black notch at the top i hope i haven't triggered you because i know
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:53.480]   it's really emotionally devastating thing for so many people that there is a notch at the top
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:59.000]   of the screen now we're in a place of of peace and love nothing will happen here that you do not
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.960]   want to happen so you're completely in control but if you can possibly walk us through the harrowing
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:11.000]   experience of using an iphone that has a black notch at the top of the screen we love my experience
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.680]   is not a normal one because you're so excited when there's a brand new product that just like that
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:19.560]   excitement level lets you tolerate a lot of things that in the day-to-day average use you may not so
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:23.320]   i saw them i could not unsee it i call it the horns i like that term because correct
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:28.840]   kreg kedericki's really good at flashing those some people uh call it the the forehead and the ears
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:33.880]   whatever whatever floats your boat i can't unsee it like i i did notice that especially when i
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:37.800]   turned at landscape you can shrink down things like if you fill the screen with a movie like i filmed
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:42.520]   it with wonder woman and at first i'm like holy hell this is a the world's first real hdr device
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:46.920]   hdr from color management all the way to screen this is blowing my eyeballs out then i'm like what's
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:52.680]   this thing on the left so you can't not see it when it's in portrait mode it does sort of fade away
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:56.760]   but when it's in landscape and you see it sort of encroaching on apps and the apps have to be
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:01.720]   extra padded to go on the side then you you absolutely do notice it will i notice it a week after using
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:06.440]   it i think so i think that's the sort of thing that i'm just like there's there's different kinds of
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:09.560]   people some people could care less i think i'm the kind of person that it will always bother me
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:13.640]   i would love to be proven wrong by that but i i just think i need you i'm not going to get over it
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:19.400]   i'll put up with it but i won't get over it over macho grande we'll never i'm never over
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:25.560]   macho grande but doesn't uh like when watching video doesn't it like black out the when you go
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:31.320]   full screen does doesn't it like accommodate it somehow like black out full screen it goes
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:35.320]   around the notch it when it's so when you when you when you go when you fill up the display like when
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:39.720]   you tap on it you make everything big so it fills up the display then the notch is or the horns
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:44.040]   are really apparent when you shrink it back down not so much like it sort of goes and and the way
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:49.320]   you'd expect yeah i saw some developers were posting on twitter after particularly after apple
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:55.080]   posted user interface guidelines for developers on how to embrace the notch so to speak um but
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:39:02.040]   it came with the mock-ups of how it seemed it i i had a hard time not having seen the iphone x
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:05.880]   in person yet i had a hard time thinking that was going to be that big a deal maybe part of it is
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:12.280]   that i have i am a veteran of the moato 360 watch that has the infamous flat tire at the bottom
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:16.520]   but that had that had that little that little win that little archway at the bottom for the
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:21.560]   same reason why uh the notches on the iphone because both the watch and the phone they wanted to have
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:26.680]   no bezel whatsoever and the cost of no bezel is you still have to put a sensor somewhere that's not
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:32.440]   being covered up by the screen uh and i found that it yeah it would have been better to not have it
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:39.080]   there but i kind of ignored it after about the first half a day or something but it seemed to be like
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:42.440]   the turn its sideways half the time like if it was if it was at the bottom half the time and sideways
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:46.360]   half the time i mean see it's it's like and with some of these mock-ups it just seemed like well
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:51.000]   what if apple between now and november the when they ship this thing they just added a system
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.040]   preference that says just make the top just make the status bar black all the time in which case
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:01.080]   partly because this is an OLED screen it will just simply look like your same black status bar only
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:04.520]   now you don't have something in the middle of it you have things to the left and the right of it
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:10.680]   it i i'd be more concerned if it were i'd be more concerned if it were something that really
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:17.640]   affected like the day-to-day use of it and i can't i have a hard time i have a hard time seeing
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:23.080]   the notches something that can't be adjusted with firm with a software update later on or something
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:29.080]   that i won't kind of get used to so i mean i've i've kind of tried that like yeah i'm pretty sure they
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:32.360]   internally they've had this for a long time and they've tried everything they've hidden the notch
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:36.040]   they've embraced the notch they've done various of the notch they've done sometimes not sometimes
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:40.040]   no-notch and and again i think that they just made a decision i don't know if it was a marketing
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:43.560]   decision mark or mine had a really good article yesterday saying that it allows apple to have an
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:48.920]   iconic shape again because the home button is gone and now you you when they make that sort of icon or
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:52.680]   that glyph showing the iphone it's unmistakable doesn't look like an android phone doesn't look
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:58.200]   like a generic phone it looks like you tell immediately oh horns it's an iphone and i don't know if
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:04.280]   marketing is the right place to make that decision yeah they're not attaching horns to the iphone
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:09.080]   is a necessarily a great marketing decision that's all i'm saying you know it's yeah also
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:14.920]   also the the essential phone also has a notch so it does look like an other thing so yeah uh so
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:20.680]   but again like they they anytime you see a design on twitter or anywhere else apple as engineers have
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:25.880]   done 20 variations of that and decided whether it's because of uh other issues or because of personal
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:29.400]   taste that they didn't want to go with that some people have said maybe that it would affect burn
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:34.360]   in but uh like sounds like a show and you can i forget shake the interface slightly like wiggle
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:37.800]   it so that the pixels change and you don't burn them in so there's there's always work
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:41.560]   arounds for all these things i think ultimately it's just that they decided they wanted to
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:48.520]   embrace the horns little tidbit in matthew panzerino's tech crunch review of the iphone 10 he says when
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:55.640]   he went to kupertino last week to pick up the iphone 10 he got to interview phil shiller uh senior vice
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:01.480]   president of hardware engineering dan richio created fedoriki and vp of user interface design alan die
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:09.320]   uh and dan richio said something interesting i heard some rumor that we couldn't get touch
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:16.280]   id to work through the glass so we had to remove that when we hit early line of sight on getting face
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:20.840]   id to be as good as it was we knew if we could be successful we could enable the product that we
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:25.480]   wanted to go off and do and if that's true it could be something that we could burn bridges
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:29.800]   and be all in with that's assuming it was a better solution and that's what we did so
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:36.200]   we spent no time looking at fingerprints on the back or through the glass or on the side because if
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:41.800]   we did those things which would be a last minute change it would be distraction relative to enabling
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:45.480]   the more important thing we were trying to achieve which was face id done in a high quality way in
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:49.880]   other words as soon as we knew face id could do what we wanted it to do we stopped even thinking
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:56.680]   about fingerprint when cults reached the new world he hunnish men shut fire to his ships
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:04.520]   but he won't move to it well i guess they said fire would touch id quite a while
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:13.160]   that's good i like it in it now some people are having trouble with the watch uh um as far as the
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:17.720]   the way the lt works and the wi-fi have do we think that that is something that's widespread
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:22.840]   across all of them or is it something that is uh specific to a certain number of
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:29.960]   in certain situations so here's the problem with with this people have said that this is an lt e
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:37.880]   bug right and it's not an lt e bug uh it connects to the lt e network just find the problem is with
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:47.480]   wi-fi now what the watch will do when you have an iphone 8 it will uh first the watch will connect
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:54.360]   to your iphone if your iphone is not around it will look for an authorized network
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:44:03.720]   uh a wi-fi network that it can connect to and do voice calls over ip that's the next
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:09.640]   uh thing after if it can't connect to a known wi-fi network it will then connect to a cellular
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:16.440]   network so those are the three steps that it makes where it's running into a problem is that on
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:22.040]   your iphone if you've gone to Starbucks or McDonald's or one of these places and connected to their
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:28.440]   wi-fi network and come up with that interstitial page where it says do you agree and accept the terms
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:36.120]   and you have to click a button uh on your phone then you can surf the web on your watch you don't
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:42.600]   get that page so your watch is getting stuck on that interstitial page where you don't actually have
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:50.120]   access to the internet right but it won't move on so that's where the problem is is it a is it a
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:55.960]   bad problem yeah apple should have known that and they should have fixed it now i never had that
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:45:04.680]   issue when i was uh reviewing and testing uh my my watch because i don't join those networks so
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:12.360]   i didn't have Starbucks in my uh my my phone or my watch so it never tried to join that free
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:18.680]   wi-fi network because it's so insecure i never joined the McDonald's network or any of the other
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:26.280]   ones the only networks that i had in my my watch were networks that i knew and that were authenticated
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:33.080]   so my watch worked fine so people were coming up with this problem uh on when the reviews posted
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:39.800]   and i thought i never saw that i i don't i don't know what these people are talking about and people
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:44.840]   were asking me because i posted my review and said yeah work great and they said well what about
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:49.160]   this problem then when it finally came out i said okay well that's why because i don't join
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:54.440]   those networks well i have to admit that i i think this is a problem for many operating systems and
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:59.960]   but also a problem on the ios and macos is this idea i'm going to jump on to a why i feel like
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:05.800]   it to jump on to a wi-fi and if i can't get to the internet in you know literally 30 seconds or a
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:10.440]   minute i'm just going to get off of it like i'm going to turn that thing off again because it is a
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:15.000]   you know a constant problem for me is that i i do use some of the insecure networks like
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:21.400]   like the united lounge or united wi-fi on a on a on a on the plane or you know all of these things
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:26.600]   and what happens is my devices jump right on they're like hello and and they get on and then they
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:31.560]   hang on there and i i don't have an internet you know and and so then i have to turn off wi-fi and
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:36.040]   everything else like just just you know until i want to use it so i think that that is um
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:42.600]   one of the things that i think i wish apple was smarter about is that i'm going to get on if i
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:47.400]   can't ping something quickly i'm going to get off that wi-fi network because it's got something
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:51.080]   that's stopping me from getting does that does that seem like it makes sense or is there is it
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:57.720]   more complicated than that yeah well the apple the apple watch has to know from now on that okay
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:07.240]   this page uh this network requires an interstitial page uh skip it and go to to lte once once they
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:14.680]   figure out how to do that right then it's going to be fine yeah you want to say tanya well i was
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:19.000]   i was just gonna say i believe apple will be able to fix this on their end i'm sure they're working
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:23.080]   on it but something that i think people should just think about before they get on the starbucks
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:28.840]   network or whatever it is is if you can get your um your bandwidth situation under control just
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:33.480]   tether from your iphone that way you're going over the cellular network and it is going to be a
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:42.680]   lot more secure for you jersey fudge so this is part of the paradise papers that came out uh this
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:49.400]   weekend this was a kind of a follow-up to a previous massive leak of financial of information
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:58.040]   of of of financial records and primarily coming from a company called apple beat which is a law firm
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:06.120]   uh in the canary islands which helps big companies and high wealth individuals use
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:15.000]   complete and i will point this out right up front completely legally use um tax havens to stash
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.640]   their money and of course apple very famously started a subsidiary in ireland where the corporate
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:26.120]   tax used to be very very low transferred a bunch of uh ip of intellectual property assets there
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:32.920]   took a lot of the money they made and transfer and you know paid the irish subsidiary for use of
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:38.920]   that property and was able to offshore billions of dollars well remember the eu censured ireland
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:43.960]   and asked them for hundreds of millions of dollars because it was being used billions from
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:50.520]   apple billions not from apple though ironically from ireland so they told ireland eu told ireland
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:55.960]   you get it from apple more yeah and and ireland did change its rules but the island of jersey
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:49:02.440]   apparently has a corporate tax rate of zero and so according to the paradise papers apple
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:10.120]   google as well apple's the biggest but many other companies and the queen of england and the finance
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:15.400]   advisor to justin trudot and a great many high worth individuals including our commerce secretary
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:22.840]   will be ross have been using these again legal tax dodges to stash money i think apple has
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:31.880]   282 billion in jersey but apple denies it right they put up and use post-loss i think it was late
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:37.080]   last night right where they try to explain their side of the story so nobody's ever said apple's
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:41.480]   doing something illegal and they're doing what you would expect uh... what shareholders anyway
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:45.800]   would expect which is i think they're paying as little taxes they can legally and i think all of
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:51.000]   us do that like i have an accountant but you can't do the double dutch with the irish
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:55.560]   going to win a money i don't have enough money but let me tell you what would happen if i had enough
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:50:01.160]   money i would use it well you know like so i you can't blame apple for doing this but you can blame
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:06.200]   politicians by the way here's a map from wikipedia where you see the red countries these countries
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:10.360]   have politicians who are exposing the paradise papers who are using these
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:17.400]   tax dodges now you know why it's legal in so many countries because and in fact a new tax law
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:21.960]   that's being proposed at congress right now makes these loopholes one would hope would make me
[01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:26.840]   illegal makes them more makes gives you more loopholes more ways to do this the only argument
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:31.400]   i've seen really against this is the moral one where it says that you know apple is apple takes
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:35.880]   a moral stance on many many issues including accessibility and civil rights and civil liberties
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:40.600]   and they should have a moral obligation to pay as much tax as they possibly can
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:46.600]   well like i'm just sorry i just observed you know it's absurd and even tim cook has said that
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:53.560]   the laws need to be reformed um nevertheless i mean facebook does it
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:58.520]   nikey does it walmart does it allians does it seaman's does it mcdonald's does it yahoo does it
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:05.560]   allergan the makers of botox do it um you know billions of dollars and now what's happened
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:09.880]   though is that puts a tax burden on you and me we're not rich enough to do this
[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:16.600]   so we pay more tax i pay more to it pays more taxes than apple does by far no you don't still
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:21.000]   worth not dollar size percentage you know they are seven percent of our ireland's economy i mean
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:25.640]   i like that's apple's justification they'd say well we pay more taxes than anybody in the world
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:30.040]   average they make more money than anybody in the world and i also think america's unique and that
[01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:33.640]   they want you to pay taxes for money you are so we're an outside america whether you're an individual
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:38.600]   or a company and not all countries understand that yet apple is transferring intellectual
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:44.840]   property assets out of the united states to ireland and now to jersey to of to reduce their tax
[01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:50.200]   liability i agree with you and as well you got to pay more even though you don't have to and and
[01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:54.280]   and amazon's looking at moving into a new city this happens in the united states too by the way
[01:51:54.280 --> 01:52:00.360]   it's not you know like cities give uh cities states provide companies with tax breaks i mean you
[01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:05.000]   want to talk about the film industry you know you get a 25 percent tax break to film in louisiana
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.320]   or in new mexico or you know and that's money that it's not it's like a tax credit that comes back
[01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:15.640]   to you i mean it's it's an incredible i mean so it the competition over taxes is basically how
[01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:22.440]   countries and states and cities market themselves to corporations to that point ireland in one
[01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:27.480]   year it's gross domestic product went up 26 percent when apple transferred everything over there
[01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:32.120]   so yes uh but now jersey gets nothing because they're not charging any tax
[01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:35.640]   jersey just gets uh some bankers rich i guess
[01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:41.720]   um they get the name of the press leo so well about them before that now everybody knows about
[01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:46.360]   yeah apple's being sued for fourteen and a half billion dollars in back taxes but but i have to say
[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:53.560]   by the bono also does this the president of liberia does it essentially that everybody
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:57.720]   everybody who wants to have some control over how they spend their money whether it's bono
[01:52:57.720 --> 01:53:00.600]   wanting to give more money away right they don't want to give it to the government they don't want
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:06.280]   to i mean they don't want to uh they don't they want to give it to what they think is important
[01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:11.960]   queen of england does it and not have it you know be you know squandered buying john katyan whatever
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:17.880]   they do your former prime minister did it does it so shuanig and strangler what we need to do frankly
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:22.360]   is we need to call congress and say you know you got to eliminate these loopholes it's not gonna happen
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:25.240]   it's hard because i think i think we need to get real listen you know why it's not gonna happen
[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:29.800]   because these people pay congress a lot of money to make sure that they don't pay as much tax and it's
[01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:33.240]   not just the congress it's the parliaments in other countries they're all they benefit from this
[01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:39.400]   fight like materially so it's very hard to get them to move off a dozen members of the trump cabinet
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:44.920]   are in the documents yeah robert murser and sheldon atlson are in the doc basically any high value
[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:49.640]   individual is a fool if they're paying taxes at this point you pay people just to make that go away
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:53.320]   and the most of probably half of them don't even know it's happening like they just you know they
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:56.200]   have an accounting firm that you know they have a hundred million dollars and they hand it off to
[01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:59.480]   a manager and the manager make sure that they pay the minimum amount of taxes they can do it
[01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:05.000]   but donut does it paul allen does it wesley clark does it it's pretty much i'm feeling like an idiot
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:12.360]   for paying all these taxes i pay almost half my income in taxes so do i i feel like an idiot but
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:17.080]   but again if i if i somehow if i somehow uh sold my company for a hundred million dollars i would
[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:20.440]   hand it off to a managing firm and they would do exactly the same thing and i wouldn't know about
[01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:24.040]   it or think about it or it wouldn't bother me you know it would just go you know i would hand it to
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:29.240]   them and then they give me a proper return and that's how that that stuff happens according to the
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:34.840]   boston consulting group the amount of money involved here is about ten trillion dollars apples just a
[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:40.520]   you know fraction of that i drop in the billion buckets yeah but i do feel like i don't know i don't
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:45.320]   know what to say it's offensive but it's not apples fault i understand there's so many offensive i
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:49.160]   guess that there's so many places that that happens that it's like we were that that one's
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:53.080]   an easy one to see but you look at like okay high frequency trading that is the leech
[01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:57.560]   that sits on top of of of wall street just sucks money out for no value at all
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:01.240]   i mean you know and and we know you know people just don't understand it well enough to
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:05.400]   argue about it so we can see this one but i don't think that it's you know i i you know it's
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:11.320]   a small number but i now Alex is looking at it now it's the first time i've touched it yeah the screen
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:17.000]   is spectacular and by the way this flame it just it feels like you spent a lot of money on it that's
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.240]   all i'm saying it's what you did you did you did and evidently it turns out there's a lot of people
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:24.840]   that are willing to spend a lot of money on a phone yeah the upward price elasticity is amazing
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:30.040]   yeah there was something we talked about this on sunday on uh on twit there's something about that
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:34.840]   one thousand dollar barrier it's not that it is that i mean so a few hundred dollars more expensive
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:39.800]   than your previous phone it's and that's a few hundred bucks amortized over a couple of years
[01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:43.480]   it's not the end of the world but but but something about psychologically about going through that
[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:46.840]   thousand dollar barrier i asked people in line and most of them were like cost how much i don't
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:51.560]   know i'm getting it for 20 or 30 bucks a month and that was the only number they saw that's really
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:59.560]   what apple's done that's i think smart yeah yeah and the 20 30 bucks a month is really is that all
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:02.840]   all right well sir i don't know what the ui's three years i think it's more than that yeah
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:08.120]   because they're very very uh over for how many years you know they don't know it's a two year it's
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:11.320]   well you give it back though so you don't own it that's the whole thing so you're basically a
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:15.880]   leasing model i think i i did the math and i think it ends up being like thirteen hundred dollars
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:20.280]   instead of twelve hundred something like that you know the apple program one should the
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:24.600]   apple one should be zero rated so it should be like leasing a car for zero percent interest oh
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:29.880]   over the only negative on that is if you've damaged it you're screwed well you get apple care plus
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:33.800]   automatically with it so you get two incidents you know i i would probably have to do i should i
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:36.680]   don't know why didn't do that that actually sounds like a smart way to do so you're not paying
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:41.960]   extra you're just spreading it out yeah and you get apple care plus i'm not good with diamonds
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:46.040]   so i just buy everything i do too like i'm just like oh i'll miss a payment well i'll be honest
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:50.040]   most of the time with the phone i use it for a few months than the next phone comes from and it's
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:54.280]   the end right now totally totally i don't i have a feeling lately i'll be using this one
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:59.880]   and the display on this one i i can't get over it so display mate said it's practically textbook
[01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:06.440]   in terms of color accuracy the best screen they've ever looked at um you know and i trust
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:10.200]   these guys they sennara does a very good color accurate monitor but then i decided just to get an
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:16.120]   iPhone one of the things they said is that they have managed to cut to calibrate each device
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:21.160]   accurately right yeah they're doing individual sub pixel level calibration across every unit
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:25.800]   would and you need for color management but a lot of pieces just aren't set up to do it well i think
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:32.600]   we talked about this that the the problem with the pixel uh two excel is this batch color calibrated
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:37.320]   and so there'll be some significant variation in different units but in this
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:43.000]   the display mate said close to textbook perfect calibration and performance
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:50.280]   superbly accurate high performance gorgeous display um you know now apple's quick to say it's
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:57.160]   still an olead it's an OLED burn-in is always going to be an issue we suggest apple says you turn the
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:03.800]   screen off time to its lowest setting 30 seconds we highly recommend you use automatic screen
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:11.800]   dimming oh Alex is looking at a movie watching Deadpool is it it's uh2 hdr it's hdr Dolby vision
[01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:17.160]   and hdr 10 dead this funny i watched deadpool on my new apple 4k apple tv how does it look
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:21.320]   because it gets you ought to get automatically upgraded looks beautifully looks good even hdr
[01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:25.320]   and t-the Netflix stuff is amazing because the marvel the marvel netflix stuff is all muddy but
[01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:30.600]   you watch it in hdr and suddenly there's color everywhere it's amazing uh and the blacks are very
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:36.040]   nice i watched a stranger things there's a scene no spoiler at all but there is a scene
[01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:43.480]   strange things where uh two people are brightly lit in a black room a dark room and in hdr that
[01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:49.800]   black is black there's no artifacting there's no banding it is it is lights out and because of it
[01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:55.400]   they pop out of the screen so it's 3d without any 3d you know i was talking to someone uh
[01:58:55.400 --> 01:59:01.720]   while i was actually talking to uh koline about compression calling kelly yeah yeah and um and
[01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:06.840]   she's the expert now the world expert our chief engineer here and then she went to google and
[01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:11.080]   then now she's a facebook and she is the world expert in everything having to do with video i
[01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:15.320]   think right absolutely yeah yeah it's pretty impressive she's she's where i go i go for school
[01:59:15.320 --> 01:59:20.920]   you know and that's saying a lot yeah i mean you're my expert so no no like i i go over i spent
[01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:25.240]   a lot of time with and she i can only handle a couple hours at a time before i get a headache
[01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:28.760]   you know just trying to absorb the information but is this off youtube where are you watching dead
[01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:34.520]   pool that's off of itunes of your soft my iTunes that's your so this is the upgraded 4k HDR
[01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:39.640]   and i i really think that yeah it's great but you're saying you know one of the things that that
[01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:44.120]   her opinion is is if you're gonna do 4k or hdr you want to just throw a lot of bandwidth that people
[01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:51.240]   because the uh if they have a 4k tv 4k hdr tv they probably have a good internet connection
[01:59:51.240 --> 01:59:54.120]   you know there's like this like you know yeah i do you buy that if you don't have that right so
[01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:56.840]   and the best thing about the iPhone is you don't have to worry about the hdmi because right now
[01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:01.720]   hdmi cables are causing the most headaches for everybody just to get 4 4 4 out of from the source
[02:00:01.720 --> 02:00:06.120]   to the television it's like playing roulette whether your cable will work or not but it just works
[02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:09.320]   on an iPhone because there's no cable involved and a lot of it's the the run by the way we've
[02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:13.560]   been doing 4k for a long time with monitors and it turns out how long that run is is
[02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:17.320]   is a big deal you know you have to we find it and some of the high ones aren't shielded
[02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:21.880]   Alex which is causing all sorts of problems for people yeah yeah the um we find that over six feet
[02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:27.160]   it's that's when it really becomes an issue of of whether it's going to work or not but um but
[02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:31.960]   yeah so i mean like my home connection now i mean tests it like except for yesterday when Comcast
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:38.440]   went down yeah well that was weird what yeah yeah so let me let me show you uh this is probably a
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:43.880]   good shot as any uh for high dynamic range because there's a brightly lit sky in the background
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:47.960]   uh i don't actually see any detail in the sky but i do see detail in the white tent
[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:54.280]   behind it and of course there's plenty of detail in the black jacket the t-shirt this this is a
[02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:58.600]   kind of a good example of high dynamic range in video that'd be interesting to get it oh wait wait
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:02.760]   i think i can download what where are you it's also depending on the studio because they get to
[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:08.200]   choose which version of 4k they give you and whether it is true hdr true 4k or up sampled yeah
[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:11.800]   so there is some variance in the content i think a lot of this stuff shot in just a
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:15.560]   it's funny that you picked Deadpool because that's what i picked at random to take a look at the 4k
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:22.360]   h uh st htr i mean just yeah it's a great movie and i happen to own it but even just demoing
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:28.440]   while i landed one to one and green and the icons the text um and of course anybody at home seeing
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:32.840]   this is not seeing it because we stream 720p if you're watching the video and if you're listening
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:38.280]   the audio you're really not seeing it but just in the hand it it really does look superb and the
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:41.800]   amazing thing is if you put your old iPhone next to it it looks the same like the icons don't look
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:46.840]   different colors no and that actually is amazing because typically in fact i compared it on another
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:53.480]   show to a note 8 screen i compared the red and the authy red is always a challenging for any video
[02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:58.920]   right red and the authy icon to the note 8 and the note 8 had a pink tinge to it it was a little
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:05.240]   poppier and brighter this is very it's a very real natural red it's perfect as far as i can tell
[02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:10.200]   and that just as you know throughout uh very well and you don't have to trust our
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:15.320]   limited eyeballs where were you in gas and there's there's i think there's a couple of
[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:19.320]   differences here one of them is that this is going to be your if you're not been iphone user you're
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:23.480]   probably been one for like five or six years this is going to be your first OLED screen and so you're
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:30.600]   gonna get a dramatic improvement over what you've seen before if you are going from an android phone
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:36.200]   like i am it's not quite so it wasn't quite so dramatic for me i thought it was very very nice it
[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:41.400]   didn't blow me away but i could certainly appreciate how good it was but just in case you're being
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:46.360]   scared off i owe well i don't have HDR content i don't care about HDR on the train ride to
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:51.640]   new york city yesterday i was actually watching an episode of colombo that i ripped from dvd over
[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:58.920]   the weekend and even that was just a really satisfying amount of detail and color even for a dvd
[02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:04.600]   quality rip of a tv show that was that was filmed in 1974 so yeah you're you're going to be really
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:10.600]   really happy with it we're gonna uh Alex is trying to pull up the same frame on his uh iphone uh six
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:15.720]   s just to compare it that's an lcd screen apple's always done good screens there lcd's
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:19.960]   nothing is missing these out either uh OLED can be challenging because the temptation with OLED
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:24.040]   is to make it brighter and popular it's an immature technology and it can be the absolute
[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:29.880]   worst panel on earth if you don't do it very careful i have the 4k you can you can also it's
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:35.160]   it's not necessarily a bad thing to actually see significant differences in the same scene it
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:43.080]   actually looks a little brighter on the success but uh in terms of detail what it what's interesting
[02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:48.200]   is it's because it's brighter you're seeing more detail on the success above it we should we should
[02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:54.840]   turn your screen down or mine up well hdr also kind of can save you energy because you do tend to
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:59.080]   overdrive the screen because you want to see details that are hidden in shadow rest the hdr
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:02.520]   screen will show you that detail even if you've got the backlight or the lighting of the brightness
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:07.640]   of the screen turned down so i think even people with a different iphone 7 and i tend to turn mine up
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:14.600]   to uh to 11 most 10 to 11 you can go to 11 and now what's interesting is even though i turned
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:18.520]   up the brightness the blacks are still inky and there's not a lot of detail in it so i don't know
[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:25.480]   i don't know i i prefer the bottom one which is the iphone 10 but yeah i think it looks more well
[02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:29.800]   number one is it looks less blue yeah it looks more natural and it looks more natural and then
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:34.200]   home you're not seeing the difference at all by the way just look at the guy's head the flesh tone
[02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:38.600]   in the bald guy's head is so much better it's a lot more it's a lot more it's a hdr 10 it'll be
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:44.200]   vision are different like goby vision does very careful frame by frame hdr where i think hdr 10
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:49.240]   does align through the entire video to calibrate it is this Dolby vision or h-year 10 i'm not sure
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:54.600]   i know that uh that he does both but i don't know yeah so does the iphones okay yeah it does both
[02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:59.560]   okay so it depends on who what marvel the studio is good to pick it up yeah right yeah
[02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:05.160]   oh actually i'm just getting some breaking news i'm going to go to the twitter right now
[02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:13.800]   and lemme orhan ergan yeah who is just tweeted something kind of scary this is a security flaw
[02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:18.520]   that affects high sierra the latest version of macos
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:24.520]   be assured you need the bad guy would need physical access and of course when somebody has
[02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:28.680]   physical access to your machine lots of things bad things can happen but this one's a bad one
[02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:33.880]   i'm sure apple will push out of fix very quickly if you go to users in group in the system preferences
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:41.800]   you know it's locked right click the lock to make changes use the word root as user name no
[02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:46.440]   password first time might not work second or third time it will you're going to get
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:50.840]   yeah and that's not the worst of it he's just using that as an example you can actually log
[02:05:50.840 --> 02:05:57.000]   in to a locked machine according to him using the same technique so if you come up to a machine
[02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:04.600]   it's locked enter the yes word root and then apparently the root password is blank and uh
[02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:11.160]   root by the way just so you know is the super user in a in eunuchs operating systems it means
[02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:16.040]   you could do things i'll give you a little here's a little tip if you do get in as root go to the
[02:06:16.040 --> 02:06:22.280]   go to the terminal and type rm i'm glad to have switched to windows all right well
[02:06:22.280 --> 02:06:26.440]   maybe it's going to keep this windows machine plugged in for things under the pot
[02:06:26.440 --> 02:06:34.680]   rm-rf star i just hit return and the entire hard drive will be erased yeah and uh there you go
[02:06:34.680 --> 02:06:41.080]   that feels good i mean famously the original ios it was root alpine for everybody
[02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:48.280]   yeah this is first of all uh i'll say it again i'm glad let me found this i'm glad he tweeted it
[02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:52.760]   i guess might have been nice to tell apple before he's going to be first yeah that's kind of the
[02:06:52.760 --> 02:06:59.080]   rule in the security field but uh apple will certainly push out a fix to this fairly quickly
[02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:05.640]   and remember if somebody has physical access to your system you're screwed in many ways although
[02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:12.120]   this is a particularly bad one listen this is about as bad as a but we were we were all having
[02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:18.120]   great fun talking about the calculator bug yeah no this is kind of bad really super bad i'm sure
[02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:22.600]   steve gibson i have some fun with this later in this show i i didn't try it yet because i'm
[02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:27.080]   podcasting but i but there's so many people who said that they got it working yeah i think i we've
[02:07:27.080 --> 02:07:31.880]   tried it here Patrick telehandi tried it at work so on his systems yeah we're gonna see that's that
[02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:36.440]   secret un unannounced feature of the new apple campus where they can flood the middle of it for
[02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:40.760]   like mocks sitting in mock naval battles like the old coliseum and we're gonna see a bunch of
[02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:46.680]   product managers and engineers in gladiator gear as part of their punishment for letting this
[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:53.000]   happen say now granted we will not you don't you will not die but you will be escorted out of the
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:59.640]   building if you lose this mock seep up this this is bad this is very very bad not good because of
[02:07:59.640 --> 02:08:04.040]   course if you work in an office you feel very bad about this yes apple should have an there should
[02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:08.760]   be an email there's there should be like some sort of announcement saying that we acknowledge this is
[02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:14.840]   a this is pretty horrible we have put measures into place to ensure that this the problem of this
[02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:21.720]   magnitude is unlikely to ever happen again this is just bad if uh if but the good news is if you
[02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:28.040]   forget your password uh there you go just log in his route with the no password and uh yeah you remember
[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:32.360]   there was a an iCloud keychain bug a little while ago too where it would it would mislabel the
[02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:35.880]   files and you could get the it would mislabel the fields and it would give you the wrong
[02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:40.280]   it would just show the password there seems like there's something went really goofy around iC era
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:47.240]   security at some point wow high sierra has been i have to say ios 11 and iceira both have had
[02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:54.680]   non non trivial number of bugs and problems more than is it more than before more than you know i
[02:08:54.680 --> 02:09:00.920]   think ios 11 it's it's it's mostly again current pain but high sierra when you add in the window
[02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:06.040]   manager and some of the security stuff and when you factor in that it was supposed to be a stability
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:09.320]   release you know that was a big marketing thing that they were they were going to correct a lot
[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:13.880]   of the problems i think that's when it becomes problematic ios 11 i think you know i there's bugs
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:19.160]   every version of ios i'm never happy with them but high sierra seems to seems to have quite a bit
[02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:24.040]   more issues than sierra did uh by the way after you log in maybe the first thing you want to do is
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:29.480]   launch keychain access again it works on keychain access and you can see in the in the clear all the
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:36.200]   passwords stored in the apple keychain i might want to write those down for future use uh but hey
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:40.840]   have you have you seen how thin our new our new knife map book is look how thin that is you might
[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:46.840]   you might want to take with you when you leave the office uh take the power supply i don't know
[02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:52.200]   what could you take with you there's take it all don't leave your computer at the office it turns
[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:57.240]   out that the place where the puck is going to be has no security so before you before you
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:02.360]   turn those case this is really bad i'm sorry this is really super bad it is a
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:07.240]   jazzy fun of apple for this because this is super bad well the only way it would be worse is if you
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:13.960]   could log in over the internet but now okay here's a workaround somebody suggested and i think this
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:21.800]   might work uh before you leave work go into the terminal on your uh on your mac and tush
[02:10:21.800 --> 02:10:30.360]   uh log in is root which is the command is sudu sudio space su you are going to log in as a super user
[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:39.240]   you will obviously use a blank password to do so and then create a password use the word p-a-s-s-w-d
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:44.760]   and it will ask you for a new password you can use blank as the old password and create a new
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:49.720]   password let's see if that works Patrick will you try that Patrick don't you i wonder if it's a
[02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:53.000]   if it's a terminal bug that over it's just in the gooey because otherwise you'd still need the root
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:59.640]   password uh well let's see um yeah let's see if that works could you also do a a firmware password i
[02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:04.040]   don't know if that would help with this yes well that that might be another solution if you have to
[02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:11.080]   go home from work today is to turn on a firmware password um here's a uh here's a here's a
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:17.640]   here's a gift of it uh working in german oh there he goes nice let's start over so the first time it
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:24.280]   rejects the blank password which makes me think maybe it isn't a blank password so he types root
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:31.800]   as the bonitzer name and uh bonazanama and then blank and that works and now he's now he's got full
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:36.680]   admin access to the that's terrible that is you write in it's as bad as it can get
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:42.040]   i think in some ways that was our greatest moment when we found out in the show about the
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:48.360]   high syra flaw and found the workaround before the show was over that's that's a blank yep
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:53.560]   it was it was like being there for the moon landing you're just reacting to the world events as they
[02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:58.200]   strike exactly like that and the uh you have a go ahead i'm sorry i'm gonna say now you have to
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:04.200]   wonder if that was something about moving all that protection into the into the new t2 chip oh yeah
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:11.240]   oh that's interesting never know it's interesting by the way i i uh i did order uh as you might know
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:16.600]   if you watched back break weekly last week i did order the iMac pro it won't be in here in time for
[02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:21.000]   our next show which is of course next tuesday january second but i'll get it a couple of days after
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:25.640]   that i'll probably review it on the new screensavers and we'll have it for january ninth we can talk
[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:31.160]   a little bit about us i'll have it set up here so we can and your i will be in it yes you should be
[02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:35.960]   just we should bake your avatar be in the iMac pro we can do that right yeah that'd be
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:39.480]   that'd be pretty cool yeah i i need to comb my hair first but yeah
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:46.360]   we're upping the anti happy new year guys happy new year andy i hope you have a wonderful 2018

[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:07.400]   very long before i remember i remember andy i was at a mac world expo and i saw the hat and sun and
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:15.080]   sideburns going up the escalator and i chased you down and i i i said first of all i love you

[02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:44.520]   and um what do you do you fireworks for new years eve um i have to admit that i don't really do anything
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:49.800]   when you go to bed you're now getting to my age i know half the time i'm not even awakened
[02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:55.160]   to you i don't you know um we used to do it my friends and i when i was living in denver we had
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:59.160]   a great little tradition that i just haven't found other people to play with where we would basically
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:05.080]   write like a whole bunch of things that we did well that we that we did badly the mistakes that we
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:09.080]   made like we every like five or six things it wasn't like we wrote like a long thing but the big
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:12.920]   things that for us then we had a little fire and we just throw them in like that's the end of the
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:16.440]   year like it was just like you know we would talk about the end of the year like kind of look at it
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:19.720]   and then you throw burn it and then you move on and that was the only thing that i ever found
[02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:24.360]   particularly fun because it was it was over a lot of whiskey too i mean i think they're a play i
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:28.440]   know we've done when we did you know my favorite memory of new year of course is doing the 24 hours
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:34.200]   of new year oh yeah the marisole leo choke leo choke me out yeah yeah you choked yeah so that
[02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:40.040]   right you were showing me uh what is it brazilian jiu-jitsu yeah and then you got the best of me you told
[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:45.000]   me when i tapped the floor to let go yeah but i was so overcome by the moment i didn't
[02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:52.280]   leo's like you don't see champion y'all it's perfect i kind of am said i mixed feelings about that
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:58.040]   those those 24 hours practically i still have sciatica and one leg because it lost all your hair
[02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:05.080]   leo yeah i lost i got shaved i still have a tattoo on my butt because of it but yeah but uh that was
[02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:09.560]   a lot of fun those i think those were my favorite new year that but i'm too old now i gotta go to bed
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:15.160]   i can't what do you do rene are you gonna do anything i usually go to georgia's brother he owns a
