[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.660]   And here's how I know
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.820]   Renee Richie said if I were to be in studio on August 6th
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.620]   I mean September 6th. Would you all be there Renee Richie here from not the pixel core?
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.060]   We'll fix that fix that fix that push a button. I'm on it's Renee Richie
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.980]   He is from imore calm and do you know anything? I don't know or is it just by chance?
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.500]   No, you know, I just assume it's gonna be one of the first two weeks in in September
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.100]   It's almost always been that way for the last since the iPhone was an iPhone 5 they've been doing it then so
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.780]   And if they do it that week because of Labor Day
[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.540]   It's probably gonna be a Wednesday instead of a Tuesday because I'll need a data set up
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.860]   So I figured it'll either be the Wednesday and I can just go straight to the studio on the Tuesday or if it's next week
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.300]   We'll figure something out well
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.500]   We will have room for you right at this very table this brand new table that we've purchased for our brand new studio
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.540]   Also here it's Alex Lindsay. We have his lower third ready
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.460]   He is from the he is from the pixel core
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.340]   Hi Alex. Hey, how's it going? You were up here on Sunday our first show from the new studio. I was it was fantastic
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.620]   I was pretty amazed that you were able to make that flip so quickly. I know that a lot of not me
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.140]   I don't take any credit at all. It really is an amazing team that did that. I'll tell you about that
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.620]   They did a great job. Yeah, and
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.020]   Mr. Andy Naco for the Chicago Sun times joining us
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.940]   Andrew would you like to come out for the September event if there should be one I?
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.500]   Don't know yet. I might actually have other business happening that week so I'm kind of holding up now
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.180]   But yeah, I've I wouldn't I have San Francisco in early September. Yeah, this is this is where people propose to each other
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.780]   Yes, it's the best time of year my mostly I
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.420]   I think that now that Apple streams it in some ways. It's a better well
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:44.780]   I tell you what I like having people in the studio in this show like Renee will probably be in the event because there is stuff
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.380]   You see as you mentioned this and he looking backstage and watching Tim Cook and seeing whether he's watching the video with the light or what he's thinking about
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.300]   That's kind of the behind the scenes stuff
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.740]   You don't get unless you're on premises, but at the same time because of the stream we can see everything that's being announced
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.900]   And it's kind of fun to sit here and qubits from afar. So
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.860]   You know, I don't know that's good. We get the best of both worlds. We'll do both. I'm sure
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.420]   You think I think September 6th that makes sense in fact, didn't we see now a leaked
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.460]   AT&T in
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.500]   House memo for staff talking about store staffing I
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.340]   Think the seventh probably because of because of only because of Labor Day. I think that pushes them by a date
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.100]   Yeah, they'll do it on Wednesday. It would normally be the sixth. Yeah, they push it a day. Yeah, that makes sense and then
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.700]   AT&T's little blurb thing
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.780]   Said the ninth we have to staff up on what on the ninth and then staff up again on the 23rd
[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.100]   Those are both Fridays and that makes sense because if they follow follow suit
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.620]   They have the event and they say pre-ordering begins at midnight on Friday. Yep, the ninth
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.060]   so AT&T would want to have lots of people in their phone stores that day and
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.940]   Delivery on the 23rd two weeks later, which also makes
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.620]   Yeah, last year it was two weeks later the week before the previous years it was 10 days later
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.780]   But then last year they went to whatever it was 17 days later
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:15.020]   Because it better suited their schedule and they could easily stay that way. It doesn't I mean obviously it's Apple can do whatever they want
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.940]   But well, they want to get them there in time for the holiday. That's what everyone can order from September through the holidays
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.540]   so I
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:29.380]   Think it seems fairly reasonable that at two weeks from tomorrow. We will have a new phone and
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.780]   Is there any reason to doubt any of the rumors that we have been repeating?
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.460]   Ad nauseam for the last month. So it's all it's all that right
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.980]   If you don't know what the new iPhone the latest thing is it won't be called a pro to be called the seven and seven plus
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.540]   really
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:55.180]   It's all it's all made up. I think I don't know who to trust I trust you Renee you know they can call it anything
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.620]   So like there's that's a marketing decision at some point like it's got an internal code name
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.940]   It's almost always a number with two letters and then or three letters sometimes and then at some point marketing make the decision
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.640]   They type it in and everyone goes makes boxes and well that's the thing the boxes are made right?
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.340]   Yeah, they can call it. Yeah, the phones are on the boat, right?
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.420]   There's containers of the phones on their way. I would have think they're making millions
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.140]   And they could call anything they want they could call it iPhone X this year
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:26.060]   Right is a man. It's really marketing decision. There's no bearing on reality. Yeah, nor and really no bearing on anything to worry about
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.180]   No, like Alex. You know it went from five to seven. You know why marketing? I mean you could call it anything you want Windows 10
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.420]   It's all fun. Yeah, I only bring it up because if we don't talk about it, we really don't have much to say
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.100]   Though I think it's gonna be super interesting
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.700]   I mean this is a phone where we've seen like the same thing within Intel where they went from TikTok
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.180]   TikTok to tiktok
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:51.620]   Tok and maybe tiktok talk talk depending on what happens because it's not always easy to you to make generational leaps and
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.420]   Sometimes there's a lot of value in keeping the basics of what you have and improving the things that are ready
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.620]   So if they don't have a fancy dance in you design
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.380]   I'd rather they not artificially make one like oh my god
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.860]   We're making a a triangular iPhone this year just because but they can make a much better camera
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.620]   You know I don't want to have to care about the iPhone camera
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.460]   I just want to be able to take great pictures in a bar with you know
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.380]   I'm hanging out with Andy and Alex and you and I want to take a photo and it just the low light is there
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.820]   And I shouldn't have to worry about that. It should be a great photo regardless
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.180]   And that's the kind of problems that they can solve this here
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.060]   Will it be worse running out and getting a new one?
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.180]   I mean we all have to just because it's our job, but but blue Leo
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.420]   I mean just like just like gold and rose gold. We only care there's a new color that also we have the new one
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.660]   Will it will it be blue? Will there be blue?
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:38.740]   There I think I think for most people I think the average person doesn't need to upgrade more than great every other year
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:44.940]   It's too realers. Yeah, that's the truth of it. Yeah, I mean and so I think that it's not really does it compare to
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:49.780]   The six or six you know as it's or six plus or whatever they you know
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.940]   Whatever they have there is really does it compare to the five?
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.260]   You know or the you know, I think that's really the
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:01.740]   Right doesn't jump enough from that position is really the sell point and how many people are still on fives
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.020]   My wife's still on a five. I can play about it five. It's time
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:10.120]   Yeah, absolutely. I mean we I'm sorry Alex you were supposed to say something. He was
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:19.980]   I mean it's grown. It's it's quite remarkable the difference between like real people and mutants like us
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:25.820]   The number the number of times that I see the only the only the only group of people that I see routinely
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:32.460]   Always have the nicest newest phone are kids like teenage teenagers and like really really young adults and
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:40.700]   Everybody who has a car payment that they're now either a car mortgage the car note that they're halfway through or God forbid a mortgage
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.460]   These are the people that are carrying phones with broken screens and and aluminum bands
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:51.580]   around the edges of them and I don't I can't imagine what it takes to convince someone who is
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.780]   Perfectly content with an iPhone 5 to say that no no no
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:02.300]   This is the time you take your phone that's completely paid off and for whatever you use that phone for is working
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:07.860]   Just great and please get fined $700 or $600 to spend on a brand new phone
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:15.100]   The touch idea is is amazing the new screens are amazing the cameras are two leaps ahead of whoever the iPhone 5 had
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:20.220]   But it takes a while to get someone into a store and it gets someone to want it not there
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.220]   They don't want it they
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.940]   It's their phones is a functional item for these people
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:30.220]   Well, I think that I think that I think that that's why Apple spent so much money on the camera is because the number one complaint
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:35.340]   I have is my wife will send me pictures of my of my kids that she went some cool place with them
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:41.460]   while I was traveling and took a great picture of the beach and and it's on iPhone 5 and the you know
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.460]   It's just not nearly the same quality that it could be
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.100]   I'm like you need to get a new phone. So so anyway, that's the I mean
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.540]   I think that that's obviously why Apple has 200 engineers working on the camera and it's still and it's still the best
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:56.780]   I will say that the iPhone still has hands down the best camera of any phone
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.220]   I've ever seen or I've seen to this point
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.780]   I haven't had a lot of hands-on with the Note 7 yet
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:06.220]   But I don't think that it will have the feature the Note 7 will have the feature that is makes iPhone cameras
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:11.300]   So great, which is there is a button and you push it and in that instant it takes a picture
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:17.620]   Which is something that Android phones often kind of screw up depending on what's going on behind the scenes
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:23.820]   Where maybe the camera takes a little second too long to launch or you tape it tap it and you don't see it
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:28.100]   Immediately do anything and you're not sure if it's taking a picture
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.820]   So you lower it to take a look at it and that's when the shutter opens and I have a blurry picture of your knee
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:39.860]   This is and as I mean as great as I've taken some amazing photos with some of the Android cameras
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:44.220]   That's I've had I've had to test I've had a loan but when it could
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:49.620]   That's why you've got I just keep shooting shooting shooting with these things because it's not good enough to say I
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.440]   spent a good 30 seconds at this spot with that
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:59.660]   That's very very picturesque and here is the best of the five pictures that I took it really is I raised a camera
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.380]   I pressed a button. I got a picture
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:06.940]   I went on with my life and no other phone is as good or reliable at that as the iPhone is yeah
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.380]   Yeah, yeah, I'm super interested to see what they do with the camera because there's always rumors
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.740]   They're gonna have a dual lens system
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:16.700]   But it's what they do with that dual lens system and some manufacturers have put a secondary wide angle lens on there
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:22.060]   We're played with the aperture and sometimes when you don't add like that's why lenses are so deep when you don't add Z index
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.220]   Z index you get a lot of aberration in some of the pictures
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:30.180]   So what how do you solve for that or are they gonna put a black and white lens there to help with low light because you can pull in a bunch
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.820]   Of black and white data and use that on the ultimate picture
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:38.220]   It gets processed on the image signal processor and it makes a much better low light picture or maybe they could do something with
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.180]   Depth of field if they if the lens are far enough apart
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:46.660]   They can start pulling some depth some distance information from it and start optimizing or working on depth of field
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.900]   All sorts of different things which of those are they gonna pick and then how is it gonna be implemented?
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.660]   So to Andy's point I don't want to sit there for five minutes futzing with a dual lens camera to try to slide what I want
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:00.180]   I want to press that button and have that whole camera assembly figure out how to give me a great photo
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.980]   And then just give it to me and that's usually where you know Apple does their magic
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:09.900]   Yeah Apple does some incredible things particularly with the camera because every time you take a look at the specs of the CPU
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.140]   That's in this iPhone you have to say to yourself
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:16.060]   This is way way too powerful for the apps that this device is running
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:22.060]   But the reason why it's that powerful is that it's feeding all kinds of features that you would normally get by adding new hardware
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:27.780]   Or in the case of the camera putting in a bigger image sensor or adding a greater exposure latitude
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.300]   This is this I was just thinking that
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:36.340]   Rather than put in a second wide-angle lens Apple has Apple's photo team has so much mojo
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:42.100]   And so much skill they could do something like just put in of really a semi fisheye lens there
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:49.380]   I mean a fixed semi fisheye lens and when you are not when you don't tap the button for the special super wide angle mode
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:56.300]   It's just simply correcting all of the spherical aberrations behind live and behind the scenes without you ever being aware of it
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:01.060]   There's so much that I keep it seems like every year I get about another
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:07.780]   3% of an understanding of what by meeting the right person and the right person talking to me even though the ness is not necessarily
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:13.300]   supposed to about what the iPhone camera is doing that I was never aware of and it always
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:18.680]   It always looks like chapter 7 out of any Photoshop book. I owned four years ago
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:25.740]   It's like really it's just doing that automatically just in case so the Sun goes behind that cloud. Oh, okay. That's clever
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:30.780]   Increasingly go ahead. I was gonna say the really exciting thing this year is from WWDC
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.860]   We saw that they've introduced raw so raw is not an Apple thing
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:38.980]   But they're gonna make it available two third parties the way that they did with the manual photo controls two years ago
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.060]   And they also have a pipeline now that's that's wide gamut
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:47.340]   So we've seen that in the iMac and the 9.7 inch iPad where they can do DC IP 3 color space
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:52.740]   But they also support 2020 color space which is the next one after that and when you start to be able to capture in
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:59.380]   High wide gamut and you'd be able to display in wide gamut that to me is super exciting because I you know
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.940]   We've seen that in higher-end equipment
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.580]   We've never seen that in a little pocket camera, especially when Apple is doing all that with the processor in between
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.500]   Yeah, I mean just a quickly button that up. I mean I've been I have to say that
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:15.660]   I've been using Adobe Lightroom added a really good camera feature to capture feature to
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:23.220]   the to Lightroom for for Android and that includes the ability to capture as a dng as a digital negative as a as a raw file and
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:30.540]   Just the ability to capture as I don't care that the image that's presenting me on the screen after I tap the shutter button
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:37.580]   Is the best image the the image exactly as I wanted to be what I care is that collecting enough data that?
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:42.180]   Five minutes or five days later. I can turn it into the photo that I wanted to be
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.980]   I took some pictures of Sunsets and the ability to
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:50.300]   Have manual controls to say don't try to guess at what this exposure is
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:56.540]   I'm telling you I want you to go lower lower lower and then to be able to take that blown out part of it and restore
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:01.180]   Clouds and texture to it because it just captured the widespread data
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:07.620]   That's pretty phenomenal and it also is a way for Apple to stay ahead of competitors that might be saying yes
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:11.020]   We have our we were selling you a $280 phone
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:15.820]   But the great thing is that you take a picture it gets automatically sent back to our super powerful servers
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.780]   Which which will process it and send back an image?
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.540]   That's as good as what an iPhone would get maybe yes, maybe no
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:25.460]   But it's all people care about is that final really good looking picture
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.380]   And I think that as the technology keeps on moving forward
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.940]   I think we're gonna see you know first we're gonna make sure you were gonna get a wider gamut
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.700]   You know we're gonna get you know
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.540]   It's going to catch up with film right now the problem really is is that we you know on a digital camera
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:44.260]   Are the target that we have to hit as a user to get a great image is still pretty small
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:49.020]   You know the you know what what film gave us and what you know a lot of these wider gamut
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:54.860]   Solutions give us is a bigger target. I can hit something pretty wide and still end up with something by the time I put it on the web
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:59.460]   So I think that those wider gamuts. I think you know there gonna be one piece of that
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.700]   I think we're gonna start seeing with the two lenses eventually
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:08.420]   Technologies that allow us to refocus you know regain a lot of detail
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:14.500]   You know we took we took that picture of our kids that is just you know that nose is in focus and the eyes are out of focus
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.180]   Well, how do we how do we fix that?
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.180]   You know
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.060]   So I think that those are going to be you know things
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.500]   I think also being able to go back in time
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:26.500]   We already see this with film with regular cameras not film cameras but regular digital cameras where I take the photo
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:31.140]   But it was actually taking photos for you know a couple seconds before and go back and find the right one
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:34.000]   And so I think that those are all the competitive areas of
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.820]   Cell phone cameras as they truly replace
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:46.180]   Most of the digital cameras that we've been buying unless you're getting something like an SLR or a you know a Sony a7 S or something like that
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:55.700]   Time machine feature only for photos. Oh show me what my daughter looked like in the five seconds before she got hit
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.700]   That's soccer ball
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.300]   Blackberry and blackberry and Nokia had that for a while. I forget what it was called
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.980]   They licensed it from Nokia was super cool
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.980]   But the the other thing that's really interesting is that Apple makes their own chipset
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:10.100]   So for the last two years they've been making an a 10 chip that conceivably knows the entire software map
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.740]   So when you look at they already have a great image signal processor
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.060]   But there's a lot of signal processing iOS 10
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:19.020]   I can type stakes into the photos app or coffee and it shows me all those pictures
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.780]   But it's sort of just burning CPU cycles to do that
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:28.020]   But you have to imagine that they're gonna build that in the same way they build the image like the color correction and white balance correction in
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:34.340]   So it's gonna be optimized for it's a big claim to say we're gonna do artificial intelligence on device and machine learning on device
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.580]   When you're dealing with companies like Google or Facebook and you have to back that up
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:42.860]   And the way they can do that is with the massive advantage they have in silicon and they will be processing
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:50.700]   Sorry those photos as they as you take them and doing all sorts of AI and all sorts of machine learning that is that is completely optimized to run on that chip
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:55.460]   Behind the scenes as you're capturing the photos and indexing them and and coordinating them
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:59.940]   And that I think it starts differential privacy to come right off the hardware that kind of stuff
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.940]   I think is gonna be super exciting going forward
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:10.660]   One of the one of the things that is becoming more apparent is that Apple is doing stuff behind the scenes that nobody really is aware of
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:14.740]   And the Apple doesn't even really fully express you mentioned the camera
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:21.620]   Thing Andy, but we're also seeing I thought this was an interesting article and I don't know what to think of it from Mac rumors
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:29.340]   Yesterday in which they did a kind of a weird benchmark, but a benchmark between the brand new galaxy no seven and
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:35.620]   last year's six s the note seven is a snap dragon a 20
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:44.220]   Four gigs of RAM the six s has the a 9 processor, which will be superseded in a month by the a 10 and two gigs of RAM
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.700]   And you know they didn't do the kind of the traditional benchmark tests here
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:53.860]   Let me turn off their idea. They didn't do the traditional benchmark test where you might load browser pages things like that
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.860]   They just opened a lot of apps
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.220]   They launched for 14 apps
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:04.740]   one after the other as fast as they can let me skip to that that part of it and
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:10.020]   The iPhone was able to open now. This is synthetic as synthetic can be because no
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.020]   I guess nobody's gonna do that and yet it might be
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:17.580]   Tell something about the speed of the of the disk access about the speed of the operating system the speed of the
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.580]   I mean
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:24.580]   Yeah, it's such different devices because the you think it's when people say like this has more cores or this has more RAM
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.580]   It's like comparing a Ferrari to a Mac. Well, that's exactly right
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:32.860]   So how you use it is what matters right how fast a web page renders or how fast
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:38.420]   Like how fast is Prisma process like for things that are intensive. That's what matters to you or how fast Photoshop
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:44.620]   But this again, this is taking a device that has a chip specifically designed for the software that runs on it and putting it up against
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.620]   I'm assuming this is the Qualcomm version and not the
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:51.980]   Yeah, so that that is a chip that is designed to run multiple cross-platform architecture
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.780]   So it's carrying a burden that Apple does not have Apple does not have to support direct X
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:20:00.420]   It's not have to support you know anything that they do not want to support and they can build every sort of optimization
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.220]   imaginable into that chip and it's a 920 P
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.720]   iPhone versus a 1440 P totally
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.880]   There's there's this is an apples and oranges, but it is the experience and there's no
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:18.020]   There's no job. I deal with right right not really I mean people know you're just gonna launch 14 apps in a row
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:22.060]   They're not good. Yeah, no no and no one cares about how fast can I launch apps?
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:24.660]   It's always about how fast can I switch from one app to another?
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:29.940]   So the hardware isn't as important as whatever mojo is inside the OS to decide that okay
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.060]   This app is super super super idle right now
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:38.780]   So we're just gonna put in deep freeze where we know that these we know that this user is typically going to he hasn't launched
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.380]   Evernote, but he is typical to dip into Evernote
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.380]   So we're gonna keep this sort of close to the front as much as possible
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:52.020]   It just it really is like one of these so we decided what happens if you were to freeze
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:56.200]   iPhone 7 carbonite and then shoot a missile at it like
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.820]   That's not gonna be a place
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.820]   Lifestyle rack to worry about that. No, no the only place where it really matters is
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:08.620]   It like day-to-day uses so I launched a game that uses unreal or that uses unity
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.980]   And then I had to switch to go answer an iMessage and then I went back to my game
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:17.420]   And if it has to reload again, and I'm waiting those 10 seconds for this massive 3d game to load
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.420]   Then I go answer another message and I'm waiting for it again
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:23.700]   If you can just bounce back and forth between those apps and that's hugely valuable from a user perspective
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.980]   And if all these phones can optimize to keep those apps available and to launch them fast when they do launched
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.100]   And that is just it's ultimately where we want where we want all the platforms to be
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.660]   Okay, so I'm gonna throw this article out
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:39.260]   I mean, it is what it is. It's like any benchmark is fine. You just have to put that in context
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:45.540]   What what to me what I I think it shows it's not you probably it's probably not that significant
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.660]   But it does show that Apple is designing purpose-built
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:53.620]   Software and hardware together this is always Apple's secret sauce right is if you want your
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:59.700]   Software to sing you design the hardware that it runs on a vice versa and that's what you could put a 2k display
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:03.740]   And I like they could easily come and exist they have companies that sell them they could put it in but right now
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:07.740]   They're if for those iPhones like they probably have better like higher resolution iPhones in the future
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:12.780]   But for those iPhones they wanted speed and they wanted energy efficiency and that's it was more important than pixel count
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:16.700]   They want probably they want oh let this point I would go ahead
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:21.840]   Well just that with everything there's there's such a balance is such a
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.660]   Varying definition of what is the right choice?
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.660]   What's the wrong choice right and that's as culture that's as much as a cultural question as an engineering question
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:35.020]   You can't you can't deny that if I've had I've had a OLED phones with 4k displays
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:42.300]   I'm sorry with the with whatever the terminology is for above 1080 whatever the call there's so much baloney that I can't
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.860]   I keep slipping on the baloney so I don't know what terms you were saying, but I've seen I've seen
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:53.220]   I've used those phones that have much higher resolution displays the iPhone. They're perfectly fine. They're perfectly snappy
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:57.180]   They're perfectly zippy and so it's not as though you can't do it
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:02.540]   It's that whatever the whatever the design path the engineers at Apple are on
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:07.220]   They don't feel as though whatever benefit they're gonna get from ultra high resolution is gonna be worth whatever
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:12.020]   They have to put themselves through and whatever they have to put through the consumer through in order to get there
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:16.300]   Yeah, and I think that I think Apple's has the advantage
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:23.660]   obviously of having the software and hardware and then also being a huge group even though Apple is not the majority of
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:31.860]   smartphone users they are one of the single largest, you know, like they're gonna sell this many iPhones that are all exactly the same
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:35.580]   which gives them, you know a lot of efficiency and scale and
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:42.780]   The ability to spend incredible amounts of money on technology that that other ones can't and then the fact that you have that all tied in where you're not
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:47.660]   Hoping that you're gonna get some kind of software upgrade or integration or anything else
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.660]   You can just decide that two years three years out
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.980]   Exactly what that architecture is gonna look like
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:58.620]   I think that that is still one of Apple's key advantages when it comes to doing that and they and I think that with it when they decide I
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.180]   Think they're pretty accurate at deciding what we think is important
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:07.180]   I you know, I think we'll all argue about the headphone jack as it as it comes out
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.420]   But I think when you know, I think OLED to the average user doesn't matter
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.540]   You know, I think that they we think it's cool when it looks great
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:19.580]   But I don't think people are gonna make choices based on you know, the knowing choices on image stabilization
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:23.860]   image stabilized phones the cameras before they make it on the screen
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.660]   I think you know, I think that that that output is more important well
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:33.460]   It's super interesting just because currently 3D touches linked to the LED backlight and OLED does not have an LED backlight
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:37.660]   So there are there are phones with LED that are introducing things that are very similar to 3D touch
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.860]   So it's absolutely possible to architect around it
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.860]   But Apple would have to architect around the current implementation to do it
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:47.980]   And then you have to wonder if technologies like quantum dot are advanced enough that Apple might just skip OLD
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:54.340]   You know, they did they used OLED for the watch so they they absolutely can do it and understand why when and where it has a huge
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:25:00.460]   Advantage to do it, but would they think oh, let's just go to led OLD now if quantum dot is next year or the year after
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:04.020]   So it's it's always it looks like I like Andy said, there's so much to balance
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:10.860]   Well, I think I think Apple looks at ROI and cost and R&D and allowing you know making sure that they what they think is gonna
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.860]   Make the difference in
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:17.340]   You know, make a difference in the in what people are actually going to choose to buy
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:21.020]   I think there's a lot of that rather than trying to make it the coolest thing every single time I
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:28.100]   Think they like making things are cool. I think they do but I think that they it I think there's definitely and I
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.660]   believe in ROI
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:36.020]   Do you feel like there's a fork in the road a little bit where I guess this has always been the case
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:41.660]   But it feels to me more like Apple is counting more and more on on lock into its products and
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.620]   Worrying lesson they never worried much about the competition
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:51.780]   But it feels like now they're almost going their own way like they aren't even really looking at what other like OLED screens
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:55.940]   Well, that's what well, that's always been that way haven't they it just feels more that way
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:01.660]   And I and I wouldn't necessarily call it lock in there. There are some ways in which boy and
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:08.420]   Jack I need to bring this up again, but there's an example right of Apple saying, you know
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:14.580]   We're in our own world at this point. Well, that's see that's and that's also always been true
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:20.140]   It's with with a headphone thing. We're not gonna go the fold for 14 rounds on that again
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:25.400]   But but the thing is that it's the world won't end when Apple releases phones. I don't have headphone jacks
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.540]   I will continue to say that I think that's a very
[00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:32.680]   Not anti-consumer, but at least a counter consumer positive thing
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:37.660]   But if people tend to keep their original headphones and wear them forever, they're not gonna care
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:44.540]   But it's I think that I think that there is part part of what gives Apple a certain amount of freedom
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:49.940]   And I'll spend that in a positive way is that they know that they are the only people that are gonna be selling phones that
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:27:00.200]   Run iOS and run iOS apps. So therefore if they want to make a change that they feel is important either for the future of the platform or for the
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:06.680]   Happiness and safety of their users or just for their own bottom lines. They don't have to worry about what happens when
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:14.480]   They're two nearly identical phones on the competitors phone costs $75 less and has a damn headphone jack and runs the same apps
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.320]   They don't have to worry about that. They can simply say, you know what we're the phone
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:23.980]   We want to make a year from now. We'll work so much better if we don't have to make room for a headphone jack internally
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:27.500]   So therefore it won't it won't it won't have any effect on this year's model
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.540]   But at least it will get us out of the way so that we can start the transition in towards the iPhone 10
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:37.420]   I'm also interested to see if they're gonna take advantage of you know leveraging
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.140]   The their their new purchase or newer purchase
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:46.180]   You know and and looking at this, you know of head of headphones
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.400]   You know one thing I've been playing around with a lot of Bluetooth headphones because I haven't really done that and now
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.940]   I'm thinking oh maybe I should think about it
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:57.680]   So I was you know been trying lots of them and you really get that there is this if you got it right
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.800]   There is a headphone that you'd want to put in that you can hear the rest of the world
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.900]   You can but just kind of there all the time you can answer questions and do stuff
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.540]   I might give you cancer, you know kill you later, but
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:15.300]   But but there is this I definitely you know, I think I that was kind of almost felt like a holy grail
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:20.080]   When I was you know for a long time where you I can answer questions
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.660]   I can answer the phone I can listen to my music
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:27.040]   I can hear people around me and and the thing is is the question is is you look at where apples going?
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:32.500]   You almost feel like they could make an argument if they did it when they release this if they had this cutting-edge
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.580]   You know hearing device, you know, you know, I think it could be an interesting
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:41.580]   I mean it could be used as a hearing aid it could be used as a a lot of different things
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:45.300]   And I don't know if this is actually gonna happen, but I started thinking that could be one possible
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.700]   way to do it and and the and the question really is then is
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:54.460]   Will Apple and this is a more kind of odd quite I mean dangerous question
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:57.700]   Will Apple continue to use Bluetooth to do it because Bluetooth is
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:03.340]   What everybody's using and it's very effective Apple doesn't have to necessarily play by that rule and there's when you deal with
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.900]   transmission of
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:09.980]   Audio for hearing aids for instance or for in studio heads that we have a couple of them that are
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:14.940]   We have transmitters, you know, they look like the Jack Bauer ones you put in and these wireless phone act
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:19.260]   These phone act receivers those can I have those I want those where do you get those?
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:25.820]   Phonak phone act makes phone actually have a whole they make hearing aids to they make hearing aids and then they have a whole
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:30.020]   Yeah, they have a whole division that's based on broadcast and a whole nother division
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.260]   That's based on defense and intelligence and all kinds of other stuff
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:38.140]   And so and so they you know that to use those and so but those transmissions are not using interestingly enough
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.780]   They can be set to take the same
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:50.100]   the same transmission as a what I call a calm context, which is what they you know, that's like
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:56.060]   Listening devices that it was originally designed for churches, but we use them on studios all the time
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:30:02.660]   And so anyway, so they but those frequencies in that transmission is definitely not Bluetooth and it's definitely higher quality
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:07.740]   And so the question is whether Apple not only maybe keeps Bluetooth. It's not like you can't use them
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:11.260]   But I don't think they would turn that off but they may to say hey
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:13.260]   We're gonna do this whole other
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:19.300]   Platform that is much higher resolution longer distance higher fidelity and Bluetooth
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.780]   Yeah, you know, like all we're gonna add all these things
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:28.180]   To it to make it truly a great wireless experience because the real problem with Bluetooth is that you know
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.940]   It doesn't go through your body very well
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.580]   so if you put your phone on one side of you and you put the ears on the
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.980]   Year's up here doesn't get through water very well and so
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:43.660]   So there's a whole bunch of things that Apple could improve on in that wireless transmission that could make a very valid argument
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.660]   What why would you ever want to have?
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.380]   You know wires again?
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:52.120]   There's a lot of reasons the more I test the Bluetooth that you still still breaks up
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.040]   It's cool, but it still breaks up enough that you know, it's not a good
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:31:00.460]   Replacement for wired, but it could be if you didn't use Bluetooth. Yeah, yeah
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:03.980]   Yeah, I'm gonna want to get the headphone thinking again
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:07.380]   We'll find out and we can all chew on that in just a couple of weeks
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:08.900]   I
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:12.980]   Think though, I do think it's somewhat related to that
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:20.780]   That a lot of people might opt to wait for the big talk right the 10th anniversary iPhone next year
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.060]   I wouldn't be surprised about people waiting three years they're betting on it
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:25.780]   How would they be?
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:31.780]   Well, you put out the headphone jack and get rid of that argument you figure it out make it work or what you know or whatever
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.780]   you
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:39.300]   Know, there's a higher percentage. I think I saw somewhere where there's a stat where there's just this huge number percentage of you look at people's buying
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:45.660]   Mentality they more are more likely to buy next year than this year anyway
[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:50.860]   And so, you know, you you kind of build up that that process you get the hard conversation out of the way
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.980]   Which is that we're gonna take out a component that you're used to
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:59.740]   And then make sure that the the next conversation is there and you bet on the fact that you've got enough lock in and and people aren't gonna change
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:04.780]   That you're not gonna really lose much market share until and then the next one just has to knock it out of the park
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.620]   Yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't be surprised if that's a calculation
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:15.020]   I don't know how much people are really aware that next year is a 10th anniversary of the iPhone and that it would affect their
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:19.260]   Really? Oh interesting. Well, again, it's second nature to us
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.900]   I just not sure how aware the real world is about that
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:28.540]   Unless you know the press decides to make this into a huge huge huge issue and make people aware that
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:34.460]   Try to scare people away from buying the phone. They're planning on buying this year not based on the features
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:37.900]   It has not based on whether it's a good value, but oh well, you know, there's a
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:41.620]   10 is larger than nine and it has a zero at the end of it
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:44.980]   And we all know how we humans love numbers that have zeros at the end of it
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:48.540]   And maybe they're gonna have one with a seat with a with a mechro CD slot
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:53.820]   So you don't have to even rip your your albums anymore. You can just I don't know. I like that
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:58.340]   That's good, I'll I'm sorry
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:04.260]   But I'll all all say is that I'm not sure that they would let Tim Cook would like to be on the on that analyst call
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:10.020]   Some quarter next year say yep, I know that sales of the iPhone 7 or we're pretty much dismal
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:15.620]   But we intentionally decided to lower expectations for this one for the big phone. We're making this year
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:20.660]   No, I think he wants to say it was our best-selling iPhone yet and our best iPhone yet. Yeah, yeah
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:25.660]   I think it's the other way around too. It's like the tech just by calling an iPhone like this year is actually the tenth iPhone
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:31.580]   So if they'd wanted to they could go up on stage and say we're releasing the tenth iPhone model and what our momentous occasion is
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:34.140]   And we made a big deal out of it. There's all new design
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:38.260]   But if that design is not ready, it's not ready at the technology that needs to go into it isn't ready
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:43.020]   It isn't ready and we saw this with Macbooks and Apple TV and a whole bunch of things is sometimes technology
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.340]   Just takes a while to get here
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:49.340]   So if if they can't do a major redesign this year the way they've done every two years up until now
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.660]   It's a great excuse to say next year that you know
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.260]   There's this great new phone and we waited for the 10th anniversary
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.100]   That's great marketing
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:34:00.860]   But I think the reality is Apple will always push out this stuff just as fast as they can and if they're there's a reason
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.780]   They can't do it then that's when you you sort of get the marketing on top of it
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:08.340]   I think Apple has probably a fairly good idea of
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:12.940]   They're pretty good at their projections. I think they know how many people will probably upgrade no matter what
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:17.540]   You know that there's a certain level of people that have like fours and iPhone 5
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:22.180]   It's just time and iPhone 6 is you know and there's a pattern to it and and and they're gonna
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:26.620]   You know get the new the newer phone and the reality is just you hang on to your phone as long as if you're a regular person
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:30.220]   You hang on the phone as long as you can and then you and then upgrade
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:35.540]   You know and and my basic rule is once I'm within you know for the company at least once we're within two months of
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:42.340]   September I won't buy a phone you know like I just that's fine but anytime before that right anytime before that it's just
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.500]   When you need it as new buy the phone as needed
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:48.780]   But but once you get within two months you're like if you can wait another two months and we can and we made that decision
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:49.980]   We've a bunch of iPhone 4s
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.940]   I think that we were that we had issued a long time ago that are dead and the producers are complaining
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:58.900]   And so we're so we're and I was gonna get them over the summer and I was like July and I was like gonna
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:04.260]   Just gonna wait till sometime. I just read an article. I wish I could find it, but this morning I read an article
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:08.380]   Well 4 a.m. As usual on my phone in bed
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:11.700]   Hovering over it so the light wouldn't bother anybody
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.740]   I
[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:19.460]   About battery life and how we really being advised not we're not being advised to do the right thing for our battery life
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:23.860]   especially with these fast chargers, but but most people don't care because
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:30.620]   Shortening the battery life doesn't make much difference when your phone is too. You're as a two-year and out device
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:35.420]   So that's why all these Apple doesn't really have a quick charge solution
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:42.460]   But the the new quick charge to and quick charge three which charges really fast shortens the life significantly of your battery
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:47.820]   Yeah, they weigh those options. They're the best they'll do for you right now is you plug it into an iPad charger and it will charge faster
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:51.860]   Yeah, so it's interesting you could make the case that other manufacturers are
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:55.940]   Are kind of pushing you to getting rid of your phone in two years Apple isn't
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:59.500]   Do you think Apple users keep their phones longer? I?
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:05.400]   Think they hand that there's a huge secondary market for iPhones and it's a huge gray market because knowing really keeps good numbers
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.900]   But when you add together
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:12.660]   That's why Apple in 18 to everyone is getting into reselling like when you when you hand back the iPhone subscription plan every year
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:16.120]   You get a new iPhone, but you hand back that phone and I know in my family
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:20.980]   There's like three generations of hand me down phones already in order of you. How old yeah, all the person
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:26.100]   Yes, that's exactly right. Yeah, and they I have fives and I think I have a phone one of my family
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:32.180]   Where's has a 4s still that they're using and it's not the primary owner like there's the early adopter who's always getting the latest and greatest
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.260]   But those other phones have a long especially the iPads
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:39.700]   I think my mom was using an iPad 2 until until this year until it conked out and it was way beyond warranty and we got her a
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:46.420]   Pro my kids were using the iPad 1 quite happily until the top half of the screen stopped working
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:53.060]   You know, but it was but it taken them that thing was much more of a tank by the way than the other than all the newer ones that interesting
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.580]   Yeah
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:57.020]   That's a good one for kids in other words. Yes
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:02.140]   They don't really care if they have the latest or greatest as long as they can play. What is it they play now?
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:09.740]   Pokemon can't yeah, it's Pokemon is dying. Isn't it? I know but it's dying. It's gone down from like
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:15.580]   120 million to 60 million so it's doomed way Apple like it will go down, but it's it's so high that it's
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:19.420]   It's dying, but it's gonna make somebody very very rich and is in their will
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:25.620]   Apparently they're doing the Harry Potter version or something next so really that that interest a IP is gonna last for a long time. Oh
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.220]   Yeah, that's right. They could do all sorts of
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:35.500]   Any good franchise they can get yeah, cuz it's the same game and people like it people just like going out and hunting things
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.420]   interesting

[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:51.220]   Probably probably not this month. What want
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.540]   Not new
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:59.060]   But I don't know but actually we will get that mac books. We'll get the mac book. No crows, right? We probably have the same old mac books
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.060]   We just got new mac books in spring
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:06.820]   Um, what what are you laughing at? I remember it was a year ago today
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:11.460]   Roughly no year ago in a couple of weeks that we were in london
[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:18.980]   And we went to maybe it was two years ago gosh time flies and we went to the apple music festival it kicks off once again
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:21.700]   September 18th
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:25.700]   If you're is it at the roundhouse again because that is a great place to go see it
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:30.260]   I just look for dal rimple and then I figure that's somewhere behind him
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:33.620]   Um
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:36.340]   Feral last year in one direction headlined
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:38.740]   Uh
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:45.060]   Well didn't they last year they kind of rolled out the uh the act's bit by bit 10 exhilarating nights
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:48.660]   Uh, and you can watch of course for free through itunes
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:51.380]   So you don't have to buy tickets tickets will go on sale
[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.420]   They're free. I think is if they do it the same way
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:59.700]   If you're resident of the uk, you can win for free, but you have to do some, you know
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.460]   You have to get in the drawing or whatever it is
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:04.260]   Apple news watch on iTunes or just apple music. Oh
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:07.060]   That's what's changed. You're right
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:11.140]   It was iTunes wasn't it now it's just apple music members
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:15.700]   Well, they had a direct that they would they made an app that you could download your apple tv or other things
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.140]   And you could watch it through that app. I don't know if it's just full put into apple music now
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:23.220]   No, that's what the apple announcement said. No, you nailed it. I I uh
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.780]   I stand corrected
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:32.500]   Um, here's the teaser video apple music festival 10 yachts at the roundhouse 18th through the 30th
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.180]   It was a whole month when we were there, but we can't went on the 30th
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:40.020]   And we saw plachado de mingo. We saw great opera
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:48.900]   London is such a great town of seeing music into it really
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:53.220]   You're no, you're in the home of the Beatles and the clash and
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:56.340]   Well, that was it. Uh, okay
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:05.140]   Not much to say there no hints follow apple music on twitter and snapchat for up to the music up to the minute music information
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.980]   hashtag amf 10 the 10th anniversary
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:11.940]   apple music
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:13.620]   festival
[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:18.740]   You were at the uh, sohoh, um, sorry the fifth avenue apple store last night. Weren't you? Yeah
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:24.340]   It's a that's a nice one of the things I noticed there that was pretty cool and it reminds me about that whole headphone argument is they had
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:27.220]   Beats headphones and I don't know if it was an olympic tie-in or not
[00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:32.740]   But they had flags like they had the canadian flag and the brazilian flag that were that was artwork put onto the headphones
[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:36.820]   And it made me realize with beats they really are doing that big fashion play like they did with
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:40.340]   The apple wash bands because they have the rose gold and the gold of course
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:45.940]   But now they're doing all these special colors and short runs so that you if you if you really want it you've got to get it because
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:49.940]   You don't know how long it's going to be there and that's an interesting move as technology becomes
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:55.780]   You know more mainstream and and changes less the cosmetic changes become more frequent. Are you excited about apple watch too?
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:58.420]   Yes, yes
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.220]   I'm an optimist though. You know, I'm a huge tech enthusiast and an optimist
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:03.540]   So I'm uncharacteristically happy about everything that comes out
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:07.540]   I just like I like the idea like to me
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:11.940]   It's very much like an iphone 3g where it's the same basic device
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:16.980]   But they've just added something to in this case a 3g radio because there are a lot of people who wear who love their apple
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:22.260]   Watch but they also wear a garment because they go outside and they run and they just really want gps
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.860]   And yes gps is a battery hit but so is the heart rate monitor people
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:29.540]   Especially with a 38 millimeter watch know that if they do two workouts in a day
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:34.420]   It's going to just kill their battery and they'll know the same way that if they have two gps sessions in a day
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:40.260]   It's probably going to do some damage on their on their battery now things like lte and and cellular
[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:45.300]   I mean apple's been prototyping those since before the apple watch came out and the thing with the original apple watches
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:52.740]   It's already running at the thermal limits of that casing so adding anything like lte would just burn your wrist off and or drain your battery immediately
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:57.140]   And that's probably not going to change until you know the lte chips get incredibly efficient
[00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:00.500]   Or the casing becomes bigger like some other vendors who make lte
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:04.820]   Watches that are you know much bigger in size like the the gps watches were
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:09.060]   But I think even if you just add the gps and you add the apple s2 computer on a chip
[00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:13.060]   Combined with watch o s3 and that that's that's a pretty compelling device to me
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:18.020]   Uh, you know, I wonder if the world this is another case
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:21.860]   uh where I wonder if the world will flock to un-upgrade or
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:25.060]   They'll it'll be people who haven't bought it yet. Maybe
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:28.020]   maybe convinced because they're runners they need the gps or
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.980]   I don't see people upgrading. Do you?
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:38.820]   I know you I don't I think I I I'm interested more more than the features. I'm interested to see how apple introduces
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.060]   new watch hardware
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:46.500]   Because you remember that the rollout and the both the first announcement and act the actual shipping
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.420]   presentation
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.500]   The announcement was kind of all over the place
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:56.020]   I think that if apple has learned anything over the past year year and a half of sales
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:46:01.380]   It's that people love it as a fashion item and they love it as a fitness device
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:08.340]   Everything else is a big question mark. So I would be I it sounds like i'm trying to be uh snarky here
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:12.260]   But if much of the presentation is here are wonderful new bands
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:17.060]   We've created or here are new here are new case colors we've created and the rest of it is nothing
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:24.180]   But we're not going to show you how I got live video of my garage door opening because I was able to unlock it from from bolly
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:31.700]   But be good and watch the door opening. I think they're going to basically say fitness fitness fitness health health health
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:38.580]   That especially when you're talking about the sort of devices that already cost 200 250 dollars and they're exceptional
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:41.620]   But apple is in a really good position to say well, why don't you spend
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:47.860]   If you're already in for two 250 dollars for one of these high-end garment watches for a hundred dollars more
[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:55.620]   You could get something that is a really robust app platform that is as well made if not better made and you won't be self-conscious about
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:47:00.260]   Wearing this wearing this to a family wedding as you might with your with your fitness band
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:05.060]   So I I don't think that we I don't think that the marketplace excuse me
[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:11.060]   I don't think the consumers have said much about their interest in having a computer on your wrist that runs apps
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.260]   Beyond its ability to simply push notifications to your wrist
[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:17.460]   But they have overwhelmingly said that we love fitness devices
[00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:24.020]   So if they were if apple worked to simply not even change anything about the apps anything about the design anything about
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:30.420]   The operating system and just simply start talking about it primarily as something for tracking health and fitness and making you
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.860]   Enjoy the fun things that you do even more because
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:37.380]   You're able to be more aware of how your body is reacting to your motion
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:42.180]   I think that that could be the biggest step forward apples made for the watch in the past year and a half
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:48.260]   I don't mean people those are like not even primary things for me for me the notifications my watch are the only reason that I don't
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:52.420]   Go back to an old one, you know, like it's you know, and a lot but lots of lots of ones do that
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:55.380]   I got I got an $80 thing that does that as well as an apple watch
[00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:59.940]   Right except that I I don't know. It's just easier to embrace with phone
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:05.540]   Ecosystem is yeah, I turn it on and just does the thing. I don't have to figure it out and it and it works
[00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:11.620]   You know and it looks nice enough and thanks for a number is that there's almost uh apple does not expect people to upgrade year over
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:13.220]   Year, it's the same way with the iphone 3g
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:17.460]   It was not expected to get original iphone owners especially because I spent a lot of money in the original iphone
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:23.300]   But there were a lot of people who never bought one and both with the apple watch two and with the rumored apple watch original
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:28.980]   That's getting a slight hardware improvement, but we'll probably if apple sticks to pattern come in lower priced here
[00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:35.140]   It's it's to get all the other people to get another 10 million another 20 million other 30 million people onto the apple watch platform
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:38.900]   Because that's their huge opportunity. There's you know, however many apple watches
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:42.820]   You think are sold is in the tens of millions and getting those people to upgrade is a very small market
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:48.900]   But getting the the rest of the hundreds of millions of iphone customers to buy their first apple watch is the huge opportunity for them
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:55.620]   Apple watch three sorry watch OS three it's it's trite to say but it really does make it feel like and you watch it is so much faster
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:57.780]   So much more coherent so much more focused
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:02.180]   Exactly on what Andy said it's focused on health. There's no more sort of people hub
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:08.340]   It's very fast to launch your most recent applications or your favorite applications. It's really good with notifications
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:12.340]   It does it really good with apple pay. It'll do cool things like unlocking your mac
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:14.660]   Which doesn't sound like much, but that's a whiz bang demo
[00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:17.700]   And when you have a whiz bang demo you show your friends and they get all excited
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:22.260]   And then they want it because it makes it aspirational and if they can just hit that tightly focused note
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:26.980]   When they debut the new hardware and then come in with the message of if you want to get the original apple watch
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:28.820]   It's now so it's such such such cheaper
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:34.340]   And we think you know, it's gonna encourage millions more people to get them then I think they start to build that product too significantly
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:41.220]   Still bumps me out that you have to own a luxury phone in order to get a apple watch that works with it
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:45.860]   I mean, I think I think that
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:53.220]   I believe that apple is sincere when they talk about all the benefits that the company can provide to people by creating this wonderful health platform
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:50:00.100]   I think that I really wish they had made it like the iphone as opposed to like a like an iphone accessory
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:04.260]   Where we're gonna make a hundred and fifty dollar price competitive thing
[00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:08.580]   That will work with anything that's got bluetooth le working on it
[00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:10.100]   because
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:15.780]   A we want to sell this to everybody from a business point of view you want to sell to absolutely everybody who's got a hundred fifty
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:22.100]   Two hundred dollars in our pocket, but also that we think that this is one of the most important things the initiatives that we're we've got going
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:24.580]   For the next five to ten years
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:28.180]   And what good is changing the world if you're only changing
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:33.780]   That percentage of the world that happens to own our products the iTunes on windows argument
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:37.700]   Uh
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:40.900]   Well, I mean, oh because like originally I threw the ipod is only for the mac and you know
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:43.380]   Not it was an accessible to everybody right when they convinced Steve to make
[00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:46.340]   iTunes for windows and suddenly everybody could use an ipod
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:50.420]   And right now the apple watch is only for people who own ios to buy only people who own iphones
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:54.100]   In fact doesn't even work with an ipad and the argument is if you made it accessible to android
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:57.060]   And there's so many more people who could buy it like like with the ipod
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:00.900]   I don't know how you know apple's not traditionally great across platform stuff
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.700]   So it might be a horrible android experience. You never know
[00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:09.780]   But that's the classic debate about whether you you keep it really tightly focused and make a really great integrated product
[00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:15.940]   Or you try to serve the vast majority of people wonder if apple had that conversation today about itunes remember steve jobs
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:20.980]   Attimately adamantly fought putting it on he said no and they said we're doing it anyway
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:23.220]   And he said if you guys if it fails, it's your ass and yeah
[00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:28.420]   And I wonder if that conversation were held today if that would even come up or would they just say you know what?
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:33.140]   This is this is back to what I was talking about earlier where I feel like apple's kind of in a fork in the road where it's saying
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:36.100]   Bye bye everybody else. We're going our way
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:40.100]   Well in beats is on android and that's because they need right it depends on your business model
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.100]   Like you need some products needs all your own
[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:44.660]   Android, okay. Yeah
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:50.900]   So uh, that's a good point. So they have they have done that but they haven't done an apple apple watch android
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:54.980]   But that you but the yeah, I mean, but there is a there is a difference. I think that
[00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:56.100]   um
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:52:00.420]   There apple has to do two things with music they have to be completely competitive
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:04.420]   They also have to bury any competitor that is weak
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:10.420]   And they're not going to kill spotify if spotify is the service that is the only service you can get
[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:13.860]   That's really wonderful and multi platform for the sort of stuff that spotify does
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:20.580]   If apple can say that we have integrated everything the spotify does we will support every platform that spotify does has as well
[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:25.620]   There are a lot of executives who work there that might be selling their second boat right now
[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:28.980]   And wondering and already moving their stuff out of their first boat
[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:33.940]   They're not they're not in huge trouble, but they can see a future in which they don't have a future
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:39.540]   Yeah, maybe it's a halo product you get your apple watch run up with your android phone and you realize wow it would be so much better
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:44.420]   If I had it with an iphone then your next phone is an iphone. I mean there's all sorts of ways to look at how that works
[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:46.900]   That's true, right?
[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:50.180]   If you really loved your apple watch you might you might then say uh
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:55.220]   By an i mean that was a thing where like you get your out your iphone. You like it so much. Maybe you get a mac
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.780]   You know, so it's right it's right. It is a business model
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:02.100]   In some ways when we talk about apple kind of veering off there. I think apples built in
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:07.380]   uh community or ecosystem is so large that I don't know if they have to pay attention to them
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.780]   You know, like I don't think they have to really look out
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:13.620]   Um, you know, they can definitely make products that just all work with each other really well
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:18.900]   And they're easy to set up and I don't have to think about it and and and some of it has to do with just resources
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:24.420]   I mean if if you've got a market that's going to be that is much much larger than the the the number of
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:25.540]   uh, uh,
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:29.860]   I you know apple watches that you're going to sell. I mean you're you're basically you're you're
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:34.580]   You're the market that the apple has within its own ecosystem is probably what?
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:38.900]   30 to 100 times bigger than what they've already sold into already
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.300]   So they they've plenty of work to do in their own ecosystem
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:46.580]   Which is different than the ipod because the ipod was selling into a very competitive market where they had a very small
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:54.100]   Uh position, uh, but here they have they have a lot of their own people to sell into why would they work on the other side of it right now?
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:59.860]   You know, Alex talked about this before too, but like you you make the apple watch and the apple watch by some estimates
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:02.660]   Where since it laid according to internal deadlines? They wanted to chip it earlier
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:07.140]   Many would argue it still wasn't finished and they didn't get really good with it until maybe this year
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:12.340]   To add android on top of that. It's just it would have been a phenomenal like a huge huge drain on resources
[00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:14.420]   They have to support all the different devices
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:19.540]   It's like making a mac app versus a windows app where you get all the all the co-co api is just bundled in and you have to
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:24.900]   Make it support all this different configurations of hardware that you're not certain about it because of money mental task
[00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:30.420]   We're building software. We had the on the mac. We would build like one version of or two versions of it
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:35.540]   For a couple different operating systems on the pc the software we built there was like literally 27 builds
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:38.260]   That we had to kind of support to make sure that it was going to work across
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:41.540]   chipsets and and graphics cards and
[00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:45.220]   Everything else and so it's not trivial to go out to an outside
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:51.300]   Um, and that was as a third-party developer for apple. I don't think there's they don't i don't think they have a strong reason to do it
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:58.100]   Let's take a quick break. Uh, there's a wall street journal article that kind of brings back what we were talking about last week
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:04.180]   Replacing Steve jobs how apple ceo tim cook has fared five years later
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:13.940]   What are you laughing at so I'm not laughing I'm weeping and i'm sure that i'm sure that at some point like you know what they have a newspaper
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:18.180]   They got a fill then is paper every single day. I'm just I'm just saying that
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:23.540]   I there are very few reasons why I would feel a lot of pity for a ceo
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:30.900]   Five million air like tim cook one of them is like can I go eight days without some
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:38.660]   Thing written about me that doesn't involve replacing ceo ce Steve jobs was a yeah, well, you know what i'm buying eggs
[00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:45.460]   All right. I'm looking at the sea which was I don't care how how Steve jobs would be in the same whole foods buying eggs
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:47.940]   I just buy I wanted to make a cake
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:53.780]   To be fair i'd be compared to how Steve jobs would be buying eggs. It is the fifth anniversary of the succession
[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:57.540]   We'll see this again in you know five more years, whatever
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:03.780]   But I mean you kind of this is when you would take take a step back and assess maybe no no all right
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:05.620]   I just I just feel like it's
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:07.460]   It's
[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:10.660]   If anything else it's five I would I would support that argument if
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:13.380]   As a nation as a worldwide
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:22.820]   Celestial being we all join hands and said we all get to spend the next 36 hours talking about the fifth anniversary
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:27.140]   Of steve jobs passing and the jobs that that tim cook has done
[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:33.700]   And return for this 36 hour orgasm of once again doubting what tim cook will be doing
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:37.060]   We never get to talk about this ever again
[00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:43.540]   And we assume that tim cook gets to do whatever job he wants to do in the best interest of apple and his
[00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:49.780]   Customers well, you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna close this tab and we are not going to talk about that story
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:52.740]   Take that last week journal take that w s j
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:57.700]   I think i think we should have a lot of you know asking each president how it is not to be a rhamelinkin
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:59.780]   I mean
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:01.780]   Oh, that's a tough standard you're right
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:04.180]   You got the reviewing phones underwater
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:07.460]   It's like you got if I had if I were one of those people who were
[00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:13.060]   Invited to like have five minutes on you two and interviewing the president. I'm john sure I'd ask
[00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:15.860]   What's it like to be the first black president? Oh?
[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:17.860]   Oh, it's like
[00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:19.860]   We're done. It's yeah
[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:23.860]   Or as zaklafinac has said what's it like to be the last black president?
[00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:26.260]   Oh
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:26.900]   ow
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:28.900]   Here's uh, homer simpsons, uh
[00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:31.460]   or the uh, the uh
[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:38.580]   Uh, the simpsons kind of take on this edison in the horse race of inventions kind of leading homer
[00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:42.980]   Okay, anyway
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:46.740]   Thank you to the jetroom for that graphical illustration of andes
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:52.740]   No matter how hard you try to write an opera you will not write an opera earlier in your life than moats art wrote it off
[00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:54.740]   Yeah, that's true
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:56.740]   Thank you. We did for everyone
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:00.740]   Uh, let's take a break our show today brought to you by my mattress
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:06.500]   Oh, good night sleep is so important and when you don't get a good night sleep you you can you underscore that statement
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.980]   You realize and I know much of our staff
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:14.980]   Has worked so hard to put up our new studio to get it working at least get it limping along so we could do some shows
[00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:19.540]   I thank them and I offer each and every one of them their very own castor
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:20.820]   Metris
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:26.180]   We don't have anywhere in the studio to put it, but we'll uh, we'll find some we'll find a storage locker for you and your caspers
[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:34.820]   The castor mattress. It's an online retailer premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost and they are revolutionizing the industry
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:40.500]   By eliminating resellers eliminating stores and and bringing you factory direct savings
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:44.420]   Of course, the first thing people say is but wait, how do I know if I like it or not?
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:51.380]   I want to I want to lie on it first and sure you I guess you could say that lying out on in the store for five minutes in the bright daylight with a
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:54.260]   Bailful gaze of the shop clerk
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:59:00.660]   Staring you down making sure you don't put your shoes in the mattress. That's probably a good way to test a mattress
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:02.660]   But I got a better way with castor
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:05.140]   You've got a hundred nights
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:08.180]   In your home with the lights out and no shop clerk
[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:13.380]   To see if you really like this mattress. They combine two technologies. I think you will like it
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:16.340]   springy latex foam and supportive memory foam
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:21.860]   So you get a an award-winning sleep surface with just the right sink just the right bounce
[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:28.020]   It did in fact win the 2016 business intelligence group innovation award this year
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:31.780]   Uh, so it is literally award-winning mattress
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:35.460]   But I give it my I give it the leo loport a great night's sleep award
[00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:39.940]   An obsessively engineered mattress at a fair price long lasting comfort and support
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:43.700]   This summer it's been great. You know we had the hottest july and recorded history
[00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:49.220]   You were glad if you had a castor because you it breathes it gives you cool sleep
[00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:51.780]   Which is so important?
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:54.180]   During these hot summer nights
[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:58.580]   You can easily buy it online and as I said, it's risk-free because you have a hundred nights

[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:33.220]   um
[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:35.220]   Actually speaking of Canada
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:40.980]   We were talking before the break, but we should before the show we should mention the performance a couple of nights ago
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:44.180]   Of the tragically hip the hip did their last
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:52.580]   concert appearance because gordo is uh, I'm sad to say dying of uh brain cancer and they did
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:59.940]   Uh, see nobody in the states really knows who the tragically hip are would you tell us Renee?
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.100]   So there was a I was gonna look for it quickly
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:05.620]   But there was this phenomenal tweet that tried to explain the tragically hip to
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:09.380]   To americans and it's just like if all of your cultural
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:13.940]   Icons got if there was a band that was made out of all of your cultural icons
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:19.060]   They had most of the most important music of your country and your generation and they were doing their final show
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:22.980]   And seab so here it is for americans wondering what's going on in Canada?
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:27.940]   Imagine a springsteen front at rem dylan wrote the songs and tonight is their last show ever wow
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:29.940]   Wow
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:34.340]   Was in kinkston the home of the hip august 20th broadcast
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:40.500]   Worldwide without and you mentioned this and I didn't know it, but this is cool regional restrictions by the cbc
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:43.780]   on the television on the radio and on the internet so
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:51.220]   Uh, they estimated more than 11 million canadians and others watched it which given the canada is a country of 30 million
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:52.580]   Yep
[01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:56.100]   That's a pretty pretty significant proportion of the proper and they let it go
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:03:01.620]   They they were on core after on core and they kept it going and the whole nation was was weeping you know in our
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:07.700]   Justin Trudeau, it was you know, it was just it was awesome there. He wasn't he opened it right he yeah introduced them
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:14.260]   I mean he's an interesting because we've had stodgy prime ministers for a long time and he's like out hiking topless and he needs
[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:20.100]   Stodgy getting what no he is he can explain quantum computing to you and he loves tragically hip so
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:27.940]   They actually their music is beautiful shank brothers up when I was doing the show in the toronto gave me the yeah complete tragically hip
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:30.820]   It's like 13 albums and they were really beautiful
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:36.500]   Songwriting I think though it I think it probably didn't do well in the states because it's very canadian
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:39.380]   I mean the the word it's about canadian topics
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:43.460]   I don't know I can I'll never understand why they didn't do well in the u.s
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:50.100]   Well when the late singer's name is gourd that's two of the two of the band named gourd
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:57.380]   And that's a perfectly good hockey name. I mean, it's your name. You know, hey, it's my middle name is gourd and so I'm never going to complain
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:05.140]   Uh yeah gourd downy. They have not said interestingly enough. They have not said it was their last tour, but it depends very much on gourd's health
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:06.580]   Yeah
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:11.220]   It was a big assumption, but I think it was just it was a nice tribute and I think it's showing that we're slowly
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:16.100]   Uh chipping away at those regional boundaries that have constrained so much of our content for so long
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:18.180]   It's fascinating though
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:25.140]   That this is such a big event in canada and not and really just kind of you know ignored around uh around
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:30.660]   I think that's actually something to say about for canada because canada spent a lot of money as you know
[01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:33.700]   Uh on protecting content. Yes, that's right
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:36.980]   You know, I think that I think that that this was this is exactly why
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:42.580]   Is so that they would have things that were that were really canadian and that didn't just get run over by their southern neighbor. Yeah
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:45.700]   Yeah, that makes sense actually. Yeah
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:54.580]   Um, they have very the ctrc their fcc has very strict rules about canadian content for instance when I went to do that show
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:59.140]   In toronto call for help. I could I was the only american allowed to work on it
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:01.460]   Everybody else had to be from canada for it to qualify
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:07.940]   I we had um unbundled cable for a long time in my province video tron would supply it and you could get 20 channels for 20
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:12.740]   Dollars originally or 30 channels for 30 dollars, but you had to have a predominantly canadian set of channels
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:15.380]   But the way they got around that was mtv, canada
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:23.140]   You know the discovery tech tv tech tv can yeah, so it had a small amount of local programming on our other wise us channel
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:26.340]   Yeah, of course, you know the historically funny story about sc tv
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:30.100]   Where is it just canadian? It was was america
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.900]   It was a american show, but it was produced in canada
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:38.740]   And so they were they had a requirement where they had to have some form canadian content in a re-show and show and so
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:45.060]   Rick or Anna said what what what what the hell you want us to do have like two hosers like sitting in front of big cap
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:51.460]   Canada just frying back bacon and drinking beer. Yes, that would do fine. And so they would simply do the
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:54.100]   Bob of the Kenzie brothers
[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:57.380]   Which became the biggest thing that ever export for him. Yeah, really wonderful
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:06:04.020]   But but but to the point though, it's I this is one of the reasons why the internet is just so great where it felt as though
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:12.260]   Um you canadians had your family moment, you know where you get to have your moment of
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:16.740]   This emotional moment as part of your own family
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:21.220]   But then after the event was over or slowly as it came to a close
[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:25.220]   It sort of leaked out to the entire world and now we start to appreciate
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:31.460]   Not only the music of this band, but why your country had such a fun fine connection to it
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:35.860]   We were saying talking about before the show that I was only aware of them in the form of wow
[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:38.500]   That's a really cool band name for the years before that
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:43.220]   But this got me listening to some of their music and buying a couple of their CDs
[01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:48.260]   Which are still on still shipping on the way and as and looking for any legal download of
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:51.620]   Of the of the show the cbc. I think
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:55.620]   Post is something to say that we will that we won't have this available online for streaming
[01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.700]   We will not re broadcast this ever
[01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:03.540]   I'm sure and I think there was some things that I've if if they i'm sure the hip will know what they want to do with this
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:09.940]   Recording after it's done, but we're this is this is a private. This is just for us and just for one air at one time airing only
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:14.020]   So I couldn't I've disappointed that I could only find a couple of the concert clips
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:19.620]   But as soon as it's available to purchase legally, I'm definitely going to purchase it legally and this is it clear
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:23.300]   It basically spread the the gospel of the tragically hip
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:27.460]   In a way that I don't think that even a successful world tour would never have achieved
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:30.580]   It would be really cool wouldn't it if they suddenly broke through and
[01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:35.300]   broke out. Yeah, yeah, well, but for the worst of reasons of course and
[01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:42.980]   And kind of at the end of the their tenure, but yeah, I just love to unread it wasn't it wasn't just like people posting illegal eclipse
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:48.500]   It was par people writing several paragraphs in a row of here. I was there at the concert
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:54.980]   I was here's what the hip meant to me and here is what they what you understand is that he almost they almost never do this many oncores
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:57.700]   And it really again really is like a wake where
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:01.780]   Not everybody coming up to the to the podium to deliver a solemn speech
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:05.060]   But just there's a drink in their hand and you've got to drink in yours
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:09.700]   And they're telling you something about why this relative that you never met was just so awesome. Mm-hmm
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:17.380]   As long as we're talking about the commonwealth, uh, there's a little bit of a to-do in australia going on right now
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:20.340]   A number of canadian banks are banding together
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:25.220]   West pac commonwealth bank national australia bank bendigo and adelade bank
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:32.180]   Seeking an exemption from competitive law so they can as negotiate as one and launch a collective boycott of apple pay
[01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:37.620]   Yeah, I mean it's not just apple pay they want to boycott google pay and samsung pay too
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:43.220]   Their stance is that the companies because they own the platform and the payment system have an unfair bargaining position
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:48.020]   And that they they they require they don't want to be charged with anti-competitive practices by not
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:55.540]   Negotiating with them so they want protection under australia law to boycott the negotiations until they can get what they believe is fair terms
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:09:00.580]   It's worth noting that they do enjoy sort of an oligopoly where there is only a few it's like canada
[01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:06.420]   There's a few federally charted banks. It's a very different scene than what you see in the united states where there's hundreds and hundreds of banks
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:10.900]   And we had the same problem in canada. We had no apple pay originally then american express
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:15.140]   Which is its own bank announced apple pay and then all of a sudden a few months ago
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:18.980]   all five of the major canadian banks and interact which is the
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:24.580]   universal platform for debit cards announced support for it and now it's just ubiquitous everywhere
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:29.540]   And the negotiating position is that apple takes a small charge from what what's paid
[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:32.900]   Uh, and in some countries that amount of money there is very different
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:33.540]   So in the u.s
[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:37.620]   There was a little bit more money and apples percentage wasn't that egregious to the for the writers?
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:39.140]   But in australia or canada
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:42.900]   Apparently there's less points that you have in between that spread so it was more expensive
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:47.780]   Uh for them to give apple a cut of that money or to give it to google or to give it to samsung
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:52.260]   It is more though than just uh tap to pay they the problem
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:57.780]   For as they see it is that on the iphone only apple pay has access to nfc
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:02.580]   On android devices. I mean this uh as a good example this note seven has both
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:05.460]   android pay and samsung's payment
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:10.660]   Procedure and other apps could access the nfc so I could have a commonwealth bank
[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:15.940]   Uh app on here use tap to pay but on an apple phone only apple can do the nfc
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:19.940]   And I think that is a big part of the reason they're uh, they're upset about all of this
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:25.140]   That is true. There's no nfc uh ap. I mean we saw it took a year to get a touch idea
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:32.660]   I ap I took five years to get a serie ap. I and there is no absolutely there is no nfc ap. But if you go back to what's actually best for the customer
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:37.860]   It's probably not having a diversity of apps on your phone that may or may not be secured may or may not be well written
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:43.300]   Most of the banking apps here are abysmal their web views that because the security procedures are so difficult to
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:47.380]   Enact they just have never updated them and they are you like you actually see
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:52.500]   Low resolution web buttons as the interface because all he did is wrap them in an app app or and they're horrible
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:56.100]   And I would never use them and I would have to I think I don't think they would cooperate
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:11:01.140]   So in a way just having whether it is samsung pay or google pay or apple pay having all of that handled
[01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:03.220]   It's sort of like I can go to iTunes and get a song
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:06.660]   I don't have to worry about going to every single music vendor having an account
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:10.980]   And having an app that does all my music I can just go to this big music button and do it
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:14.980]   And I think it benefits customers to be able to just go to that payment button and do it
[01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:19.540]   So it'd be nice to have both but I think the world is going towards a more unified solution for this
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:21.860]   It's interesting that we didn't have this debate in the u.s
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:25.460]   Because it is really anti-competitive in the sense that uh
[01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:31.940]   Verizon had a payment system which has gone away samsung's payment system is struggling only because apple
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:34.900]   Is it is a closed
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:39.940]   Well your law is at least secure pay and so the lot of people got very very nervous
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:44.180]   Immediately about the security because if it's provable that it's your fault suddenly you're on the line
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:47.540]   But I mean if i'm horizon, I would be a little annoyed it'd be like well gosh
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:50.020]   We wanted to have a wallet, but we couldn't have a wallet on iPhone
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:52.980]   We'll realize that there is such a thing as android pay
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:12:00.100]   And so what it doesn't exist on apple you got well see but that's probably got the you got the you got the 800 pound gorilla
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:04.820]   You got the 800 pound shark between the sea and the land there is no place for anybody else to live right
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:09.060]   At that point being you can make a third party payment system on a day of their device
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:11.220]   So this is even a payment system for doves good point
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:14.340]   I think that's any
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:16.420]   If that's better for consumers, I think well but that
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:18.820]   Be able to choose the payment system they want
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:21.700]   This is the best thing that android provides apple
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:26.420]   Which is that apple does not have the majority of the market so you would just say that this is an apple could just say hey
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:30.420]   There is choice right there's choice. You can always get another you can always get a different kind of not using you know
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:32.100]   You know like they're they're basically saying you know
[01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:38.260]   If if apple had 51 or 60 or 70 percent of the market this would be impossible like what they're doing right now
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:39.380]   would be
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:46.100]   Absolutely impossible but because they have you know if you look at the smartphone market they have a shrinking you know
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:51.940]   Margin of that of the of the total market. I think it makes it it makes that argument
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:57.860]   It makes any kind of monopoly structure very difficult to argue. I mean yeah, they own their own well, it's remember we've not
[01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:01.300]   currency we the wall mart attempts to do a
[01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:06.100]   Payment solution, but they didn't have access to NFC. So they had to do that goofy
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:10.020]   QR code solution. I don't know if they knew it NFC was legal
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:17.460]   I don't know. Let's be fair. They couldn't use NFC on apple phones and that really made they had to use us a less
[01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:24.580]   Acceptable solution that was really inconvenient for consumers and it killed it. Well, they also had enough. That's just using credit cards
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:26.740]   Yeah, I understand their other issues as well
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:33.460]   Also, also that the problem is that if they had full access to NFC currency would not have been able to deliver to Walmart
[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:36.260]   What Walmart wanted to get out of the system, which is?
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:41.140]   Absolute unfettered access to every transaction you're making not only in every Walmart store
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:46.420]   But in every participant in the currency cartel. So I don't think that I don't think that
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:51.220]   That apple or google gets any sort of an assist in the death of currency. It was just a terrible
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:58.820]   Terrible system that was going to struggle even if not for the even if not for the fact that you have android pay and apple pay to
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:00.500]   excellent
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:05.300]   Contactless payment systems to compete with so that's it was death by their own hand
[01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:09.540]   And I think it is scary for the banks because if you don't participate in this process
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:14.420]   You lose out on a lot of revenue there's there's credit cards that I don't have on my on my apple pay
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:17.860]   And as I can use it more and more more I use those credit cards a lot less
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:21.460]   And so that it you you have to participate in the United States
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:22.980]   I think pretty much as a bank
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:26.900]   Or you're going to be losing out on more and more of your of your ordering
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:32.900]   But in addition to that there, you know, you do see both google and apple stepping in between the credit card
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:36.660]   uh, you know providers and the and the credit card users
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:40.260]   And I think that there's a lot of opportunity there for them to to
[01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:43.700]   Make that gap a lot wider if they wanted to
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:46.820]   You know, it's a big retailer in australia called coals
[01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:53.220]   Uh kind of the equivalent of walmart and they want to do their own payment system and they're really they're joining in with the banks
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:58.260]   eventually the australia and competition and consumer commission has to decide by october
[01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:01.540]   Which cartel is right?
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.620]   Yeah
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:07.780]   I mean big retailers want to get rid of credit cards just because they see the fees that they're paying
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.940]   What if they just want to do a digital wallet?
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:13.140]   I mean, what if they just said we want to provide some competition for apple pay
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:17.060]   Because apple pay charges such a high price. We want to do a 1%
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:21.300]   Solution, you know instead of whatever what is a very powerful paid charges?
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:23.780]   it's it's not just that though they
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:27.060]   Just like a lot of card
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:28.820]   I think most car dealerships
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:34.580]   They don't sell cars. They are actually finance companies that use cars as ways of getting people into a finance contract
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:38.820]   And a lot of these larger chains they would love for you to use their own base
[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:43.940]   Their their own form of currency so that they can lock you into their own financial system
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:49.940]   Uh and perhaps be able to they they'd have to be subject to some regulation, but they've had a lot of freedom to
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:55.940]   Abuse these systems. I'm really really concerned about what would happen if any court were to rule that
[01:15:55.940 --> 01:16:02.340]   There is if there's any part of a phone or a popular piece of hardware a third entity
[01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:07.540]   Should have the right to access any component on that hardware for any purpose that they see fit
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:12.340]   And I don't I don't think there's an equivalency between nfc and this but in the broader sense
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:16.340]   It's the idea of what what happens if someone says i'm tired of using apples apis
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:18.420]   I want to be able to write things directly to the screen
[01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:22.500]   And why does apple have to why is apple controlling the the only
[01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:27.780]   Access to uh to pixels on the screen like well because they build your own damn phone
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:32.900]   Uh, I just I think that's kind of a straw man argument. We're just saying open the nfc
[01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:36.900]   I just I think there would be a positive thing for apple to open nfc
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:41.460]   There are a lot of cool things that i'm doing with my android phone because I can create my own solutions
[01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:45.700]   I'm actually here's this is i'm only mentioned because this really occurred to me this morning
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:52.260]   I'm having a problem where i'm still getting like my normal six to eight hours of sleep a day, but I don't know what
[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:55.460]   Spice I ate in any
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:58.020]   Takeout food that I had in the last two weeks
[01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:01.860]   But for some reason I am not able to fall asleep before
[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:06.580]   Like six or seven in the morning and then I sleep until two or three in the afternoon
[01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:12.820]   Which is proving it which is proof exactly it's like it's like my brain's preparing me for living australia or something
[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:17.780]   It's terrible and so I had this idea. I want to I'm going to write a new uh alarm clock app
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:25.060]   That requires the i'm going to build like an arduino or a raspberry pie thing an nfc reader in another room making a loud noise
[01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:27.300]   Where I physically have to pick up my phone
[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:32.260]   Walk into that room and touch my phone to this device in order to turn it off
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:34.180]   That's the only way to turn it off
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:35.700]   And that's a silly
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:40.660]   But the silly thing even though I think it's cool they intend to uh show it off a shark on the shark tank
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:42.980]   This season and abc walks for me
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:45.140]   But there there are a lot of little things like that with that
[01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:51.140]   You have to you have to I think that it's important to allow the third parties to find the cool in your device and nfc
[01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:55.380]   Just the ability to say i'm going to make things happen just by proximity
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:57.540]   And i'm going to tap this to hear it words
[01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:01.780]   My guess is that it's similar to touch id so touch id took a year or two make an api for because
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:06.660]   My understanding is originally they couldn't secure the token so touch id you would release a yes no token
[01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:10.740]   But the app could pretend that it got any token it wanted because it would just get the token. Okay. I got it
[01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:12.100]   We'll just say yes
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:15.300]   And so it took them a year and it ended up integrating it into iCloud keychains
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:21.620]   So now that token goes to iCloud and iCloud doesn't you don't you never know what it is iCloud just understands it and releases you
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:25.380]   The credentials or doesn't release credentials, and that's absolutely secure
[01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:32.500]   And there could be with apples nfc that they are trying to make sure that when they do make that api that there's no ability to scan for it
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:36.260]   As you walk because right now they're only turning it on right away when you do the transaction
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:37.460]   They're turning it off again
[01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:43.940]   So it makes it much harder to start passively pulling stuff off of like some people worry about nfc cards or or rfid and passports
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:47.780]   So it makes it very hard to intercept those things you got to be super close and super timely
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:51.300]   But if it could be it on at any particular point in time, that's much harder to secure
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:56.180]   So my guess is we won't see the nfc api until they they make it rock solid and they know that
[01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:59.380]   If it's it's turned on for any reason no one's trying to pull your credit card data
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:02.020]   No one's trying to pull trying to access anything on your phone
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:05.140]   It's just it's bulletproof and these are the things you can do with it
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:12.660]   That is a little self-serving because uh, I mean, I just have to point out you and I and everybody else is paying
[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:18.100]   For I mean that they just this charge is passed along by the merchants
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:20.580]   And the and the retailers to us
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:25.060]   And if apple has an any competitive position and can charge whatever it wants
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:28.020]   uh as they're a vig for
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:30.580]   Providing the transaction
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:36.180]   Uh and puts everything else out of business it could go up and up and up and we just comes out of our pocket
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:42.580]   So I'm not sure that's international so in canada at least my understanding is that the retailer is responsible for the credit card charges
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:45.860]   The user's response the customer is responsible for debit card
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:51.140]   I understand but retailers look at any cost retailers have in their operation ends up being passed on to you
[01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:55.940]   Well, some of them refuse to say credit cards because they want you to use your debit card because then you you pay the extra percentage
[01:19:55.940 --> 01:20:00.260]   Some of them here in the states would give you a price break if you don't use a credit card
[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:05.540]   Yeah, so I understand but I'm I'm just saying that ultimately this is something consumers should be concerned about
[01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:07.460]   because
[01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:12.660]   Any competitive behavior like this costs us money or we're paying for convenience
[01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:15.860]   I mean I can pay with my watch now and it may cost me to like a percentage more
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:18.820]   But I would probably pay that anyway if there was a subscription fee for my watch
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:24.900]   The ability to go and I I am not a fan of an apple a monopoly in this respect. Okay. That's fine
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:29.860]   I'll only say that it Renee is absolutely right. I mean it's it's absolutely correct to
[01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:36.820]   Ding apple or at least be concerned when apple has the technology that they're not letting third parties have access to but they've they have
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:42.020]   established a pretty reliable track record of making something that is only
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:46.740]   Under control of apple for the first year two years maybe even three years
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:50.500]   But then eventually they give access to everybody else
[01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:55.540]   I mean forever and sakes how long do we have to wait for cut copy and paste on our phones for god's sake
[01:20:55.540 --> 01:21:00.980]   But but the thing is so I mean with other companies I would be a lot more
[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:08.100]   Concerned about how the reason why they're not allowing third party apps or the reason why they're not allowing NFC is because they're trying to be anti-competitive
[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:11.380]   They're trying to kill other industries with apple. I will point out
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:15.380]   I will say that it's annoying that I can't do cool NFC stuff on my phone yet
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:23.700]   But I at least trust apple based on experience that when they feel as though they can create a system that will allow third parties to access
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:29.300]   And if see without compromising what apple believes right or wrong to be the security of the device
[01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:31.300]   They're gonna let that happen
[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:34.580]   When I also think that the margin the extra margin that apple makes on its phone
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:40.260]   Uh is far greater than the then all of the starbucks coffees i'm gonna buy between now and
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:44.420]   Maybe i'm not sure i'd say that remember
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:47.140]   apples of services company now
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:53.220]   And uh, there's a lot of that there's money to be made in uh, those crumbs that fall off your final
[01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:55.860]   Incredible headline sensitive
[01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:59.380]   Well, but this is an interesting point because until this story
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:03.300]   I don't even think I'd considered the fact that this is kind of monopolistic behavior on apples
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:09.700]   Well, they had a last year there were headline after headline about how apple pay was causing fraud when it absolutely wasn't it was completely immune from fraud
[01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:12.100]   It was a bank not cancer. Yeah, that was a bs
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:15.940]   Those are bs totally and we saw touch id came out and suddenly people are trying to break it
[01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:19.860]   I mean other companies have stored fingerprints and world readable directories and you barely see a headline
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:23.940]   But anything apple does is because they are so popular that is the equal and opposite effect of it
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:27.620]   And if there is any if there is a single breach to nfc you would see it everywhere
[01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:33.300]   And that's why the bug bounty apples new bug bounty program one of the highest amounts you can get is if you can pull any information at all
[01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:35.460]   off that secure element in the nfc
[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:37.540]   Well, I think apple house also has a reason to
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:38.820]   to
[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:44.180]   Not one of gouge people over you know the the the the per transaction because I think they're you know
[01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:51.780]   They're always making money on the entire ecosystem, you know, so it's not necessarily, you know, gouging on one area the other wouldn't necessarily
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:56.500]   Could reduce the the usage, you know of the ecosystem and so I don't think that
[01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:59.780]   I you know, it's theoretically absolutely they can do that
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:02.900]   But are they gonna go much yeah, probably any higher than what they're doing now?
[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:07.300]   I mean practical practical terms probably not we can we can also point out the fact that
[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:11.300]   ATM networks are not necessarily proprietary
[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:14.820]   Banks are operating with freedom and individuality
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:21.460]   That does not that is not stopped every single bank from charging a crazy stupid amount of money for a transaction fee
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:26.100]   Every time that you take money off an ATM sometimes when you're even using an ATM on your own network, so
[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:29.300]   It's not an easy question
[01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:32.820]   And I mean if I was apple, I would be selling this as a convenience
[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:38.180]   I guess you're paying me a percentage but look how much faster your transactions are happening at the cash register because people aren't putting in a chip
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:41.940]   And a pin or having to do a sign or and it's secure and if you do have a breach
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:44.260]   They're only getting one-time tokens. They're not getting numbers
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:47.540]   So this is the cost of what you're this is the value that we're giving you with apple
[01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:53.140]   Right one and I have to admit that I really want to see it, you know everywhere like I whether I'm doing web purchases
[01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:54.660]   What I'm doing, you know, like all the other
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:56.660]   Alex
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:24:03.300]   Because it's not it's not I get frustrated, but I do I have found myself, you know choosing one store like especially drug stores
[01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:07.860]   Uh, you know over each other because one's got apple pay and the other one, you know, doesn't
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:10.420]   We started off talking about
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:18.180]   Really super advanced features of brand new phones and things that only a company that operates at the scale of apple can do compared to smaller companies
[01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:23.220]   But really the things that really get right to the heart of a consumer are simple convenience
[01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:29.140]   Like I just placed my phone on top of or bring it near to a POS terminal and the transaction happens
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:32.340]   I don't have to fumble with my wallet. I don't have to swipe something through
[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:36.100]   I don't have to cover up the keypad because I need to type in a pin or something like that
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:38.900]   I just tap it. I wait for it to go bling and it's done
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:42.180]   Just this again this this morning
[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:48.340]   Uh, I went to the my local my new England my new England regional market
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:52.820]   Not their literally tiny mom and pop market though, of which there are only four that I also shop at
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:59.060]   finally upgraded their self-serve terminals so that they actually take uh android pay and apple pay and
[01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:03.380]   Just the ability to I don't have to worry. I don't have to think about it
[01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:06.420]   If I just drop my phone on here, not only is it physically convenient
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:10.820]   But I have no concern about anything being interception intercepted during this transaction
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:17.060]   And yeah, like Alex says this will help me to want to spend more money at this place rather than a place where
[01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:23.620]   I don't know if it's running x windows xp without any service pack somewhere in the manager's office
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:28.740]   Uh and skimming credit card numbers. Well, if you look at like online sales, I'm
[01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:33.300]   Generally, there's only a handful of places that I like to put my credit card anymore
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:38.180]   You know, like it's not, you know, like I got I got scammed once so what happened, you know from an online sale
[01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:44.100]   And so now I'm always like well if I don't you know, I will look at amazon and be an age first for most of my purchases
[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:50.340]   And and then I'm more likely to buy something from someone if if they've got the amazon pay that's going to give me like a little
[01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:53.780]   You know controlled window and and I'm not gonna you know that that type of thing
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:57.860]   And I think that you know, I'd love to have that be something that was ubiquitous with something like apple pay
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:02.980]   And I and I think that I think that really there we we think in these esoterica areas that well
[01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:06.500]   What we want, but I think that things might be mildly more
[01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:09.540]   More convenient is oftentimes enough
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:16.260]   apple acquired a small company called glimpse. It's a health data startup that allows you to share
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:20.900]   Your health data and control who it's shared with from different platforms
[01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:22.980]   uh
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:27.300]   In other words combining information from labs and hospitals and pharmacies into a single
[01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:29.780]   uh health report
[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:33.380]   Um apple has confirmed that they acquired glimpse, but not said what they're going to do with it
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:37.060]   But it's by the way glimpse with two eyes gl i m ps
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:42.740]   Glimbs apple from time to time acquire a smaller company. Yes, that's their statement
[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:46.260]   Uh, makes sense. This would be a great thing for health kit
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:49.060]   If we look at how this i can bind with some of the security
[01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:51.220]   Uh stuff that they showed at wwc
[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:55.380]   I think that they they fit hand in hand of truly making sure that that you can get
[01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:59.540]   anonymized data that is being shared for other reasons
[01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:01.540]   That is never going to come back to you
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:06.340]   I mean that's they spent a lot of time talking about that and I think one of the reasons they would do that is is
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:08.740]   For health reasons specifically
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:13.300]   I want to go ahead and share this all so that researchers can find out how people live
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:18.820]   Um and and how to make their life better and more healthy, um, but I don't necessarily want that to show up on my you know
[01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:20.740]   Uh insurance record
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:25.300]   Let's take a break and you guys get your picks ready because our picks of the week coming up in just a moment
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:29.540]   But first I want to pick texture. I love magazines
[01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:35.700]   I find magazines often have some of the best journalism going because it's kind of slow journalism
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:40.740]   Uh, you know, they take the time to write these stories, uh often. It's just a monthly magazine
[01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:46.580]   There's always something I want to read there's probably 20 magazines that every month there's something in there
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:50.100]   I want to read whether it's rolling stone or the new york or a vanity fair
[01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:54.180]   Gq I like to take the quizzes on cosmos
[01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:58.740]   I actually like to look at the billboard charts and see what's up in the ad industry with ad age
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:03.300]   So and for cooking, you know, I'm always looking for new recipes, uh bon appetit
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:07.060]   Great stuff, uh lots of cooking magazines
[01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:11.940]   All of these things are on my iphone because I have a subscription to texture
[01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:15.300]   Texture is like netflix for magazines
[01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:18.900]   All the magazines you want hundreds of the best magazines
[01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:25.060]   For one flat monthly rate very affordable too. So you don't have to subscribe to those magazines
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:29.140]   You don't have to buy the newsstand issue for just one article you save money
[01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:36.100]   You save coffee table clutter. I guess this week you'd probably be wanting to read sports illustrated about uh, the uh, you know
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:38.740]   The olympics and our top athletes
[01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:43.460]   Well, there you go. You see you maybe you don't want to subscribe you around, but this is one you want to read
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:44.900]   It's in there
[01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:49.300]   Because you get them all you can read the magazines offline too download them and you read them on a plane
[01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:52.420]   Or on the beach where there's no internet access
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:57.380]   It's easy to remain curious about the world with top stories and new and noteworthy sections
[01:28:57.380 --> 01:28:59.620]   So you don't even have to know about the magazines to find
[01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:07.940]   Subject matter you want from mac world and national geographic and pc magazine and popular photography and popular science
[01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:10.740]   sound and vision
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:12.900]   Texture is awesome
[01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:18.260]   And because you can access your account on five devices you can have it on your iphone
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:24.820]   And your ipad and your wife can have it on her iphone in her ipad and there's even room for one more give it to grandma
[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:27.380]   texture.com/
[01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:32.340]   To it no more stacks of national geographic in the basement grandma. Sorry. I've got them all
[01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:34.340]   On my ipad
[01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:41.460]   You also get bonus content. You can't do it in print magazine like videos over 200 of the world's best magazines one low price
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:46.580]   It's a great deal and you could try it free right now. I encourage you to do it. You're gonna get hooked texture
[01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:54.180]   Text you are e.com/twit sometimes I feel guilty about the stack of magazines piling up
[01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:56.260]   next to my bed
[01:29:56.260 --> 01:30:03.780]   Texture eliminated at all. I can read it all on my ipad texture.com/twit give it a try free
[01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:09.700]   Right now time for our picks of the week. Let's start with rene richy all the way over there
[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:13.140]   I Renee so hi. So I have two for you Leo today
[01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:16.500]   So one of them I'll just mention quickly is a few weeks ago
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:22.260]   Ivan kristik who is head of security at apple gave a talk at black hat and it was semi-historic because apple's never done
[01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:25.780]   That sort of talked before at black hat and it was the fundamentals they yes
[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:27.780]   They announced the the bug bounty
[01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:34.020]   But he also did a deep dive into the fundamentals of iOS security a really great talk and it's available on youtube now
[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:36.580]   So if you haven't seen it if you missed it if you weren't at black hat
[01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:39.860]   And this might be a better fit for steve gipson and security now
[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:46.660]   But I just wanted to let everybody know that if you're interested in how apple is looking at privacy and looking at security and and how they want to keep your
[01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:49.460]   Information on your device and keep it safe. It's a phenomenal
[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:54.340]   I would love this is great kudos to apple. They should do more of this high
[01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:58.500]   You know deep dive stuff because there are people like us who want to know the stuff
[01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:02.420]   And that's great reach out and tell people what you're up to I love that
[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:08.420]   And he's a guy who did bit frost. He's the guy who did sandboxing. He's the guy who did uh enterprise the rootless stuff
[01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:15.220]   So it's it's he's phenomenally clever about these things and it's great that they put him up on stage and now by the way he explains why
[01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:22.740]   Some components in iOS 10 are not encrypted. Yes, because who cares if the boot logo is encrypted, okay
[01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:27.380]   Yeah, no, and he's really really forthright. It's a he's a really really smart guy
[01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:33.700]   You know even if you disagree or whatever the fact that they're out there explaining it saying here's we're thinking about it
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:35.140]   Here's our thinking
[01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:40.740]   Fantastic. Hey smart. Like if you're gonna hate them hate them for legitimate. Yeah, right. Yeah, right. Yeah
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:46.820]   Yeah, so my other thing is I've been traveling a lot and there's very little that hits my battery harder than roaming
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:54.260]   Because just different towers or tunes different networks and if I have a rogers phone on AT&T or if you have an AT&T phone on rogers
[01:31:54.260 --> 01:32:00.180]   Wherever you go typically when you're roaming your battery gets hit harder the things that use up battery are radiation based
[01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:04.180]   The screen is on the screen is bright. The radio is ramping up trying to keep a connection
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:12.500]   So I travel with battery packs usually and yeah because there are things like snapchat now and there are things like Facebook and there's things like pokemon go
[01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:15.940]   The average power consumption on our devices has never been higher
[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:19.780]   What apple originally said 10 hours of battery life and internet on wifi usage
[01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:22.340]   They meant like checking your mail checking a few web pages
[01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:26.340]   They didn't mean looking at all this video, which is constantly like snapchat stories
[01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:31.540]   A huge amount of data. I've had to up my data plan almost doubles since I started using snapchat
[01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:38.420]   Facebook notorious for staying alive in the background pokemon go you have the screen on all the time and the gps firing
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:40.500]   Because you're always out catching pokemon
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:45.140]   So what I did was I broke down and I bought yet another battery case and this one I got I have to admit
[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:47.460]   Because it was rose gold they had the colors
[01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:51.300]   Scratch my surface and you will find more surface
[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:53.540]   uh, so
[01:32:53.540 --> 01:32:56.500]   This is just a huge and that surface will be rose gold
[01:32:56.500 --> 01:33:01.460]   I mean until until the rose the space blue one is out. It'll absolutely
[01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:03.780]   B rose gold and I mean i'm off
[01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:08.180]   He did a great job because these things are increasingly people are more fashion conscious about them and they are
[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:10.660]   integrated into our lifestyle match pretty well
[01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:15.780]   It matches so I'll hold it I'll hold it up to the camera, but it matches pretty perfectly
[01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:21.780]   Uh because that's a hard thing to do because apples rose gold is is really a unique shape. I'm trying the wrong way
[01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:24.580]   There we go. Yeah, it's good. It's really really close
[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:28.180]   And you put them together and you're kind this is like you don't have to get one this big
[01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:31.460]   This is just silly, but if I find that I was stuck at an airport
[01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:36.180]   My plane was five hours late and airports are notoriously bad for radio reception
[01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:38.500]   And the Wi-Fi is not always great either
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:44.100]   And I would just I would have not been with a phone for three of those hours if I hadn't had a massive battery case with me
[01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:48.980]   So I just put it in my pocket. I connect the lightning cable and and it will recharge two or three times
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:53.620]   It says four or more times. I think 8x is is the official labeling on it
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:57.860]   But if you're using it and the screen is on and the radio is ramped up while you're charging
[01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:02.500]   It's never going to be as much as it would in the lab, but it's it reworks for an iPad works for an iPhone
[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:04.820]   It's USB so you can plug in your android phone
[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:06.180]   You can plug in your headset
[01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:10.580]   You're I have these noise canceling headphones and I'm wearing the Bose ones that require charging
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:17.300]   So I can just plug in anything and it charges fairly quickly and I'm just back on and that's priceless to me when I'm traveling the ability to stay connected
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:21.860]   I'll say it's a having a big big honkin battery
[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:25.860]   That's like going through life knowing that you are loved by god
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:31.460]   Because you feel as though you feel as though there's very little that can really truly harm you with
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:34.020]   I've got a big huge anchor 22
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:40.020]   2200 battery and given that like my usual travel machine is an iPad knowing that if I
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:44.260]   Don't see if there's a hurricane and there is no power for 72 hours
[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:49.140]   I'm perfectly I don't even have to like not binge watch columbo on Netflix
[01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:53.860]   If I don't if it does conserve anything because I've got at least two or three changes of battery here
[01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:58.340]   I kid it's like one of the simplest however much you're spending on whatever piece of kit
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:04.260]   You're about to buy round it up to the next 100 by buying battery packs because again
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:08.020]   It's you've got the sort you've got the shield you are invincible. Yeah
[01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:12.580]   You go
[01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:15.060]   I've had a macbook. I've connected to it as well because if you
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:21.300]   That was the first thing I tried when apple sent me the macbook for review like oh, please
[01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:23.700]   Please don't be the apple of
[01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:30.180]   2009 that would definitely have just put in something artificial to prevent it from charging from an external battery
[01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:36.180]   And it's like yes, you are I get 23 hours of battery life just by having this big that
[01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:41.860]   Anchor battery, you know, and that's one thing that really bugs me about hp made that macbook clone the specter
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:45.140]   And it will only charge than hp charger even though it's a type c connector
[01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:50.260]   Yeah, and that's just artificial. There's no reason not to work with other you're throwing away an advantage of usbc
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:57.060]   Why would you do that? Why would you take only the disadvantage of having a foreign connector that the user doesn't have any copies of makes me so angry?
[01:35:57.060 --> 01:36:04.100]   Yeah, but anyway, I'm super happy about this nice very pretty my giant me and my giant battery tell us the name and price again
[01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:08.420]   Uh, it's 100. I think it's 150 us. I paid way more in Canada because Canada
[01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:11.860]   But it's it's the mophie and it's the power station 8x
[01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:17.460]   I think I got I went for the big one the big one and you can get your choice of colors get the big one
[01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:20.740]   Yeah, Alex Lindsey pick of the week, sir
[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:25.380]   So I went out and we're looking for the right head headset to give to
[01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:28.500]   Folks that are doing production the right bluetooth headset
[01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:33.700]   I didn't want to cable when we were to set your phone down and be able to walk around and and do what you need to do while
[01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:39.460]   While you're working and still be connected and so you know, I just bought a whole bunch of them and um and tested them
[01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:43.300]   And the one that we like the best now, it's not the fashion most fashion conscious one
[01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:49.140]   Um, but it is the the one that was the most effective from a point of being loud and and have good clarity
[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:52.180]   Is this this little guy here? Now this is a uh
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:56.660]   You know, let me pull it out. It's like it's a bit of a headset. This is a blue parrot
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:58.820]   Um vx
[01:36:58.820 --> 01:36:59.780]   Yeah
[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:06.020]   This is the blue parrot vxi or i'm sorry blue parrot 3 b50. Yeah, sorry. That's the b 350 xt
[01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:10.660]   That's the headset truckers use they love because it's so there's a lot of reviews. Yeah
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:16.980]   Like this is great in my car. It's like it's so good. Yeah, yeah, so great noise cancellation
[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:22.660]   Um, a boom is kind of required for us because we really all we care about is that we can understand what you're saying when you say
[01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:29.380]   You know, the speaker, you know, the person is not gonna get on stage in time. Right and so um, so anyway, so it's it's simple
[01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:35.540]   It is a little bulky. Um, you know, it's not like the tiny little whatever, but what we were looking for it's kind of a big battery though
[01:37:35.540 --> 01:37:38.020]   That's why right last a long time
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:39.540]   it
[01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:44.100]   Uh, it also is comfortable. It's not in your ear. Right. It also
[01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:48.020]   Uh, the boom might definitely makes it more, uh, you know
[01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:52.580]   It makes your voice clearer and you can hear everything clear because it's got a bigger, you know, it's got a bigger speaker
[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:56.180]   So who cares if you look like a time-life operator? Who cares?
[01:37:56.180 --> 01:38:00.740]   It looked like the bottle sparkle act so so so what if you look like a mission control
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:05.060]   Engineer during the Apollo era. Yeah, what's wrong with that? It's how it's actually
[01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:11.060]   If you can't if you can't walk around with one of those snoopy caps that they would use in the command and service module
[01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:15.540]   That that's for me. There's there's just that and then there's 800 points below that
[01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:18.260]   But that looks like it's at the top of the below that it's awesome
[01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:20.740]   Honestly, I would wear one of those
[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:27.460]   You know, if you're really all you're looking at is I don't want wires, but I do want clarity both what I hear and want and what other people hear
[01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:33.380]   Then you know, because that's a big reason why I choose the headsets that I choose are is actually the the you know, how they are on the phone
[01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:37.140]   Um, and this is the best one we found for for bluetooth
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:45.060]   Blue parrot the b350 x t the choice of truckers and alex lindsey everywhere
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:51.780]   Here we go truck it. Yeah, it's funny because uh, I know about this from the radio show because we got a lot of truckers listening
[01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:54.900]   And they all love that blue parrot there. They love that
[01:38:54.900 --> 01:39:02.340]   Uh and in our co- oh I should mention I was uh if okay, you could use that wimpy little battery
[01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:08.580]   Okay, you could use that wimpy little battery, but if you really care you'd probably spend 500 bucks on this
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:13.620]   The powerhouse from anchor. It's a 400 watt hour
[01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:18.260]   Not milliamp hour watt hour portable battery supply
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:20.740]   Is that fuel seller nuclear leo?
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:25.940]   You could charge your laptop 15 times
[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:32.740]   With this puppy, uh, look at the guy in the hammock. He's got his phone. He's a robot that carries it behind me
[01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:36.580]   It's a little big it's a little bit. The type of you here is me ordering
[01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:38.500]   I'm like, yeah, is that awesome?
[01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:45.220]   I see at 12 vote that's pretty damn hot car socket for fast charging usb ports
[01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:50.340]   40 charges on an iphone. That's amazing 40 iphone recharge is pretty impressive
[01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:52.580]   This definitely is going off a bit
[01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:56.660]   If you're not to be the hit of any pokemon party you bring that oh, yeah, baby
[01:39:56.660 --> 01:40:00.660]   Put that down and dollar refills isn't that nice anchor does good stuff
[01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:05.780]   It is a little pricey at 500 bucks, but i point out that it can it can run your mini fridge for seven hours
[01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:08.260]   Yeah
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:11.300]   Hey, what a deal perfect 400 watt hours, baby
[01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:13.940]   Perfect and the anaco your pick of the week
[01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:21.860]   Mine is so simple, but I like it so much. It's a little utility called pip tube pip t ube for ios
[01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:27.220]   All it does is it will take you ca you copy a youtube link
[01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:32.340]   And then you go into the today tab where pip tube blibs and you tap a button inside
[01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:38.260]   Today and it will play that youtube video using ios is built in video player
[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:44.340]   Which means that you can finally watch youtube using the picture and picture functionality of ios 9
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:50.180]   Given that i spend so much most i would say that i at least spend as much time
[01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:57.220]   Watching tv shows on youtube and i'm talking about the really great original content that gets produced on youtube
[01:40:57.540 --> 01:41:03.540]   I was used there was a new x robots dot uk dot co dot uk video that i watched in its entirely
[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:09.620]   Immediately before running into the studio to be here at two for for for for mac break
[01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:15.860]   I watched so much stuff on youtube that it just annoys me that i can't use the youtube after use picture in picture the most
[01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:18.820]   You do most picture in picture necessary feature
[01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:24.980]   For for youtube, I don't know why google had google does slide youtube does slide over
[01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:31.220]   Does everything except for the thing that i really really want so i it annoys me that you need something as bonehead stupid as
[01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:38.420]   See this link open it in open create a container for it using the built-in video player and let me have picture in picture
[01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:43.780]   I was happy to give uh jessie caron i'm snot cross and i'm correctly
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:51.300]   Corona and k you are oh any and two dollars for this because it's like why does the youtube app not do this
[01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:53.300]   Nice
[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:57.460]   You what is it pip you pip pip to p i t u b
[01:41:57.460 --> 01:42:03.700]   And i swear to god after i found this i was looking for like video players that did this after i found this i'm like
[01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:05.460]   uh
[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:12.980]   I must be stupid there must be like there must be an update planned to the youtube app or there must be another app that's much more
[01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:19.380]   Complicated than this because i was afraid that the there's gonna be like ads in this or it was gonna be one of those
[01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:23.700]   Like russian slash chinese developer names that makes you suspect
[01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:26.180]   What's happening to your web traffic or whatever

[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:49.220]   Fabu
[01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:50.980]   You guys are great
[01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:56.180]   Uh, always a pleasure and welcome to the new uh twit east side studios tests we call her

[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:07.140]   Uh on this the same bat channel at 11 a.m pacific 2 p.m. Eastern
[01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:10.100]   That's 1800 UTC Tuesdays
[01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:12.900]   And maybe uh, let's see
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:19.700]   I will guess that's about two weeks the week after that right so close rene richy in studio because
[01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:24.980]   He should be in san francisco around september 7th. He should be fingers crossed fingers crossed
[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:27.380]   He should just be in town. You never know
[01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:32.180]   Either working exceptionally hard or just just every time i've bought pre-bought
[01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:35.620]   Flight flight flights and hotels like okay
[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:41.940]   I'm either gonna be super busy these next four days or i'm gonna have lots of time to visit all of my friends in san francisco
[01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:43.940]   Indeed any sweeping gun around this too
[01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:44.500]   Got a time
[01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:49.220]   What's your prediction though? It probably won't be at must sconey or the arab of wina center right? It'll probably be
[01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:56.020]   My guess is that there's the last three events where bill bill graham and it's sweetening them really well for the apple tv demos and then for the
[01:43:56.020 --> 01:43:58.660]   Getting a bunch of people in there for ww dc
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:03.060]   So I think they've outgrown your but and camp and ac2 isn't ready yet. So
[01:44:03.060 --> 01:44:08.980]   It feels like bill the graham is there go to for a while or you know we should just go check this schedule
[01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:13.620]   The bill graham is a auditorium and see if there's anything going on on september 7th
[01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:19.140]   You know it could be the last major. I think it will be right that they do outside of the
[01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:26.180]   Yeah, what are the chances that uh, there could be a small mac ipad or something event in october, but yeah
[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:31.780]   What would it be wild if you got an invitation that said join us on the new apple campus?
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:35.780]   I don't think it's ready. Yeah, where are your rubbers?
[01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:38.900]   It's a little muddy
[01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:41.380]   It's you're flying me on a drone
[01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:50.420]   As as i'm sure leo you have absolutely no familiarity with there's a difference between having the structure all built and having it actually serve wire
[01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:57.940]   Entireling it all the little things that make it habitable actually working there. That's like 80 percent of the project and so I don't think they're quite finished
[01:44:57.940 --> 01:45:03.540]   I was hoping I was I was really hoping that they would debut it in september, but oh well
[01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:08.020]   The flint center was two years ago. I just think that that they save that for really epic things
[01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:11.220]   So just do yeah, I'm just saying there doesn't look like
[01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:16.900]   Rheology there's anything going on at the bill Graham civic until september 21st
[01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:20.900]   That's when de aunt vaud comes into town
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:26.740]   Great, so if they can bend yeah, they're your people aren't they a south african rap doe. Yeah
[01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:31.540]   Yeah, oh those are the guys from uh the movie from um
[01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:39.140]   Plan line from outer space just 51 no that's from uh um um
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:42.900]   Oh, you know the robot uh chappy chappy. Oh
[01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:49.700]   Yeah, well they were great chappy. Yeah, I didn't realize that they were actually uh
[01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:55.780]   A thing ninja that yo landi and beat annihilator dj high tech will be in town
[01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:03.700]   But that's not till the 21st. So uh they could be an event in there for apple anytime in the next three weeks
[01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:07.620]   It'll be so much easier when you can just assume it's gonna be at apple campus too. Yeah, right now
[01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:12.500]   Yeah, I'll I will I will say that I'm sorry to see
[01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:18.260]   Everything moved to the apple campus because it's such a pain in the butt to get there from september
[01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:23.060]   Yeah, and the alternative is to spend just basically book your hotel in
[01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:25.780]   in cooperatino, which is
[01:46:26.020 --> 01:46:31.300]   Lovely if you want to visit the apple store a couple of really great burrito places, but san francisco
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:35.940]   There's a lot of thing. I will say you're spending a lot of money for a weekend week in the area
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:42.340]   Maybe you'll have more fun and the nightlife in san francisco. Uh, wait, I meant there's the juniper hotel cooperatino
[01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:45.140]   It's part of the hilton curio collection
[01:46:45.140 --> 01:46:48.020]   If anybody has a sufficient better at sweet so
[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:54.260]   149 dollars a night right right off a highway 280 and that's for a weekday
[01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:59.700]   Yeah, yeah, it's not normally about tight you get you get you get into those world in the weekdays
[01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:01.540]   in
[01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:05.780]   In the south bay the it's incredible like motel sex will be like 300 bucks a night
[01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:10.180]   Yeah, you get to the weekends because everyone's all coming in yeah, it's business. So yeah, so wait
[01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:16.100]   So then you get to the weekend and it's like a hundred dollars a night, you know, and so it's it's completely inverted from what we're normally seeing
[01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:17.940]   Yeah, I've never seen jumin or junior
[01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:22.180]   Runder 400 bucks when I've needed to go there. Wow talk talk but awkward though
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:25.380]   Like I once got an airbnb and it turned out to be tim's house
[01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:29.540]   It was like a small talk we had to make for three days
[01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:32.420]   Was absolutely dead like exercise bike
[01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:37.700]   Every every time I came in there with my android phone and said you have an outlet where I can plug this in
[01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:40.180]   Oh boy, that was
[01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:44.580]   It was like I put his under I was drawing my underwear in his microwave. It was
