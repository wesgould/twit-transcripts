[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.120]   We had to put you out in left field.

[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.880]   And on our third baseman Renee Ritchie.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.720]   I'm going deep Leo.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.440]   I'm going deep.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.800]   Catchers and pitchers report.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.840]   Let me see your studio now.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.720]   You've got, I saw your vector video now.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.160]   You're going video on the vector.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.120]   Thank you.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.680]   So you had to set up an actual studio with purple lights.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.480]   Well, I just made them purple because your lights were purple.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.680]   I wanted to feel like part of the team.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.480]   Oh, aren't you sweet?
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.200]   You with a hue, you can do anything.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.360]   I know it's almost like having a lighting person up in the rafter is just going purple.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.600]   I know.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.320]   I love it.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.800]   I love it.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.600]   Nice mirror Vaseline on the lens and I look normal again.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.040]   So update all your devices.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.560]   There's a new iOS in town and a new Mac OS 2, right?
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.440]   Updates all the OS is all the OS is TVOS 2.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.320]   We are now up to 11.2.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.920]   Point six.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.240]   We are safe from Tagaloo.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.200]   It's all the fault of Unicode.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.560]   I blame Unicode.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.200]   Unicode.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.520]   I started asking around asking a bunch of developers who work on messaging apps and
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.880]   Unicode parsing.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.560]   I mean, apples had a particular string of problems.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.360]   They had it with Cyrillic.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.880]   They've had it with emojis with non-breakspace characters.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.240]   And now with the glue characters and it's just getting that input from Unicode.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.920]   And showing it on the screen, it seems to sometimes result in a world of.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.920]   So Tagaloo is an Indian language.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.680]   And I'm trying to find the character, but I guess nobody wants to show it.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.920]   No.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.760]   If you hadn't updated it would just crash whatever application you were trying to show it in.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.880]   And then you would restart it.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.560]   Just pronounce it phonetically.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.760]   It'll crash your speakers.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.360]   It's not the first time this is had.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.840]   There's not the there've been many text bombs, right?
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.480]   It's again, it's the Unicode parsing engine.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.640]   Once in a while, it just encounters a character that causes the entire thing to give up and
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.560]   run home in the most fiery, painful way possible.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.920]   As you might imagine, Russell Monroe has his response.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.480]   Here is the secret leaked list of major 2018 security vulnerabilities.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.920]   No. 1, Apple products crash when displaying certain
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.760]   Telugu or Bengali character combinations.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.840]   No. 2, an attacker can use a timing attack to exploit a race condition and garbage collection
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.120]   to extract a limited number of bits from the Wikipedia article on Claude Shannon.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.040]   No. 3, at the cafe on 3rd street, the Post-it note with the Wi-Fi password is visible from the
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.680]   sidewalk.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.560]   Are we supposed to figure out which ones are true and which ones are false, Leo?
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.280]   Is that this game?
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:43.120]   Flaw and some x86 CPUs could allow a root user to deescalate to normal account privileges.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.320]   Apple products catch fire when displaying emojis with diacritical remarks.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.640]   Haskell isn't side effect free after all.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.560]   The effects are just concentrated in this one computer in Missouri that no one's checked in a
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.960]   while.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.720]   Nobody really knows how supervisors work, but there are a couple of these.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.920]   Apple, Apple products grant remote access if you send them words that break the I before E rule.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.200]   But my favorite is this one, Apple products execute any code,
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.880]   printed over a photo of a dog with a saddle and the baby riding it.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.840]   That's part of like, yeah, that's a that's a core graphics bug, Leo.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.520]   Turns out the cloud is just other people's computers.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.320]   See, you hate these jokes that are actually true.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.400]   I'm going to have to remind people of that.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.560]   The cloud really is just other people's computers.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.800]   Other people's computers.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.520]   Anyway, that's the most.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.120]   I think meltdown reminded us of that, Andy.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.600]   Ex-K.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.600]   Hell is other people's computers.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.680]   I think Dorothy Parker said that.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.200]   Let's see.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.520]   Well, we've got now the big developers conferences from Google, Google I/O dates.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:03.360]   We've got build dates and we may have Apple's not announced, WWDC dates.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:11.520]   But according to Mac rumors, there is evidence to suggest it may be Monday, June 4th through
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.360]   Friday, June 8th at the McHenry Convention Center in San Jose.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.240]   That's where it was held last.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.480]   They wouldn't do it.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.560]   I guess the new Apple's Steve Jobs Theater is just not suitable for the WWDC.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.200]   No, it's for keynotes, but it's not for developer conferences.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.440]   And they were super happy with McHenry Center last year,
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.280]   so that's every reason in the world to believe about it.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.960]   In San Jose, you need lots of nooks and crannies.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.040]   That's a small meeting space, sort of space.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.760]   So an Apple does not want 5,000 developers just meandering throughout the park.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.760]   If they did want to do it at McHenry Center, which they did last year,
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.680]   they would have to do it in that first week of June, because it's booked in the other weeks.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.280]   Apple has always done WWDC in June.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.800]   They could go back up to the Bill Graham Auditorium in San Francisco, I guess.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.520]   I don't know whether it's...
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.800]   That was just for the keynotes as well, and then they went to Moscone for the actual...
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.640]   Moscone, that's where they did that.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.840]   They could do anything they want.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.280]   I mean, they're a huge company with unlimited resources.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.520]   They could have it in the Twin Cities, if they wanted to.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.120]   They could have it in a flotilla in the middle of the ocean.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.560]   You know, that would be super cool.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.520]   It's not practical.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.280]   That way you avoid this.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.560]   One of the reasons Apple wanted to build the Steve Jobs Theater is so they could have their
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.120]   announcements without the press figuring it out from looking at calendars of local venues.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.720]   I think they should.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.360]   They should tie together barges in the San Francisco Bay.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.520]   Nobody would know ahead of time.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.480]   Didn't Google try that?
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.320]   Oh, well, they put a storm in the bunch.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.040]   Actually, that would be a very Apple thing to do, not barges, but if they were to lease
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.680]   a few cruise ships so that this is not...
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.640]   This is your living space.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.600]   Isn't it the cool?
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.960]   But also it means that they could control people leaving and coming and going to control
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.320]   the internet access.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.280]   They could have...
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:01.280]   Imagine if it's like people are stranded on an island of only Apple for an entire week
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.960]   where nobody can tell them what's happening on the mainland.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.080]   They can't tell anybody else.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:11.360]   They can really spill every single secret knowing that no one's going to know for an entire week.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.120]   Unless you got scuba gear.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.240]   Yeah, Motorola would have scuba gear.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.240]   What would we see at WWDC?
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.360]   What would Apple talk about?
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.920]   The operating systems.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:27.680]   iOS 12, backOS 12.14, watchOS 5, tvOS 12.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.320]   We've already got the hint from Mark Gurman that they are going to be, at least in the iOS space,
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.520]   more performance and reliability and stability updates than big new features.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.800]   I think Enifread broke that.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.480]   That's right.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.040]   It was Enifread.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:41.520]   You're right.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.160]   Mark followed up on it with specifics.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:44.960]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.920]   It was a really...
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.680]   We talked about the Tweestorm from Sonoski last week and that was built on the back of this
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.760]   and that you don't turn a battleship in a second.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.800]   Then Apple has been last year at WWDC Craig Federica.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.560]   Craig Federica said they altered their plan so that they weren't just doing feature after feature,
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.240]   but they were giving the teams and the individual contributors time to work on the things that
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.600]   really mattered to them.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.680]   This is sort of an extension of that where they were doing a series of sprints.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.640]   They made the iPhone, they made UI kit, and they were just doing marathons of sprints over and over
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:14.960]   again.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.480]   It was a complete grind.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.800]   Now the operations are mature and they have different things they have to solve for.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.560]   And it's gone are the years where people like iOS is not innovating anymore.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.320]   Android's got all the innovation and Apple felt like they needed to really ramp things up.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.080]   And now it really is about adding core features that are super important to where they think
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.920]   the product needs to go, but also taking the time to make sure that the foundations that they're
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.920]   built on are really, really solid.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.480]   And I don't know if they're going to have a secondary team to do that.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.760]   If the primary team is still working on those new features and there will be other people who
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:49.120]   maintain it and solidify it going forward, but it feels like something that Apple has to invest
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.280]   in heavily now.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.720]   Would we see any hardware announcements?
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.240]   Maybe that's where we see the Mac Pro.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.480]   Yeah, great to see it.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.480]   Be great to see it.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.360]   If we're going to be seeing a new evolution of the Mac books, like it's been rumored for
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.680]   the past couple of weeks, that's going to require some developers support.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.080]   So we might see some teases there.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.560]   I'm wondering though, since they had such a problem getting the home pad rolled out after
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:18.240]   making that announcement and there was so much tension about the iMac Pro announcing it in
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.640]   advance and then having to deal with everybody saying every single week, is it out yet?
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.640]   Is it out yet?
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.640]   Is it out yet?
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.920]   Maybe that have affected their desire to tease something and actually show something
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.800]   off before they know exact before before it's actually on the barges heading heading there
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.800]   their way west.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.280]   There's also interesting way where they'll have a March event or not because they have
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.080]   March events not every year, but several years they didn't have one last year.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:46.080]   They had one the year before and there's still ready to have that event this year.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.080]   Because WSC is not often about hardware, it's sometimes about hardware, but we've had several
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.280]   years where there's no new hardware at WWDC and those are often the years where we have
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.960]   March events for Apple Watch or the 12-inch MacBook or new iPads or something like that.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.160]   So Apple's going to balance those two things because now that they have the Steve Jobs
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.760]   theater, they can do exactly what you said Leo and that is they can drop a March event without
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:31.480]   having to coordinate with your bibwenn on or anywhere else.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:38.200]   So March would be iPad not iPhone obviously, but iPad.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.960]   I had as soon because they had the last iPad that WWDC about nine months ago and they've
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.440]   traditionally done 12 to 18 months for iPads not always yearly.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:57.000]   Okay so it could be the fall or it could be in June or it could be in March.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.880]   March would be a very good time to update the lower end MacBooks because that's been
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.920]   a lot of purchasing decisions are being made for fall.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:11.880]   That's also a good time for iPad rollouts for much the same reason, but also because
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.840]   it's a good time to make it.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.880]   If they've made a decision on the larger size iPad Pro, that would be an excellent time
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:25.320]   to do it particularly because of their branding of the iPads as real computer reserves.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.800]   So much better than so much as good as computers that they can't even call them computers anymore.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:35.080]   I wouldn't be surprised to see an iPad announcement or a low end MacBook announcement.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:41.880]   Maybe if enough for the fact that they made such a big update to the Apple Watch so recently
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.840]   I would be thinking about a big update to that.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:49.360]   Maybe they would have now surprised drop or a new feature rollout for that even before
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.160]   WWDC.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.920]   There's very few things that make a lot of sense for March, but that's the stuff that
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.320]   you're thinking of.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:02.520]   I'd be surprised if it would be of any kind of a new phone because when does it benefit
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.880]   them to have that released in March as opposed to later in the year?
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.000]   But that's just a guess.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.320]   Just historically they did the original iPhone SE in a small town hall event in March a few
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.320]   years ago.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:22.120]   Then last year they did the red iPhone 7, which you don't think that color really matters.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.000]   But a lot of people color really matters.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.640]   Introducing a new color is like introducing a new design and people get super excited.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.160]   So a new color for iPhone 8 or iPhone 10.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.560]   Especially because this year the word on the street about the Samsung Galaxy S9 is that
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.560]   it is not a very incremental update.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.200]   It's not wow, whizbang entirely new design.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:45.680]   Very similar and they might not want Samsung to own the spring discussion about telephones.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.200]   Also the iPhone SE isn't a fall.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.040]   I'm not thinking of it, the iPhone SE is not something that they're selling in the United
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.240]   States as much as they're selling overseas.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:00.120]   But it's designed to appeal to markets that aren't going for the thousand dollar phones
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.680]   and typically that's not the United States or that's not the US and Europe.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.560]   But what event is happening in March that they would like to piggyback on to that's
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:14.960]   in let's say India where you really have to deliver lots of value for the money in order
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.840]   to have a big success or at least have an aftermarket success.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.840]   Well we'll look forward to finding out.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.360]   He's won a red iPhone 10 so badly Leo.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:33.280]   Here is the by the way thanks to the chatroom naked security sofos.com has the tokulu character.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.360]   That is a sexy character.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.560]   I actually know that I think of it.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:42.560]   I've seen that like on Reddit and stuff people obviously are trolling other people by putting
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.560]   that character in there.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.560]   I don't know how you would make it show up.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.560]   What does that catch you up?
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.160]   I don't know who speaks to Gulu.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.160]   Oh I don't know.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.160]   How about you?
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.360]   Could I do translate?
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.360]   Right.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.200]   Well I can't so sofos is not stupid.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.640]   This is not the actual character.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.560]   It's a picture of the character.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.560]   Right.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.200]   Because if if this were the actual character my Mac would have crashed.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.200]   Whoa.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.760]   I'm sure Google could ocr that right into assistant Leo.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.360]   Oh you know I could try maybe.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.680]   Actually you're probably not wrong.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.000]   Yeah what if I did just is Google lens now.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Computer computer tell me what this is.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.160]   Let's see now you got me.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.920]   I want to know now.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.480]   Text this character to the person who cut me off on the street yesterday.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.560]   Yes sort of a here's the camera.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:38.080]   Okay tap what you're interested in interested in that.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.080]   Your protection we have.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.880]   Here's what I found.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.080]   Yes.
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.760]   What did you find?
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.360]   Nothing absolutely zilch.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.360]   Her screen is dirty.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.640]   Facebook I found Facebook.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.040]   I found Facebook twit and a thumbs up.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.840]   Glad you like it.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.280]   Let me let me try that again.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.040]   They have ASCII emoji to Leo.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:07.200]   Tap on what you're interested in right there that.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.200]   It's not translating.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.920]   Okay I'm gonna grab my Android phone.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.920]   It's part of by the way we've been saying it wrong.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.920]   It's Telugu.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:13.920]   Sorry about that.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:14.920]   Sorry.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:15.920]   Telugu.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.920]   I've been saying it wrong too.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.080]   Everybody's been saying it wrong.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:25.080]   So if you if you haven't updated your Mac, your iOS devices, did Apple TV and Apple watch?
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.080]   They got updates too.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.080]   Was that also?
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.760]   Apple Apple watch will render eye messages.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.760]   So it's a sure.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.040]   Yeah sure.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.400]   And once you're updating all the parts.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.160]   Is that all the update was when was there any I mean they don't know they're not always
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.160]   coming up.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.000]   There was a second fix that they actually put up in the public notes.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.080]   It wasn't anything major and then there's the usual list of things.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.320]   I wonder if you're pretty much a question get it out by Monday.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.520]   Yeah and we're kind of done with the specter meltdown stuff right.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.600]   It's it's done as long as you tell people think of new exploits.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.600]   Right.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.600]   Everything that could have been done immediately has been done and I was just patching new
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.200]   holes in the canoe as they appear.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   People will be happy to know has filed for a trademark for the classic rainbow Apple logo.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.400]   It's because they got around to it.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:19.840]   It will be I guess they're going to do the retro stuff.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.360]   So I didn't know the history of this.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:28.920]   It was designed to replace the Newton yeah logo back in 1977 designer Rob Janoff created
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.920]   it.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.920]   It lasted 20 years Steve Jobs replaced it when he came back to Apple in 97 with the monochromatic
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.920]   logo.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.640]   I didn't realize it's been that long now.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.560]   They have a t-shirt with that logo and cups with that logo for sale at the Infinite Loop
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.560]   Apple store.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.560]   They should.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.440]   That's what I was thinking now that they're now now they're again selling products with
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.440]   it.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.680]   Perhaps they want that to be a defensible canonical.
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.680]   Oh I should be.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.160]   The question is whether the chicken or the egg question did are they creating those t-shirts
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.900]   just so that they can create a stronger trademark meaning hey look we're using the
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:04.760]   same thing as commercially we have not abandoned this mark or are they now trademarking because
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.680]   they intended to do more with it.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:13.120]   Because that's for a company that is so adamantly against its own nostalgia.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.360]   It was a great thing to see the color logo back in the Apple store at least in the mother's
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.360]   ship store.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.160]   But I wouldn't be surprised if it was simply oh let's say we won't be able to defend it
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.040]   unless we can say we're about to lose this trademark because people could argue that
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.960]   we have completely abandoned at this point.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.000]   I really I really like the rainbow.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.780]   It is it has that great to start.
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.180]   What I didn't realize is we have had the other one for 20 years now.
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.180]   Right yes.
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:40.500]   So this was the Apple's first 20 years and now the monochrome is the second 20 years.
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.020]   But they still say bleed in six colors.
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.020]   It hasn't left.
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.780]   Yeah no it's very much in our consciousness.
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:52.580]   Somebody gave me old Apple stickers the rainbow stickers yes which was so nice to have.
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:53.580]   And I probably shouldn't have.
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:19:00.760]   I think I put it on a laptop should probably have sold it on eBay but never the last paper

[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.640]   Oh, I am.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.640]   Dambiso Moyo.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.640]   This is a problem.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.040]   I have so many books I want to listen to.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.040]   That sounds great.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.640]   I pretty much read anything.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:47.920]   Well, it's actually this is actually about economies and Dambiso Moyo is one of my favorite
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.920]   authors.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.320]   I mean, a cowboy West.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.360]   She means us now Western world.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.520]   She really digs into it.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.640]   I agree with her.
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:59.400]   I think China is about to march right in.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.440]   Well, it gets really into the details of the issues that we've had in the past and how
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.600]   we've structured things and so on and so forth.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:12.440]   It's a she's out of actually I believe she's out of Uganda and she's former consultant
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:17.920]   for the World Bank investment banker in emerging markets at Goldman Sachs.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.920]   Really?
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.920]   Oh, this sounds amazing.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.920]   She's got a couple books.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.640]   And this happens to you as it often does and I've run out of credits now because I've
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.240]   bought all the books I could buy.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.800]   I'm going to add that to my wish list.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.560]   And then when you when you then get a credit every month, you can go to your wish list.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.960]   My date is the 22nd.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.320]   So a couple of days I'm going to get to.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.760]   These are all the books I have on my wish list though.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.480]   My dad's listening to Grant right now, the new grant.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.480]   Oh, I hear that's wonderful.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.480]   He said it's just amazing.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.760]   Ron Chernow's autobiography of Grant.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:49.440]   I really want to listen to this because I'm a fan of Bill James.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.760]   If you're a baseball fan, you'll know about Bill James.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.120]   He created Sabre Metrix.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.240]   He was the statistician that really revolutionized baseball.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:04.320]   He's written a book using Sabre Metrix, using statistics to solve a century old serial killer.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.920]   And he believes he solved this.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.600]   So I can't I cannot wait to read the man from the train.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.200]   Anyway, you could see we have a problem.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.680]   We have an audible problem and two books.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.680]   Two little times.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.680]   This is the only way I actually read books.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.680]   Oh yeah, I don't quote unquote read the book.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.680]   I fall asleep.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.880]   No, I don't believe really.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.960]   There are times when I'm on a task, but on something like this, I love all the time.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:33.400]   I love to be cleaning my house, doing my yard work, doing those types of things while listening
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.600]   to a book is the perfect.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:40.600]   Well, we've just gave giving you like hours to listen to.

[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.000]   I think they're testing this out.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:58.800]   They want to see if people like the idea of texting to their short code Macbreak to 500 500
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.760]   show them how the power of the Macbreak audience.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:11.080]   Next company today selected Apple as the most innovative company in the world.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.080]   Wow.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.920]   Bum bum bum bum bum.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.920]   That $2 to get you a cup of coffee.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.000]   Bill Schiller's ass was incredibly happy.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Courage, my friends, innovation, my, you know who.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.040]   I think that, you know, Apple certainly right in there.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.440]   I know, you know, I absolutely, absolutely.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.760]   I wonder how the HomePod is doing.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:39.120]   I mean, regardless of how it does as a product, the computational audio and the computational
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:43.520]   photography and all those things are a data technology that I think we'll see expand as
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.520]   time goes on.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:49.400]   It's a typical Apple product where it's kind of a hint as to where Apple's going.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.200]   It sounds a different way of doing things.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.200]   You like the sound?
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.200]   I love it.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:01.960]   It's not, so I have a, in my office, I have already a pretty good stereo system built into
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:08.440]   it, but it's really surround sound for my TV.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.280]   And so it's really loud and it feels good when you're watching movies and everything
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.280]   else.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.600]   But what I was amazed by was the HomePod was so much clearer.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.840]   Like I just felt like I could hear every instrument.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.560]   You know, there was something, there wasn't, it was just this.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.200]   And so now everything sounds muddy.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.600]   Like after you used to listening to it.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.000]   So I find myself listening to it for hours.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   And then I turn on, you know, there's speakers in a lot of rooms.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.840]   It's like putting on glasses and seeing the world and then you take them off.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.120]   And it's, and I probably like that.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:36.440]   I have this, you know, like I, the house that I bought happened to already have a bunch
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.440]   of speaker systems.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.600]   I didn't put them in, in a lot of the rooms.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:44.160]   And I, I now walk around and I, you know, put them in the living, turn on the living room
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.160]   speakers or whatever.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.760]   You're like, ah, it's a little, it's a little muddy.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.120]   You know, like, you know, and I did, it was sounded great.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.120]   It got spoiled.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.760]   And I'm already ready to like buy a second one once they get the stereo thing working
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.720]   because I have a feeling that it'll be amazing.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.800]   You know, but it's, I think that it's, with songs that really take advantage of it, I
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:07.560]   did find that I had to go back to Spotify and up the ante on all the, I can start hearing
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:08.560]   the compression.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:13.360]   So you don't mind using the live, the air, air, air play to play the music.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.680]   Yeah, it's a little delayed, but it's otherwise it was fine.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.200]   I didn't, um, all my playlists are on Spotify.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.560]   So it was just really hard to.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.640]   I use, so I use Apple music really only to request songs.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.680]   You know, like, I just want to play.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.360]   Why don't you make playlists on Apple music?
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:31.760]   Is it not as, I mean, I have like, you just done, I have like 80 playlists on, on Spotify
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.360]   and I haven't gotten around to, to moving them.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.280]   And, um, for some reason I liked, I find things faster.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:42.360]   Like the other, I find it's faster for me to kind of build a playlist on Spotify than
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.360]   it is on Apple music.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.360]   And so it's just, um, anyway, that's why I do it.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.480]   I don't have a strong opinion about it, but I really just kind of the habit Apple music
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.840]   came late, you know, and so, which we talked about a lot.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.840]   So.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:00.000]   New, here's another one for you to debunk Renee.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Cher's fall.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.880]   By the way, I don't know how much they fell or whether they're still falling, but Cher's
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:11.320]   fall on fresh report of even greater reductions in iPhone 10 production.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:19.640]   This is, uh, the, the whisper rumor from Nikkei that, uh, Samsung is planning to make 20,
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.720]   it displays for 20 million or fewer iPhone 10 units.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:29.800]   Uh, let me just see if apples, you know, I think apple shares falling means the, at
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.400]   the moment they wrote that story.
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.880]   Oh, well, maybe yes.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:33.880]   Okay.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:34.880]   There you go.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.440]   So this is the one day.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:43.360]   It's not, you know, a huge blip if you look at five days or one month, it's still higher
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:49.080]   than it's been since, uh, January 23rd, it looks like.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.080]   Uh, all right.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.080]   But if we look at like, let's, let's go back to the, you know, one year, it's like, it
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.080]   has, it has ups and downs.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.500]   There was this big dip, uh, at the beginning of the month.
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.500]   Was that the same rumor?
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.800]   That was, I think it was a lot of dips in the beginning of the month.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.800]   That was the stock market, right?
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.800]   Everything was going down.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:07.880]   It reminds me of what that, what that, uh, market maker said was a two weeks ago that
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.480]   apple apple should really only move when it reports earnings and announces new products
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.120]   and everything else is manufactured.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.520]   That's a, wow, that's perfect.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.280]   That's exactly right.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.280]   The rest of it is speculation.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.520]   You never know because DK has, DK has a great reputation, but they've also published articles
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:28.280]   that had absolutely no foundation in the past and Samsung is a wonderful company, but they
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:32.440]   have also been known to leak stories because they didn't get the contract they wanted or
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.960]   they wanted to put pressure on the contract or they wanted to move the, like they were
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:39.560]   negotiating, they wanted to move the price of NAND flash or the, so you're sick all
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.800]   stuff with a grain of salt.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.520]   And again, apple had a huge quarter and they traditionally sell less in the quarter after
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.520]   the holidays than they do in the quarter with the holidays.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.560]   So from now on, I'm just going to build these stories as a buying opportunity.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.560]   Yep.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.560]   Yes.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.760]   Also, also, I think I can't think of any other company who CEO during a shareholders
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:01.560]   meeting has suggested that shareholders sell their apple stock if they're unhappy.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.200]   And that's happened, I think more than once with tip cooks meetings.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.760]   So everybody knows that apple is a long term hold stock that if you're, if you're going
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:11.960]   to react that quickly to an unsourced article somewhere.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.640]   Yeah, this is not the stock for you.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:18.800]   You'll be happier investing in vinyl or something commodities.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:23.000]   What would you do to improve the iPhone 10?
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.720]   I'd reduce the price for one.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:30.600]   By the way, the other rumor is that Samsung's S9 will be about a hundred bucks more than
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.680]   last year.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.280]   So Samsung is looking at apples pricing saying, yeah, we can charge more.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:40.440]   Yeah, the announcement is going to come probably next week.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.440]   Exactly.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:47.040]   And so by the way, we'll be streaming that live, I think 9am Pacific, noon Eastern.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.880]   We're going to be doing the live stream of the Samsung announcement.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.440]   I'm sure they'll announce a price then.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.440]   What are they?
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.440]   Oh, you're doing it from here.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.440]   It's at Mobile World Congress.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.440]   We're not going to get you.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.440]   Maybe a price.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.440]   Maybe a street day.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.440]   You never know this.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.440]   It's always entertaining though.
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.440]   That's a good point.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.440]   Sometimes they do leave the price out, don't they?
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.440]   But yeah, but hey, one of them all is going to be purple.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.440]   I'd be happy to see a purple iPhone.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.440]   I'm not even kidding.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.440]   I'm not even kidding.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.440]   That's where you.
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.440]   Yes.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.440]   I don't want a purple funds.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.440]   I like Samuel Jackson's lightsaber.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.440]   And ironically, it doesn't really matter because everybody puts a case on those, right?
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.280]   I mean, you'd be, although I read a great article, a guy said, "I really don't want to put
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.280]   a case on this."
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.040]   I have to admit, when I take the iPhone out, I love having an application.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.040]   I don't have a case.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.640]   I'm always like, "Cool, we've got to put it back in."
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.640]   Nice and safe.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.360]   Renee, you do it without a case.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:31.240]   Most of the time, if I have to review a case, then I put one on for a while, but most
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.240]   of the time, I leave it.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.200]   It's not the back that really sends me on this.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.280]   I just took my case off.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.280]   It's the stainless on the white one anyway.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.040]   The stainless steel border.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.680]   It looks like the original.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.680]   It's so pretty.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:48.800]   It really does deliver that sort of, "Okay, this is why I spent $1,000 on this phone experience.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   It doesn't look cheap.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.360]   It doesn't look compromised in any way."
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:56.680]   I am that person who, no matter what the phone is, it will go in a case.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.880]   Probably because I take so many pictures with it.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:03.040]   I just like to have these rubber grips so that if I'm trying to get an angle like this,
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.800]   I don't have to worry about dropping inside a fountain.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:10.400]   The number of times that I've had, especially with the loaner phone, if I know that I'm
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.240]   going to be loaned to phone for two months, I'm going to be carrying it around every day
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:20.200]   for a month, I will spend $20 for my own money to put it in a case because all that has to
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:25.920]   happen is once and then you're like, "Why did I not spend $20 for a case?"
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:31.480]   It was Nick Stat writing in the Verge saying, "I don't want to use my phone in a case."
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.560]   There was a great article.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:33.560]   I think it was in the Verge.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:40.000]   Let me see if I can find it about the notch.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   I think this is it.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.520]   Brad Ellis, who's an interaction designer at Tall West, talks about, and this is an example
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:52.000]   of how Apple fanboys really, and I'm one, really going to go way overboard.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.560]   He says, "This notch, this is better than you think.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:02.000]   First of all, it shows how bad it would look if they just put squared corners."
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.880]   But then he talks about other ways to do rounded corners.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:12.920]   Then he talks about the squirkel, which is Apple's very special.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:19.200]   Notice, by the way, not only is there a rounded corner on the outside, but the inside is rounded
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.400]   on the notch.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.000]   He says, "There is no point on this curve that you could get a tangent that's a straight
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   line."
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   It's, well, I guess-
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.160]   It's a non-trivial engineering to fill-down politics.
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:33.360]   Here he shows the difference between- It's hard to see, but it's an animated gift between
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:37.440]   a rounded rectangle and an iPhone X.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.800]   Can you see the shoulders on the rounded rectangle coming up a little bit?
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.040]   The iPhone X, so it's not a rounded rectangle.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.880]   It's a squirkel.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.600]   That is not easy to do.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.200]   People don't make screens with squircles.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.120]   Well they do when an Apple comes.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.880]   Yeah, I mean that's lovely.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.960]   I'm sure the people who love- I'm sorry.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:58.960]   It's a designer.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.280]   You understand how designers are, right?
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.760]   They just- Yeah, but- There's a somewhat rude word that I use internally.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:10.960]   Yes, I know what word you're going to- And I won't use it, but it's like-
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:14.800]   I'm glad that as someone with a really sharp eye for design-
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:18.800]   No, no, no, and I don't mean necessarily for the designer.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:24.800]   I'm talking about, okay, you are basing- I want to make sure I phrase this correctly.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.880]   It's like, it's nice that you notice these things.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:37.280]   I wonder if you had phone A with some straight lines in it and phone B the way that the Apple
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.520]   actually designed it.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:42.200]   Would anybody who's actually using the phone really care?
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.200]   Here's the problem.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.200]   Here's the problem.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.880]   It just doesn't interest me at all.
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.640]   It's deep nerd- Deep designer talk.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.840]   He admits to that, right?
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:50.840]   There's a lot of things-
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.840]   I should point out that there's a lot of things like-
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.840]   Go ahead, Renee, first and then we'll get-
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.440]   I was going to say, I should point out that Brad is a huge fan of the show.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.040]   I'm a fan of Brad Ellis.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.200]   I follow him on Twitter and I love this article.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.200]   A nominal.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.160]   I had a conversation with Brad about this.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:09.360]   We did a designing for iPhone X roundtable with Brad and Sebastian DeWitt and a bunch of
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.320]   other really interesting designers.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.720]   When you look at the apps that they've been making since then, there's an absolute case
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.120]   for having a straight line.
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:20.640]   It's really nice, but it's not that Apple put an envelope on top and took away your
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.760]   screen real estate.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:22.760]   That would all have been gone.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.960]   What they did is open up these corners.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.960]   It looks weird at first, but then you have suddenly a little bit of extra screen.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:34.560]   You look at apps like Apollo for Reddit or the photography app Halide, they put things
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.240]   like histograms and there are volume controls and there are ISO images in there.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.720]   It's like complications on the watch.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.720]   It's just a little bit extra.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.880]   And yet in a perfect world, there'd be no bezel on any phone ever, but Samsung can't
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:45.880]   do that.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:46.880]   Google can't do that.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.880]   LG can't do that.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.400]   I think this is an interesting way of tackling the problem.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:55.080]   It gives you that little bit bonus screen and lets them make the marketing claim that
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.080]   it's edge to edge.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:01.560]   But Brad is absolutely one of the people that notices everything about the typography to
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.560]   the pixel anti-aliasing.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:07.560]   And the truth is, I think that while people don't explicitly notice this, I think you
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.400]   might feel like it looks better.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.520]   The issue really gets into when you talk about design is what we call subconscious
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.520]   details.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.520]   Yes.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.480]   So, it's something that you don't see.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.280]   You can't quite figure out why this looks better than that.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:24.640]   But it just feels like when you look at it, yeah, no one's going to notice that it's
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.960]   there.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.440]   But it's this overall feeling that takes in.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:35.360]   And that's all the work and that last like 1% is the difference between something like
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:39.360]   Apple and something like almost every other Android phone and everything else out there.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:43.440]   I mean, there's a handful of like the Google Pixel that really starts to work on that.
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.440]   Some of the Samsung phones.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:48.720]   And the rest of them fall off pretty quickly because they're not doing that.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.400]   And we can't tell, we can't tell like as a user, you can't say, I don't know what the
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.840]   difference is, but just one feels cheaper than the other one.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:59.400]   And it's all those super subtle little details of curves and everything else.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:05.440]   And I've worked with definitely designers who can really articulate like was articulated
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.680]   in this article, but can really articulate the difference between those things.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.560]   And they have a whole, they have a vision of like, you know, they see colors also that
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:12.560]   I don't see them.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.560]   Like it's green and red.
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.240]   You know, one frame dropping in an animation.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.160]   You know, yeah, I can see them.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.960]   And of course you don't see it.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:24.680]   You don't see it yourself until somebody tells you and then you can't not.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.080]   So you can't unsee it's like your home pod experience.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:30.920]   And you do every business, every business has this, you know, it might be the way, you
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:34.200]   know, someone might be speaking good English, but do they sound like they're intelligent
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.200]   or not?
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.360]   That's very subtle use of words, how they structure their sentences.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.520]   It's exactly the same thing.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.880]   You know, when we do live streams, we, you know, good video means that you watch longer
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.040]   and you don't know why the average viewer doesn't know that.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.000]   They just go, they just stopped, they got bored and they moved on.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.240]   They didn't notice that the camera angles weren't very good or the, you know, like all
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.240]   of those things.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.120]   And so with all of these things, there's these subtle details that experts will, they
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.760]   are thinking about these things like that curve that he's talking about.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.760]   I guarantee there were meetings.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.640]   There were a lot of meetings and there were a lot of designs.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:07.440]   There were probably a hundred versions of that little close up that were, that were worked
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:12.000]   on before they spent, you know, and getting the hardware to do it is again incredible.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.920]   Well, that's, that's a huge point, which is, you know, only Apple.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:23.600]   In fact, Steven Sanovsky, he of the Windows 8 fame in the long Twitter post about the
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:27.840]   iOS underlined this paragraph from Brad's article.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:32.320]   One of the things I love about indy apps is their ability to be opinionated.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:36.640]   It's nearly impossible to ship strong viewpoints from larger companies where there are 50
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.840]   people in a room examining angles.
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:44.600]   So it's cool to see Apple still has the ability to take a strong stance in this way.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:49.400]   And of course, they have the market cloud to get vendors to build screen.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:53.000]   They do so much of their own silicon now, like custom controllers and custom, like they
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.680]   did a lot of stuff on that screen beyond the panel they got from Samsung and most companies
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:57.920]   just don't have the resources.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.440]   So are we okay with the notch?
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.840]   I mean, it seems to have disappeared as an issue.
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.440]   It drove me crazy for the first two years.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.440]   And now I'm like, don't look fine with it.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.440]   In fact, I feel like.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.320]   I don't notice except I know where to go.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:11.120]   It's funny because I know exactly where I want to scan to get to my notifications.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:16.040]   Yeah, as it turns out, and maybe this is making lemonade out of lemons, but as it turns out,
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:21.800]   having those ears is, as you pointed out, Renee and Halide and other programs, but on
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:25.760]   the front page is just useful to know that's where that's where those are going to be.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:31.880]   In fact, it drives me crazy now because I go to my iPad and I that the control panel
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:32.880]   is not there.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:37.720]   Yeah, I mean, edge to edge would be much better if it really was just a frame with the screen.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.400]   But again, no company can do that yet.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:41.400]   And this is as good a compromise.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:45.320]   Oh, I have a Samsung Note 8 and the way they avoid it, they have, you know, they just don't
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.400]   go all the way to the top of the screen.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.200]   They have a bar that's fine.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.720]   Yeah, there are a lot of different ways to solve this problem.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:57.400]   I did like the the essential phone just simply saying we're just going to have hard corners
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:58.640]   everywhere.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:02.520]   And they weren't they weren't putting as much on that front screen as Apple was certainly
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.880]   but at least having a selfie camera saying, you know what, there's going to be a deal
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:06.880]   with it.
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.920]   There's going to be some missing pixels around a circle at the very top of the screen that
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.920]   will have the opening for light sensors and the and the and the camera and just deal
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.920]   with it.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:20.800]   I think that it really is interesting seeing how engineering and design continue to have
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:25.440]   a master slave relationship that keeps flip flopping from time to time where it says,
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.160]   look, there is the form factor we want to have.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:31.680]   You're going to have to make this panel fit versus look, we have to we have to put a 3D
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.480]   face scanning camera in here.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:37.000]   You're going to have to figure out a way to adapt.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.320]   Here's where the hardware has to go.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.880]   You have to figure out how to adapt something else to make that fit.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:46.080]   So some you give a designer, you give an engineer a set of limitations.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.200]   It's their job to work through them.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.520]   And it's always interesting to see how they deal with it.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:53.840]   And I think that with essential, they said, if we can't if we can't really do round, let's
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.880]   do let's really embrace corners everywhere.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.880]   Right.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:57.880]   And they made a beautiful phone.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:02.680]   We can't really have any way to have an uninterrupted piece of glass from corner to corner aged
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.680]   edge.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:08.040]   So let's make that instead of trying to hide it or apologizing for it, let's make that
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.760]   as well integrated and as intentional and purposeful as we possibly can.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:16.520]   I have to say though, we know the numbers now for the essential phone and they've sold
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.800]   less than 90,000 total.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.720]   I think it's a beautiful phone.
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:22.800]   I really honestly do.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.080]   I bought one and I really at full price.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:28.640]   By the way, not the 500 bucks they ended up settling on.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.040]   And I think it's a gorgeous phone.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.040]   But yeah, it's gorgeous.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:35.600]   But it just goes to show you that part of it is you have to tell people that these things
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.920]   are for sale that I don't I don't think that there were a lot of fumbles for essential.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.840]   Well, they didn't have the carry relationships and Android Central was never happy with the
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:43.840]   software.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:45.840]   The fit right.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:51.520]   I mean, but but you also it's just there are also other way more sophisticated way more
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:56.800]   established brands that it's like, how do you expect to have a really good presence in
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.560]   America if you're not going to buy a bus bus at every now and then how much if you're
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:04.720]   not willing to again, pay off the local phone stores to give your phones good placement
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:05.720]   in the store.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:11.000]   It's it's it's it's very I tend to think that, well, this is this is one of the greatest
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   phones ever.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   Everybody should have one.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   This is going to be the most popular thing ever.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.280]   But it's like, unless unless 200 million people are listening to me, which they're not,
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.520]   no, it's going to know about this thing.
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:30.680]   And actually, while we might say that Apple's success comes from sweating the details and
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:36.880]   some, you know, subliminal reinforcement, this also has a lot to do with market cloud,
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:38.800]   the ability to get the stores.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.440]   They have a couple stores.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.800]   They only have a couple stores.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.560]   You know, I mean, it's a phone company just carry a relationship.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.400]   I mean, that's what kept my every carry no carry.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.840]   It's funny because Apple launched right with just one carrier.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.640]   They couldn't get Verizon turned and he had a huge history.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:57.160]   I mean, his history going back to the sidekick with sprint and I think it was with sprint
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.160]   was, you know, it's T mobile.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.160]   It was a sidekick.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.960]   And then he did the original Android phones and he had great relationships.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:05.680]   But I always felt to me like it was a bit of a ploy to get because the rumor is that
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.160]   Google wants an iPhone badly.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:11.160]   That's why they're working on the pixel, but they he could have sold like it felt a
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.840]   little bit like this was, Hey, buy my phone, take me back.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.880]   I'll, you know, I'll forgive interest and we'll make a great product together.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.080]   And it for a variety of reasons that just didn't happen.
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:20.480]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:26.520]   Yeah, the pixel went, I mean, I love the pixel to XL, but in every respect when you design
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:31.720]   is no, I mean, it's just not, it's not a gorgeous phone.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:32.720]   It's a fun.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.720]   It's a second.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:35.720]   It's a high.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:36.720]   It's a highly functional phone.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:40.640]   Oh, see that's where design is so, so many different ingredients.
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:44.560]   I think that one of the strengths of the pixel to is and you've covered up with stickers,
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:48.200]   the fact that let's not just have a boring single tone case, let's have a dot, let's
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.200]   have a panda.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:53.480]   We'll have the top of it be white, well, the bottom of it be black and let's have a phosphorescent
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:56.280]   orange sleep, wake button on it.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.800]   That is so cool as far as I'm concerned.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:04.080]   And like, and Renee and I have been talking for different products saying I, if all that,
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:07.560]   all that, all that Apple has to do is come up with a red version of the iPhone 10.
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:12.160]   I really want a red iPhone 10, just like if, just like I hate to say it, but if it were
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:18.040]   kind of close between switching back to the next iPhone or the next pixel phone and the
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:23.760]   iPhone came in a really good like flake metal purple as a limited edition.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:28.360]   That's it's weird, but that might be enough to tip the scales that it's close.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.280]   I could be very happy with either one of them.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:34.760]   I really love that baked on purple metal flake finish.
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.480]   And I don't care if I do have to wait in line for two days to get it.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:38.480]   I want it.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.480]   That's interesting.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.480]   I don't know.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.480]   I don't know.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.480]   I can think of personal taste.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:45.480]   Personal taste.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.480]   It's fine.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.480]   I'm not looking for gaudy.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.080]   I mean, black and white with orange buttons interesting.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:54.480]   And I did in fact wait three weeks longer matches your watch to get this one.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.040]   But I don't know.
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:00.080]   I do have to say personal, personal subjective opinion.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:04.720]   I think the iPhone 10 is the most beautiful phone as a static object anywhere.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:05.920]   It is, it really is gorgeous.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:09.800]   It just, it just goes to show that for some people, if you're, if you're in for a penny
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:14.200]   and for a pound, they're much, they're okay with spending extra $150 to get something
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.840]   that for something they're going to be looking at, taking out of their pockets and putting
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.480]   into their pockets for the next two or three years.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:22.040]   That's not a whole lot of money to spend as far as they're concerned.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.400]   You know, I have both and I carry both.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:30.320]   And I have to say when I want to take a picture, I almost always pull the pixel out as opposed
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.680]   to the iPhone.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.400]   I'm really, I'm really torn between the two.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.400]   Because I also.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.400]   There's advantages with both.
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.400]   I agree with you.
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:43.320]   I love the whole segment from DP review on Saturday on the new screensavers about computational
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:47.240]   photography and what iPhone and pixel are doing.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.600]   I mean, I love, I love the quality of the pictures that the pixel takes, particularly with the
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:57.240]   way that that the Google camera app does HDR plus, I really think that they've got the
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:01.200]   edge over Apple's HDR and especially the way that it works just automatically.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:04.440]   I do think that gives it a real edge.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:09.960]   And I just tried the new version of the camera app that has added additional panorama modes.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:14.120]   So now you can do fish eyes, you can do sometimes you don't just want left to right, but you
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:17.440]   also want to get the ceiling and just the ceiling because that's part of that part of
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:21.120]   the artwork in a mural that you want to get all these other modes.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:26.200]   But so whereas I like the quality of the photos I'm getting from the pixel, I really
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:30.720]   wish I had the larger photo ecosystem of the iPhone.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.720]   That's true.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:37.560]   Because it's just every time there's a little, it's like when you buy a camera, like a physical
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:41.960]   camera platform because, ooh, there's this amazing lens that you can't get for.
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:42.960]   It's kind of unusual.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:47.160]   You can't get it for any other platform that will swivel swerve you towards the Sony or
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.160]   towards the Olympus.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.720]   The fact that there's all these amazing little apps that just make photography so much more
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:56.560]   interesting for you just at that moment.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.200]   I can't decide between the two.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.640]   I can't really recommend one over the other.
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:06.200]   It makes me wish for this magical world where Google and Apple never had their split up.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.560]   To me, the iPhone is still arguably better hardware.
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.880]   You can tell because as much as Google says, you don't need two lenses to do portrait mode,
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.240]   they're doing almost everything in software.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:19.160]   They're taking a little bit of parallax data from the focus pixels and they're doing incredible
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.760]   segmentation masking and machine learn blur responses.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.600]   But they don't get depth data.
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.960]   The iPhone gets a ton of depth data.
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:28.760]   Google would make that photo app for the iPhone.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:32.640]   I bet it would be phenomenal because you'd have the power of those two lenses or that
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:33.640]   true sense camera.
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:37.240]   That true depth camera plus all of Google's machine learning, you could just take it and
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:41.520]   swap it where if you put the Apple camera app on the Google Pixel, I don't think you'd
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.480]   have much of anything.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:47.200]   That shows me that there's just so much potential.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:51.040]   You can never graft a better lens on the Pixel, but you can grasp better software onto the
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.040]   iPhone.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:55.680]   I hope that my one wish for the next Pixel is that they start throwing cameras on those
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.240]   things that are like Apple quality or Samsung quality.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.560]   Yeah, it's a glass.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.400]   I love to see the fight between these two companies.
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:06.400]   One argument would be that, well, great.
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:11.160]   Google can certainly source some sort of depth sensor or some sort of a better twin
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.800]   camera arrangement for the next generation of hardware.
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:17.880]   You can also make the argument that Apple's getting better and better at machine learning
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:21.160]   at learning the sort of tricks that Google is talking about.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:24.440]   Partly because all this stuff is being published.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.040]   It's not as though these are trades.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.840]   Most of the stuff is not necessarily trade secrets.
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:34.240]   There's a lot of work being done to make sure that the rising tide elevates all boats.
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:39.880]   As a matter of fact, just a couple of weeks ago, Google actually did something that was
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.080]   so very Google.
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:46.720]   It's such a nice positive, like industry positive gesture that you wonder what their
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.440]   evil hidden intent is.
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:54.640]   They released a huge data set of, I was just talking about how much I like their HDR+ algorithm,
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:57.480]   how it generates really good natural HDR.
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:04.520]   So they released a huge data set of some 4000 individual images.
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:11.160]   If you download this data set, you get the final HDR+ image plus you get the source images
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:15.880]   that the phone shot to get that and intermediate image as well.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:20.000]   You can actually test your own algorithms against the result that Google's algorithms
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.200]   are getting.
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:25.600]   Their desire is to say, well, at least in research, at least let's have a common framework to
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:29.480]   discuss how well these algorithms work.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:35.280]   When you're publishing a paper, you can say, I've used a Google HDR data set number 441
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.280]   for this.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:39.200]   Now, if you want to create your own version of this algorithm, you can test your own results
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.200]   against it.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:45.520]   Hopefully, it will just continue to become better and better and better cameras.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:50.720]   I can say enough, I can give no stronger endorsement for the pixel on the iPhone than
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:57.200]   the fact that a year and a half ago, I bought a $600 pocket camera for all those times
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.000]   where I didn't want to take my big interchangeable lens camera.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.800]   There are so few times that I'm actually charging up and taking it with me because I'm getting
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:08.960]   so many good results just with this darn phone.
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.400]   It's sickening to me.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:15.040]   I find that the only time I really think about taking a camera with me is when I'm going
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:18.440]   to shoot with a long lens.
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:21.480]   If I've got a one to one thing, no phone does very well.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:26.520]   If my kids are playing sports or something, I'll have a one to 400 with a 2x converter
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:30.560]   and you're going to be outside and I'm going to get closeups from where the camera is.
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:35.640]   I'm going to really encourage everybody's interest in this subject to read Rishi Signyel's
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:38.080]   review, a DP review.
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:42.680]   He was on, as I said, on the new screensavers on Saturday.
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.360]   This is kind of what he said.
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:50.160]   He's a serious photographer as an A7 R3, the latest, greatest phone from Sony.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.880]   He does some comparisons.
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:56.560]   For instance, here's where the iPhone wins is in the contour lighting of the same picture
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:00.360]   of his daughter.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:03.360]   Here's a comparison full frame or pixel 2.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:07.640]   He said, "I can pick out the difference, but the point is you can get this shot right
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:10.440]   out of the phone without thinking about it."
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.440]   Another example, he said, "I took this shot."
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:14.080]   Oops, I zoomed in a little bit.
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.080]   Let's go back.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:21.080]   On the pixel 2, and I didn't do anything in order to get a better shot, arguably a better
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:28.200]   shot with a full frame sensor camera, I had to take out a polarizing lens and on and on
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.760]   and on.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.360]   Force stop reverse graduated neutral density filter and dynamic range compensation mode
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:36.080]   to get a usable image.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:39.200]   That's where the HDR+ in some of these cameras is quite remarkable.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.120]   This is a good article.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:46.120]   He basically says the same thing we've been saying, which is there's advantages in the
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:48.160]   iPhone X, there's advantages in the Pixel 2.
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:50.920]   They're both doing amazing things.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:58.360]   With the exception of perhaps specialized situations like a long telephoto, man, it's
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.200]   pretty amazing.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.200]   Here's the...
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.120]   He has a studio chart that they use.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:10.800]   If you compare the Pixel 2 image with a micro four thirds image, because it's doing...
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:15.440]   Even though the sensor is one ninth the size, because it's doing nine images in one frame,
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:19.040]   it's getting very close to the resolution of a micro four thirds camera.
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.040]   That's remarkable.
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.040]   That's remarkable.
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:28.320]   I was up in Starbucks up in the reserve one of their reserve breweries, I guess.
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:29.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:30.320]   They've started to open, which is by the way.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:31.320]   For coffee?
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.320]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.320]   Or beer?
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:34.320]   No, it's a...
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:35.320]   I'm sorry, roastery.
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.320]   It's a...
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.320]   You get a diffusion of the brewery.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.320]   I mean, the brewery.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:45.560]   Up in Seattle, they have a Starbucks roastery, which is like the Willy Wonka's factory for
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:46.560]   coffee.
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:47.560]   I mean...
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:51.000]   So I got this kind of crazy orangy coffee thing and a sandwich and I took this with
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   portrait mode and I was...
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   Oh, that is gorgeous.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   Where's that?
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   Can I show that on this screen?
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   I saw it on Instagram, but you can...
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   That's amazing.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   Let me pull it up.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.920]   And I admit, it was the portrait, like the studio mode or whatever in portrait.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.720]   I took a picture of something, I was just curious, I was just like spun through it.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:06.720]   See what happens.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:07.720]   Yeah, let's see what happens.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:08.720]   It's gorgeous.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:09.720]   And that was...
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:12.040]   I snapped it when I took a picture, I was like, "What?"
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:14.080]   So that wasn't of a person.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.560]   It somehow likes your quesanwich.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:19.440]   Yeah, it was a quesanwich and I was corrected that it's not a sandwich.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:20.440]   It's some kind of other thing.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:22.200]   Oh, I don't know what it is, but I want it.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:23.760]   It was really good going there.
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.960]   By the way, if you're ever in Seattle, this roastery, it is kind of the most amazing coffee
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:32.840]   shop and bread and breakery and thing that I've ever been to.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.160]   But it takes really...
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.800]   Like literally, that's with the portrait mode, like the studio mode.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.080]   It looks like a Rembrandt.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:40.720]   The lighting is so interesting.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:42.640]   And it was literally like just sitting on a table.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:43.640]   It's like Rembrandt did.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:46.520]   You have these dark images, but then things would glow.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:47.520]   They would have an inner light.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:48.520]   Almost like an inner light.
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:50.680]   It was literally like I just...
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:54.360]   I literally snapped it and it's like the lighting in the store.
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:55.360]   I mean, it wasn't anything.
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:58.720]   That's actually one of the things that's most amazing about computational photography
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:55:59.920]   and camera phones.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:01.560]   They surprise you.
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:03.840]   That sometimes you get a shot, you go, "What?"
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:04.840]   And that's what I started.
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:06.320]   I started now, especially after this.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:10.640]   I start spinning through all those settings and taking photos just to see what's going
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:11.640]   to happen.
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:13.640]   And that's shot on my iPhone as well.
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:14.640]   That's gorgeous.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.400]   That's the same thing as the music.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:20.120]   It's that they do the science behind it and then they give it to their artistic photography
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:22.880]   team and they do things like, "Well, let's not just have normal noise.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.920]   Let's find it a really appealing grain pattern if we have to have noise."
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:27.520]   And that's not just a Gaussian blur.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:29.880]   Let's do a custom disc blur or a wind blur.
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.840]   And let's feed the lights this way.
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:35.600]   I mean, a perfectionist might say, "Well, there's halos around the sandwich and around
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:38.240]   the coffee and blah, blah, blah."
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:39.240]   But you know what?
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.240]   That's not...
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.480]   The initial impression is, "Wow."
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.480]   Right.
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:44.480]   Exactly.
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:47.920]   And the thing is, it's an Instagram photo that I took while I was on the phone.
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.760]   I was talking on the phone on a conference call and I took that picture.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.400]   It wasn't like I was doing an ad or it was an conference call.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.160]   It wasn't doing an ad agency thing.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:59.520]   The other thing is that these features get people engaged in photography as opposed to
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:05.560]   just taking snapshots where I have my visual receipt of the fact that I'm on the phone.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:11.640]   The fact that grandma was here at lunch, people can actually get dramatically good results
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:15.480]   by doing dramatically simple things.
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:25.480]   I'm not a huge fan of portrait mode because I often really shows the artifice in work,
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:28.640]   but that's just my personal thing.
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.800]   But the fact that people can think, "Ooh, I'll use portrait mode on this."
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:35.520]   Instead of just being a passive click, we got it saying, "Let's see how good it is."
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:36.520]   "Good a picture we can take."
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:40.680]   And then that leads to people asking themselves, "What is it that I like about a photo and
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.520]   how can I enhance that in the pictures that I take?"
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:47.680]   And that's what turns you into a photo nut.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:53.040]   Let's take a little break and we're going to have some feel-good stories and some fun
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:56.320]   stories and then of course our pics all coming up.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.480]   Yes, in the sale.
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:03.920]   Oh, and Alex has some very interesting news, but I already put Dibs on one of your cameras.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:08.440]   But first a word about sleeping better.
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:09.720]   Sleep is everything.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:15.600]   Sleep is the best way to lose weight, to reduce stress, to feel better, to literally improve
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:17.120]   your health.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:22.480]   And it all starts with a great mattress from Casper, award-winning mattresses for your
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:23.480]   best rest.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:26.080]   Oh, this is our new Casper we just got.
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:30.640]   Oh, I'm glad you got the video.
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.840]   This has become a ritual here at the La Porte hassle.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:34.720]   I'm so excited he already has his pajamas on.
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:38.720]   I start my jammies.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:42.360]   I love these Casper's because they come in surprisingly compact boxes.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:49.360]   When you open them up though, they go to full size and it is the most perfect combination
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:55.080]   of bounce and support that you've ever had.
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:58.280]   Oh, I love my Casper.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:05.920]   Oh, you're going to love your Casper to the best bed for better sleep.
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:10.480]   The original Casper mattress combines supportive memory foams for a sleep surface with just
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:13.280]   the right sink and just the right bounce.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:14.480]   Plus it's breathable design.
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:18.760]   I really majorly appreciate this because you know, it's winter.
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:20.160]   We got the heat on in the house.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:23.800]   I don't want to sleep hot and the mattress sleeps cool.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:27.280]   It allows you to regulate your temperature through the night and you sleep better.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.120]   Some lasting comfort and support.
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:32.280]   Even the kitty loves Casper.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:34.200]   You can buy it easily.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:36.360]   That's Samantha.
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:37.520]   Samantha loves it.
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:40.880]   You can buy it easily online, completely risk free.
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:43.600]   They understand you want to try a mattress before you buy it.
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.120]   That's why because you're going to spend a third of your life on it.
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:52.360]   That's why they offer free delivery and painless returns in the first 100 days.
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:59.480]   You don't have to lie down in the showroom.
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:03.720]   You can actually try it in your life.

[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:40.440]   Feel good story of the week iPhone and Apple watch.
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:45.160]   Their emergency SOA's feature saves a woman and her child after a collision drunk driver
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.920]   to spotlight.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.280]   Hits the car.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.360]   Casey Anderson.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.960]   This was the late last year.
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.760]   The car was launched by the force of the crash.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:58.040]   The occupants were buffeted into the vehicle game to stop.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.600]   Everything in the car went airborne.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.120]   She hit the steering wheel, the headrest back to the steering wheel.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.480]   The window I blacked out for about a minute.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.640]   I couldn't see.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:06.560]   My eyes were wide open.
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.720]   All I saw was black.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.160]   My hands flew around to feel for my phone.
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:16.280]   Then I realized I had my watch on and commanded it to call 911.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:18.160]   Turned out she had a severe concussion.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.000]   That's why she couldn't see.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.560]   With brain swelling and bulging discs.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:28.560]   Thanks to that Apple SOA emergency SOA's feature she was able to just hold it.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.160]   We should tell everybody how to do it.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:33.040]   Renee, have you ever used emergency SOS?
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.040]   I have demonstrated it.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.960]   I have never used it in real life.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:36.960]   Tell us how you do it.
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:42.240]   You can sit on your Apple Watch or on your phone and you basically, you just start squeezing.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.720]   I'll use this because it's really big.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:47.720]   You just start squeezing the sides and it'll come up in six seconds.
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.480]   Yeah, it'll start.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.480]   I'll terminate now.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:52.480]   Wow.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.960]   It'll actually go all the way back to the house.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.040]   It'll alert your emergency contact as well, which is really important.
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.040]   Everybody should know that.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.920]   Set up an emergency contact.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:01.920]   Go to Apple Health.
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:06.680]   Set up that whole profile because first responders can do that on the phone too.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:09.640]   They can see what blood type you are.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:10.640]   I've talked to first responders.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:15.720]   They say the most important thing, the thing we really want is to call your next of kin.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.560]   Then we can ask them questions.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:18.560]   It's all in there.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.560]   Just pull that out.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:23.720]   Then if you do the same thing, you hold the side button on the watch for six seconds.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.520]   It actually didn't even take that long.
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:29.440]   You've got an emergency SOS on the watch.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.360]   Turn it up and do it.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.840]   It's a huge advantage of Apple being so unified with their products.
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:36.880]   The first responders are likely to know about this and look for it because the iPhone is
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:39.000]   just so iconic that they've become aware of it.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.520]   It's not a fringe feature.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.520]   Yes.
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.000]   It's nice to have a feel good story.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.800]   Here are the new emojis.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.440]   I love them.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:51.840]   Not all approved yet.
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:52.960]   Oh, yes.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:53.960]   These are approved.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:54.960]   Wow.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:55.960]   There's a Poteeti Poteelio.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:56.960]   I'm boycotting.
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.120]   We're getting 157 new emojis.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:07.480]   Now this will be, that means you're, god dang it, 208,823 emojis.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.520]   Oh, man.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.520]   You want to see all of them?
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.520]   Here we go.
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.520]   Here's a first look.
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.520]   This is from a Moji Pedia.
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.760]   All 157 new emojis.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.680]   Beauty face.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.640]   Pleading face with big, sad eyes.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:22.640]   Anime face.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.640]   Woozy face.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:26.280]   I like your beauty face.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.280]   Cold face.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.080]   Hot face.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.080]   Red heads.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.080]   Gingers.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.080]   You finally get your own emoji.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:36.120]   And of course, skin tone as always is variable.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.560]   Curly-haired people too.
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.720]   And our old folks.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.680]   Get mine.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.640]   And people who look like cue balls.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:45.600]   Actually, that's awesome.
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.680]   Super villain face.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.680]   I love it.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:49.680]   Super hero.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.960]   Not much difference to the villain and the hero.
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:52.960]   But there you go.
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.560]   Oh, a leg.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.560]   Have a leg.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.280]   Or a foot.
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:00.200]   Just a twos or a bone.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:05.400]   Oh, now I can be a scientist with goggles.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.000]   Hiking boot.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.760]   Woman's flats.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.760]   Ooh.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:10.760]   Microbe.
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:11.760]   This is good.
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.760]   I'm liking these.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.000]   Mosquito parrot.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.320]   These are the not the apple emojis.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:21.800]   These will be the kind of the emoji, PD emojis, but apple will undoubtedly do something similarly
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.440]   3D.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.240]   The hippo's interesting.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.240]   Stepping out.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.240]   Cupcake.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.240]   Bagel.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.240]   A little bit of controversy with the lobster.
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.080]   You realize that that is a cooked lobster.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.240]   Oh, it's red.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:33.240]   Right.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.240]   Lobsters are not red.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.240]   That's not good.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.240]   Well, again, serving suggestion.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.240]   Right?
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.240]   That's a Montreal bagel.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.040]   Not in Frisbee lacrosse.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.040]   Was it a Montreal?
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:46.280]   Chestpawn softball puzzle piece magnet toolbox.
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.480]   We really like the scientists.
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:50.120]   We got a Petri dish, a test tube, a lat coat, DNA.
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.280]   It is flu season.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:52.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.280]   An abacus.
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:57.800]   For those of you who go old school, I wish they had a turntable.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:58.800]   Two turntables.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:01.160]   Two turntables and a cart machine.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.080]   There's a toilet paper roll.
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.200]   Red envelope for the Chinese New Year.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.200]   Okay.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.200]   Long hay fat shoy.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.200]   Yes, I saw that.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.480]   Renee did a nice little gong hay fat shoy for everybody.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.480]   Nice.
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:12.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:16.320]   Nice as we have lots of emojis.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:17.840]   I'm still I'm still old.
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:22.680]   I'm making the transition to emojis where instead of I can't be bothered to like take
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:26.440]   my hands off the keyboard and click on something to get the thumbs up emoji.
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:30.560]   But at least I'm now typing in parentheses, thumbs up emoji, close parentheses.
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.440]   So you're saying that is a Montreal bagel.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.440]   Is that really?
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.440]   I'm claiming it.
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.760]   I know that other people are going to say it's a New York bagel.
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:39.760]   What is that?
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.200]   Well, that's a mango it looks like.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.200]   It's like a mango.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.200]   The tooth is disturbing.
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.200]   It's a healthy.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.440]   Well, especially because it's a healthy tooth.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.440]   Someone pulled that's malpractice.
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:49.440]   That's a healthy tooth.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:52.280]   Like cut a foot off Andy.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:54.280]   I mean, there's an honestly.
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:59.080]   Well, if you get a foot, you should put it in a shoe and you get your choice.
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.360]   No, that's the money Python emoji.
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.360]   I just find it.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.360]   I just find it.
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:06.360]   And of course, these will drive up.
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:09.120]   The disembodied leg is kind of creepy too.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.120]   It's a major award.
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:13.480]   Put that next to the lampshade.
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.720]   Is that a skunk or a badger?
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.720]   What is that?
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.360]   I think it's a badger.
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:19.360]   I say badger.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.360]   Not a wolverine.
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:21.360]   Okay.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.360]   Peacock, parrot.
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:23.360]   But it's not a honey badger.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.360]   Not a honey badger.
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.360]   Hippo.
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.360]   I think they should have an emoji for a honey badger.
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.480]   Or like we call it in Canada syrup badger.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.400]   I just look like a regular badger.
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.400]   Yeah.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.160]   They're both doing some weird hippo.
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.000]   Oh, that's not a.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.720]   So is that a raccoon or a badger?
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:39.720]   I'm sorry.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.720]   The full face.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:43.440]   That's a black and white raccoon.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.360]   That's not an American raccoon.
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:48.000]   That's a Chinese panda coon.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.080]   Oh, I should remind everybody that hippopotamus is the most feared animal in Africa.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.600]   It wasn't as a ship.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.600]   We were warned about it.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:07:00.880]   More people die from hippo crushing than lightning or terrorists.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.680]   They're also understand they're very, very sarcastic.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.440]   And you raised a sad point.
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.440]   That is a cooked lobster.
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.440]   Yeah.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.440]   Well, that's not.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.280]   I don't want to be.
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.360]   I don't want to be that guy.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:16.240]   I'm just saying that cartoons always show them red.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:19.920]   And I'm saying these anytime you have like a walking around red lobster, you're looking
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.600]   at a zombie lobster, which is awesome.
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:26.080]   But make sure that you understand what kind of character you're writing.
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.840]   When is you believe it's a Lego lobster?
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.200]   What kind of pie is this?
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.200]   I don't.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.920]   That is a pecan pie.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.760]   So it's a thick pie.
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:34.760]   It looks like a pecan pie.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.400]   It might be almost a meat pie.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.920]   You know, with it, yeah, it doesn't have.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.160]   It's not like an egg in the middle of it.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.840]   So it could be a pork pie.
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:46.600]   Oh, see, they try to make these international as international as they can.
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.160]   And that cupcake.
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.160]   I mean, come on.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.160]   That's a beautiful.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.560]   That is a sift cupcake.
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:55.280]   That's our local cupcake factory.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.280]   Yeah.
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.360]   Alex, do you have any good cupcakes or donuts in Seattle?
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.520]   There's voodoo's up there, right?
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:01.520]   I didn't.
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.520]   I did not.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.520]   I said coffee.
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.160]   Oh, and a really good.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.160]   A really good croissant.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.160]   A little croissant.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.160]   A little croissant.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.160]   All right.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.160]   What now?
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.160]   Is that soap?
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.920]   I guess that's soap.
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:14.920]   It's pink.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:15.920]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:16.920]   Or loot.
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:17.920]   Oh, there's loot.
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:18.920]   Is that Lufa next to it?
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:20.480]   There's a sponge or a Lufa.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:21.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:23.240]   Well, they've, you know, they're really pretty much.
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:26.920]   It's kind of hard to imagine an emoji missing except for a protein.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:31.200]   What I believe, yeah, what I believe, Leo, is that you should be able to long press on
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.840]   the French fries and get options for tater tots.
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:34.840]   Ah.
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:35.840]   Damn.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:36.840]   You're cooking.
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:37.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:38.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.840]   You're cooking with cheese curds.
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:40.840]   Yes.
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:43.360]   Third party opportunity for 3D touch.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:44.920]   Would you not agree?
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:49.760]   I've replaced my emoji keyboard where it's actually actually that's that's not a bad
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:55.320]   idea because I in addition to doing searches, you could probably start off with five emoji.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:56.840]   That is just here's a smiley face.
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:57.840]   Here's a piece.
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.320]   Here's a here's a piece of cake.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.200]   If you long press on the piece of cake, okay.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.200]   Now you're now you're digging into food.
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:07.720]   So are you looking for baked goods, dairy, vegetables, that would probably be the easiest
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:13.800]   way to actually get to the one you want when you can't when you don't know how to, how,
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:18.120]   what keyword has been assigned to the actual emotion you're trying to hit.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.120]   Third party opportunity.
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:23.120]   As long as we're talking emojis, let's talk about emoji apocalypse.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:26.120]   I'm bum bum bum bum bum bum for some reason.
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:32.360]   No wishing you take us to that seems to be rejecting games with emojis in them with
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:35.080]   the one word reject one line rejection.
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:40.560]   Your app and apps met at metadata include apple emoji, which creates a misleading association
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.040]   with apple products.
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.000]   I thought they fixed it.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.760]   This is emoji.
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:50.680]   You have to make your own emoji if you're going to.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:54.840]   I mean, these rules are so they're completely separate divisions with an apple that do a
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:56.160]   lot of these things.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:01.320]   And the I think the the the hair they were splitting is that if you used apple emoji in
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:05.360]   your art, then you were violating apples copyright, that if like you weren't displaying it on
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:09.080]   the keyboard, but you're actually using apples emoji to advertise your product.
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.240]   That was a violation of apples copyright on those specific.
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:14.720]   Yeah, you should if you're going to here's, you know, if you're going to have a crying
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:20.560]   face in your game, you should use your own damn crying face instead of, you know, but
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.560]   not just that.
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.880]   But if you have in the app store and you have like a like you if you're showing off the
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:27.000]   emoji as part of your advert, I forget what the what the details were and sometimes it
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   was being enforced.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.120]   Like always and sometimes it wasn't being enforced, which is our friend.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:33.040]   Jeremy Burch, who is a regular here.
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:39.080]   He's with the Unicode committee for emoji said it seems reasonable to me that apple would
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:43.120]   want some level of control over emoji use in the app store, but banning it outright from
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.160]   anything other than user inputted text fields feels a step.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:51.920]   That user input text feels a step too far, in my opinion.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:56.200]   Um, maybe, yeah, anyway, well, it's it's nothing to worry about.
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:00.960]   As far as abstract rejections, historically apples policy seems to be create the policy
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.040]   way to see how many people complain.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.520]   If people don't complain, it's not a problem.
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:09.120]   If people do complain, review the rule and that's things that things have been like a
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.840]   huge problems two years ago.
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:14.360]   You don't hear from them as of three months after the first brew, because they figured
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.840]   out that, okay, this was too broad.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.840]   Now we can narrow it down.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:17.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.680]   In fact, one developer said they've always I've always had emojis on my leaderboard, but
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.160]   apple must have just noticed.
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:27.120]   So yeah, and then, you know, who knows, by now they may have, they may have changed the
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.120]   policy.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.920]   And some of it is sometimes like a legal department person goes, well, if we don't
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:32.680]   enforce our copyrights, then we lose them.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:33.680]   Right.
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:38.080]   So that's important point to make that every company designs its own emoji based on the
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.000]   Unicode standard.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   And that is artwork owned by that company Twitter, whether it's Twitter or Google or
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.600]   Apple or anybody else Facebook, they make their own emojis.
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:50.880]   Uh, let's see.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:55.200]   As some room with the drone Leo talk about the drone getting lost.
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.200]   That's hilarious.
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.200]   We're getting there.
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.200]   Yes.
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.200]   That's almost he's it.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.200]   Let's just use it.
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.720]   Spotify has job listings that suggest they might be doing.
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:04.720]   You might be happy about this.
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.520]   Alex, their own speakers.
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:08.920]   I'm done with speakers.
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:11.160]   You bought the last speaker you're ever going to buy.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.160]   Here's the old.
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:15.600]   I have, I mean, I'm just like, I'm not looking for more smart speakers.
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:23.560]   I've got, I know, some rooms, I have a Amazon Echo, I have Amazon show, I have the apple.
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:28.720]   And then I have, and then I have 14 Sonos servers that go out to all these speakers.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:29.720]   I don't need any.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:30.720]   I'm done.
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.040]   Like I don't need any more, more of this.
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.200]   They're too late to the game.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:36.120]   I mean, they, for me, I mean, I'm just like, I can't go.
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.640]   Then let's just put a time code at a mark for two years from now when we're talking about
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:44.360]   the great new speakers that we're replacing all of our existing speakers with.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:48.400]   I joked on Twitter if Spotify made a speaker and it didn't support Apple music at launch
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.400]   with people.
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:50.400]   That would be funny.
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.320]   And people said, oh, well, first of all, they're not never going to make a speaker and second
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:55.240]   of all, Apple's a platform company and Spotify.
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.520]   People have no sense humor.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:00.000]   It's just that's called literal internet.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.600]   I didn't even notice like I was like, oh, I'll just put Spotify on and I listened to it
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:04.600]   on the speaker.
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.600]   I was like, it works.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:06.600]   No, like it didn't.
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.080]   I didn't before people started complaining about it not being compatible.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:12.720]   I was like, oh, it's not perfectly compatible, but didn't I didn't notice it at all.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.160]   And yes, there is one set of more speakers, any outdoor speakers.
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:16.520]   So I'm still trying to figure that out.
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.520]   I see.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.640]   You see that I'm not done yet, but I don't think they're making outdoor speakers with
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:21.640]   this.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:26.680]   We were, we ripped a planet of the apps and carpool karaoke saying Apple can't do production.
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:30.000]   Well, carpool karaoke has been renewed.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.160]   So you can do it well enough.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:32.360]   Carpool karaoke was fine.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:36.320]   It was at part of the apps that just that was really so bad.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:41.040]   Also, also carpool karaoke cost next to nothing to produce.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.800]   Yes, it's two people like car.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:47.600]   The most most clever thing that one of the most clever things anybody ever explained
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:50.600]   to me was somebody in the TV industry and saying, if you ever see a show and you're
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.200]   wondering why the hell is this in?
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:55.080]   I can't believe this is in a 13th, 14th season season.
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:14:00.560]   You're looking at a show that is cost that costs nothing to to produce.
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:03.760]   And let's let's let's let's phrase nothing in broadcast.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:06.480]   In broadcast quarter million and $750,000.
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.480]   What could this cost a buck?
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:09.680]   You mean you got a run?
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:12.080]   I'm sorry about do they pay the artists?
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.400]   They got to fly the bin.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.400]   I'm sure they take care of them.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:20.280]   I bet you I bet you these are I bet you it's a hundred thousand and a hundred thousand
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:22.640]   hundred two hundred hundred two hundred fifty thousand per episode.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:23.640]   I could do it.
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:26.120]   Apple I could do it for $25 for you.
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:27.120]   We could not.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:31.880]   If I could if I can use the car for the rest of the day to run errands, I'll do it for
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:32.880]   fifteen.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:35.040]   You know, it's cool.
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.960]   I have yet to see any of the Apple ones.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:41.000]   I've seen most of the James Corden ones, but I mean, these look cute.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.560]   I'm more watching the Apple ones were probably the ones are much cheaper.
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:45.360]   These are you can say there's more production value.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:52.440]   So they're doing, you know, yeah, and they get big stars and they're blowing their cars.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.440]   Okay.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:54.440]   That's Apple.
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:56.040]   Can't do it cheap.
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:58.040]   Watch only on Apple music out of the market.
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:01.840]   So one of the reasons I haven't seen is I only now have subscribed Apple music for my
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:04.600]   home pod.
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.600]   So now I can see it.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:06.600]   Right.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:09.480]   It's very confusing to say something you can watch it on Apple music.
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.480]   That's very confusing.
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:12.280]   Like why get that movie on iTunes?
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:14.080]   It's just I don't know why we keep getting stuck in these.
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:15.240]   You do you got to fix that.
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:16.840]   Do you have the YouTube TV?
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:17.840]   I do.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.240]   I love it.
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:21.880]   YouTube TV is I think the one to get now.
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:22.880]   I like it.
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:23.880]   It is the one to get.
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:24.880]   It's the one to get right now.
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:25.880]   It's it's so for you.
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:29.320]   It's the interface is a little funky like they they have to kind of go back and like I
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.320]   like the interface.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:34.600]   But it's like it does this weird thing like it skips too fast is it the interface itself
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:39.240]   is fine there for some reason the way they program the interaction is is funky.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:43.760]   You know, it's like I like the the guide is great because you can hover over and see
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:45.160]   the live video.
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:48.480]   They've added some channels including Turner classic movies.
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:50.320]   Frankly, that was enough to put me.
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:53.760]   If I were to subscriber, that would have put me over the top.
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.760]   Here we are.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.240]   Sweet bird of youth.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:57.240]   Paul Newman.
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.240]   Let's see.
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:59.240]   That's great.
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:04.320]   And then fact that I could if I if I want to record it.
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:07.880]   I'll show you what we do and I do this every few weeks.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:11.520]   I go through Turner classic movies schedule.
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:15.440]   You don't even have to buy movies anymore because I just record all these old classics.
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:17.960]   Let me see if I can find it.
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:18.960]   We're listening.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:19.960]   Here it is.
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:25.200]   I just look at the Turner classic movie schedule and I see what's coming up.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:28.200]   I'm going to stop that subject with roses.
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:29.200]   Oh, Viva Sepata.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.720]   Let's say I want that press the plus button.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.440]   Now I'll have a recording of it.
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:34.440]   Boom.
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:35.840]   That easy.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:36.840]   That easy.
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:37.840]   They really did it well.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.560]   But you berated interesting point Renee.
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:40.560]   They don't have locals.
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.040]   I'm sure they don't have Montreal locals.
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.040]   Do they have it in Montreal?
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.240]   I don't think they have an encounter at all.
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.240]   Yes.
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.120]   We have locals in the Bay Area.
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:55.440]   So you want to go somewhere where it makes more sense if you can get your live locals
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.280]   because then you're going to get the Oscars.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.640]   You're going to get the Super Bowl.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.200]   Actually, Super Bowl was blanked out on my phone.
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.200]   I had to watch it.
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.360]   Yeah, my iPad phone.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.800]   I think Verizon watched some sort of exclusive.
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:06.800]   But you could watch it.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:07.800]   Yeah, you could airplay it.
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:10.280]   As long as you were watching it on a TV, it was okay.
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.280]   I wasn't going to watch it and then I saw a couple of them.
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:13.280]   Now this is on Apple.
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.280]   I'm going to watch the Super Bowl.
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:17.280]   I'm going to go watch the second half.
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:20.080]   I don't want to miss the Bia'thlon Nordic combined.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.360]   So I'm just going to record that.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.360]   There you go.
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.360]   Still get all the ads.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.360]   I'm not saying you don't.
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:27.960]   You also point out just how terrible YouTube made their new Apple TV app.
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:29.840]   Is it bad?
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:32.040]   It's worse than the Amazon Prime app, which was an open jail.
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.440]   That's what I was talking about.
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:37.120]   I don't think the interface itself is bad, but I think that the interaction is horrible.
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:40.760]   Yeah, it's again, I think it's one of those quad platform apps where they'd rather have
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.680]   fast and cheap than good.
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:43.920]   That's surprising from YouTube.
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:46.280]   But we're just seeing so many complaints.
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:49.360]   It literally gets stuck in a state where you can't select anything.
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:54.160]   And then I went out and looked around a little bit and they said, "Everything else on Apple
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.160]   TV?"
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:56.160]   And came back to it.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:57.800]   No, you can't actually select on what you want to play.
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:02.520]   And I want to say that I think it's almost inexcusable to make a bad Apple TV app because
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:03.520]   there's TVML templates.
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:07.640]   If all you're doing is a video player, they even give you these templates that you can
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.840]   use if you want to be lazy about it.
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:12.360]   But that's not just making these bad apps.
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:17.920]   It's making it an inconsistent experience across platforms because I don't know a lot
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:24.600]   of people that decide to buy all Apple TV gear is maybe the exception.
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:28.360]   But it's so easy for someone to be using a different version of the two app.
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:31.080]   If they've got five people in the house, there's going to be three different versions, three
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:34.000]   different platforms in play at any given time.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.140]   And when I switch from the Android TV, YouTube TV player, to the Apple TV player, to the
[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:42.320]   phone player and have to deal with different, I don't know where my wife is.
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:45.360]   Watchlist is, I don't know where my watch later list is.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:50.520]   I'm surprised that Google has not really made this a consistent experience across the platform.
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:56.600]   It's even worse when you realize how, when you have a problem with a product made by Facebook
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:19:03.000]   or Apple or Microsoft or Google, you wonder, do these people not have enough resources to
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.800]   do a proper job of this?
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:07.680]   Do they need to hire some people to do this?
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:08.680]   No, they don't.
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:09.680]   They've got money.
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:10.680]   They've got time.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:13.880]   Why not actually create a great version of your product?
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:14.800]   I have to admit, I'm so modal.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:15.800]   I don't even notice it.
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:19.560]   Because I, you know, like, it was a really big TV is just, is just on the TV.
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:22.880]   And then my, and then I watch movies on my iPad and I don't really watch anything on
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:23.880]   my phone anymore.
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:27.360]   I just, there was a really good study about, cause there was, this is a huge concern in
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:30.740]   the design world, whether you make it, like it's a Firefox thing, like do you make Firefox
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:35.880]   look the same on every platform or do you make it suit the specific platform that it's
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:39.880]   on and what's more important, your brand or the platform feel and what they've found,
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:43.000]   like according to the study, enough to try to find the link for it is that most people
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.200]   aren't cross platform.
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:47.360]   Most people don't have multiple versions of, like they have Netflix on eight different
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:50.000]   things, but they never watch it on anything but one.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.080]   So if you make it work well, like if you make it fit with the behaviors of the platform,
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:58.280]   then people already know how to use it because they're using eight other apps on that platform
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:00.200]   that are, that are well behaved.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:03.880]   And they're not going to, like, they're tablet is such a different mental context than their
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:06.240]   TV that it's okay if they're not similar to that.
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:10.080]   But the YouTube app has to work the way the Amazon Prime app works the way the Netflix
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:15.120]   app works the way the TV app works and then no user has any problem with any of the software
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.120]   on their device.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:20.360]   Yeah, it's a different, I think it's a different thing with TV apps because I really don't think
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:24.760]   that any company has created a breakthrough paradigm for this.
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:30.480]   It's always up down left right action and there is voice but it's a sub.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:31.480]   I don't know.
[01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:35.360]   I don't know anybody who uses a feature who is not currently at the second being filmed
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:38.520]   for commercial for Verizon or for one of those products.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:43.840]   And so the bigger problem is that there are oftentimes where I just don't even see the
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:47.920]   same paradigms being transferred from one place to another.
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:50.120]   I love Adobe Lightroom.
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:55.120]   I like the fact that I can use it on my iPad or anything or any other device.
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:59.480]   But I've disappointed that I get the same experience on Windows as I do on the Mac.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:02.680]   One of the reasons why I really love using Aperture was that it really was designed by
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:05.600]   people who think in terms of the Apple user interface.
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:10.040]   It really does fit into the same world.
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:14.480]   It's like a like in Star Trek where every single, it's an alien from eight cajillion
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:15.680]   light years away.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:20.200]   But he or she still has two arms, two legs, two eyes, a mouth and a nose in the familiar
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:22.560]   places we're used to seeing them.
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:29.760]   And so when you wind up with a gelatinous blamange alien, it's like, I will still have
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:32.400]   you play on my Scrabble team.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.200]   Or your good blamange.
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:35.760]   I'm glad to have you here.
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:40.760]   Just realize that I'm going to have to, it doesn't fit in with the rest of the world
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:42.560]   that I'm living in.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:50.720]   As of a couple of days ago, Apple changed its address for the first time since 1993.
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:58.360]   If you go to the Apple page for Contact Us, their new official address, it used to be
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:00.240]   one what greatest address ever.
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:02.920]   Right, one infinite loop.
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:04.200]   This one's not so bad.
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:09.920]   One Apple Parkway, Cupertino, California, 950014.
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.360]   There's still that one infinite loop.
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.800]   Yeah, the building's still there.
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:15.680]   But if you send, if you want to send mail to Apple, send it to.
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:18.000]   Otherwise, Eddie, Eddie, he's going to get all your mail.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.840]   Is Eddie stuck on the old campus?
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.440]   Well, I think iTunes is because right now iTunes is spread out.
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:23.440]   They have results way.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.440]   They have a bunch of other campuses.
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:25.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:26.440]   And I think they're going to try to unify.
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:27.920]   But I think they already don't have space.
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:29.240]   I think they don't have space at Apple Park.
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:31.440]   No, they don't have space at infinite loop again.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.480]   No, they're growing fast.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:38.720]   You got to think, though, that that is-- I know that you can know in your head, oh, it's
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.480]   not an insult.
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:45.920]   But to see all your colleagues moving to the new campus, and you're stuck in the old one.
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.720]   That's kind of very organizational base.
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:50.880]   If there are teams that are split up, it'll be super annoying.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:53.520]   But as long as it's like Eddie's group is in one place.
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.520]   I'm sure they're not doing that.
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:57.280]   I think there's some advantages to the older one.
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:00.360]   I truthfully, one infinite loop was great.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:05.480]   I like the fact that it was really nicely integrated into a community where at times
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.560]   you feel as though you're-- if you go from one building to another, you feel as though
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:12.680]   you're leaving a place and entering another place.
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:18.760]   Infinite loop-- excuse me, the spaceship campus is a little bit more of a compound feel to
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:19.760]   it, I think.
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:24.520]   I wonder what it's going to be like to live and work there 12 hours a day, five or six
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:27.240]   days a week, seven days a week during crunch time.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:33.400]   And it's like I am-- I know that when I wave to the parapets, as I walk past the outer
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:36.880]   layer of the fortress, I know I've left the campus.
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:39.480]   Otherwise, I know that I'm still within the ring.
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:40.480]   What?
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:41.480]   Just look up from your phone.
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:42.480]   Parking top of the glove.
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:48.480]   If you look at the drone shots, the parking for the new campus is pretty far away from
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:53.080]   the building compared to the one in from the local--
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:57.600]   14-0 city loss, sir.
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:06.160]   Just real quickly, I want to find Scooter X, our chat mod, went to the shareholders
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:08.400]   meeting last week.
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:13.480]   And he has posted somewhere, I'm going to find the link for Scooter X. He's posted
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:15.280]   the pictures he took.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:19.280]   He said it's really a beautiful campus.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:23.480]   Let's see, he wrote a nice little article about it.
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:29.680]   But where is-- the photos link on Google Photos, I'm trying to find it.
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:31.640]   Oh, here it is.
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:32.800]   Here it is.
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:36.440]   Thank you, Scooter.
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:39.840]   It really is-- now Scooter X, you took this with a Pixel 2.
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:42.840]   I hope you're not going to-- we're not going to have any problems.
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:46.240]   It's pretty good block tackled.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.560]   It really is gorgeous.
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:50.160]   He says there was music coming out of the ground.
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:53.080]   They have speakers, underground speakers.
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:54.360]   I love this roof, too.
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:25:01.600]   We've seen these amazing pictures before of this roof.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:05.560]   And a beautiful-- you've been here, Renee, so I apologize for boring you.
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:06.760]   Oh, that's beautiful.
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:10.160]   But there's Scooter's badge.
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:14.520]   He drove five hours, got up very early in the morning to go to this.
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:18.920]   It's the pneumatic tube that shoots you up to--
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:24.160]   It delivers people all through the campus like a gustous gloop.
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:29.400]   Well, he's fallen into the iPhone mixing tank.
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:32.880]   So I'm not sure how you got this special treatment, but he got a--
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:36.480]   he did get a tour in a golf cart around the grounds a little bit.
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:37.320]   So he did it.
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:41.520]   He was able to see some of the landscaping, which is coming in.
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:44.840]   Here's the reception in a tantau.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:45.840]   Well, that's not a tantan.
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:46.800]   That's different.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:47.960]   Yeah, tantau is the road that--
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:49.720]   Oh, OK.
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:50.960]   Should have been tantan.
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:51.600]   Tantan.
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:53.520]   That's the one I was thinking.
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:55.040]   This is the visitor center, right?
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.560]   The little reception area there.
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:57.600]   And they have--
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:00.120]   They hear what she much here is?
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:01.760]   I never asked Renee.
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:05.080]   What's the accommodation for people with disabilities
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.080]   inside the theater?
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.520]   I don't know, because--
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:11.600]   Special assistant and assistant devices?
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:13.240]   Yeah, I actually don't know.
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:14.800]   And I'm ashamed that I don't know.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.400]   But I believe they have the ablators and--
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.200]   The scooter ex has a little trouble moving around.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:23.440]   Scooter ex, did you get any special access treatment there?
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:25.040]   Where he was able to get.
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:27.880]   And he says he was led in a little bit before the crowds.
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:31.280]   I'm sure they have an elevator that you can get down in.
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:32.720]   He's not a chair, but he's--
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.840]   Accessibility in ADA is so important.
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:35.840]   You have to do it.
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:36.960]   Well, not only do you have to do it.
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:37.560]   It's so important.
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:38.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:39.960]   I can't imagine this, not actually probably--
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.520]   I believe it has seating too.
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:42.560]   Like they had special seating arrangements.
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.080]   I'm sure they do.
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:44.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:47.600]   Matthew Roberts has been posting drone videos
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:50.680]   of the Apple campus, has a new job.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:53.920]   He says, a drone pilot crashed into Apple Park
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:55.080]   over the weekend.
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.920]   The drone pilot got in touch with me shortly
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:58.880]   after the incident to ask if I could
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.640]   assist in locating his down drone.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:02.600]   So he took out his Phantom 4 Pro
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:05.520]   and began searching for it.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.120]   This is his search.
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:11.320]   Oh, there's the video of it crashing.
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:13.800]   This is like the snow speeder is looking for Luke.
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:16.240]   So obviously, it's not a Phantom 4.
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:19.160]   Not quite the 4K imagery we're used to.
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:19.680]   Great.
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:22.120]   You're going to get so scolded by Old Man Cook,
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:24.400]   who's sick and tired of you kids.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:27.000]   He says, there was no sign of premature.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.920]   It just-- this is what happens to me every time I fly a drone.
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:33.400]   It just went down.
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:36.120]   Now, maybe Apple has a new supersonic device.
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:39.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:40.400]   The phasers.
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:42.400]   The phasers are set to stun.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:43.680]   Crunch.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:46.000]   And he said, I don't know where it landed.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.800]   So he got a little help.
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:50.560]   Oh, no.
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.360]   And there it is.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.640]   You can see it in the solar panels.
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:55.720]   You see we're zooming in there.
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:57.440]   Didn't damage them.
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:59.480]   No.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:02.680]   I'm surprised a guard didn't run up there.
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:04.160]   I didn't even see it.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:09.080]   It looks like a DJI actually looks like a Phantom.
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:12.080]   The pilot notified Apple of the incident
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:14.400]   and got a stern talking to.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:15.760]   I'm the old Apple.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:16.520]   It's me.
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:17.360]   I crashed.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.360]   My name is Guy from Next Door.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:20.320]   How do you get the pushback?
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:21.800]   I guess that was a live feed.
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:23.040]   It's Billy from Next Door.
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:25.320]   I crashed my drone across your fans.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:27.040]   Can I hop over?
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.320]   That was where I find your--
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:29.600]   You know what the punishment is?
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.600]   He's going to have to wash windows for an entire week.
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:34.120]   That's a lot of windows.
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.680]   Billy learns his lesson.
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:39.800]   I wonder if Apple-- well, obviously, this drone is fine.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:42.480]   Michael and Matthew Roberts' drone didn't get taken down.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:43.840]   But you know, you've got to wonder
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:46.240]   what Apple's doing to protect themselves against flyovers.
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:48.440]   I imagine this is just getting--
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:51.480]   Well, this is just so damn annoying on top of everything
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.600]   else to say, look, we are sick.
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:57.360]   I would not like to be an employee at Apple knowing
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.800]   that there could be people sending drones just for fun
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:01.120]   to get in the windows.
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.120]   Yeah.
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:03.120]   I mean, yeah.
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:03.620]   It's illegal.
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:04.360]   You can't do it.
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:06.320]   You can't jam the frequencies and have these things.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:08.560]   But nor can you fly over people.
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:09.920]   No, no, you can get someone in trouble
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:10.760]   who's flying over people.
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:12.480]   But you can't take down the drone.
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.200]   You can't take down the drone.
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:17.160]   Unless you did it with a sandbag cannon.
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:17.680]   Well, they--
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:19.360]   That wouldn't be illegal.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:21.120]   I don't know.
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:22.240]   I know that there's--
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:24.360]   I wonder if they have drones that fire nets.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.280]   They have drones that fire nets at other drones.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:31.400]   And those are not used in the United States.
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:32.360]   What about EM2?
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:34.160]   Can you set up for EM2?
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:35.640]   Sorry.
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:38.240]   And EMP, like an electromagnetic pulse.
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.120]   They probably take your drone down at the same time.
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:41.040]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:42.120]   It would not only take down the drone,
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:45.280]   but the nuclear fallout would just kill everybody in Apple.
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:47.640]   You know, it would be a very, very Apple eco-friendly
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:49.680]   and awesome solution.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:50.800]   Attack hawks.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:52.840]   You just train hawks.
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:56.200]   You spend like a year or so flying like drones
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:58.640]   that have like raw meat attached to them.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:01.880]   You train these hawks to attack these to get meat and boom.
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:04.200]   You have to get it just right so they learn to not come
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:07.200]   from above, but come from below and put their claws up.
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.520]   The eagles are coming.
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:10.920]   It's been the eagles that are coming.
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:13.240]   I'm just going to Google anti-drown hawks.
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:14.880]   Yeah, actually.
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:16.680]   This is not a new idea.
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:19.200]   The Dutch police have trained hawks.
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:21.200]   I thought I'd seen this.
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:21.720]   Oh.
[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:23.440]   They have trained hawks to take drones.
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:25.840]   I like this completely out of the sky.
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:27.440]   I want to see what they do.
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:29.200]   They handle it.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:32.480]   They just take it down.
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:33.840]   I got it right here.
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.240]   There it goes.
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:38.920]   Yeah, you're not going to win against 5 million years
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:40.360]   of food-based evolution.
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:42.280]   Terminated with extreme hawks.
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:44.200]   That's a lot of R&D.
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:44.760]   Look at that.
[01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:45.320]   Boom.
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:46.160]   It's easy for them.
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:48.000]   It's no trouble.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000]   Nope, no problem.
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.520]   I'll be glad to get it.
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:52.040]   The company says they're continuously
[01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:54.960]   investigating any possible extra possible protective
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:57.760]   measures in order to protect our birds.
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:58.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:30:58.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:30:59.400]   Well, you're the bald eagle.
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:00.440]   That's a bald eagle.
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:04.000]   So great.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:04.760]   Wow.
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:05.400]   Thank you, sir.
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:06.080]   Thank you for serving.
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:08.080]   God bless you, Dutch and National Police.
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:08.600]   Neither.
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:08.800]   Good heavens.
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:10.040]   Thank you for your service.
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:14.440]   Don't mess with the Dutch.
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:16.880]   They can command-- they can command attack birds
[01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:18.960]   at their will.
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.800]   Tim Cook, like, just raise his glasses
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:22.320]   and use his Omega beams to not mess.
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:24.920]   I really want Apple to do this.
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:27.240]   Because I have mocks everywhere.
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:29.840]   Hey, we can't help it if the hawks like drones.
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:30.320]   I don't know.
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:31.520]   All right, get your picks ready.
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:32.560]   We're going to take a break and come back
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:34.040]   with your picks of the week.
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:36.960]   Renee Ritchie from iMour.com, Alex Lindsey from the Pixel
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.640]   Corp from the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:41.040]   Mr. Andy Enoco, our show today brought to you
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:45.320]   by my favorite blog platform, my favorite web platform.
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:49.320]   Frankly, the world's favorite web platform, 29%
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.520]   of all the websites in the world.
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:55.040]   Run on, say it with me, WordPress.
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:56.560]   WordPress is phenomenal.
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.360]   Some of the best magazines and publications
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.200]   use WordPress's platform.
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:01.840]   I use it for my blog.
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:04.320]   If you've got a business or you want to set up a personal website,
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:06.040]   that's leoloport.com right there.
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:08.280]   I'm very, very proud of that.
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.720]   I just-- it was so easy to do.
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:10.600]   You don't need experience.
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:11.640]   You don't need to hire somebody.
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:15.240]   WordPress.com guides you through the entire process,
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:17.440]   from start to finish.
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:19.320]   They take care of all the technical details.
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.720]   They keep the site up.
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:23.840]   They keep all the patches, all the plugins, everything.
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:26.160]   They have hundreds of beautiful designs to choose from.
[01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:29.200]   You get automatic features like built-in search engine
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:30.400]   optimization.
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:31.600]   I love social sharing.
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:34.120]   That means somebody who likes what you're doing
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:37.120]   can share it with their network on Facebook and Twitter.
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:39.960]   And by the way, WordPress.com itself is a social network.
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:41.640]   You can have a follow button.
[01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:45.200]   I get hundreds of followers from WordPress.com.
[01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:46.760]   I'm a business plan owner.
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:47.480]   I like that.
[01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:50.440]   It gives me access to every plugin, every theme.
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:53.120]   I can even bring my own.
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:54.280]   Best customer support team.

[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:22.520]   little all may can do.
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:23.680]   I love WordPress.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:27.880]   WordPress.com/MacBreak, 15% off your brand new website.
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:30.520]   Full disclaimer, I've been using WordPress
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:31.840]   practically since the beginning.
[01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:41.000]   I think since 2004, 2005, WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.800]   Let's start with you, Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:46.040]   So late last week, Twitter announced
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:49.080]   that they were no longer going to be maintaining Twitter for Mac.
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:52.360]   It started as Tweety for Mac by Lauren Richter of 8-Bit's fame.
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.200]   Became Twitter for Mac.
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:55.520]   They created a new version of it.
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:57.920]   And then they promptly abandoned it.
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:01.280]   So I wanted to recommend two of my favorite Twitter clients.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:03.800]   Yes, you can still go to Twitter.com in Safari or Chrome
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:04.480]   or whatever you like.
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:07.800]   Or you can use TweetDeck, either the--
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:10.000]   I think it's an electron app.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.240]   Or you can use TweetDeck on the web, whatever you like.
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:14.160]   But if you want a native experience,
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:16.520]   if you want a really mac-ity-mac experience,
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:18.440]   if you love the idea of Twitter being persistent
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:20.480]   of having keyboard shortcuts, of being
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.280]   available in a window or columns,
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:25.920]   or just in other ways, acting like only a native app can,
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.600]   then there is two wonderful choices for you.
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:31.240]   There's TweetBot, which is a really opinionated Twitter
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:33.160]   client that has a little bit of that Tweety.
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:35.600]   There is a little bit of the original Twitter for Mac
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:36.920]   flavor.
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:38.760]   There are a lot of things around mute filters.
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:42.040]   It's still in a phenomenally quick way to triage Twitter.
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:44.000]   If what you really want to do is get in there
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.240]   and just handle all your mentions and DMs and lists
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:50.760]   and all those things, TweetBot is a phenomenal way to do that.
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.880]   And there's also Twitterific, which has just proudly
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:55.760]   returned to the Mac after a Kickstarter project.
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:58.680]   And Twitterific, they found a way to hack around Poll
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:01.400]   because third-party Twitter clients do not get access
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:03.560]   to all the same APIs that first party do.
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:04.280]   They don't get polls.
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:05.280]   They don't get group IMs.
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.720]   They don't get a lot of other features.
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:09.120]   But they found a way-- if you put a hashtag poll
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.320]   or the poll emoji on it, they'll send you
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:13.160]   to a web view with the poll in it.
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:15.920]   They've also got an edit button, which kind of surreptitiously
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:16.800]   deletes your Twitter.
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:19.320]   You're tweeting the background and retweets for you.
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:21.800]   And they've also got phenomenal accessibility support.
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.280]   So if you're someone who's near or someone's
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:28.040]   got lower or no vision or has other accessibility needs,
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:30.000]   then Twitterific is just a wonderful choice
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.920]   because web clients are traditionally not
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:34.200]   great at surfacing specific needs.
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:35.440]   People with accessibility issues.
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:38.200]   So if you really love Twitter and you use a Mac
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:40.480]   and you want Twitter on your Mac, and for some reason,
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:42.560]   you are still using the Twitter for Mac app
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:46.240]   then either of these will serve you really well.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:47.800]   Yeah, it's just so sad.
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:52.680]   I wish they'd give him back Tweety or something.
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:54.600]   Well, Lauren is super busy, but the people--
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:56.760]   the outsourced the last version of Twitter for Mac,
[01:35:56.760 --> 01:35:59.520]   it was made by a really, really well-known third party
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:00.280]   development house.
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:01.480]   And my understanding is some of the people who
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:04.160]   worked on it were like, please, let us keep working on it.
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:05.520]   And Twitter was like, nope.
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:07.560]   And there was an interesting exchange between Dan
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:11.080]   Frommer and John Gruber and Jack Dempsey on--
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:13.440]   I'm not Jack Dempsey, sorry, Jack from Twitter,
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:15.680]   I'm like on his last name--
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:17.280]   on Twitter where he was saying, we really
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:19.840]   want to invest in the experience of the web.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:22.840]   But Twitter never felt like a website to me the way
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:24.800]   that Facebook or something that's always felt like an IM
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.200]   client, an IM client.
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:28.680]   I've always been best as native apps.
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:31.040]   I didn't realize Lauren had worked at Apple.
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:31.480]   So he--
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:33.880]   He did the OpenGL stack on the original iPhone.
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:35.080]   Yeah.
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:37.640]   Here's your profile of him from a few years back.
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:40.120]   And correct me if I'm wrong, but I think
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:45.480]   Tweety was the app that invented the pull to refresh.
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:46.720]   Yes, correct.
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:48.080]   Interface, which now everything has.
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:51.560]   The interface on iPad was so forward looking.
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:53.440]   It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in terms
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.920]   of tablet software.
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:57.760]   And Tweety for Mac, he basically rewrote UI kit for Mac,
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:00.200]   called it Tweety, and implemented it that way
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.960]   because he wanted to do things with scroll views.
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:05.360]   They just app kit at the point in time couldn't do.
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:06.800]   It was remarkable software legacy.
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.160]   Yeah.
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:11.640]   It was very-- I'm sure it was good for Lauren
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:14.160]   that Apple bought it.
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:17.080]   But of course they killed it.
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:17.720]   I'm not Apple.
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:18.400]   Twitter bought it.
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:19.720]   And of course they've killed it.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:20.600]   But pulled over fresh.
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.560]   There it is.
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:24.280]   That Lauren Bricktik should get credit really
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:28.600]   for creating that metaphor that every program now uses.
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:29.600]   It's just so natural.
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:31.160]   It's just a way that the vocabulary--
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:33.240]   he said that he was just fiddling with his phone
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:34.480]   and pulling down and he thought, well, that's
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:35.160]   a useful gesture.
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:36.920]   Something should happen when I do that.
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:37.920]   It's just natural.
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:40.040]   It's like he invented adverbs.
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:41.240]   I'm just seriously--
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:42.240]   Yeah.
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:44.880]   There was a working language that now--
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:47.000]   as soon as it appeared, it feels as though that was there
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.440]   always.
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:49.600]   Brilliant.
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:52.720]   I'm sure that Lauren got a nice payday and I hope he did.
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:54.560]   And what's he doing these days?
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:57.080]   What is eight bits up to these days?
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.120]   He is busy working on some personal projects
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:02.280]   and you may or may not be able to see a brief visit from him
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:03.440]   on Tomorrow's Vector.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:05.760]   Oh, that's nice timing.
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:07.320]   How convenient.
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:07.820]   Yeah.
[01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:09.360]   I haven't told anybody else that.
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.680]   So everyone else will be surprised unless you watch my video.
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:14.240]   That's nice.
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:15.440]   Letterpress was great.
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:16.840]   I remember that program.
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:17.880]   Is that still around?
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:19.680]   He wrote that in OpenGL.
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:20.520]   It's still around.
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:21.920]   Yeah, I don't believe he maintains it anymore.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:23.360]   Yeah.
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:25.360]   Well, I will be listening tomorrow to find out
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:27.120]   what Lauren Britter's next act.
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:27.720]   Sure.
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:31.640]   I'm sure he's off just rewriting UIKit when--
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:32.520]   G--
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:35.520]   Is it really talented designer and programmer?
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:38.840]   It's really, really, really cool.
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:40.160]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:42.600]   He's one of those few individuals who is good an engineer,
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:45.200]   as he is a designer, as he is a creative in terms
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:47.400]   of what sort of interactions people want.
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:50.240]   And like Alex, he worked a little while with Mike Mattis
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:53.400]   at Facebook when they were doing chat heads and paper
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:54.160]   and some of those things.
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:55.480]   And he would just spot--
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:57.800]   like you're dropping one frame out of the 60 on this one.
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:58.560]   Let's fix that.
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:01.480]   Great guy.
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:04.760]   Alex Lindsey, you've got a few things coming up.
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:05.640]   We do.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:06.720]   Tell us about that.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:08.640]   Alex, I'd hate to interrupt there.
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:10.560]   But before I learn what you're about to talk about,
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:12.960]   I just want to say the friendship, if--
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:14.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:17.400]   We've enjoyed it over these years.
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:19.200]   It's one of my most valued things.
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:20.320]   And one of these--
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:20.680]   Sure.
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:21.640]   --what are these days--
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:23.480]   I've been meaning to say that I've got--
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:25.680]   ever since I moved, I have all this old stuff
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:27.120]   that I can't use anymore.
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:28.280]   And it's going to send you a list.
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:30.440]   And whatever you want, you just have for free.
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:31.760]   I just put them down there.
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:32.800]   I'm sorry to interrupt.
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.600]   Except for Crane, go ahead and talk about whatever
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:35.840]   you want to hear.
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:40.600]   Well, we're building up-- what really happened here
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:43.960]   is we realized we had a lot of stuff that's been--
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:48.120]   we're slowly trying to unify under one pipeline.
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:48.800]   And--
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:49.600]   Production pipeline.
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:50.120]   Production pipeline.
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:51.560]   We should mention, if you didn't know,
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:54.120]   that Alex Lindsey's company, Pixelcore,
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:57.000]   is the king of the hill in terms of live streaming
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.960]   interactive broadcasts.
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:02.280]   You do them for the biggest companies, governments--
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:04.680]   I mean, all over the world.
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:06.760]   So you, more than anyone we know,
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:08.880]   buy a lot of video production here.
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:10.280]   Yeah, and we've gone through it.
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:12.560]   We know we've evolved through a lot of production gear.
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:14.960]   And we got to a point where we had three or four different
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:16.760]   pipelines that we were using.
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:18.760]   And we realized we needed to kind of centralize on one.
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:21.240]   We're also, at the same time, we're building up a studio
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:23.320]   in Washington, DC to support people who
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:27.040]   want to stream inexpensively from our studio.
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:31.280]   And so we're trying to raise cash for that at the same time.
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:32.520]   And so we were like, you know what?
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:34.520]   We've got-- we did the math.
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:36.800]   It's like over $1 million worth of hardware that we're not--
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:37.920]   You don't use.
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:38.920]   I don't know if we never use it for--
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:40.160]   It used to be in our basement.
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:42.000]   I know it because it used to be in our basement.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:42.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:43.960]   So it's a lot of gear.
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:46.680]   And so we decided to--
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:49.280]   we decided to sell at pretty good rates,
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:51.120]   because we just want to try to get moving out--
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:52.960]   Everything is priced to go.
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:54.560]   It is priced to go.
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:56.760]   It'll be the best deals we get.
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:59.720]   We'll probably be a little pushier on eBay once it gets there.
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:02.320]   So the idea is that we'll do an in-person sale on Thursday.
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.680]   So you have to go to--
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:04.720]   Here's two layers.
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:05.320]   OK.
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:10.440]   One is that we're going to do an in-person sale on Thursday
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:11.040]   at our office.
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:12.760]   So you actually get to see what our office looks like.
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:14.760]   We just been kind of secret.
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:17.160]   And then a week or two later, we're
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:18.160]   going to do an online one.
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:21.040]   So whatever it didn't sell on Thursday.
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.000]   And we're using Square.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.400]   Don't bring checks.
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:24.520]   I don't do that really.
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:25.320]   Bring credit cards.
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:27.040]   Cash or credit.
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:28.360]   Well, Square doesn't take cash.
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:30.480]   No, I can take out of it or you can bring cash.
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:30.960]   OK.
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:32.520]   But you can't bring checks.
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:35.160]   Anyway, unless they're cashier checks, whatever.
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:38.160]   So anyway, so--
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:40.040]   but we're going to try to get a riz as much as we can
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:40.720]   on Thursday.
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:43.000]   And then we're going to do an online sale
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.520]   on sometime in the next week or two
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:47.840]   before we start putting everything on eBay.
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:51.360]   So everyone will get kind of a--
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.000]   everyone will get a chance, at least the people who
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.280]   would listen here and follow me on Twitter and Facebook
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:58.280]   and stuff like that will get a chance to either come
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:00.080]   and check it out or do it online.
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:03.120]   And then it'll all start getting piece by piece up on eBay.
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:04.960]   We'd like to try to avoid the amount of work that it takes
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:08.400]   to-- I mean, there's literally 200 or 300 things
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:10.120]   that we're selling, everything from little USB
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:12.200]   mics and headsets that--
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:14.000]   Oddly enough, like literally we have headsets.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.440]   You know those--
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:16.440]   Plantronic headsets?
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:17.040]   Oh, really?
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:17.540]   Yeah.
[01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:19.360]   I've got five of them that are still in boxes.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:20.360]   Like, we bought them as--
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:21.400]   Oh, that doesn't surprise me.
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:23.360]   Well, they're backups for--
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:26.160]   they were backups for hangouts that we used to do.
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:29.800]   And so anyway, so there's a lot of stuff.
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:31.960]   Most of it is in incredibly good condition
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:35.600]   because we were always worried about it breaking.
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:36.080]   And so--
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:37.440]   How can people find out about it?
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:40.880]   So what they can do is they can go to pixacore.com/sale.
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:43.360]   So I try to make it as easy as possible.
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:50.480]   If you go to pixacore.com/sale, you can just sign up.
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:52.280]   We'll send you a list tomorrow.
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:54.040]   It's very-- it's very cloak and dagger here
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:56.080]   because we're just finishing it up.
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:56.880]   A list tomorrow.
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:00.640]   And then if you're in Northern California on Thursday morning,
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:02.200]   we'll send you the address because what we're going to do
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:03.040]   is we're going to do the sale.
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:05.080]   And then we're going to move all the equipment out of there.
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:08.520]   And so anyway, so you'll have--
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:09.760]   you'll get an address on Thursday
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.000]   if you're in Northern California.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.880]   Otherwise, you will--
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:15.880]   again, if you sign up for the same list,
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:21.320]   we're going to tell you how to look at it online in a couple
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:22.840]   weeks when we get it organized online.
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:23.940]   We'd like to-- it's pixacore.
[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:25.800]   It's not in the state sale because that--
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:26.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:27.800]   No one died.
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:29.320]   No one died.
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:32.480]   And so it's just a-- it's a spring cleaning sale.
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:35.800]   I think that's really a better solution.
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:38.480]   We have a lot of gear that, again, we weren't using--
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:41.520]   we weren't fully utilizing before it becomes not useful.
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:43.040]   Bring your credit card.
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:44.040]   Bring your pink slip.
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.040]   Bring your wife.
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:46.040]   Come on, Dan.
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:47.040]   Do you have to opt out?
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:48.240]   Do you bring auction titles?
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:51.960]   FS100s, like five or six of them.
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:52.480]   We've got--
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:53.600]   You've got one on the CX3, I think.
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:55.160]   Oh, unless-- yeah, that one's off.
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:56.880]   We've got some older EX1s.
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:02.360]   We also have Sony P1, Sony P23s, which are pretty expensive
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:07.200]   cameras, and then Sound devices, 788s, and all kinds of stuff
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:08.880]   that we're making available.
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:11.520]   So a lot of this stuff is not old.
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:12.120]   No, no, no.
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:13.360]   A lot of it's still in production.
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:18.320]   So it's-- and we've got just lots of stuff
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:19.040]   that we're trying to move.
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:23.960]   And mixer-- somehow we have how we ended up with 20 mixers.
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:25.640]   But we have a lot of-- some of them are digital.
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:26.440]   Some of them are analog.
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:30.040]   We've got little ones that are tiny and big digital ones.
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:33.320]   But again, we're trying to tie that all together.
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:35.280]   So anyway, that's the sale.
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:40.320]   And we'll-- I'll put it in the chat room there,
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:42.320]   so people can get it there.
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.080]   And just sign up there, and we'll
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:47.080]   send you both updates for the in-room and then updates
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:50.000]   for the online sale that's coming up before we get
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.720]   everything on there.
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:52.680]   Anyway, so that's that.
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:54.400]   And then my pick of the week is really
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:56.520]   the new Blackmagic camera.
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:59.720]   Now we know what you're replacing all these other cameras.
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:02.280]   So the new Blackmagic camera-- this is a--
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:06.400]   this is what's called the Blackmagic broadcast camera.
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:08.480]   And this was like really-- for those of you
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:11.640]   in doing production, what Blackmagic added last week,
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:13.640]   I think it was last week or the week before,
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:17.320]   is really the last missing parts that we had for broadcast,
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:20.400]   which is-- so this is a 2/3 inch camera.
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:22.200]   Now you might wonder why we're going down
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:24.920]   to 2/3 inch, because we mostly-- almost all of our work
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:26.320]   nowadays is super 35.
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:27.640]   This is not 4K.
[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:28.200]   It is 4K.
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:29.400]   Oh, it is 4K, OK.
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:31.920]   So it's a 4K 2/3 inch camera.
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:34.840]   And it also-- they've also added--
[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:38.400]   so it's great E and G camera, but they've also added fiber
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:41.920]   backs for it so that you can control it with a CCU.
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:45.080]   These are all things that are required for broadcast studios.
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:48.360]   You can use standard, SIMT-5-r to base it.
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:49.280]   You don't have to use those.
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:51.280]   You don't have to use Sony cards anymore, either.
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:56.400]   Yeah, that's been-- they've gotten ahead of that for a while.
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:57.720]   It'll take 2/3 inch lenses.
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:58.920]   And the reason that that's important
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:02.600]   is because the B4 mount is something
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:05.680]   that is very common in broadcast.
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:06.920]   So everybody's lenses.
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:09.520]   And the thing is, you don't spend money on cameras
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:11.360]   as much as you spend money on glass.
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:14.560]   So everyone's got a single lens anywhere
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:19.240]   from $15,000 to $100,000 just for the glass.
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:20.840]   Now, most of the time, for the really big glass,
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:24.800]   we rent it, but we own a lot of glass as well.
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:28.120]   And getting really good glass is the thing
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:32.720]   that is complicated.
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.520]   And so no one wanted-- there's a lot of resistance
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:37.280]   to the other mini-ursas because you couldn't really
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:39.800]   get good--
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:41.960]   you couldn't use your old glass on it effectively.
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:43.720]   So this is a 2/3 inch chip that'll
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:48.120]   let you just use all the broadcast glass you already have.
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:53.520]   We have it up in the lab, so they lent us one to look at.
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:56.120]   I get it until the end of today, I think.
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:58.560]   But we're going to buy a couple of these.
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:00.400]   And the reason we're buying them is because they integrate
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:02.280]   with the rest of our pipeline.
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:05.920]   We can throw big 90x box lenses on them.
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:08.920]   They've got fiber, backs, and everything else.
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:10.520]   Now, they say it's a broadcast.
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:12.880]   Does that mean it's not good for the field?
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:14.160]   I mean, they're a lower light.
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:15.720]   So you can use it.
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:19.120]   What I'd say about that is that it's a little grainier
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:24.320]   than the 2/3 of chips that we're used to, just a touch.
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:26.160]   But the grain is much nicer.
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:29.120]   So the grain is much more closer to a film look
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:31.840]   than the grain that you get.
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:35.640]   When you get digital grain from a CCD or 2/3 inch CMOS,
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:39.480]   it's typically like this really ugly electronic grain
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:42.200]   that is not particularly useful.
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:45.920]   And so you really can't gain up at all.
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:48.320]   This one is--
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:49.920]   it's got a little bit of grain to it.
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:52.760]   It's got more grain than the Super 35, as you would expect,
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:55.040]   because it's a much smaller--
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:58.880]   it's a third the size of the Super 35 sensor.
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:01.720]   So it's going to have a little bit more
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:03.720]   rather than you would have there.
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:08.120]   But again, it ties into a standard video production pipeline.
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:10.280]   And the reason you want 2/3 of the chip--
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:13.360]   and the clarity on the chip is very high.
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:15.920]   And the reason that you want a 2/3 of a chip is also
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:18.120]   because if you're doing ENG, you actually
[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:20.800]   don't want the short-dip the field that you're typically
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:23.840]   used to for artsy stuff and film,
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:26.360]   because you're handheld, you're trying to get somebody
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:29.240]   in focus, and having the Super 35 lens--
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:31.000]   also when you throw it on a 90x lens,
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:32.840]   so those big box lenses, you see it
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:34.560]   at a baseball game or football game.
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:37.320]   The problem is you put Super 35 lens--
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:39.680]   I mean, Super 35 sensor on the top of one of those,
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:42.760]   even if they made one, which they don't--
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:45.080]   the depth of field gets so tight that you can't actually
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:46.560]   keep anybody in focus.
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:49.600]   And so having a 2/3 engine a little bit more depth of field
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:52.120]   actually makes a difference.
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:54.360]   These are EF lenses.
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:55.720]   No, no, these are PL.
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:57.440]   Some are PL, not PL, B4.
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:48:58.920]   B4 lens.
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:48:59.840]   There's so many lenses.
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:01.560]   PL is really what you're using for your Super 35.
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:04.000]   But they do say it's have lens adapters for--
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.600]   You can get other lens adapters, but what this one really
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:14.080]   is built for is a B4 mount, which is the standard broadcast
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:14.680]   mount.
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:17.400]   And again, the crazy thing is you can buy--
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:22.000]   this glass is so common that you can buy those ENG lenses
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.880]   for hundreds of dollars or low thousands--
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:24.720]   Really?
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:28.480]   If this doesn't come with a lens, it's 3295 minus a lens.
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:28.920]   Right.
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:31.400]   And then for us, the other math is
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:33.960]   we're going to still buy a CCU for it, which
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:35.400]   is another $3,000.
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:36.400]   And we're going to buy it.
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:38.200]   And lots of stuff.
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:40.200]   Once you package it together, it's a little bit more expensive.
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:41.800]   But that's the way it is for a lot of cameras.
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:43.080]   It's not what you buy them.
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:46.280]   It's incredibly inexpensive for what they were.
[01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:49.040]   But yeah, a full package is still going to cost $15,000.
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:51.160]   It still blows me away that you can get a camera of this
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:52.800]   quality for $3,500.
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:56.160]   I know that sounds like a lot, but it's only five galaxies.
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:57.080]   Right, yes.
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:49:59.080]   It's a great deal if you're going down the path.
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:00.800]   And if you're not doing ENG or you're not
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:02.840]   doing a bunch of those things, Super 35 still
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:05.240]   makes sense for those types of things.
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:07.920]   They also, by the way, this is a typical black magic.
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:10.760]   They took their 2ME switcher, the new 12G 2ME switcher.
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:11.800]   And they said, oh, yeah, now there's
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:14.240]   a software upgrade that makes it a 4ME.
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:16.560]   So there's-- we just didn't--
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:18.440]   if you have a 2ME and you spent the extra money
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:21.600]   on the 12G rather than the 6G, which I didn't,
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.120]   so now I'm kicking myself.
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:25.840]   I've got like six of the 6Gs.
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:30.120]   The 12Gs now, just with an update, are now 4ME.
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:32.520]   Now what we're hoping for in NAB is, of course,
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:36.000]   a 4ME control panel, but we don't know if that's
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:36.760]   going to happen or not.
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:38.640]   Anyway, but the camera is a good--
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:39.960]   I mean, if you're looking at broadcast,
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:42.600]   I mean, again, we've done some pretty heavy testing
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:46.160]   over the last four or five days on the sensor.
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:49.240]   And it's as good as it's going to get for two thurs.
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:49.800]   I'm impressed.
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:51.440]   Black magic's really kind of--
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:52.440]   They're just chewing it up.
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:53.160]   Yeah.
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:54.120]   They're chewing it up.
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:56.800]   I mean, they came out of nowhere.
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:57.480]   Well, they came out of--
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:58.920]   Tony and Canon and Nikon.
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:00.160]   Yeah, they didn't see it coming.
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:01.160]   I mean, I mean--
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:03.400]   And they bought Altimat.
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:04.600]   And they haven't set it outright,
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:07.360]   but the new update for their switchers,
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:10.480]   I was like, the controls for their keyer
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:12.520]   looks remarkably like Altimat.
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:14.240]   Like, they didn't say, oh, we put Altimat in it,
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:16.920]   because they're still charging 10 grand for an Altimat box,
[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:18.840]   which by the way, a 4K, 10K--
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:24.560]   a 4K-- 10K keyer for 4K footage.
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:29.920]   I paid $33,000 for a 1080p, 444 years ago.
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:33.680]   So it's still dirt cheap.
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:37.600]   But now they've built a lot of it into the switcher.
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:42.760]   And the issue is that the thing that has us kind of spooked,
[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:44.400]   and why we're still not buying-- we weren't planning
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:46.720]   to buy any cameras right now is because Blackmagic released
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:49.920]   an 8K capture card a couple months ago.
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:52.440]   And so everything here stopped because we were waiting
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:54.760]   to see if they're going to release 8K cameras and any of these.
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:56.520]   She's Louise.
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:52:01.080]   So anyway, but the pipeline overall for Blackmagic
[01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:06.200]   is really hard.
[01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:08.920]   They built an ecosystem that--
[01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:11.840]   I think in the early days, it was pretty unstable.
[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:12.680]   But at this point--
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:13.960]   They had a vision for where they wanted to go,
[01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:16.440]   and they've clearly kind of lived it.
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:18.680]   Grant, who's the founder of Blackmagic,
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:21.840]   is really the Tony Stark of video.
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:23.320]   Nice.
[01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:25.880]   Andy and I go pick of the week.
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:28.760]   I can't say that I've used this device, fortunately.
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:33.280]   But it's such a cool device and such good news for iOS users,
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:35.080]   especially, particularly outside the United States.
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:36.720]   I really wanted to talk about it.
[01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:41.520]   It's the freestyle Libra, continuous blood glucose monitor.
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:43.640]   We've been talking a lot about how--
[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:46.640]   one of the holy grails of medical technology
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:50.160]   is, is there a way that people with the type 1 diabetes
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:53.600]   be able to take blood glucose readings through, let's say,
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.400]   a watch, a sensor, and a watch as easily
[01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:56.760]   as they can take their pulse.
[01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:58.600]   And we're not nearly there yet.
[01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:01.600]   But this system has been around for a couple of years.
[01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:06.400]   It's a double system where you have a little handheld computer,
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:11.240]   plus a sensor that--
[01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:14.440]   a stick-on patch on the inside of your arm
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:19.160]   that's applied with a special spring loaded installation
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:23.720]   tool that basically what it is is the applicator tool
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:26.960]   is like a needle with a sensor filament inside it.
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:31.720]   And when you set the spring present against your arm
[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:33.320]   and press the button, it goes, "Pitchick!"
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:36.640]   And the needle deposits this flexible filament
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:38.040]   where it can get blood readings from.
[01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:41.040]   And there's an outside medical grade
[01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:42.880]   adhesive sensor with a battery in it
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:47.760]   that will then be taking your blood glucose readings
[01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:50.800]   once a minute and be able to provide accumulated reading
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:52.880]   once every 15 minutes.
[01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:55.800]   And then you have this little sensor that you carry with you
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:57.600]   that any time you want to test your blood,
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:54:00.160]   you just simply-- instead of pricking your finger,
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:01.440]   it's all NFCs.
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:03.560]   Would you just simply tap it against the sensor
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:06.720]   and it will simply download up to eight hours' worth of readings?
[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:13.680]   So it's not just taking your blood once a few times
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:14.760]   during the day.
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:17.040]   It's like, well, I'm about to exercise,
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:19.360]   or I'm about to write a motorcycle.
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:22.840]   I want to make sure that my blood sugar is OK before I go.
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:24.200]   Do I need to eat or anything?
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:26.840]   And immediately let you know, here's what your blood reading
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:27.400]   is like.
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:29.800]   And also being able to give you these continuous--
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:33.720]   again, once every 15 minutes of blood levels,
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:39.560]   that the device plus a desktop app can show you really fine-grained
[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:42.280]   data about what your blood levels-- sugar levels we're doing
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:43.880]   over the course of the day.
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:46.240]   It'll also-- device won't let you log what you've been eating,
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:47.680]   when you've been eating, when you've been sleeping,
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:50.200]   so you can really get those things dialed down.
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:52.560]   Really, really fine-grained.
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:54.520]   Again, thank goodness I don't have diabetes.
[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:57.920]   I try work despite the stuff I sometimes
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:00.560]   tweet photos on an Instagram.
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:02.960]   I am working hard to make sure I avoid that.
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:05.840]   But I was taking care of someone with type 1 diabetes,
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:09.240]   and it takes a long time to really figure out,
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:11.760]   monitor very closely what these signs are,
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:14.920]   and make sure that someone doesn't have a problem that will
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:16.640]   send them into a health crisis.
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:20.000]   And the idea of having this as a simple, single tap
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.320]   is an amazing thing.
[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:23.080]   Now, the reason why it's newsworthy,
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:24.640]   and the reason why it's a piece of Apple News,
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:29.200]   is that Core NFC was introduced with iOS 10--
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:33.440]   excuse me, iOS 11, which is the first ability for third parties
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:38.200]   to get access to the NFC reader that modern iPhones use
[01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:39.600]   to use Apple Pay.
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:42.400]   And so this is, I believe, the phone app
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:46.440]   is the first iPhone app that has been approved by the App Store
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:48.600]   that uses Core NFC.
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:50.840]   The bad news is that it's not available,
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:53.880]   although the hardware and the sensor and the little device
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:56.280]   and the desktop software is available in the United States,
[01:55:56.280 --> 01:56:00.280]   the iPhone app is not available in the US yet.
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:02.920]   But it's available in the UK, and it will certainly
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:05.960]   be barring any regulatory problems.
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:08.640]   I'm sure that's going to become available in the US
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:09.640]   very, very soon.
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:12.760]   As one step closer, imagine the free cell
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:14.120]   come up with a version of this that's
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:16.320]   like a low-power Bluetooth.
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:20.040]   So it can actually can talk to your Apple Watch at all times.
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:22.080]   And I don't even believe the UK version of this app
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:23.760]   is working with HealthKit yet.
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:26.000]   But imagine this stuff being able to integrate
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.240]   into HealthKit apps.
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:30.080]   As it is, you can easily share your data
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:31.800]   with not only your medical professionals,
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:34.640]   but if you have someone who is your caregiver,
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:36.840]   like if you're taking care of your mom,
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:39.760]   or your husband, or whatever, you
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.640]   can have your app linked to this device
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:43.280]   so that you're getting these results, too,
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:45.600]   so you can really see what's going on as easily
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:48.240]   as the person who's taking care of themselves can.
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:50.080]   And I have to admit, I wasn't aware of this
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:54.480]   until about a year ago when one of my favorite YouTube sites,
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:56.800]   Techmo, which I've talked about before,
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:59.000]   the Matt, the guy who runs Techmo,
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.480]   is a type one diabetic.
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:02.640]   He's been used in the system for the past two years,
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:04.840]   and he did a video about it about a year and a half,
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:06.080]   I think, ago.
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:08.360]   And when you see it in use, it really
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:11.280]   does seem like it is 2018, and medicine
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:14.320]   is starting to move into the modern age,
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:18.080]   because again, I only have the experience of someone
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:19.840]   who's taking care of a type one diabetic,
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:22.000]   as opposed to someone with diabetes themselves.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.320]   But you try to balance the need for information
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:29.240]   about blood glucose levels with the pain,
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:32.120]   and the interruption, and the anticipation
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:35.120]   of taking blood readings when you actually have to,
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:37.280]   again, make your patient bleed,
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:38.800]   even if it's just a drop of blood.
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:42.000]   The ability to simply casually, whenever the moment strikes,
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.640]   whenever someone's feeling a little bit tired,
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:47.240]   or whenever someone's about to be away from their stuff
[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:48.240]   for the next two or three hours,
[01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:49.520]   they want to make sure they're going to be okay
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:50.840]   for the afternoon.
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:52.400]   The ability to simply trivially do that,
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:56.680]   and look at that data, that seems like such a huge step forward.
[01:57:56.680 --> 01:57:59.880]   And integration with phones is another big, big step,
[01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:03.000]   because we carry these things with us everywhere we go.
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.280]   So I can't wait to see it move forward on the Apple platform.
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:09.680]   - Yeah, this isn't the non-invasive blood readings,
[01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:11.880]   it's the Holy Grail, but it's as close as you can get,
[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:12.880]   right now.
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:13.720]   - Right.
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:16.000]   - Phil Libben, who the former CEO of Evernote,
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.560]   I don't think he's a diabetic,
[01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:21.000]   but he was wearing it a few months ago when he visited Twit,
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.120]   and he was absolutely sold on this.
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:24.560]   He's probably considering investing in it,
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:27.120]   would be my guess, but he was really blown away by this.
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:28.600]   You still need a doctor's prescription,
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:30.400]   this isn't something you go to the drug store
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:31.800]   and buy for yourself.
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:34.200]   - And it can be paid for by Medicaid
[01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:35.360]   with the doctor's recommendation,
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:36.600]   but it's not cheap.
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:38.080]   Each one of these sensors, again,
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:41.600]   it's a little NFC computer with a battery and a device.
[01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:43.560]   It lasts only for about 10 days of readings.
[01:58:43.560 --> 01:58:47.800]   I think each one costs about 40, 50 bucks to replace.
[01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:51.120]   But Matt, again, the techmoan says that
[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:53.920]   it's not something that you notice when it's installed.
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:55.480]   You feel a prick when you,
[01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:57.280]   pin prick when you install it.
[01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:01.600]   If you are unlucky enough to bump that part of your arm
[01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:03.480]   against a chair or something,
[01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:05.440]   it'll be a little bit sore, but again,
[01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:08.000]   it's not a hard needle always in your skin,
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.640]   it's a filament that's flexible
[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:11.560]   and apparently pulling it off.
[01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:13.760]   I'm sure with someone with my body hair,
[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:17.520]   the pulling the hair out will hurt a lot more
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:19.120]   than simply pulling the sensor out.
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:20.280]   - Very interesting. - So great stuff.
[01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:21.400]   - Yeah, very exciting. - I'm keeping my eye on this
[01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:23.320]   because I'm setting stuff.
[01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:24.160]   - Thank you, Andy.
[01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:25.560]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:27.760]   We do Mac Break Weekly every Tuesday,
[01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:30.560]   right after iOS today, usually about 11 a.m. Pacific,
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:32.520]   2 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:35.480]   That would be 1900 UTC if you want to stop by and say hi,
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:37.080]   watch the show live.
[01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:39.800]   You can do that at twit.tv/live.
[01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:42.960]   You can also chat in the chatroom at IRC.twit.tv,
[01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:44.680]   join the bunch of great bunch of people
[01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:47.080]   watching the show simultaneously.
[01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:48.760]   But of course on demand audio and video
[01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:51.800]   is always available after the fact of twit.tv/ios
[01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:54.040]   or subscribe in your favorite podcatcher.
[01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:56.760]   That way you won't miss an episode.
[01:59:56.760 --> 01:59:58.520]   You can also listen, I think this is gonna be
[01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:00.000]   the biggest boon for podcasts.
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:03.480]   You can also listen just by asking your echo
[02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:06.480]   or your home pod or your Google Home
[02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:09.080]   to play iOS or Mac Break Weekly.
[02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:10.040]   It's so fantastic.
[02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:12.000]   Did I say twit.tv/ios?
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.800]   I think it is twit.tv/mbw.
[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:15.640]   I'm getting confused.
[02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:16.800]   What challenge is this?
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:19.520]   Twit.tv/mbw.
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:22.720]   I bet you you can listen to Renee Richie's podcast vector
[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:23.760]   that way.
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:25.480]   All you have to do is ask Siri, hey Siri,
[02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:27.920]   let's listen to vector and they would play it for you.
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:30.600]   You'll find that at imore.com/vector.
[02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:32.800]   And tomorrow, Lauren Briccher, that'll be exciting.
[02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:34.120]   Thank you Renee for being here.
[02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:34.960]   - Thank you so much.
[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:35.800]   - I appreciate it.
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:36.880]   You can't go to the Echo's podcast material.
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:37.760]   Same thing.
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:42.040]   You just say, hey, goog.
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:46.400]   Let's listen to the material podcast and there would be.
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:50.880]   Unfortunately, Andy of course writes for Chicago Sun Times,
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:52.120]   I think he's unfortunately.
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:54.800]   Unfortunately, you have to buy a paper to read him.
[02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:57.120]   Actually, they must post it on the net too, right?
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:01:00.120]   - It's available on many of the best web browsers today.
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:02.360]   - Not yet on Echo, but everywhere else.
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:05.200]   You also find Alex Lindsey at the Pixel Core,
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:06.800]   the best way to keep up on his,
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:09.520]   have married many ventures,
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:12.040]   including I guess the sale would be to follow him on Twitter.
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:13.080]   - Twitter's the easiest one now.
[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:18.080]   - Twitter.com/alex, L-I-N-D-S-A-Y.
[02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:19.920]   Thank you everybody for being here now.
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:21.600]   I'm sorry to say it's time to get back to work
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:23.840]   'cause break time is over.
[02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:26.420]   (upbeat music)
[02:01:26.420 --> 02:01:29.000]   (upbeat music)
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.580]   (upbeat music)
[02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:35.340]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
