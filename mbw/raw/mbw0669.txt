[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.100]   She's managing editor, alcoholic.
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.100]   One last time in her grandmother's attic.
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100]   I don't know where you are.
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.100]   My best friend would be so mad at you.
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.100]   What is that photo over your left shoulder?
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.100]   That absolutely gorgeous velvet painting of Dolly Parton.
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.100]   That's why I thought it was grandma's attic.
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.100]   I've got to tell you, that was the giveaway right there.
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.100]   Now just tell your friend, she's got excellent taste.
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.100]   She really does.
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100]   Thank you Laurie for being here and belated Happy Birthday yesterday.
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.100]   Thank you.
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.100]   Thanks very much.
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.100]   20.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.100]   Whoo!
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.100]   21st birthday.
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.100]   Yes.
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.100]   She's ready to drink.
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.100]   Also with us Andy Naco from location number three.
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.100]   Yeah.
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.100]   It's as though the forces of evil were conspiring against me to make sure that my voice would
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.100]   be silenced for this show because my home internet was sketchy.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.100]   The local internet was out.
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.100]   Went to the second most local library that internet was out.
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.100]   And finally was like, okay, there's a Starbucks within walking distance of the failed second
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.100]   library.
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.700]   Either I'm going to do this from a Starbucks or I'm just going to enjoy a cool frosty beverage
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.100]   on this 85 degree New England day.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.100]   I'm glad I'm doing a podcast and having a nice frosty beverage on this.
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.100]   It's just like you did.
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.100]   Starbucks decided to spend a little extra money to have there on private internet.
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.100]   We're glad to be running on that.
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.100]   Thank you.
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.100]   Thank you.
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.100]   Throwing bar partners at Google Starbucks.
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.100]   Google Starbucks.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.100]   Yes.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.340]   So I don't care what information that Google is getting from me on this.
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.420]   Thank you for letting me have some sort of internet here.
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.980]   So listeners, I just want you to know this is how much I love you.
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.460]   And this is how much I look forward to Mac break every single week that even when Moses
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.980]   would have just like abandoned his people in the desert.
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.100]   If Moses had been through what I was through today, I pressured on.
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.620]   Well, if you look up above you, there's a loon balloon floating right above you giving
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.900]   you internet connectivity, the only one, the only one in all of Massachusetts.
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.020]   That was going to be the next thing to try.
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.340]   There's actually there's a loon balloon.
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.380]   I think it's been up there for more than a year now and they're starting to use it.
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.220]   I think in the is it West Africa somewhere they're using these for the first time to
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.660]   and the funny and the funny thing nearby profit is one of like only two cities that Verizon
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.580]   has actual 5g net.
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.140]   Oh, actually working.
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.140]   So I could have had I have anticipated failure earlier, just said, I'm going to take the
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.620]   sample phone that I'd not have that the data charts I do not have to pay for.
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.300]   I want to do some extended testing in federal Hill.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.300]   Wow.
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.620]   Yeah, my mom is in Cranston, which is nearby.
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.020]   That's probably just far enough to not get 5g.
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.740]   But man, that's it's actually it's actually it's actually only in a couple of specific
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.460]   neighborhoods in Providence.
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.460]   Yes, of course.
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.460]   You're you're right.
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.460]   You're brown.
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.820]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.820]   Yeah, this is it.
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.260]   This is the P496 a loon balloon that just spent seven months in the air.
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.860]   It was launched in Puerto Rico, traveled 180,000 kilometers, circled the globe, spent 140
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.060]   days testing flight algorithms off South America.
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.340]   This is was the was the plan.
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.860]   I think Google was abandoned it, but this was the plan for internet via balloon of all
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.380]   things also with us Renee Rache from my more and the vector podcast.
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.380]   Bonjour.
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.380]   I can't.
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.540]   Bonjour Leo, you know, Andy can't ethically say this, but on his behalf, if you're enjoying
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.540]   his contributions of the show today, please buy a pixel.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.100]   Please buy a pixel.
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.100]   Please buy a pixel.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.460]   They need they need your money.
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.140]   Actually you guys, Lori and Renee were up early this morning.
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.260]   Was it you said five 30 Pacific time Apple put out a
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.260]   we have news?
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.260]   There's news.
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.260]   There's no actual Mac break.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.460]   Well, and actually I was, you know, reading over my morning coffee, this story.
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.860]   And I thought, I really want to ask these guys if this is news or not, Apple announced
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:31.540]   a part of its back to school special, a new iPad Mac book air MBA that true tone display.
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.180]   It seems to be scant on new features.
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.420]   True tone display is one.
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:43.940]   And maybe eighth generation Intel processors and a very, very good price 1099, 999 if you're
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.700]   college kid.
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:52.460]   And they took the Mac book escape, the last Mac book pro with a normal keyboard and replaced
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.700]   it with a new one with I presume also eighth generation processors.
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.020]   Yeah, lower price and touch bar.
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.020]   Is there anything?
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.660]   So these are very minimal design changes.
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.060]   Oh, and they murdered the 12 inch Mac book.
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.700]   Oh, did they announce that?
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.460]   Oh, no, nothing.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.460]   Oh, that's sad.
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.460]   The Mac book.
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.460]   No, yeah.
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.100]   Oh, I'm really sad to hear that.
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.620]   Yeah, because that was a very sporty design.
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.500]   It was doing things that the Mac book there wasn't doing.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.100]   But I guess now that they have now that they actually have a future for the Mac book
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.980]   there that involves losing the USB ports and having a real display.
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.540]   Okay, I guess that the writing was on the wall, but it would have been really cool to
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.380]   see what they could have done with a Mac book, nothing name as this is always going to be
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:43.340]   the ridiculously thin we will you're willing to sacrifice to make this as thin and iPad
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.620]   like as possible, but to run max offer on it.
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.300]   That would have been a really great, great product.
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:53.020]   Yeah, I thought for a while, maybe the Mac book would have been an arm based, you know,
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.020]   the first arm.
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.500]   Yeah, like I said, it canceled it last time and then brought about in 2015 with this all
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.500]   new design.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.500]   So canceling it now kind of opens up that spot and that name for next generation computer.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.700]   So I read the press release.
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.300]   It wasn't exactly front and center on the press release that they're killing the Mac
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.300]   book.
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.020]   How do you know they're killing the back book?
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.020]   I got to ask a bunch of questions earlier.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.020]   Okay.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.020]   Yeah.
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.020]   And it's also gone from the website.
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.020]   You cannot you can no longer order it.
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.100]   Did they explicitly say though we will no longer make the Mac book?
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.100]   Yes, it is.
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.100]   It has been discontinued.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.100]   Okay.
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.100]   Is that coming?
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.140]   I mean, it's it's like it's been discontinued, but they never comment on whether it'll be
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.140]   coming back in the future.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.340]   Oh, okay. So it is comparable to the last time it could be it could be back.
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.100]   Yeah, they were never making another display and then, you know, now I'm not going to
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.100]   multiply this.
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.980]   Oh, no, never mind.
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.060]   So tell us about first of all, I don't mind so much because I replaced my Mac book, which
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.780]   was really pretty sluggish with a Mac book air.
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:53.660]   And I've been very happy with the 2019 Mac or 2018 Mac book air.
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.140]   What are we seeing in the new Mac book here?
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.460]   The thing that's really cool about both of these things.
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.340]   I guess it depends. This is a lot of people were hoping that this would be the new keyboard
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.220]   debut, especially because Ming Chikwah was teasing that.
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.220]   But this is not that.
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.700]   So if you're waiting on that, you got to wait just a little while longer.
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.820]   But what they're doing here is they're really pushing the specs on the high end.
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.860]   Like the high end has all the latest Silicon coffee lake refresh, but they're not updating
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.620]   as aggressively the lower end specs.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.180]   What they're doing instead is dropping the price because everyone remembers the Mac book
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.100]   air got conflated with a $999 Mac.
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:30.380]   They never launched with that at launch, I think 1,700 for the first one and 1,300 for
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.380]   the second one.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.460]   But the second one went down until it hit $999.
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.660]   This one launched at 11 or 1299 and I'm wanking on the exact price.
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:42.900]   But now they've pushed it down to $1099 and $999 if you're on education.
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.540]   So instead of just ramping up the specs on it, they did a pretty good update.
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.620]   I think it's way more efficient than it used to be and it has a better display than it
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.620]   used to have.
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.420]   But they pushed the price down now to $1099.
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:58.460]   The MacBook Pro that's replacing the Escape, they added a bunch of features to it.
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.780]   It depends on whether you actually care about those features or not.
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.020]   But it's updated to 8th generation coffee lake, not the coffee lake refresh at the high end
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.220]   got, but still 8th generation coffee lake.
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.820]   And it has the touch bar, it has touch ID, it has a T2 security chip and they kept the
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.980]   price on that the same.
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:18.340]   And also as much as I love the 12 inch MacBook, it is now super clear the product line.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.620]   You basically get a MacBook Air and then if you care about performance, you start paying
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.700]   200 bucks extra and then as much performance as you care about paying.
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.100]   And it's a very easy choice between those two.
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:35.580]   Do you think there'll be some sadness, Andy, with the loss of the MacBook Pro Escape?
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.420]   Because you got a touch bar now.
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.900]   No, I don't want to.
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.140]   I think so because there are a lot of people who are buying it.
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:47.380]   It was nice to at least have the option of having an actual function key row and escape
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.620]   key row.
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.740]   And now you just don't, your Apple is just throwing you off the cliff and saying you
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.500]   either learn how to use this parachute, which involves the touch bar or you plummet and
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.420]   die, which is the equivalent of switching to Windows.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.380]   So I'm very, very sorry to see that go.
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:09.780]   Touch bar and turn it into the, you can actually enable the escape key, the function key format
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.780]   on the touch bar.
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.780]   Yeah, but still the touch bar.
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:12.780]   It's not quite the same.
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.780]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.780]   So I think it's coders.
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:20.300]   Like if you use VIM, you really, you use the escape key a lot and not having a physical
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.300]   escape key.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.940]   You can remap it to the caps lock.
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.420]   I think that's what some people do, but it's still, it's weird.
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.540]   And so not just that, but it's weird that the touch bar is not quite, it doesn't, it's
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:34.140]   not the touch surface doesn't extend to the full width of the mechanical keyboard.
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.940]   So you have to kind of get your fingers used to the idea of the escape key is not at the
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.100]   extreme upper left.
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.100]   It is now.
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.100]   Quite a row.
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.100]   But not quite to the left.
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.100]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:49.420]   And still, and still went to the problems of sometimes hitting the hitting a touch button
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.300]   when you didn't mean to hit a touch button, you meant to hit the delete key or something
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.300]   like that.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.020]   So I'm okay.
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.100]   It's very Apple where they definitely believe in the touch bar.
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.740]   They see no reason to have two different lines of computers with and without.
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:07.740]   And they know that the reason it's, we're not going to move forward to the touch bar
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.980]   until everybody who has a MacBook is going to anticipate that they're going to have a
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:11.980]   touch bar.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.180]   And the developer who develops software for the MacBook is going to anticipate they're
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.820]   going to be developing for a MacBook with a touch bar.
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:23.540]   But I still wish that they would give Apple, Apple customers a choice in the matter.
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.500]   But again, that's the least Apple thing that Apple could have done.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.500]   Yeah.
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.500]   I like the Mac.
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.580]   It's interesting that they switched, they switched gears to kind of force everyone into
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.580]   the touch bar.
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:40.980]   I was really excited about it in 2016 when it came out, but then it kind of into the general
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:47.820]   public seemed like this niche thing or this sort of like almost silly add on that most
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.700]   people don't use.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:55.500]   So I actually in my mind saw Apple sort of deciding that that touch bar was kind of
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.180]   a failed experiment.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.940]   We'll go back to the way we used to do it, but we will have touch ID.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.820]   And it is interesting to me that they've gone, so they've doubled down on the touch bar,
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:09.960]   even though sort of the general consensus is nobody really is that excited about the touch
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.960]   bar.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:17.020]   I'm sure there's a lot of people that have found joy in using it, but it's not something
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:22.980]   that becomes a replacement for just your standard use of a keyboard.
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.460]   It's not something that people are saying, "Oh, you've got to have a touch bar."
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.300]   So it's weird that they went this route.
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.300]   Yeah.
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.580]   It's kind of the opposite of 3D touch.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:38.100]   The great thing about 3D touch is that if you are looking for excitement, adventure, and
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.380]   faster ways of doing things, 3D touch is there for you to discover these extra sort
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.100]   of user interface things.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:49.300]   But if you're not that adventurous, it will not get in your way.
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.220]   It will not confuse you in any way.
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.820]   You can pretend that it doesn't exist.
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.340]   Whereas the touch bar, you just got to deal with it.
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.700]   I really do think from the beginning that this was not a well thought out idea.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:07.700]   When I got my review unit and the first experience for the touch bar was I'm typing and I'm seeing
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:13.820]   like a complete words appearing in the touch bar.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:14.820]   And I'm not joking.
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.060]   I had no audience here.
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.220]   I was not trying to amuse myself.
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.620]   I literally had to take my hands off the keyboard and reflect on the fact that whoever
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:28.140]   designed the touch bar thought that the way to use it is that, "Wow, I just typed the
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:33.500]   letter T," instead of typing H-E with my fingers that are already on the keyboard, I'm going
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:38.380]   to take my hand off the keyboard and touch this button instead to autocomplete it.
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:42.660]   I can't think about how long a word would have to be before it would be shorter and
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:47.700]   simpler and faster for me to take my hands off the physical keyboard and find an aim
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.780]   and autocomplete word on the touch bar.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.100]   That's what made me think that they have no idea what this is for.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.980]   This is just something that there was a mandate to put a touch bar there and then find a reason
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:57.980]   for it.
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.420]   I still think it's one of the most disappointing features that Apple has ever rolled out.
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:06.420]   I think it's kind of okay now that there are third party apps that let you do things that
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.420]   are actually useful with it.
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.580]   Yeah, better touch tool.
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.580]   Yeah.
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:13.700]   Now an app that lets you turn the dock on the touch bar, which I guess makes kind of
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.820]   sense, but no.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:20.780]   Oh, conspiracy theory, Apple is getting all the current generation MacBook Pros on a
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:25.300]   touch bar so that when they announce the new next generation 16-inch MacBook, that has
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.660]   whatever comes next and then you sort of differentiate the old ones from the new one.
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:30.660]   Right.
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.700]   Especially if that new one has the new keyboard, a new scissor key, which is the rumor from
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.700]   Ming Chi Quo.
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:41.940]   God, I just, you know, between the keyboard and the touch bar, I will not buy another
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.660]   MacBook period.
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:49.180]   Fortunately, I got the MacBook Air last year and I don't need to buy another MacBook,
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.580]   but it's just very disappointing.
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.580]   I think.
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.580]   Oh, you'll like the 16-inch LEO.
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.580]   I'm hoping.
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.580]   Have you seen it?
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:55.580]   No, but I can hear it.
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.580]   Almost got him.
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.580]   I almost got him, folks.
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:58.580]   I almost did.
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.580]   You see how casually I just said, "Oh, yeah, really?
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.580]   Have you seen it?"
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.580]   So it's right but not.
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.500]   So the rumor is when?
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.500]   September?
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.940]   The rumor was initially September, although now some people have been saying 2020, but
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.740]   those are sorts of things that when they haven't preannounced them, they can just push
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.940]   them out when they're actually ready.
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.580]   And if it's not September event, it's the October event.
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.580]   It's not the October event.
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.580]   It's the March event.
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:26.500]   See, now I'm thinking Ming Chico got it wrong because the rumor that they were going to
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:33.060]   the swisser switch keyboard or the swisser switch keyboard was that it would be in the
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.300]   2019 MacBook Air.
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:39.260]   Well, clearly that's wrong because unless, I don't know, has anybody seen this new MacBook
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.260]   Air?
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260]   Maybe it wouldn't be something if they didn't even mention it.
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.260]   There could be one.
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.900]   Well, there could be one in September, but I think almost everyone else who heard that
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:50.540]   rumor besides him heard the 16-inch MacBook Pro, I don't think anybody else heard that
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.540]   the MacBook Air.
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:55.860]   Yeah, they mentioned that 2020 MacBook Pro or Ming Chico mentioned that.
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.660]   His source on this is a company that makes the scissor keys who says, "Yeah, we got to
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.580]   deal with Apple."
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:06.020]   So maybe his source isn't specific enough to say, "Oh, it's going to be for this machine
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.660]   or that machine."
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.820]   I would love to see them abandon the touch bar and put a scissor key keyboard back.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:16.420]   The story was weird though because he said the MacBook Air and then he said a refreshed
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:20.500]   MacBook Pro next year, but the refresh didn't seem to sound like the new design.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.420]   Which even he's spoken about previously.
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.540]   That mean that the new design was coming out and then they would go to the new keyboard
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.260]   on the new design next year after putting it out with the current.
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.260]   It sounded very complicated.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.420]   The new design is the so-called 16-inch.
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.060]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.960]   Which would be weird to ship with the butterfly keyboard if you've got a new...
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:42.700]   And it was Greg Konig who does a lot of industrial design work.
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.660]   He was actually impressed that they were getting it out this fast.
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.620]   He said, "It must take about two and a half years to spin up a new keyboard."
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.300]   Which means that they don't realize about two and a half years ago that they're going
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.620]   to have to do this and it's been keys to the wall until they manage to get this out.
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:00.580]   Yeah, I was kind of worried that Apple was going to continue to double down on the butterfly
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.500]   keyboard saying that, "No, no, this is perfect.
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.100]   We just need to convince people this is perfect.
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.100]   Yes, we're going to...
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.380]   We expect that we're going to have to fine tune it, but this is really just people who
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.060]   want to see a bad story where there's nothing but a brilliant story.
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:39.260]   And so it's nice to see... I'm hoping the Super
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:46.260]   Game is going to be a great game.
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260]   I'm sorry, I just won't.
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.260]   It's interesting.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:55.260]   They've introduced two new laptops, but they kill two laptops at the same time.
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.260]   So it's net zero.
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.260]   Net zero sum game.
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.260]   Go ahead, I'm sorry, Renee.
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.260]   Although you're arguing...
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.260]   I was just going to say you guys can just tape the Bluetooth keyboard on top of the case.
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.260]   I just fix this.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.260]   That's it.
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.260]   That's perfect.
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.260]   I mean, but they weren't getting more value for your dollar.
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:12.140]   Whether you want them or not, you're getting more features including the T2 chip and that
[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.260]   same price as the...
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:17.700]   I think that MacBook Air is... That's the Mac I would get.
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.460]   That's a good price.
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:23.100]   I really think Apple has to always have a $1,000 computer for education.
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.620]   I just think that's really important.
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.620]   So I'm glad to see that they did that.
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:31.540]   And one of the reasons I think that is I remember when I was on the board of trustees at the
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.900]   local high school here, they used to have a one-to-one program and they would give every
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:43.140]   student one of those white MacBooks because they were $1,000 or maybe even $900.
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:47.780]   And as soon as Apple stopped selling a $1,000 laptop, that school said, "Okay, we're going
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:48.940]   to Windows."
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.220]   And they left and I doubt they'll ever go back.
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:55.060]   And it's that kind of thing that really... It's funny, you wouldn't think, "100 bucks,
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:55.860]   does that make a difference?"
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.860]   It does.
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.740]   Especially if you're buying 300 of them.
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:00.740]   It's not a...
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.740]   It's a non-trivial expense.
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.940]   It's also a huge mental thing.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.940]   It's mental.
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:05.940]   It's a $1,000 laptop.
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.540]   You got it.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.140]   So I'm glad they're doing that.
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.020]   Okay.
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:17.780]   Apple also dropped prices on high-end storage upgrades for the iMac, the iMac Pro, the
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.620]   MacBook Pro, the Mac Mini and the Mac Pro.
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:26.620]   Although why people would buy storage from Apple, I guess if you're buying an all-in-one
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.700]   like an iMac, you kind of have to make the internal storage.
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:30.700]   Yeah.
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:35.540]   But with Thunderbolt 3, you really don't need to spend.
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.420]   And are they still selling a Fusion drive?
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.220]   This graphic has to be wrong.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.860]   Yeah, that's what you use me as well.
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:43.860]   No, I think it's...
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:44.860]   Let's look.
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:45.860]   That would be...
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:50.220]   I think it replaced the crappy... Didn't replace the crappy HD drive on the HDD.
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.980]   Let's see what kind of... Let's see what models what I can do.
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:53.980]   Let's buy an iMac.
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.620]   What do you say?
[00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:00.540]   I'd kind of rather have an HDD than a Fusion drive because people know how to fix HDDs.
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.540]   And the reason to replace it.
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.540]   Fusion drive is bad engineering.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.580]   It's a brilliant idea that just never paid off for anybody.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:08.580]   Yeah, let's see, storage.
[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.580]   Exactly.
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:10.580]   Well, but...
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.580]   They still sell it.
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.580]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:17.260]   So the base 27-inch iMac comes with a terabyte Fusion drive.
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:21.420]   Or if you're willing to spend $500 more, you get a terabyte SSD.
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:25.260]   That's the reason for the Fusion drive, that $500 difference.
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.620]   The problem is opening up an iMac is non-trivial.
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.620]   We've done it.
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.860]   You have to have a giant suction cup for the screen and you should watch the videos before
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:37.820]   you attempt it to just make sure you're willing to go through this nightmare.
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:38.820]   I would not...
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:42.420]   Especially with the weird videos where the word fail in the title that will get you
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.420]   to hell.
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.420]   Make sure there's enough hair in your chest, male, or female.
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.900]   Aww, I broke the glass!
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:47.900]   Oi!
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:48.940]   I wouldn't get a Fusion drive no matter what.
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:54.260]   So maybe instead get a smaller SSD and use the Thunderbolt 3 port for an external drive.
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.260]   That's what I do with my iMac.
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:59.100]   Which you want anyway, because it's nothing worse than a drive feeling inside a steel machine.
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.100]   Wow, surprise.
[00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:07.860]   So anyway, the prices are lower but still nowhere near market price for any of this stuff, I
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:08.860]   don't think.
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:13.820]   You know, it's interesting because a lot of people would say that Apple is making more
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:18.780]   expensive devices now, which is true, but they're also making more expensive devices.
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.180]   They're using the top upper end of every single part.
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.260]   And a lot of other companies might do that in one model, but don't certainly don't do
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.260]   that in all models.
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.260]   Right.
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.780]   I bought a backup drive from my MacBook Pro and I have a two terabyte drive inside, which
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.020]   was hell expensive.
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:37.540]   And I got the Samsung X5 and it was, it's gone down now, but when it launched and I bought
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.540]   it, it was $1500 just for that drive.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:45.140]   And I think it was a similar part to what Apple was using.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:49.060]   The bad thing, like it's not like they're, sorry, way to say this, they just don't have
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.060]   cheaper options.
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.820]   If you're like, I don't care about peak performance storage, just give me an affordable, doesn't
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.340]   have to be top of the line SSD.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.420]   They have absolutely nothing for you.
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.300]   So just to give you a sense, so they're charging 500 bucks to replace that fusion drive with
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.220]   a terabyte SSD.
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:08.500]   A Samsung 860 EVO right now is $137 on Amazon.
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:14.860]   If you want to get the faster 860 Pro with VNAN 279, it's still a little more than half
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.060]   what Apple is charging.
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.660]   It's just that you can't get into that to put this thing in.
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.700]   But SSD prices have tumbled.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:30.740]   And if you want an NVNE drive, an 860 EVO is 154 bucks for a terabyte.
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.180]   And I've seen really good prices.
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:40.180]   You know, maybe Sam, okay, so the Samsung 960 EVO NVMe, the M.2 drive internal is $418.
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.540]   So maybe Apple isn't overcharging too much for that NVNE.
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.940]   Well, I'm sure they're maintaining margin, but you know, they're...
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.060]   I've seen some really good prices.
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:54.100]   No, there's no like E-Mac version anymore.
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.100]   Right.
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.100]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.100]   Yeah.
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.100]   Yeah.
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.460]   The big problem is that technology is not meant to be admired from one side of a shop
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.900]   window.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:10.300]   I like that the MacBook Air is still $1,000 computer or $1,100 computer.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.820]   I really think that Apple would...
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:17.300]   I think it would be a great challenge for Apple to say we're always going to have a Mac that
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.340]   costs a MacBook that costs $900.
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:27.380]   And we don't think we have to absolutely destroy the trademark.
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.140]   We don't have to make something that's unreliable or cut down on features.
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:35.260]   We are going to use that as a design challenge for us to make sure that we stay sharp, to
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:41.900]   make sure that we can still always make an $800, $99, $899 MacBook every single year with
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.740]   the best components we can find for it.
[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:49.420]   They take inspiration from the Raspberry Pi where it's always been $34.99 and even as
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.260]   they add more ports, even as they make it faster, even as they more...
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:59.300]   Erm, it's always $34.99 and now you can get it for $59.99 but that's if you want a whopping
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.660]   four gigabytes of RAM.
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:06.620]   But that's a really interesting design challenge and that's such a great case study with Raspberry
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:10.620]   Pi to us saying yes, people would love us to have like active cooling on it.
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:14.180]   People would love for us to have USB 3 like last year or the year before.
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:18.340]   We can't do it and maintain $34.99 price point so we're not going to do it now.
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.340]   But that's in our roadmap.
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.180]   We're going to figure out a way to do it in the future.
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:26.260]   As long as we're living in Rumerland, economic, daily news, Chinese publication, let me...
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.500]   I better translate this because I don't...
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.500]   I don't...
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.500]   Unless some of you can read that.
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.300]   Let's see what Google has to say.
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.340]   No, that's not it either.
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.820]   I better go back to 9 to 5 Mac.
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:43.100]   This is the economic daily news suggests that a 16-inch MacBook Pro will enter mass production
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:52.540]   in the fourth quarter and they'll be a new 10.2 iPad set to replace the one from last year.
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.140]   I guess that's not a surprise.
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.660]   We'd expect that.
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.460]   I don't know what their sources are.
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.460]   I don't even know.
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:04.660]   So we're placing a 9.7 inch so then we'll have a 10.2, a 10.5, and a 7.9.
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.660]   Yeah, you got a...
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.740]   Actually they're squeezing bezels on the line, right?
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.740]   Is that...
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.460]   Remember when you had one iPad and you liked it?
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.060]   It was 9.7 and that was it.
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:20.660]   The 10.2 iPad Rumer does seem a little bit off to me and it's because of the way Apple
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:25.060]   just updated the iPad Mini and the iPod Touch.
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.100]   That makes me really think that I don't think this is happening.
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:35.580]   The iPad is supposed to be the low cost sort of entry iPad except for the Mini of course.
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:44.300]   So they'd have to redesign the chassis in order to do that and that makes it more expensive.
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:49.020]   And I think they're going to just upgrade the guts but keep the chassis the same.
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.460]   They're just going to ride that design all the way down.
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.460]   I do.
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:55.460]   If they want to keep it at that sort of low price point.
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.860]   I mean they have the pros.
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.660]   Just like the iPod Touch.
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:05.260]   But you can't make the Air Mini look old, can you?
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.260]   Like the Mini look old?
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:10.100]   Yeah, like if you give the new design to the lowest end one then what are the people who
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.620]   bought the Mini and the Air at the Hype just a few months ago?
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.740]   It's like, well why do they get the redesign and we did it?
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:15.740]   Well that's right.
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:16.740]   That's the point, right?
[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:17.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:18.740]   Yes.
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:19.740]   So, yeah.
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:20.740]   If you want...
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:25.580]   And yes you're right they do have the 10.5 chassis design so they could turn the 9.7 inch
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.300]   iPad into a 10.5 inch iPad.
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:32.340]   But that kind of goes along with that same idea of then they would just charge more for
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:39.540]   it and if they're trying to keep the standard iPad out of a cheaper price point I don't
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:43.980]   think they're going to do anything big like change the design of it at all.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:49.780]   This kind of thinking it shouldn't because it's a business but it kind of ruffles my
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:53.700]   feathers and the feathers of people who say well Apple should be a technology company first
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.660]   not an economic entity first and they should do what's the best new technology they can
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:01.420]   do not say it's the same problem I had with the iPad Touch.
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:07.620]   iPod Touch which is oh you know we'll just take the old design and refresh it a little
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.620]   bit.
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.460]   That doesn't seem to be a technologist's way of thinking.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:16.700]   That seems to be a chief operating officer's way of thinking.
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.460]   They did that with the iPad Air though they gave that a complete redesign and that they're
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:26.300]   sort of positioning the iPad Air as the iPad for you whereas the iPad is more of the entry
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.140]   level version and the iPad Pro is the pro level version.
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:34.260]   That's how I pictured in my head is that Apple is always going to have one device that's
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:39.340]   sort of the lower end one that's to get people in that's to get your foot in the door so
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:44.220]   that one is never going to be as good as the rest it's never going to have the same process
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:49.060]   or chips or the same screen display or all the features that one's always going to be
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:54.620]   a little bit off the mark and then people will sort of start with that and feel if they
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:59.580]   love the iPad then they'll feel I'm ready I want to spend you know twelve hundred fifteen
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:05.180]   hundred dollars on my next iPad and then they'll sort of upgrade to one of the fancier versions.
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:10.740]   But increasingly the iPad line is kind of bifurcated now because there's such a difference between
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:16.220]   the pro and the non-pro versions and it doesn't feel like they want to bring the non-pro versions
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.420]   up to the pro versions.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.420]   It feels like they do it in steps.
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:23.100]   It's like they get pencil and then once everything gets pencil the new ones get a different
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.580]   differentiator and then that differentiator spreads across the line and then the new ones
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.220]   get an even new different like they get to face ID so everything can have touch ID and
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:35.740]   everything can have pencil and it doesn't make every feature across the line and then
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:39.820]   they'll get all pencil and it will be something else like the no bezels on the new one or
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:44.340]   USB-C and then the next generation will get USB-C and the pro beyond to something else
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:49.180]   and it seems like from iPhone to iPad to everything that's the way they go they make
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:52.860]   their money back on the high end for whatever R&D went into creating the new feature and
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.900]   then they propagate it everywhere and as they propagate it everywhere they're busy investing
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:59.540]   in the next new big feature which they pay off in the next new high end design.
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.100]   I guess I understand that.
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.100]   It's a business.
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:06.580]   I do think that people are pretty excited to have a $300 iPad.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.620]   That's not black and white.
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.100]   It's not like 640x480 pixels.
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:16.140]   It really is a real iPad and I'm sure that everyone on this panel gets lots of questions
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.220]   from people who are trying to figure out what's the difference.
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.220]   I'm not an artist.
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:25.620]   What's the difference going to be for me between having an iPad Pro and having an iPad Air?
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:29.220]   That's a very, very long and interesting question to answer because for a lot of people to
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:34.780]   get what they want from the iPad experience, $300 is going to do them very, very well.
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:39.980]   For $300 it's not a trivial amount of money for most people but it is a low enough price
[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:45.180]   point that you can afford to have a laptop and then have an iPad only because, buy this
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:50.020]   iPad only because you like it, you think that the apps are pretty nifty and you don't
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.420]   intend to be using it three or four hours a day.
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:55.940]   It's the three or four hours a week that you intend to use it that are going to really,
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.100]   really make it earn its pay.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:05.380]   I guess, as long, I mean also from the developer's point of view, what you really don't want
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.780]   to do is to bifurcate the line.
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:11.140]   I have to be the least expensive iPads so much slower than the top of the line iPads
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:12.820]   that it's two different things.
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:17.460]   They have a bit of a Microsoft problem now too because when you like the iPad, the iPod
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:22.380]   touch, I didn't realize this, is huge in enterprise and retail and they have these machines that
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.380]   they slide into.
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.380]   I was told to.
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:25.380]   Yeah.
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:26.780]   And if you change that, it's something that in those ways, and the sled design design
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:27.780]   is a big deal.
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.940]   Apple traditionally wouldn't care but probably Apple has to care a little bit which makes
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.940]   me sad but I'm not in enterprise.
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:34.580]   Yeah, and I get that.
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:37.220]   I was schooled in that by a guy who actually works with these devices.
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:42.700]   He says, you don't understand how many people buy iPod touches for retail or for inventory
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:48.780]   or for hospitals and they all have sleds they have to fit in so they can't change the product
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.940]   factor, the form factor.
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.580]   But the iPads, well, I shouldn't say.
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.100]   Oh, schools have their sleds and their trades.
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:59.940]   I think they give them a little bit longer and I think they realize that the iPad Pros
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.860]   are not going into those institutions so they can be real aggressive with those.
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.660]   And then again, it seems like Apple's got this whole new strategy where they're really
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:11.540]   pushing the limits on the high end but they're kind of sort of picking up for it by being
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:14.940]   a little bit slower and a little bit more price conscious on the low end.
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.540]   And certainly the iPad is leading there.
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:20.780]   I would love to see you as either did that with the phone and new sort of really education
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:23.220]   friendly Macs that did that with the Mac lineup.
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:29.060]   I think then you can sort of justify the higher prices for the early adopters and the
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:33.420]   geeks and the people who just love the technology and have this whole wealth of more mainstream
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.940]   products, everybody else.
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:35.940]   And it makes a really good balance.
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:40.140]   You've got to honor their desire to keep a low price product so people can get into the
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.140]   product line.
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.540]   That's absolutely appropriate.
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:48.740]   But on the other hand, didn't they learn the lesson from the iPhone that the SE did, I
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:53.340]   mean, that having cheap iPhones wasn't a good strategy for them that that really the
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.340]   market is high end.
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.340]   Watch what you say, Leo.
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:57.340]   Why?
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.340]   Why?
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:31:59.340]   You say that?
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:03.900]   There are a small group of people just like me that absolutely love that SE form factor
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.420]   and we are hoping it will come back.
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.940]   There's not a bunch of us but we love it and want it.
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:09.940]   But that's the form factor.
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:10.940]   Not the price.
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:11.940]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:13.740]   It's the form factor, not the price.
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:19.180]   But you would say then, though, it is actually still quite pricey, the 10R is what Apple is
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:24.140]   considering the sort of entry level price point, which I know is pretty expensive especially
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.140]   expensive.
[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:31.260]   I thought the conventional wisdom was Apple has learned its lesson.
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.540]   There's no point in having a cheap iPhone.
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:37.740]   Well, we say we want them cheap and then we don't buy them.
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.260]   We're wonderfully mercurial.
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:43.340]   But it sounds like it depends on the market now too because smartphones are mature.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.740]   And when you have mature markets, you do have to start segmenting those markets.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:50.580]   And there's rumors that Apple's going to do a less expensive phone for China, maybe India
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.660]   as well.
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.980]   And that'll be different than the phone that they do for the first time, different than
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:59.060]   the phone that they do in North America that might still be three cameras and pushing the
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.660]   limits again.
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:04.220]   And it's going to start to be real interesting because Apple did really good business with
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:11.700]   just one iPhone for everyone, but that model may not last any longer.
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:12.700]   Let's take a break.
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:13.700]   Come back.
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:19.580]   We've got the 10th anniversary of the App Store, what happened to the iPhone's original plastic
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:26.580]   screen and we can do a FaceTime demo where my eyes will eerily follow you everywhere
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.020]   in the room.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.020]   It's coming up next.
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.020]   Andy Enoch goes here.
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:33.980]   He's in Starbucks.
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:40.580]   Having a fine iced tea and no, they should though.
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.580]   They should.
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.380]   I wish I wish I could get that Howard money.
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.380]   Yeah.
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:51.340]   Also, of course, Lori Gill, she's also away from home somewhere in Dollywood.
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:54.540]   Yeah, she's in beautiful Branson, Missouri.
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:34:01.060]   And from Montreal, where the home of the last decent bagel and Mr. Renee, Richie and
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:06.260]   fine coffee, or should they brought you by rocket mortgage by quick and loans?
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.060]   I feel like an old friend is back in town.

[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:45.260]   So the iPhone last month celebrated its 12th anniversary.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.900]   Was it really two years before they got an app store going?
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:49.860]   No, see it was the 10th anniversary last year.
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.700]   So I really don't understand what's happening right now.
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:52.700]   Okay.
[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:53.700]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:54.700]   It was 2008.
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:55.700]   Yeah.
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.700]   2018.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.700]   Okay.
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.580]   That makes more sense because I didn't think we were waiting two years for the app store.
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:02.580]   No.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:03.580]   Okay.
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:09.180]   A nice piece though, a 9 to 5 Mac, 10 years of the app store in which they compare, I
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:16.420]   think in a really nice way, how some of this stuff has evolved.
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:17.420]   This is a great one.
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:20.300]   This is the actual icon for the remote.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:23.340]   And you can see how 3D it was in the earliest.
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.460]   This is July 2008 when it first emerged.
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.620]   Kind of modernized a little bit, but really this new flat look, it makes you appreciate,
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.180]   frankly, the simplicity of icons today.
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:34.180]   And not just icons.
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:38.740]   Design in general, this is the Facebook app from 2008 compared to the Facebook app of
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:40.180]   today.
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:47.500]   And I just, that 3D pop buttons, is it just fashion, do you think, Andy, or is it?
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:50.500]   Also one guy wrote that app, that Facebook app, and now it's a whole team.
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.500]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:57.460]   I mean, to me, this flat looks so much better.
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:04.060]   But is it just like the same thing as like a car with fins, doesn't it look stated?
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:08.300]   Well remember that we were dealing with a much, much lower resolution screen.
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:12.540]   So if you wanted to be able to identify a button, you couldn't remember.
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.780]   And also that these flat designs we have today, they also have shadows.
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:20.500]   They also have highlights, but they're so subtle right now that because of the high resolution
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:21.580]   of the screen.
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:27.940]   So I do think that it reflected the design aesthetic of the time, but it was also a concession
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:32.340]   to what they had to do with the pixels that they had available at the time.
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:38.580]   I think that I'm glad that Apple seemed to bounce down and then back up again, making
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:44.380]   the interface way, way, way too flat for my taste with iOS 7, I think.
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:49.500]   And then gradually deciding that perhaps a splash of color would be, would lighten
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:52.580]   people's Elan over the course of a very busy and stressful day.
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:59.860]   We may look back and say, oh, gradients, that was so 2020, you know, because now everything
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.660]   has gradients, right?
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:06.540]   Like this is the 2013 Facebook app, which is basically the same as their app icon.
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:10.100]   And there is a very subtle gradient in the color there.
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:15.780]   And remember that these design cues come go all the way back at least to 1984, the very
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:22.140]   first, very first max, that the everything had a shadow that came from the upper left
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.140]   hand corner.
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:29.140]   Coincidentally, the Apple logo was at the desk accessory menu was in the upper left hand
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:30.140]   corner.
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:34.140]   And that was, again, another cue for people to see some depth and depth and see some reaction
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.540]   and liveliness in the user interface.
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.540]   So we definitely see things move forward.
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:45.700]   I think that between iOS and material design in Android, we're seeing two really, really
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:51.940]   great ideas, just sort of like, let's say, sniffing at each other and just sort of jogging
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:55.220]   next door to each other and taking cues from each other.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:39:00.660]   And this is all due to the depth of color that we have and the level of detail that
[00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:01.900]   we have today.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:05.460]   But it is kind of fun to go back in time.
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:11.220]   Apple has re-released Texas Hold 'em, which was as I remember.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:18.780]   I seem to remember this was one of the very first apps certainly I ever used.
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.340]   Did this come with the iPhone or did you have to download it?
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.100]   The App Store launched.
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:26.380]   It came, yeah, it originally launched on the iPhone Touch.
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:27.580]   Oh my God.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:30.460]   Well, that was definitely a constrained screen.
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:35.940]   Let's show it on a massively beautiful, this is on an iPad.
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:39.020]   And I think it was bad for them to discontinue it because it meant they never tested any
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:41.620]   gaming APIs directly and that's always the worst thing to know.
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.940]   Is this the only game Apple ever released?
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:44.940]   No.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:46.140]   Does chess on the Mac count?
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.140]   Chess on the Mac.
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.140]   It's still there, isn't it?
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.900]   Also, Alice, remember that was an original game for the Mac.
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:52.380]   So cool, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:53.380]   All right, I'm gonna bet.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:54.380]   Impossible.
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:59.460]   I invented at least 12% of the profanities that are in the English language today, trying
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.900]   to get one successful player that game.
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.260]   All right, I got a pair of kings.
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:04.700]   I'm going all the way, baby.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:05.700]   This is it.
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:06.700]   Let's see.
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:07.700]   I'm all in.
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.700]   I'm all in.
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:09.700]   I'm all in.
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:10.700]   Whitney.
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:11.700]   I'm gonna go all in against Whitney.
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.340]   I think she doesn't have it.
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.980]   You're going down, Whitney.
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.780]   I chased her.
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.220]   I chased her.
[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.740]   I am now the pot later, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.740]   I think it's a bad time to close it out.
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.980]   One of the things that's I hate to end the game.
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:29.820]   It has multiplayer because I'm winning big time.
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:33.980]   One of the things that's fun, though, is they have a lot of different casinos, but
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:38.620]   you got to earn your way up all the way up to the Macau.
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:44.740]   I'm not seeing these because each of them has a much higher table stakes.
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.740]   Let's resume this game because I'm doing so well.
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:50.700]   You guys just talk amongst yourselves.
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:56.380]   This is reminding me of how much I enjoyed the Paperboy game, the Paperboy game that
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:41:03.580]   was that Tim Cook showed off at the briefing at the investor conference a few weeks ago.
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:09.980]   I love to see Apple express their creativity and express their level of playfulness and
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:15.340]   joy in a way that does not involve making keyboards that have only 0.52 millimeters
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.340]   of travel.
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:23.380]   When you task a group to say, "You know how in that list serve that's a company only,
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.820]   you were talking about this idea for a game, tell you what, why don't you take the next
[00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:33.900]   five weeks off and take any two people you want and just make this game because we think
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:38.260]   would be a cool thing for people to give away to people so that they have this wonderful
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:42.500]   bobble that they know has the same level of security and the same level of privacy and
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:49.900]   not wanting to steal your money as we idealize for the app store, but also just to show off
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:55.860]   here's what we think of as a we if we were going to take on all the problems that you
[00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.860]   developers take on creating a great game.
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.700]   This is the sort of game that we're we're talking about here.
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.340]   Here's a fun Easter egg.
[00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:06.540]   The development team is in the in the app.
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.140]   You can know it's not the development team.
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:13.380]   It's just a bunch of random poker players like you can be as weird as you want.
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.580]   Is that the Unibomber up in the upper?
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:16.940]   Yeah, that's that's actually me.
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:19.140]   I like being the hoodie guy.
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:21.980]   So yeah, that way you can't see my tells.
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:23.500]   Anyway, it's fun.
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:24.500]   It's free.
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.500]   It's back.
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:26.500]   Maybe.
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:30.060]   Leo, can you look at it from a different angle on the iPad on the iPhone?
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:34.020]   You're actually sort of face to face instead of top down on it.
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.220]   Oh, yeah, I don't know.
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.620]   It's an interesting difference in this iPhone app.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:39.020]   So I think I oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.020]   Okay.
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.620]   So let me let's let's flip it.
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:42.620]   Yeah.
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.100]   Oh, now now I got the first person.
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.300]   I can see my scummy dealer.
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.700]   You get to see them move around and it's kind of fun.
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.700]   Oh, hey, I didn't even know that.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.980]   Man, you're you're the Texas hold them expert.
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:56.380]   All right, I'm going to bet on other things.
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.540]   I don't know that you can switch it to.
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:42:59.900]   Oh, look at these guys.
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:04.380]   Oh, this is much better than the yeah, they should make this VR.
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:05.380]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.380]   Oh, wow.
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:07.380]   It takes a lot.
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.380]   Talk to them.
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:10.060]   It takes a lot longer to play.
[00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:11.060]   Let's see.
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.380]   I got a I'm like one card from a straight here.
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:14.380]   Should I bet?
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.380]   Let's go.
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:18.100]   Let's let's bring up the stakes there.
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.100]   See if we can chase the rest of these clowns.
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:21.300]   He looks like a loser.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.940]   Oh, he's going to he's going to raise.
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:24.940]   Excuse me.
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:26.660]   Oh, I think it's bluffing.
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:27.660]   He's bluffing.
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:29.860]   I call him.
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.260]   Let's see what we got here.
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:32.260]   Let's see.
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:33.260]   Let's see the turn.
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:36.260]   Oh, I think I just got a pair of aces.
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:38.740]   I'm going to go all in, baby.
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:40.660]   See if that guy goes.
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:42.940]   Oh, he's matching.
[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:47.100]   Oh, well, this is a big showdown on the river.
[00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.100]   Nothing.
[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:50.060]   A pair of aces.
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.780]   Let's see.
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:52.780]   And thank you.
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:53.780]   I'll take all of that.
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:55.780]   Very much eliminated.
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:56.780]   Wow.
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:57.780]   Thank you.
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.900]   You made this so much more fun.
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:00.900]   I could watch him lose.
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.500]   That's a very talented dealer.
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:06.420]   There's probably he can carry him your next card off of the opposing wall and get it to
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:07.420]   appear in front of you.
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:09.860]   It's a remarkable feat.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:11.540]   This is really this is the old game.
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.540]   Yeah.
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:16.060]   See, this is an iPhone game and I forgot that because it's an iPhone game on my iPad, I
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.300]   could probably do with what you just said.
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:19.300]   Thank you.
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.300]   So that's pretty fun.
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.300]   I'm saving that game.
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:23.220]   I'm doing all right.
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:24.220]   Let's see what else.
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.940]   Oh, the eye contact problem.
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:27.940]   Go ahead.
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.540]   Did you have something else, Lori, you want to talk about?
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.780]   No, I was just going down memory lane.
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:35.860]   The good old days.
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:41.340]   So the FaceTime, we talked about this a little bit, but earlier today, Mike, a sergeant,
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:44.900]   and I with great effort managed to make a FaceTime call.
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:47.660]   And yes, in fact, it's a little creepy.
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:51.940]   His eyes do, even if he's looking at the picture, appear to be looking straight at the camera.
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.940]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:54.940]   I'm glad.
[00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:55.940]   Makes me doubt what is real.
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.860]   I don't know what's reality anymore.
[00:44:57.860 --> 00:44:59.180]   It's crazy that means to me.
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:02.340]   That's my problem with it.
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:06.140]   It's a very obvious and a very, very natural feature to put in, but I think that it's kind
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.460]   of a binary thing.
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:11.600]   Either you trust that FaceTime is giving you a picture of the thing that the camera is
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:17.660]   looking at without abandations, or it is enhancing things to make sure that the person
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:21.820]   is looking at the camera or saying that, oh, Andy didn't shave like this morning.
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:27.020]   So let's just sort of like tone that down so it looks like he shaved.
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:32.540]   When you're talking about a basic communication tool, I know that this isn't the most important
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:37.780]   thing in the world, but it just, again, it's binary either the app is not changing anything
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:44.780]   to trick you into thinking that reality is not what it is, or you accept that, yes, maybe
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:49.260]   this person does not have kitty ears and cool sunglasses.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:50.260]   I just think that--
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:53.140]   Kitty ears and sunglasses at least you know that's a super--
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.140]   I'm sleeping on the call.
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:55.140]   Imposition.
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.140]   Is it agonized?
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:57.140]   I don't think--
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:58.140]   Actually, we didn't try that.
[00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.140]   Close your eyes.
[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:00.140]   See what happens.
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:01.140]   I didn't try that.
[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.140]   That was--
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:03.140]   Just paints the eyes right on there.
[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:04.140]   You're like, my mic was starting.
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.140]   You didn't hear it.
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:09.580]   I think the money will save on ping-pong ball eyes and wooply eyes for those boring meetings.
[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:10.580]   Yeah.
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:13.780]   Like, I would love it if it made me look 15% smarter, but at a certain point it's just
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:14.780]   a--
[00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.580]   It's kind of the next thing, isn't it?
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:17.580]   Yeah.
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:18.580]   Yeah.
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:19.580]   Yeah.
[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:20.580]   It's very--
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:24.020]   It's not a danger.
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:30.500]   It's not like trying to beautify you, remove your pimples or whatever.
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:35.140]   All it's doing is it's sort of shifting your eye focus so that it looks like you are actually
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:37.900]   making eye contact with the person that you're talking to.
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.300]   But at the same time, that is--
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:41.300]   It's false.
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:44.460]   It's false visualizing.
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:49.340]   So it's kind of-- I'm kind of on both sides of the spectrum of it because I do--
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:54.060]   Even when we have our conversations, if I'm not looking directly at the camera, I'm looking
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.900]   slightly above or slightly below the camera.
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:00.780]   And I try really hard when I'm-- I'm the one conversing that I look directly at the
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:01.780]   camera.
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:07.980]   But most people will start to just kind of wander and look away, look down at the-- at
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.660]   the screen instead of looking at their camera.
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:16.140]   And that-- you know, it's-- the idea that it can fix that problem for me is great because
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:19.260]   it makes a conversation feel more intimate.
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.300]   But it's-- it's false.
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:29.020]   So you know, when are we-- you know, when are we letting technology replace our own human
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:36.500]   natural movements and gestures and when does that line-- when does that line OK to draw?
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:40.780]   You know, is it OK that it's just shifting my eye focus and then in that case, just like
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:44.780]   you're saying, will it then someday be OK to make it look like I've shaved and woman I
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:45.780]   haven't removed tattoos?
[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:47.540]   And Georgia said that she can't tell.
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.980]   Like she says, usually when I look right, I'm lying and left I'm remembering and she can't
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:51.980]   tell now.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:52.980]   Oh, yeah, those tells are gone.
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:53.980]   That might be good for me, but bad for her.
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:54.980]   Yeah.
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:55.980]   All your body language.
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:56.980]   Yeah.
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:59.340]   Because sometimes people are looking off and all those things give us cues as to how we
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:00.980]   communicate with each other.
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:02.380]   Well, here's the good news.
[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:03.380]   You have to turn it off.
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:07.060]   First of all, you have to download the latest iOS 13 beta if you want to try this that came
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.220]   out yesterday.
[00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.820]   And you have to turn it on in the settings, the FaceTime settings.
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:11.820]   There's--
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:13.300]   So I have a big conundrum for you, though, Leo.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.860]   Like, should you be the one to turn it on?
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.540]   Or should I also be allowed to turn it off?
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:18.860]   Like if I say I don't want FaceTime lying to me.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:24.500]   Because there was that whole superhero male, superhuman male thing where you know, like,
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:25.980]   do you, should they lot track you?
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:29.780]   Should you not be like, what if I just never want FaceTime to lie to me?
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:32.220]   Should I have that setting too?
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:33.900]   Or should it override your setting?
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:34.900]   I don't know.
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:35.900]   Or is there ethical advice?
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:40.060]   Or even just a, if you get info window that was a superimposed, by the way, here are
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:43.820]   features that the person who's sending you video is turning on.
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:46.860]   Would these please mute any keyboard sounds?
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:49.220]   Please adjust to eye frequency.
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:53.340]   Please make sure that the mouth seems to be-- by resting face seem to be happy, as opposed
[00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:55.140]   to exhausted and frustrated.
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:57.780]   Actually, I would pay for mute keyboard sounds.
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:58.940]   That would be a really handy plugin.
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:48:59.940]   But it's so complicated.
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:03.660]   Because when they had the Google duplex, some people were saying that you should absolutely
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:05.100]   have to disclose it.
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:06.660]   And you should know that you're not talking to a human.
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.940]   But other people are like, should I have to tell you if I'm using an artificial leg?
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:13.380]   Like if I'm mute and I'm using Google to speak for me, how is that your business?
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:14.980]   And none of these have easy answers.
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:18.620]   So I wish that when companies would do these features, they would start off these conversations
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:19.620]   as well.
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:20.620]   I like the info screen.
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:21.620]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:25.060]   So you at least know what's being-- and as we get better and better at this, you're
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:26.060]   going to see a lot.
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:28.300]   I have a feeling Apple's just doing this to show off AR.
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:29.300]   ARP, right?
[00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:32.140]   This is just, look what we can do.
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:36.220]   But man, if they could mute keyboard sounds, my mom always yells at me when I'm not looking
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.060]   at her while we're talking on FaceTime.
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:39.060]   She always yells at me.
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:41.060]   You know, you're playing Harry Potter, Lee.
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:43.620]   She knows exactly what I'm doing.
[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:46.660]   And if it would mute keyboard sounds and make me look at her all the time, man, I'd
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:47.660]   pay for that.
[00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:50.180]   I used to do a podcast with somebody.
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:55.300]   And I had at some point say, look, it's OK if you're not going to be paying attention
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:56.300]   to me.
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:58.780]   But it hurts my feelings when I get to your clock.
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.580]   When I'm giving my opinion on something, it's like--
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:05.140]   Well, you've heard of here, I'm transferring the glass into the whiskey.
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:08.940]   You can hear him putting the ice into the whiskey while he's supposed to be vodka.
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:13.860]   It always subtly bothered me whenever we had Adam Curry on any of our shows.
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:14.860]   You can always hear--
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:15.860]   [SIGHS]
[00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:20.860]   And then the next sentence would be--
[00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:24.300]   And it always bothered me just a little bit.
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:25.820]   That's just me, I guess.
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:26.820]   But those towels--
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:27.820]   It's a teacher, Leo.
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:28.820]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:29.820]   Hey, attention.
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:30.820]   Mr. Curry.
[00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:32.380]   If you didn't bring it up for everyone.
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:36.580]   Hey, here's something thanks to our chat room for filling me in on this.
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:41.740]   Mac rumors has-- I think they're being a little satirical when they say, good news.
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:47.100]   Both the new MacBook Air and the new MacBook Pro 13-inch entry-level model have the same
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:52.300]   third-generation butterfly keyboard design with updated materials in the new 2019 MacBook
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:53.300]   Pro.
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:56.220]   The good news is that it's the third generation, not the second or first generation.
[00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:57.220]   Oh, OK.
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:58.220]   Not good news.
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:50:59.220]   It's the updated third generation.
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:04.220]   Yeah, the third generation so far hasn't seen the same failure rates as the first and
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:05.220]   second generation.
[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:06.500]   Does it feel different when you type with it?
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:07.500]   I haven't tried it yet.
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.500]   I haven't tried it.
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:09.500]   Yeah.
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:13.420]   So then there's a new third generation has that new material.
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:15.940]   So there's the third generation has the membrane.
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:19.820]   Then there's the new, like new Coke third generation that has the membrane and the new
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:22.060]   material in the domes.
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:24.580]   And the neutral in the domes does feel slightly different.
[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:26.380]   And the membrane feels slightly different.
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:29.780]   So depending which version of which generation you're going through, Leo, there's different
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:30.780]   levels of different--
[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:33.660]   But should I run out and buy one just to find out?
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:34.660]   No.
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:39.900]   If you're going to poke in the eye with a slightly blunter stick, you can do a portion of it.
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:40.900]   Which is better though.
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:43.780]   If you're going to get poked in the eye, wouldn't you prefer a sharp stick?
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:44.780]   I'm just saying.
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:45.980]   Just so you end it all?
[00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:48.180]   Yeah, just get it over with.
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:50.420]   Like, that's-- let's stop.
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:54.660]   The MacBook Edit books coming to you in June.
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:52:01.020]   Students, not only will you get your own power beats headphones from Apple, but you are going
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:05.340]   to get a double the free trial period for Apple Music.
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:08.140]   So normally it's three months.
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:12.540]   Students will now get six months of trial time.
[00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:13.540]   Interesting.
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:19.980]   Yeah, with Apple's student's campaign right now, you're getting a pretty decent--
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:20.980]   Good deal.
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:21.980]   --$200 off your Mac.
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:22.980]   Yeah.
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:25.580]   $350 beats headphones.
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:33.860]   And extended trial on your Apple Music Plus, I think it's $5 a month for your subscription
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:34.860]   when you find something.
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.860]   Oh, you even get a better deal on the subscription.
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:37.860]   Not bad.
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:38.860]   Nice.
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:41.780]   It takes some of the sting out of going back to school, doesn't it?
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:42.780]   When they say back to school--
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:43.780]   Think you're going to go back to school.
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:44.780]   I know.
[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:46.860]   In the press release, it said college students.
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:49.380]   But can high school students take advantage of this?
[00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:50.860]   Does it have to be a college student?
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:53.780]   You have to be able to buy for the Apple portal.
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:54.780]   Okay.
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:59.780]   You have to be able to provide your student ID and you have to register with--I can't remember
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:01.380]   the name of it, but there's a program.
[00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:02.980]   Oh, I remember that.
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:03.980]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:04.980]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:05.980]   Yeah.
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:10.660]   And wasn't there something in the newsroom story about how 60% of college kids we were
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:14.220]   using or wanted MacBooks now, which I thought was an alarming number given how that used
[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.220]   to be?
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:18.020]   Yeah, I'm sure that's true.
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.020]   Shop free.
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:23.980]   Well, they want McLarens and they want Ferraris instead of Jota's hand to it.
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:26.980]   And they don't have to get it from their parents, but they can't necessarily have it
[00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:29.700]   and they don't necessarily need it either.
[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:31.220]   All right.
[00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:36.900]   So anyway, if you do qualify, whatever it is that takes advantage of it, that's a pretty
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:38.860]   good deal.
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:44.100]   Mm, Steve Wozniak deletes his Facebook account.
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:45.100]   I saw this everywhere.
[00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:46.100]   That's a little news.
[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:47.100]   That's a net.
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:48.100]   Yeah.
[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:49.100]   What did he do that a long time ago?
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:50.100]   Yeah, April.
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:51.100]   2018.
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:52.100]   Yeah.
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:53.100]   I think he--
[00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:54.860]   April, 2018 story.
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:56.860]   But for some reason, it came up again.
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:57.860]   Like--
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:58.860]   Yeah.
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:53:59.860]   He was talking about it again.
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:01.340]   He was just reminding everyone that he's still believing.
[00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:02.340]   I still--
[00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:03.340]   I still believe it.
[00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:06.980]   I forget who it was, but I saw a bunch of YouTube videos like why I'm deleting my social
[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:10.540]   accounts and then the same person, why you shouldn't delete your social accounts.
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:12.940]   I think there's like trendy to be on both sides of the story.
[00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:13.940]   The new thing there was this article that--
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:15.940]   Yeah, they're all supposed to be on YouTube.
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:22.340]   Yeah, the new thing is to apologize for something you did on YouTube on your Instagram
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:25.500]   or somewhere else less popular.
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:30.180]   So Logan Paul's apologizing, but he's not doing it on his main account where it might
[00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:31.980]   look like him look wimpy.
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.820]   He does it like an aside account.
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:36.500]   Don't those apology videos do makeup business?
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:37.500]   I know.
[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:38.500]   I know.
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:40.780]   I think the more drama, the better.
[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:41.980]   So here's some good news.
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:44.580]   I know people have been concerned about Huawei and its future.
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:51.380]   The CEO of Huawei says he's going to start using Apple as a privacy role.
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:53.420]   You know what?
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:54.660]   So am I.
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.020]   Ren Zhengfei.
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.780]   So am I.
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:00.780]   Good to hear.
[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:01.780]   Good to hear.
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:02.780]   Yeah.
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:03.780]   Yeah.
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:05.780]   Well, I mean, I'd rather he copy the privacy.
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:08.140]   Then I forget was it Xiaomi who have someone copied the Memoji?
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:09.140]   Oh, we can't hear.
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:10.500]   You have to say the Matebook Pro.
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:12.460]   Oh, yeah, that was really funny, wasn't it?
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:14.540]   But I was like, just I was so identical.
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:17.500]   You have to almost think it's like cute.
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:21.860]   It says even Xiaomi staff can't distinguish its clone of Apple's Memoji, this is from
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:23.700]   Apple Insider.
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:29.900]   After Xiaomi protested, of course, that it's Memoji looked nothing like Apple's Memoji.
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:33.100]   The company's accidentally used Apple's advertising for its own promotion.
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:35.460]   Oh, there's some ways to do this.
[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:38.820]   Like we we's looked totally different and the Xbox ones look different.
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:39.820]   There's like so many it's like a emoji.
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:41.460]   There's so many different ways to make them.
[00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:42.300]   Yeah.
[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:44.020]   But Apple's is the right way.
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:45.020]   Yeah.
[00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:47.340]   But if you hate them, you want something different.
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:50.180]   You don't want to hate Apple go by a competing phone and be stuck with the same stuff you
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.660]   just left Apple for.
[00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:56.180]   It's just, you know, it's just a very blatant example of what Chinese companies have done
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:58.700]   for years, frankly, which is.
[00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:04.460]   Yeah, I would just like to think that making making use of their actual Apple's actual
[00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:08.580]   like videos, that's put that in a separate folder or something.
[00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:12.660]   If you want to pretend your hands are clean, that's not a good thing.
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:16.100]   It seems like it seems like that's that's that's a that's an unforced error.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:17.100]   That's an own goal.
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:18.580]   I think that you could have avoided that.
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:23.380]   I think that some people should be disciplined inside that company, not for having stolen
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:27.020]   stolen material, but having done it so stupidly.
[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:32.140]   So I think I'm guessing Bill Gates has been playing Wizards Unite.
[00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:34.580]   The new Harry Potter game.
[00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:38.180]   You might be right about that because he says his pronoun.
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:48.300]   He says, Bill Gates in an interview with, I guess, CNBC says, I was like a minor wizard
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:50.340]   compared to Steve Jobs.
[00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:53.500]   He would be casting spells and I would see people mesmerize.
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:58.340]   But because I'm a minor wizard, the spells don't work on me.
[00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:03.020]   Steve was a he says, well, it was really easy to imitate the bad parts of Steve.
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:08.300]   I have yet to meet any person in terms of picking talent, hyper motivating that talent.
[00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:09.300]   Who could match him?
[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:12.300]   He brought some incredibly positive things along with that toughness.
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:20.220]   But he says he also was a wizard at casting spells that kept Apple from dying to keep
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:24.580]   Apple employees motivated and working long hours.
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:26.340]   I think Bill cast a few spells.
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:29.980]   I think Bill's a little unnecessarily self deprecating here.
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:35.420]   He got people to pay for softwares because that was an amazing feat.
[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:41.620]   We forget that before Bill Gates came along, people gave away software.
[00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:44.020]   He was a cop.
[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:45.020]   Exactly.
[00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:50.380]   He was famous back when he was just the prototypical, just a college dropout guy who was doing
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:52.180]   computers for the friend of his.
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:57.860]   He had this sort of like bomb burst sort of like letter, public letter memo about hates.
[00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:04.500]   It's easy for you to make a copy of the punch tape of Microsoft basic, but don't.
[00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:07.100]   It takes us a long time to do that and it's wrong.
[00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:12.060]   And a lot of people who are mostly hippies were saying to information months to be free.
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:13.900]   I agree with the hippies.
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:15.860]   Maybe I'm a hippie too.
[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:16.900]   Actually let me correct myself.
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:22.780]   This was an interview he did with Fareed Zakaria on CNN that we'll be airing on Sunday.
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:26.020]   So that's a CNN interview, not a CNBC interview.
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:27.020]   I'll be watching.
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:31.180]   I think Bill, I don't know what it builds on some sort of tour, publicity tour these days.
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:32.180]   I don't know what.
[00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:37.020]   Yeah, he's been saying a lot of interesting things to get picked up by everybody.
[00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:42.500]   Just like last week or the week before he said he was talking about, he was at some
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:48.700]   sort of investor conference and said his biggest mistake was not killing Andrew.
[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:50.380]   Not killing off Andrew.
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:53.620]   And said, well, no spit.
[00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:57.940]   Even that given that Windows you had no mobile strategy and that you were basically had your
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:00.420]   total lunch eaten.
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:06.460]   If you haven't yet watched your VHS tape of Sunday's World Cup final, please plug your
[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:08.180]   ears.
[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:10.300]   And whatever you do, don't go to Apple's website.
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:14.900]   They celebrated the US Women's World Cup victory over the Netherlands on Sunday with
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:15.900]   Memoji.
[00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:17.900]   Yep.
[00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:19.460]   Is that Megan Rapinoe?
[00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:20.460]   I don't know.
[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:21.660]   It's hard.
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:23.580]   They're kind of generic emoji.
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:26.940]   It is no longer on the homepage.
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:31.340]   But it featured three emoji heads, red, white and blue, seeing cheering the nation's victory
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:36.380]   complete with eye message stock and FETI effects and bouncing soccer balls.
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:40.540]   And then it says job well done and goes back to the Apple page.
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:41.540]   I missed it.
[00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:42.540]   I wish I'd seen that.
[00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:43.540]   I wish I'd seen that with the Raptors.
[00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:44.540]   I guess that was the beta test.
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:45.540]   They did it for the Raptors?
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:46.540]   Yeah.
[00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:47.540]   Wait a minute.
[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:48.540]   For Apple's Canada site.
[00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:49.540]   Yeah.
[00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:50.540]   What?
[00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:53.620]   For years, our Golden State's favorite sons.
[00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:55.780]   I'm guessing it was when Eddie was on vacation.
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:56.780]   Yeah.
[00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:59.180]   Eddie Hugh is a big Golden State Warriors fan.
[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:00.460]   That's a good point.
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:01.460]   Yeah.
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.180]   Here's the Canadian.
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.980]   Oh, you saved it?
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:06.980]   Yep.
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:07.980]   Nice.
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:08.980]   It's got dinosaurs.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:11.100]   And then you can get the iPhone 10 for $0.10.
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:12.100]   Yeah.
[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:14.980]   But I think because Canada is so small, they probably beta tested it with us and then did
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:16.780]   something way more extravagant with you.
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:17.780]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:18.780]   Yeah.
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:19.780]   Maybe.
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:21.580]   But the story is pretty quick here.
[01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:25.860]   There's a 40-year-old Apple One original manual that's going up on auction.
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:29.700]   I love it because it has the original Isaac Newton Apple logo.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:30.700]   Yeah.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:33.940]   Which is truthfully, I'd buy it for that.
[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:34.940]   And look at the font.
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:35.940]   Look at the typeface.
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:36.940]   It's very--
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:37.940]   You can get that t-shirt.
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:40.580]   I don't have to have it all the time, but they cycled in and out that t-shirt at Infinite
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:41.580]   Loop.
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:42.580]   Oh.
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:43.580]   I would buy that.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.580]   Yeah.
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:45.580]   Yeah.
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:46.580]   I guess one of those, they're awesome.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.180]   Oh, do you have to go down there to get it?
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:49.180]   Yeah.
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:50.180]   I'll pay people, Leo.
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:51.660]   Oh, maybe somebody would send it to me.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:53.900]   I'll pay them back.
[01:00:53.900 --> 01:01:01.740]   I think it was Jeff Wayne Apple's secret third partner who had designed that logo, Mind.
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:07.980]   Forever voyaging through Strange something, something.
[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:10.220]   Sir Isaac Newton, I love that logo.
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.580]   I would love you with that.
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:14.740]   Maybe you just have to buy the manual.
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:15.740]   There's the page.
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:16.740]   There's the page.
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:21.700]   But I do wonder at what point did this logo drive Steve Jobs?
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:23.620]   Absolutely crazy.
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:30.020]   This was the guy that eventually decided that having a color logo was way, way too much.
[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:35.300]   We need to have a single color logo that-- I wonder at what point he decided that--
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.300]   Ah.
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:37.300]   No.
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:38.300]   It is too busy.
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:39.300]   A full label?
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.300]   No, no, no.
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:41.300]   I think he just said it's too busy.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:42.300]   It does.
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.300]   It looks like one of those labels you put in your book, Ex-Lebrus.
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.300]   Oh, no.
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.700]   It's like a creative fruit.
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:48.700]   A fruit label.
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:49.700]   Yeah.
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:50.700]   Yeah.
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:55.540]   Vulnerability in Zoom's Mac client could allow websites to turn on cameras without permissions.
[01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:58.820]   That's not good.
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:02.780]   This is discovered by a security researcher, Jonathan Leitzich.
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:05.780]   Light chute chute.
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:08.820]   It's a Zoom zero day.
[01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:11.060]   So what do you do?
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:17.660]   It also apparently impacts Ring Central because they do a white labeled Zoom system.
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:22.020]   So anything that's using Zoom.
[01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:23.900]   If you've ever-- oh, this is great.
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.580]   If you've ever installed the Zoom client on your Mac, then uninstalled it.
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:31.300]   You still have a local host web server on your machine that will happily reinstall the
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:35.220]   Zoom client for you without any user interaction on your behalf.
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:37.500]   You just have to go to a web page that asks for it.
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.500]   It's an instant reinstall.
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:42.980]   So, wow.
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.140]   This is a feature of Zoom.
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:46.660]   You can send people meeting links when they open that link.
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:50.300]   The client opens your camera, comes on, and they can see everything you're doing.
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.380]   I love this meme.
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:57.860]   So this was disclosed in March 2019.
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:06.940]   Zoom confirmed the vulnerability, but apparently did not fix it.
[01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:14.420]   So once the 90-day disclosure period ran out June 24, he said, "I'm going to publicize
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:15.420]   it."
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:16.420]   So there you go.
[01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.620]   And I imagine there will be a fix.
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:25.340]   And this article, which appeared on Medium in the InfoSec write-ups, might have a fix.
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:26.900]   I don't know.
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:30.140]   And some people on Twitter were saying that if you uninstalled Zoom, it kept a process
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.660]   running that would just reinstall the whole thing.
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:32.660]   Yeah, local host is still there.
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:34.940]   And if you get that link, it goes, "Oh, yeah.
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:35.940]   That's the problem."
[01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:39.100]   You can't just uninstall Zoom to get rid of this.
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:44.460]   I think the Medium post offers a couple of quick fixes that use terminal.
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:45.460]   Okay.
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:46.460]   Good.
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:49.820]   So I've installed Zoom on my iMac.
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:53.620]   To fix the auto join with video part of the vulnerability, he had told Jonathan I told
[01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:58.380]   Zoom to immediately disable a media creator's ability to automatically enable a participant's
[01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:02.780]   video by default.
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:07.140]   They didn't really like that idea.
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:11.420]   So July 7th, there's been a regression in the fix implemented by Zoom that's allowing
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:13.500]   this vulnerability to be exploited again.
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.300]   Oh, great.
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:17.220]   There's also potential thus vulnerabilities.
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.220]   So you think that Apple should punish them for this?
[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:26.300]   I really think that this goes beyond the pale that when you uninstall an app, that's
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:29.340]   an explicit request from the user.
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.020]   It doesn't say, "Oh, I'm sure."
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:33.580]   I'm, you know, it was a Thursday.
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:35.420]   We were all really tired.
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:37.540]   The user said some things didn't mean.
[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.100]   The apps said some things we didn't mean.
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:43.820]   I'm sure that if we just keep reinstalling the software, he's going to remember how good
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:47.980]   this relationship is and how much we've invested in it, at least keep the group chat going
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:49.820]   in for the sake of the kids.
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:50.820]   Yeah.
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:56.260]   He says the local host-webserver solution has got to be removed.
[01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:58.220]   And they have not to this day.
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:04.340]   He estimates given Zoom's popularity, there are about 4 million Mac users with Zoom installed.
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:09.500]   So here's the patch, the vulnerability yourself, which is to disable the ability for Zoom to
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:10.980]   turn on your webcam.
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:12.380]   Simple enough.
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:15.020]   And then, of course, if you're going to have a Zoom meeting, you'll have to re-enable it.
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:18.140]   He does offer a terminal command that will do the same thing.
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:20.060]   You don't have to use the UI.
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:24.940]   And then apparently the web server is running, so you might want to look for the process
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:26.420]   and kill it.
[01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:27.740]   Good lord.
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.980]   That's just ridiculous.
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:33.260]   And then there are some other solutions as well.
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:34.260]   Wow.
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:36.940]   Yeah, I feel like maybe Apple might have something to say about that.
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:43.940]   That is not good behavior to turn on a web server that still runs after you uninstall
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.300]   the application.
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:46.540]   That's crazy.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:50.980]   You get to stay in the app store, but your next build has to be written in either basic
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:51.980]   or list.
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.980]   Hey, "list is good."
[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:55.420]   Don't knock list, man.
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:56.420]   That's a fun language.
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:57.420]   I like list.
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.420]   OK, APL then.
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:05:59.420]   APL now you're talking.
[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:00.420]   Now you're talking.
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:07.580]   You might have to spend on the special keyboards alone with bank rippling.
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:10.460]   Actually is that Jason Snell in our chatroom?
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:11.460]   Or just somebody impor--
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:12.900]   Would not put it past him.
[01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:14.660]   Impersonating the Snell.
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:17.380]   I think they're talking about this anyway.
[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:18.380]   Oh, no.
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:20.260]   This is Jasonell tweeting.
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:23.260]   My hope is that someone at Zoom got a call from someone at Apple today indicating that
[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:30.340]   the click to confirm Safari feature is intended to be used and that bypassing it is not cool
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:33.860]   if Zoom wants to throw some of its competitors under the bus or doing the same thing.
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:34.860]   Great.
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:35.860]   Yeah.
[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:36.860]   So there should be a click to confirm.
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:39.780]   Thank you, ScooterX, for reposting that tweet.
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:40.780]   I agree.
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:44.860]   "I'll show you today brought to you by Zip Recruiter.
[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:46.540]   Hiring used to be hard.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:51.060]   Multiple job sites, stacks of resumes, a confusing review process.
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:53.180]   Today you're in luck.
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:57.500]   Zipping can be a lot easier and you only have to go one place to get it done.
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.140]   ziprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:05.580]   We've talked about how easy it is to post on 100 plus job boards just by posting once
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.020]   on Zip Recruiter.
[01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:10.060]   But there's a lot more with their powerful matching technology.
[01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:14.540]   Zip Recruiter scans thousands of resumes to find people with the right experience and
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:17.140]   then invites them to apply to your job.
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:22.660]   As the applications come in, Zip Recruiter's smart technology analyzes each one.
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:25.860]   That lights the top candidate so you don't miss a great match.
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:27.140]   In fact, it works so well.
[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:31.780]   Four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality candidate through the site within
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:33.580]   the first day.
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:34.900]   That is pretty sweet.
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:37.740]   We've used it and had great results with Zip Recruiter.
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:41.900]   I love it because you don't get jammed in box or a lot of phone calls.
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:43.660]   They all go into the Zip Recruiter interface.
[01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:49.020]   All the resumes are nicely formatted so it's very easy to see exactly who's offering what.
[01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:53.580]   You can even have screen questions, multiple choice or essay questions to help you narrow
[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:54.940]   down the candidates.
[01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:58.940]   With Zip Recruiter, you will find the right candidate fast.
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:03.020]   A lot of it has to do with your reaching out to everywhere candidates can be.
[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:06.100]   But I love this feature where they send candidates your way.
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:09.860]   Right now, Mac Break Weekly listeners can get Zip Recruiter free, but you've got to go
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:13.260]   to ziprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:14.420]   That's a good thing to do anyway.
[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:15.580]   Let's have no you heard it here.
[01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:18.300]   We really appreciate Zip Recruiter's support.
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:21.620]   You've been a great sponsor for so long for Mac Break Weekly.
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.620]   You help us out by going to ziprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:29.780]   Z-I-P-R-E-C-R-U-I-T-E-R.
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:32.540]   Ziprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:35.380]   You wouldn't spill it.
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:37.300]   R-R-O-T-E-R-O-T-E-R.
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:38.300]   No.
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:40.380]   CR-U-I-T-E-R.
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:44.380]   Thank you, French Franco phones for screwing up our language.
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:48.260]   Justrecruiter.com/macbreak.
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:52.700]   Do you pronounce Recruiter?
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:54.300]   I don't think it's the same word.
[01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:55.500]   I don't know.
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:56.500]   You would know.
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:57.500]   I don't know.
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:01.860]   It's hard to go back and forth when you see it or when you're in it, but it's hard to.
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:02.860]   I know.
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:05.140]   Hey, I got to ask you, did you get a new camera because you look spectacular?
[01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.140]   You look marvelous.
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:07.140]   I didn't.
[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.900]   I don't know what's happening here.
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:09.900]   It doesn't need to look great.
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:10.900]   You got a tan.
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:11.900]   You got a tan?
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:12.900]   Were you in there?
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:14.720]   writing my contacts which I don't usually do.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:15.980]   - Oh, he's not wearing glasses, there you go.
[01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:16.820]   I know it was something.
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:17.700]   I can see your eyes.
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:18.440]   Where is it that new FaceTime..
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:21.060]   - Look 30% of our augmented reality feature
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:22.440]   that's what it is.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:23.280]   Renee, why is it?
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:24.460]   - It's chiple, yo, so if my eyes would be over here
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:29.080]   somewhere, why don't you kick, kick us off
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.960]   with your pick of the week?
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:31.940]   - So I have two picks.
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:35.140]   One is unusual, I think just in terms of why I picked it,
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:38.960]   but it's, it's hard for me to find shoes because I,
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.520]   a long time ago I went to China a lot
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.700]   and I walked around China a lot
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:45.100]   and ended up tearing ligaments in my foot.
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:45.940]   - Yes.
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:49.420]   - And when I got back, they prescribed me these inserts
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:51.240]   that you put in your shoes that keep your shoe arched,
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:52.980]   but it was really uncomfortable.
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:55.740]   And then a guy I knew who'd done a ton of physiotherapy
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:57.460]   training goes, no, no, no, that's all garbage.
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:59.380]   What all it does is make your foot more and more dependent
[01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:01.220]   on it and the problem will ship to your knee,
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:03.620]   then it'll shift to your hip, throw those out
[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:06.460]   and just get the most minimal shoe that you can possibly get.
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:07.300]   - What?
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:10.140]   - Take the insoles out and just walk, walk and build up
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:11.260]   all those muscles.
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:12.100]   - Go barefoot.
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:15.060]   - And he, yeah, well, I mean, it's Montreal,
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:17.340]   so there's quite a few times when I can't go barefoot.
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:18.180]   - But barefoot is. - But barefoot is.
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:19.500]   - Go barefoot. - Yeah.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.740]   - And I can't do the vibrams, they just don't fit,
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:24.540]   but so what I did, but that, they're so hard to find.
[01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:26.740]   We just don't have a lot of shoes in the store.
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:31.100]   So recently I needed new shoes and I just went to Nike.com
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.460]   and I sorted, I also have very wide feet,
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:35.500]   so I just sorted by wide and ultra wide.
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.380]   I find exactly the shoes I wanted.
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:40.180]   I ordered them, they arrived, I took the insoles out,
[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:44.220]   put my feet in and I've been walking on them ever since.
[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:46.500]   And it's great and it's just, sorry.
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:47.940]   - So it's like your barefoot though,
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:50.300]   you really feel the ground?
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.380]   - The Nike Freeze, yeah, I mean, they're not vibrams.
[01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:54.980]   If you really wanna go hardcore, you get those crazy toes.
[01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:56.620]   - Those crazy toeships. - Yeah.
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:59.060]   - Yeah, but the more you can walk better,
[01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:00.420]   like, and I can't explain the whole thing,
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:03.940]   but like, if you walk badly, injuries tend to spread
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:05.660]   and you build up malignant neuro pathways
[01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:08.180]   and your body just, your body, you have to feed
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:09.900]   your body motion the way you feed it food.
[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:12.500]   Your body, it feeds on motion.
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.180]   So when you get out and you do a bunch of different things
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:15.700]   and you do it as naturally as possible
[01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:17.940]   and you're not walking sideways or moving your legs
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.660]   in weird ways because the shoes are deforming you
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:21.780]   and they're pushing you forward.
[01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:23.740]   It just, it clears up a lot of things
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:25.220]   that you thought were chronic problems
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.860]   or at least in my case it did.
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:28.260]   So I've been doing it for a while
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:29.580]   and I'm super happy with it.
[01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:34.580]   - I am gonna customize some Nike Freeze for me right now.
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:36.100]   - It's awesome.
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:39.300]   - Which ones did you get, the Flyknit, the Max Genoski?
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.060]   - I got the Zoom Pegasus and what I thought
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:43.580]   was so weird about these is they don't have real laces.
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:45.540]   They have a back that unzips
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:47.100]   and they just put them on like stickers.
[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:49.540]   - Oh, how will you ship them back up?
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.380]   - Brilliant.
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:52.660]   - And you Velcro them and the Velcro closes
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:53.860]   and then you're just off and going.
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:57.780]   - I no longer wanna tie my shoes, that's for sure.
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:58.860]   Very nice.
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:02.300]   What are you laughing at?
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.580]   - It's a little bit back to Velcro.
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:04.700]   - What are you laughing at?
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.780]   - Lori Gil. - So when you're a little kid.
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:07.620]   - And you're picking the week, Lori.
[01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:09.500]   - A little kid, you're learning how to tie your shoes.
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:10.340]   - Oh, they're horrible.
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:11.580]   - So you have to wear Velcro
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:14.060]   and then when you become an old man, you just.
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:14.900]   - Yeah.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:15.740]   - Just give me some.
[01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:16.580]   - Yeah, I like that girl.
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:17.420]   - Kid Velcro.
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:19.180]   - Old man yelling at you laces.
[01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:21.140]   That's why we're loafers all the time
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:22.140]   'cause I'm a loafer.
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:26.460]   Missed them as Lori Gil, your pick of the week.
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:29.620]   - Yeah, well, so Mophie just came out with a new
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:34.820]   charging device, which they make a lot of
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:36.100]   and they're always very good.
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:36.940]   - We love the Mophie.
[01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:38.740]   - It's called the Power Station Hub.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:40.060]   - Yeah.
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:44.300]   - And it is Qi enabled and it plugs into any wall port
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:48.660]   and it has two USB A and one USB C port
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:50.940]   and it is wireless.
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:54.220]   So it has a Qi, the Qi support
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:55.580]   which you see in that first picture there,
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:59.380]   but you can also plug in any iPhone
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:04.020]   or even an iPad or a computer and let it charge.
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:06.540]   And you can either plug it into the wall
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:09.620]   and use it as a type port.
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:12.780]   - It's like a wall wart that also charges.
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:13.620]   It's got a battery.
[01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:14.460]   - Yes.
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:15.780]   - Oh, that's so cool.
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:17.220]   - It has its own separate battery.
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:19.500]   So it's like super versatile and I've got one
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:22.700]   and I actually used it when I went camping this past weekend
[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:24.500]   and it ended up being great
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.100]   because it was one of those situations
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:29.460]   where I could have plugged it into a wall
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:32.740]   but the nearest plug was in a different room.
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:35.860]   So by the way, camping this weekend was at a cabin,
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:36.780]   not in a tent.
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:39.820]   So that's why I'm saying a wall.
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:43.060]   But so when I wanted to just charge up my phone real quick,
[01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:44.980]   I just grabbed it and charged it
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:46.700]   instead of having to take my phone
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:49.020]   into a room where there was a wall port.
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:51.460]   So it's a nice little versatile thing.
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:52.740]   - Oh, we love Mophie.
[01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:53.860]   Now it's not a huge battery.
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:55.260]   It's 6,000 milliamp hours
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:58.900]   but that's enough to charge your iPhone for sure.
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:13:59.740]   - Yep.
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:00.580]   - Yeah.
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:01.420]   - That's really cool.
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:02.660]   - And because it plugs into the wall,
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:04.700]   it's not, it's not really intended to be like
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:06.140]   the all day charger.
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:06.980]   - They carry around.
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:07.820]   Yeah.
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:09.180]   - Yeah, you plug it in when you need it
[01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:10.660]   and then if when you're in a place
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:11.740]   where you can actually,
[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:15.540]   sorry, you plug it in to use it on the regular
[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:17.140]   and then when you're out and about,
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:19.860]   you bring it with you so that if you need a kind of a re-app,
[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:21.140]   you've got something you can do with it.
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:22.580]   - So it's roughly the size of say,
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:27.220]   the MacBook Pro charging block thereabouts.
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:31.060]   - Yeah, it's a slightly bigger but almost that.
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:32.900]   Yeah, in fact, I actually,
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:34.940]   I also have a plug bug which is,
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:36.180]   I'm sure you know what that is.
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:39.140]   It's got the similar sort of idea of multi ports.
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:39.980]   - Right.
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:42.820]   - And that sits right on top of the charging,
[01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:45.860]   the power brick for the MacBook Pro.
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:48.020]   It's almost exactly the same size
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:51.300]   as the MacBook Pro power brick with a plug
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:52.300]   on top of it.
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:53.660]   - Right, nice.
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:57.580]   Mophie, the power station.
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:00.580]   Oh, but, see, I'm always looking for simple things
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:03.260]   I can put my backpack in half with me at all times
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:05.100]   and multi-function.
[01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.340]   - That fits in your back pocket.
[01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:07.780]   - Yeah, nice.
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.140]   - A little bulky, but it does fit.
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:09.980]   - Yeah.
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:13.100]   You know, with my butt, it doesn't matter.
[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:14.140]   Andy and I,
[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:16.140]   I'll leave the rest of your imagination.
[01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:18.740]   Andy and I, co, you're pick of the week.
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:20.260]   - I was gonna just make a joke and say,
[01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:23.340]   my pick of the week is this lovely green iced peach tea
[01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:27.060]   from Starbucks and the Google Starbucks wifi
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:28.900]   that got me through this show after--
[01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:30.220]   - It worked well.
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:32.180]   - After my home office in library number one
[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:33.860]   and library number two, Acedo,
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:35.420]   somebody on Twitter that said,
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:38.060]   "Gee, dude, are you that cheap or that poor
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:41.020]   that you got to always use free wifi?"
[01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:42.260]   So my actual pick of the week is--
[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:43.540]   - She saw his Twitter.
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:44.380]   - I freaking hate Twitter.
[01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:46.020]   - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:47.020]   it was funny, it was funny.
[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:49.980]   I've never had a bad time on Twitter, really.
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:54.660]   But it did inspire me to share a very, very brief tip here
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:56.980]   that the reason why, like, I kept doing,
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:59.860]   I keep doing shows from my local library
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:02.660]   instead of my office after my office internet got fixed
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:04.380]   was that I found myself,
[01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:07.620]   that I was tricking myself into having a better time
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:09.820]   doing podcasts because usually,
[01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:13.020]   the podcasting desk is an opposite
[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:14.580]   of the desk I do my writing at.
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:17.020]   And I would be like, up at, I'd start my work day
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:19.900]   at like 9.30 or 10, I'd be working until
[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:22.060]   about maybe 10 minutes before the show starts,
[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:24.340]   maybe even up until the moment the work starts.
[01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:27.460]   And so I just sort of like shift from one desk to another.
[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:29.300]   I found that I've really, really enjoyed
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:32.740]   the idea that there's a time in the morning
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:34.700]   where I have to stop what I'm doing.
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:36.580]   And if I haven't shaved, I have to shave,
[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:37.420]   'cause I'm going out.
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:39.380]   If I haven't put on shoes, I gotta put on shoes,
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:40.900]   I gotta be properly dressed.
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:42.860]   I have to make sure my bag is packed.
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:45.220]   And then I have to, I have a lovely little like walk
[01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:47.020]   for about a mile, a little bit more,
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:49.660]   through like ponds and seeing critters and stuff like that.
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:51.980]   And then I have to unpack in the conference room
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:53.220]   and set up my gear.
[01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:57.260]   And that's like a good like 45 minute pause
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:58.820]   between the very, very last thing I was doing
[01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:00.900]   in the morning, which is writing or editing something
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:03.460]   or doing my email and sitting down in my mind
[01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:05.060]   and doing this podcast.
[01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:09.140]   And my mind is just in a very, very much better state
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:12.180]   that I put a breather between the end of one task
[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:13.740]   and the beginning of another.
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:18.740]   And so this was today, okay, things went wrong.
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:23.380]   But this is why you're often going to see me doing shows
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:25.100]   from the local library,
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:27.060]   assuming their internet comes back on.
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:28.380]   So that's my tip.
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:31.620]   Sometimes if you have the sort of day or your sort of work
[01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:34.860]   where you have to keep juggling between multiple things,
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:38.140]   you know, neurologists keep saying that the brain
[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:39.860]   is not really good at multitasking.
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:41.980]   We just trick ourselves into thinking it's multitasking.
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:44.020]   It's sort of like a Mac OS system seven.
[01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:45.460]   It's not really multitasking.
[01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.740]   And we all know how well that version
[01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:49.980]   of Mac OS actually worked.
[01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:53.700]   So my advice is to if you have to manage lots of things
[01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:56.260]   at the same time, even if you just get up at your desk,
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:58.980]   take a walk, go get a glass of water,
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:02.940]   go get a cup of coffee, go outside, sniff a sniff
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:05.380]   at a flower and then come back inside.
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:07.260]   The fact that you've put some space,
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:10.100]   some cognitive space between the last task
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:12.820]   that you were doing and this new task you have to move on to,
[01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:14.580]   I really do think, or in my case,
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:18.180]   I really do think that it's led to me having a healthier brain.
[01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:22.660]   And I hope that I'm doing better as a commentator
[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:25.500]   and as a podcaster, being able to again,
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:28.980]   sort of have these little breathers between tasks.
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:30.340]   So that's my pick of the week.
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:32.980]   - Andy's getting out of the house and we're all happy.
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:33.820]   - He's getting it.
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:35.140]   (laughing)
[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:39.700]   - And look, my skin tone has turned from like a greenish blue
[01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:42.900]   to almost a grayish glow of all the sunlight.
[01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:44.580]   - I was gonna say you're not translucent anymore.
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:46.380]   - It's a wider shade of pale.
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:47.980]   Let's just put it that way.
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:49.540]   I wanted to talk about this.
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:51.180]   We were talking about it on iOS today.
[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:53.380]   And you're mentioning Anchor reminded me
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:55.740]   that Anchor is the first company I know of
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:59.700]   to do commercial production of gallium nitride technology
[01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:00.540]   devices.
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:03.460]   Gallium nitride is a newer material that is being used
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:07.340]   to replace silicon in electronics devices.
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:09.940]   Eventually it'll be in semiconductors,
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:11.300]   it'll be in chips.
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:14.340]   Right now though, it's being used for power.
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:17.900]   And Anchor put out this new little device.
[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.540]   This is actually really cool.
[01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:22.580]   It's about the size of an iPhone, Wal-Wort.
[01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:27.460]   It's got a USB-C PD power, what is it?
[01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:30.220]   Power delivery port on it.
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:32.660]   But this is the PowerPort Atom PD-1,
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:35.700]   but it's 30 watts in something the size
[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:37.660]   of a little tiny plug.
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:41.260]   They also make, yeah, this is because of gallium arsenide.
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:46.260]   They also make the PowerPort Atom PD-2, which is 60 watts.
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:49.020]   And so enough to charge two devices,
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:54.300]   got two ports on it, or a MacBook Pro even.
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:57.380]   These are about 15% smaller than stock chargers
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:59.220]   because of gallium arsenide.
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:00.460]   Sorry, gallium nitride.
[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:02.780]   It's a really interesting technology.
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:05.220]   And I'm very excited by the idea
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:07.380]   that we're going to see more and more of these devices used
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:10.060]   in wireless charging, fast charging,
[01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:12.580]   and eventually even in faster microprocessors.
[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:15.540]   But if you want to get a little piece of the future,
[01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:18.700]   something that's actually quite cute and not very expensive,
[01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:20.340]   take a look at the PowerPort Atom.
[01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:21.420]   It's the PD-1.
[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:25.140]   We interviewed the guy from, what was it,
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:28.940]   electric power conversion, EPC,
[01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:31.540]   about gallium nitride technology more than a year ago
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:32.380]   in triangulation.
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:33.860]   I was very excited about this.
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:38.660]   And finally, Anker has released its GAN technology charger.
[01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:40.540]   And it lives up to the promise.
[01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:41.620]   It also runs cooler.
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:42.900]   It doesn't get as hot.
[01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:46.540]   There's a lot of benefits to gallium nitride technology.
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:50.620]   That's that for this episode of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:51.900]   A little short episode today.
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:55.660]   Apple's got to get to work and give us more stuff to talk about.
[01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:58.420]   Renee Richie, probably glad to be through a little early
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:01.380]   because you got up so early for that press release this morning.
[01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:03.940]   Why do they, Apple's a West Coast company?
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:05.380]   Why would they release something that early?
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:06.860]   I don't understand.
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:08.980]   I guess because these Coast markets are going to open
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:09.820]   or who knows?
[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:10.660]   Who knows?
[01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.140]   Who knows Leo?
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:13.700]   But I managed to get a video up already.
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:15.420]   So I'm tapping on those.
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:18.740]   Will I find that at imore.com/vector?
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:19.580]   You would.
[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:21.100]   You would or youtube.com/vector.
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:22.100]   I managed to get the URL.
[01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:23.620]   It was a vector show before.
[01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:25.660]   And through Harry Potter-esque magic,
[01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:26.660]   I managed to get slash-vector.
[01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:29.340]   You are a spellcaster.
[01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:30.980]   Back to you, vector.
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:31.980]   Best.
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:33.940]   I still can't get my Wikipedia page updated,
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:35.300]   but I can get the URL out of YouTube.
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:36.300]   No, I'm not allowed to get it.
[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:37.140]   Just tell the people.
[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:38.660]   They did fix my country of birth.
[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:39.620]   That was finally fixed.
[01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:41.020]   It was wrong for like three years.
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:41.860]   Citation needed.
[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:42.700]   But now--
[01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:43.780]   South Africa?
[01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:44.620]   It was.
[01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:46.980]   Canada-listed because I guess I apologize so much.
[01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:48.820]   They thought it was natural.
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:52.500]   So anybody wants to use this show as a citation.
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:54.140]   That is OK with Wikipedia.
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:54.500]   Yes.
[01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:56.020]   So now you've heard it here.
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:58.540]   Where were you born, Renee Richie?
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:21:59.940]   Johannesburg, South Africa.
[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:00.820]   Thank you.
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:03.260]   That's the citation right there.
[01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:03.780]   Thanks, Renee.
[01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:04.700]   Always a pleasure.
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:06.060]   Thanks to you, Andy and Aco.
[01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:07.580]   And thanks to the Starbucks--
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:09.460]   just next to the Providence Starbucks
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:14.420]   for giving us a little Andy hit and some caffeine too.
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:16.540]   You'll find Andy at WGBH Boston.
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:18.740]   What are you going to be on this week?
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:20.220]   Friday at 1 p.m.
[01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:21.820]   And the great thing is that we're doing that
[01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:23.180]   at the Boston Public Library Studio.
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:24.660]   So it's open to the public.
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:26.420]   So if you're going to be in Boston, drop by.
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:28.300]   The Boston Public Library is a wonderful place
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:30.860]   to visit under any circumstances.
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:34.180]   It will be slightly dampened by watching me gesture wildly
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:35.220]   as I speak.
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:36.940]   But it should be a lot of fun.
[01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:39.220]   Go to the newsroom cafe.
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:41.620]   You'll be very, very easy to find.
[01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:42.820]   Very nice.
[01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:45.020]   And Laurie Gill, we thank you for being here.
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:46.980]   She's managing editor at iMore.
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:48.940]   So she's got a lot of responsibility.
[01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:52.500]   I really appreciate you taking the time to join us.
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.820]   I'm just waiting for my Wikipedia page.
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:57.100]   You don't have a Wikipedia page?
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:58.100]   No.
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:22:58.460]   OK.
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:00.340]   I'm not cool enough yet.
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:02.220]   OK, I think she qualifies.
[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:05.740]   I think everybody needed to help out.
[01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:07.300]   By the way, this is a good tips scooter.x
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:08.900]   mention this in the chatroom.
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:13.100]   Both scooter and x and I subscribe to the Apple PR bot
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:14.420]   on Telegram.
[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:18.100]   And so we both got messages at 6.30 in the morning.
[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:19.820]   Do you do that to Laurie in the Renee?
[01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:22.100]   Is that how you get your Apple PR?
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:23.900]   I used to have shenanigans for that.
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:25.380]   And now they just made web alerts.
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:28.660]   So if you get you can be able to get a web alert when
[01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:29.940]   the soon as the page is updated.
[01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:31.020]   Nice.
[01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:34.700]   I still love Telegram as my messenger, my favorite messenger.
[01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:37.340]   It's not super necessarily super encrypted
[01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:38.740]   because they do their own encryption thing.
[01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:40.860]   But those bots are fantastic.
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:43.220]   And yeah, I've had the Apple PR bot forever.
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:46.500]   So that's how I keep up with Apple's up too.
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:47.380]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:48.340]   We'll see you next time.
[01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:51.100]   Mac break weekly is every Tuesday, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:53.700]   Eastern time, 1,700 UTC.
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:55.860]   You can watch or listen live at our live stream,
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:59.860]   twit.tv/live, or ask your Amazon Echo, say, hey,
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:01.060]   play Twit Live.
[01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:03.980]   And usually-- not always, but usually it'll
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:06.220]   start playing the live stream right away.
[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:09.300]   You can also get downloaded versions of everything
[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:13.460]   we do at our website, twit.tv/mbw.
[01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:17.060]   You can also ask Echo, play the Mac break weekly podcast.
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:18.340]   It'll give you the latest episode.
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:20.100]   If you want earlier episodes, they're all available
[01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:20.980]   on the website.
[01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:22.380]   Or subscribe.

[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:33.700]   But it's pretty simple.

[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:40.140]   on a Tuesday afternoon.

[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:46.380]   because break time is over.
[01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:46.940]   Bye-bye.
