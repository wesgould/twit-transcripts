[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.040]   Yes, you like me to contain 3,000 miles away my little box. It was so easy to shut me off when I'm not in the studio
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.720]   isn't it Leo's yes, it was so nice to have you here and
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.800]   We actually used another segment that you did at what's in my bag
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.280]   For us when you were out and the screen savers two weeks ago and this past Saturday
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.680]   We showed that if that people haven't seen it. It's a great. It probably do we make a twit bit out of that?
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.840]   We ought to have
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.720]   What was in Andy's bag, but it was there was so much in your bag? We actually had to cut it down for length
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.760]   Yeah, I wish I had I known I would have like
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.560]   Yeah, there's my bag is full of wonder mints and delights. It is it is the bag of holding awesome
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.360]   I highly recommend anybody
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.680]   Yeah, the bag of holding anybody wants to have some fun watch that segment from
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.480]   The the new screen savers last Saturday, which would have been my February 4th. I think also with us
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.480]   Hello Renee Richie from imore calm
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.680]   Leo, I was not at all jealous sitting here freezing while Andy was sneaking into Skywalker ranch
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.960]   I mean totally that was all fine. He went everywhere. He got to go to Pixar. Did you get it?
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.960]   I don't get into Skywalker ranch Andy
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:23.120]   No, no, I see even though I've never been more explicit to Alex about how he keeps saying and saying and saying but that's okay
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.040]   Now I know for a fact is that he regards me as riffraff who would simply embarrass him
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.800]   It's good to have these things out in the open. Wouldn't you agree? Yes? I do agree. Oh, it was wonderful watching Alex Andy's travel journal
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.840]   Yeah
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.840]   Did you follow him on Instagram or Facebook or Flickr? Where did you yes? Where's the best place Andy? We see all your images
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:51.800]   I've I've I've I've I've sliced it up like this Instagram is like where I post lots of things often right from my phone
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.800]   I've decided that I'm using Flickr now for more that that's after things have been edited and polished and
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.480]   So good. I just flew me away. I love this
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.600]   I you I shot that on my way back from from doing Mac break last week. It was I got it
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.480]   I was I was on the Golden Gate bus and then I'm just it's an hour to
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.840]   Hour with your thoughts and I'm thinking oh, you know what? It's about four ten
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.680]   We're gonna be crossing the Golden Gate Bridge and had like 20 minutes before sunset if I get off the bus
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.480]   I can run run run run run to that beach that I've admired but not actually been to I might be
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.640]   Look at something fun and I had my tripod with me. I had my good camera with me
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.360]   And an hour later I had I had wet shoes, but I had a good picture
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.520]   But a full heart is this the north side of the bridge or the south side of the bridge?
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.280]   That's the west side. It's a there's a place called Marshall's Beach
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.520]   Oh, yeah, it's actually not far from a nude beach where you don't want to say a nude beach. Let's say
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.480]   No judgment no judgment no judgment
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.440]   and
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.800]   You have to the problem is that you have to it really is you have to climb down the side of a cliff and the fact that they've set
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:10.280]   Trails and steps to help you it helps you but it's not changing the fact that you have to go down a metric
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.560]   Butload of steps which means that after you get your beautiful sunset photo you have to climb up
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.000]   Butload of steps in like the semi darkness, but it's it really is a great
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.120]   I've been I had been to the golden gate bridge like two or three times before I was even aware that you could there's a pedestrian tunnel
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.520]   That goes underneath the 101 freeway
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.800]   that you can actually go to the other side of the bridge and
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.920]   We're given that if that's the side that faces west it means that that's the only side that's getting sunlight
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.520]   Unless you're getting up at a crazy stupid hour, and it's such it's a peaceful place. You're not like surrounded by tourists
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.080]   There is only one other person there
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:54.120]   And it was some fellow who I think was taking some sort of a photo instruction or a guided
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:01.880]   photo thing all I know is he was from Europe and he left his his wife or girlfriend decided that
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.320]   She didn't want to climb all the way down like the very very last like
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:11.400]   Goat goat trail and she had waited there patiently for an hour for them to come back
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.320]   Because when I when I packed up and was going I'm like what you've been waiting here this whole time
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.120]   She said yes and on time freezing
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:24.200]   Like okay, hope you like that picture because it's gonna be a long flight back to germany for you son
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.120]   this is uh
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.880]   Some of the gardeners praying out the opposite side
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.960]   You normally see if you go on the other side of the bridge here at the north end
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.120]   You'll be up on the hill there with a looking down into san francisco
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.960]   But you wanted to see the sunset in the bay. That's got to be used for os 10.14
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:46.520]   Isn't that beautiful? Yeah, yeah, oh, it's 10 mccos golden gate. There's got to be one yes. Yep
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.800]   I'm I'm I'm a it's available for reasonable terms
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.840]   Anyway, nice nice picture and a bunch of them and I see a lot of great ones on flickers
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.120]   So that that's obviously the the place to go and those were all with your omd
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.840]   Mostly yep, that's your look they the olympus. I absolutely freaking love that camera
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:10.600]   You saw all the sites and so did apparently your cows. This is l.a. Now
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:18.280]   Yeah, I did I did get some I did get shots of the cows at google so that's oh, I'm still I'm still working on that picture
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.280]   So that's that's very good
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:28.520]   Uh, let's see has there been any uh, let's see when we last gathered yes, rene was running out the door
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:37.080]   Yes to listen to the earnings call and yes, sir and write his story in fact serenity called will transcribe this
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:42.200]   Why did serenity get tapped for that is she the fastest type her she does she started doing with jason
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.040]   Jason sennell many years ago and she's just kept doing it. No, she still does it with jason
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.680]   It's just it's it's one of her awesome talents. Wow, and she gets it done really fast
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.840]   And I know a lot of people in the investment community internally everywhere just really loved them
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:01.720]   So so let's uh hit the highlights. It was a record once again quarter for revenue for apple their biggest
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.360]   You thought yeah
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.200]   That's that's pretty impressive 78.3 million iPhones
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:13.000]   It's a little bit of sleight of hand because it was a leap quarter where they had an extra week compared to previous quarters
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.600]   It happens every every so often, but it's also the holiday quarter and that is always a record
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.960]   It's gonna be yeah
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.120]   It's gonna be the biggest quarter for sure and they sold a lot of iPhones ipad sales
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:31.400]   Continue their slide down. What was it now this time? It's 13 point so this is I am so conflicted about ipad
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.800]   It's 13.1 million units sold this quarter
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:39.640]   Which most companies would give the it of every one of their executives to have a business like that but it's not growing
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:46.120]   It's it's a shrinking business. It'll probably end up leveling off sort of like the Mac business as but apple is not doing it
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.720]   Any favors by not telling a story about ipad it sort of like yet
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.480]   Maybe they'll maybe the update cycles are long
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.760]   Maybe most people don't need more computer so they buy an ipad and they keep it three or four years and they're totally fine with it
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:02.840]   But it still feels like since ipad 2 and maybe a little bit with the verse that they just haven't they haven't given people a reason
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.240]   Michael gartner called it the tivo problem where it starts to tell somebody why a tivo is amazing
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.520]   But the minute you really show them their eyes light up and they have to have it
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.720]   Yeah, yeah, also they're they're facing a couple challenges from
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:20.040]   There people understand the need for an e-book reader or a simple like back of this back of the driver's seat
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:27.880]   TV read to movie player for the kids and that's covered well with kindle fires that cost 50 bucks and do are superb for that job
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.920]   People might even understand the idea of a tablet multi-touch computer
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.320]   but a lot of those people because
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:41.800]   Apple hasn't trained Mac users to understand the idea of multi-touch for for productivity
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.920]   A lot of those people on the window side are not going to be tempted to get an ipad
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.080]   Instead of a windows based multi-touch tablet
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:57.560]   So they're kind of navigating the middle ground saying we're going to give you we're trying to we're trying to sell you on the idea
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:04.760]   Of something that's priced like a productivity device, but can't do everything a desktop computer can do
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.440]   Based on the common definition of a desktop computer when in truth
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.480]   It's just as capable for for people who people who typically need a five or six hundred dollar computer
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.720]   An ipad pro can really do the job and in many cases do it even better
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.480]   So they saw they saw the graph it's uh, yeah, I
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.840]   It may be you know and it that looks like leveled off doesn't it? I mean if you if you look at it
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.600]   Yeah, it'll probably give you attach the mac graphic at the end of that
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.240]   You know, it'll probably end up being what the ipad graphic is and it's 85 of tablets over 200
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.800]   And again 16.1 million
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.560]   Units sold in just one quarter. It's a billion dollar business and those are rare
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.040]   It sells more than most other technology. It's just in
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:51.320]   When it's an apple product and you compare it to things like iphone it looks bad by comparison. Yeah
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:56.920]   Yeah, particularly because we're kind of trained to buy a new iphone every new phone every two years every three years
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:02.520]   Unless you're absolute and we also tend to buy a new laptop every two or three years because
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.640]   Both my phone and my laptop these are things I use every single day and all I really rely on these things
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:14.120]   People who buy an ipad maybe they're not using it as a day-to-day device. So they're like, does it still play Netflix?
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:19.640]   Yes, can I still read books on it? Yes. Can I still read comics on it? Great. Okay, so i'm fine with my ipad three or my ipad four
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:25.080]   And again some people that's all they want it sold three to almost three times as much as max salt last quarter
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.840]   So there's a large swath of the population that is super happy with getting an ipad and and sort of using that for what it
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.920]   What they want to use it for?
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:40.200]   He's the spackle these these spackle pc it uses they use just to fill in whatever gaps are left over between their phone and their and they're
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:46.040]   And they were just sort of alienated and they did they found computers on a electrical computer is unapproachable and the ipad sort of was something
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.880]   They could get their hands on and feel like they weren't dumb just trying to use it and that was powerful
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.840]   And then they bought it and they were fine with it for the next three four years. Yeah
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.920]   Um
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:00.040]   And there may be some uh some juiced up sales in march when new ipads are announced especially
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.360]   I think if they announce a 10.5. They are yeah if they're announced. Oh, come on
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.440]   Yeah, oh, this is just in a commercial
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:13.640]   Thank you karsen
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.960]   Uh, you really need to have something you know, I know that you've got that really big like high ceiling
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.720]   You need to actually have like wires you can fly things down like lady gaga
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.920]   When you when you need like a more coffee or one of these little announcements. I always wanted a
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.280]   pneumatic tube system
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:37.880]   Yeah, yeah, I I like a tube right here. It just goes from right into my left
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.960]   Oh, this is just in a word from squarespace that kind of thing it'd be great
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.640]   Or a mccransporter
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.320]   What what if what if you were to buy karsten like a t-shirt cannon and you could you could
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:55.320]   You put like a plexiglass slug in there that has the paper and she he just fired at your chest not at your head at your chest
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.400]   Okay
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.480]   Yeah, that what could possibly go wrong
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:09.320]   How about uh services this is the number two uh revenue a generator it was uh what was a 24 billion dollar quarter
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:16.440]   For services on the back of bookamongo and mario run on the app so amazing and they've said this apple said this for a while that services
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.800]   I'm sorry 7.2 billion dollars. I don't know where i got the craze
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:25.000]   The not i don't call it craze, but the the the amazing prediction that they made that got a lot of attention is that they said it was going to double
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.320]   Again over the next few years and then maybe quadruple after that and when you consider that
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:35.800]   It was more than facebook made the quarter before at the time when apple announced this they were making more money off services and facebook
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.480]   Was making off of everything. Yeah, which is a stupefying again sort of
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:44.200]   Like the apple really suffers from these laws of these numbers are just too big the creeping best ones
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.200]   I don't understand other so big
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.640]   It really really makes you think about it if they're saying that they're going to double that
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:56.360]   Do they mean that there's going to be growth in all of their existing services or do they mean that no we are going to own
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.600]   We're going to own netflix in two years. We're going to own comcast in a couple of years
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:07.800]   We are putting everything in place so that we really pivot so that we're not even necessarily anymore a hardware company
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:15.400]   We are simply apple. We are like 3m. We have you be surprised that we are in we're in pharmaceuticals. We are in scotch tape
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.560]   Uh, we are in imaging devices. We have we build devices for cars
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.480]   Uh, so it's really makes you think about what they what they got what what they
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:28.040]   In the secret room, they've got the five-year plan what they got on that white board that we can't even imagine
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.920]   What do what is services? What what does that include?
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:37.000]   iCloud app store it's anything that's delivered. It's not apple pay apple music. Yeah apple pay
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.200]   They break it down at all. Do we know how apple paid it for instance?
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.120]   You know, they don't break it down in the numbers
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.520]   But they will sometimes break out the numbers and things like the conference call or give you give you enough guidance
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:51.480]   It's smart people like a like a ben tomsen or a Neil cyborg can sort of do the back of the envelope math and figure it out
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:58.600]   Okay, any anything insight from that or I think just what what's hard for me is a distortion by the app store
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.120]   When you deal with things like again pokemon go revenue in the last if you court, right?
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.120]   It's just it makes so much money off pay you know free to play games that it's
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:11.640]   Unbelievable. Yeah, I mean, they're certainly not making money off of a off of iCloud subscriptions
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:18.040]   Well, see that's the thing. I mean one they're almost apples and oranges because how you do in store sales versus how you do in iCloud
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.280]   There is apple music subscriptions is different kind of revenues and yeah, one time
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.200]   Apple's always been a genius at figuring out where the money is hidden
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:31.240]   And I really it really does look like they figured out that if you can just figure out
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:37.560]   How to simply sell electrons and never have to manufacture stuff and not have to worry about
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:43.960]   Shipping constraints and have to worry about having enough stuff in the stores not having to worry about having to predict which colors and which
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:49.320]   Capacities of these devices is gonna sell best. It's not that they would have want to get out of the hardware business
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.680]   But they realize that that's yeah, I mean, I'll have to do is well
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:57.960]   You forget that amazon makes a hell of a lot of money just off of doing application hosting
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.760]   AWS right and really it is not that this doesn't this has no sunk cost
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:09.560]   But it's a lot easier to simply be a utility to be a utility service than to be someone who again has to if there's
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.440]   That has to figure out what happens if there's an earthquake
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:17.800]   In a part of asia where a critical part of your process your manufacturing has happened happening
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:23.800]   That's what's happened with nicon is is delayed now almost a full year in shipping their next generation
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.640]   when their next generation
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:31.560]   Pocket cameras because the earthquake basically disrupted their ability and manufacture or what happens if you
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:38.760]   The batteries that you buy for your your your your keystone product swell up and cause fires. What do you do then?
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:43.560]   It's if you are in a services company you put out the fire at your server farm
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:49.240]   You don't tell anybody what happened and you play you claim that the reason why you're down for 12 minutes is because of
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:53.400]   odd activity happening in in in Russia
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:58.840]   And while check somewhere that we've corrected or you hope you're not exactly you hope you're not get lab
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.120]   Did you and also it's a great story for wall street to understand because like the the
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.360]   The correct real fear with iphone is that there's no room for growth that if everybody has an iphone
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.600]   You know no one's gonna buy two iphones or very few people
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.600]   But services seems like an infinite revenue stream and that makes it makes it more attractive
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.920]   Yeah, actually if you look at and by by the way again
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:20.840]   Thanks to a six colors and a jason snell for these great graphs because it really is easiest way to look at if you look at iphone
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:28.120]   Year over year revenue growth. That's what this chart is you see this this last four quarters
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:33.320]   But before this quarter with negative revenue growth and they're back to positive
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:38.600]   Um, but it's nothing nothing like the growth, you know back in 2015
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:45.080]   Yeah, that's the quarter where they pulled iphone upgradeers forward by having the bigger screens and that just it really
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:50.600]   Everything yeah round everything a few years ahead and then those people weren't gonna upgrade two years in a row
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.720]   So now they're back to kind of the growth figures from you know
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.400]   2014 and the asp was interesting because they not only had an iphone
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:02.040]   Plus but it was $20 more than the previous years plus and yet that turned out to be the sleeper hit
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.440]   They they admitted they didn't do the demand forecasting right
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.840]   So it was more popular than they thought it would be and more people are buying it and whether that's some combination of the finishes
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.640]   The size most maybe the camera is one of the marquee features
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:18.600]   But people are actually willing to pay more to get the you know the highest end iphone and that raised up the entire revenue stream for the product
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:24.600]   Yeah, it points to how apple has to for the iphone. They really have to get people's attention with every new release
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.640]   They can't just simply say hey look we now have the a12 processor
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:33.560]   And hey look now we have 40 touch they really have to do something that gets people's attention whether it is
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:38.440]   We've now we now have one that's a much larger screen or now we have look we've got two lenses on it
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.440]   And it takes much much better pictures not just
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.680]   We're gonna we're gonna
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.320]   Land this point not simply by showing you before and after pictures
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.800]   But by showing you a picture of a look it's it's it's like a it's like a tic-tac now
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.280]   It's not a circle that's because it's got so many lenses in this thing
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.520]   So it's it's I think apple's feeling the pinch from
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.800]   I guess
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.320]   People there people's
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.600]   Engines of excitement are wearing thin at this point
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:10.920]   I mean, I mean I mean across the entire industry where a phone really is more of seeing is more seen like an empty vessel
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:17.320]   Into which you pour a multi platform app like the facebook app or the instagram app or or the snapchat app
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.520]   People are there. I think there's gonna be a lot less loyalty to a specific platform
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:27.880]   And when you get to the point where now people are not I was not are not being hidden
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:32.840]   I'm not being tricked into thinking that the iPhone is free that this is something you're going to be paying
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.640]   $7,800 for this is when they start to say well, what can I buy that?
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.920]   puts $300 back in my pocket and
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:47.240]   Even though the alternatives aren't as well made maybe aren't in as advanced maybe aren't as stable aren't as safe
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:53.720]   That's 300 bucks. It just to give you some sense of how important the iPhone is to apple's profit picture
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.280]   This is the quarterly profit graph
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:02.920]   And the peaks are every fourth quarter big yes, right? I mean this is iPhone sales is what's powering again
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:09.640]   It makes more money than companies that have exclusive access to fossil fuel. Yeah. Yeah bigger than xon more than xon. Yeah
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.360]   so
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.600]   Clearly the iphones important clearly the iphones is holding steady
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:23.080]   But as you say andy they need something to get people's attention every every every q4, right?
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.080]   uh
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.000]   How do you how do you uh do that this year? I have a bet you know
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.760]   You make a transparent leo and then you're picking it to goggles. So scoble scoble
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:39.720]   What do you think of that scoble was on uh twit on sunday and man is he adam and he is sure
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:44.600]   That apple's gonna release a clear iphone for the 10th anniversary iphone is that
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:51.240]   I thought that is so utray that I said i'll tell you what i'll make a bet a one-sided bet
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.640]   You don't even have to give me anything if if you're if uh if uh you're you're wrong
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:21:02.760]   Because I know you're gonna be wrong and I want to but I will take you to your favorite french restaurant in paris
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:07.480]   Wow, we even made it in the news there in paris
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:13.320]   If apple releases a clear iphone am I at risk? Yeah, georgia and peters faces. They are just classic with
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.360]   a very good skeptic sandwich
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.440]   Uh, I don't think i'm a great risk here
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.400]   It's it's it was really hard about this stuff is that when someone hears rumors like if you go to johnny
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.960]   I have and you say what's the iphone a gonna be and he sits down explains it to you
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.800]   You can give a very good impression of what that phone is you can describe it to people you can
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:34.920]   Laban if you hear whispers here and there like oh, it's being made at a glass and your mind glass translates
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.200]   And i'm not saying this is what happened with scoble
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:42.760]   But in your mind glass translates into transparency and then you tell somebody that and then like that very easily echoes down
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.400]   And that's why we see a lot of people who can report on excellent data
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.400]   Like they they know certain things about it
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:52.040]   But they don't know the story or how or the context or what that what it actually ends up meaning
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.320]   And that I think is where we get with this like apple is absolutely working on
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.280]   Admit reality and ar and they're absolutely working on
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:04.760]   Uh casings for the iphone that are made out of substances like glass. I mean, I think well, here's what i'm gonna bet
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:10.520]   I think you nailed it that he heard bits and pieces and and assumed that that was a clear iphone
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:17.240]   Augmented reality we already seen this for instance with pokimango where you take the cameras image put it on the screen
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:21.160]   So it's as if you're looking at the world as if it's a clear phone
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:28.920]   And i'm sure that's something scoble has very specific interests about the future and what he heard is probably filtered through that lens
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:35.640]   Right. Okay. I mean i don't want to i don't want to rag on robert and you know what we're gonna all be eating crow when robert's right in in nine months
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.600]   But uh comes out with the transparent eye flow on his face
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:44.360]   I do agree with him that ar is in the future and I do hope that there'll be something uh announced this year in ar
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.360]   But again, that was the thing that go ahead
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:51.560]   Sorry in the earnings when people when they talked about rnd a lot of people said oh well project titan is not dead
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.400]   Project titan is only a very small part of the special groups that apple has working
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.640]   So yes, that you know that's there and that's being accounted for
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.880]   But when you look at it that includes things like ar it includes a lot of projects that apple's working on that
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:06.600]   We may never see like the tv project of a few years ago. What were the rnd numbers? Are they up?
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.680]   Uh, I forget where they are. I'd have to look them up again historically apple
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:16.360]   They're on the rise used to spend less than anybody else on rnd and people like ben tomsen and john lewie
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.440]   Gasey would point to that and say you know that that's unusual for a company of that size
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.800]   Is spent so little on rnd, but it did ramp up over the last year or so
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.400]   Uh, yeah, and that was obviously project titan
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.440]   Also functioning of how good they are prototyping because they can do a lot of things in that little lab that makes them save a lot of money later on
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.640]   Right the rnd is simple if johnny i've runs the whole
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:41.960]   The whole show right you don't have 18,000 people working on it. Yeah, um, ipad sales
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:47.080]   Spiked as would any any quarter, but uh, not any you know that that slides
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.680]   We have the problems they had no new products last year
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:56.840]   They had the ipad pro 13 inch that they could you get a rise out of they also had what he said was a manufacturing shortage
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:03.480]   And I believe that was an education people buying ipad to and ipad mini they just couldn't some supplier had yield problems
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:09.720]   And they had a they had a problem with that and also again demand forecasting is something that they've been struggling with even on ipad as a result
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.160]   ipad revenue continues to drop
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:18.520]   Year over year sales growth is in the red now that's growth by the way that means
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:24.360]   Yeah, not that sales are going down, but the growth of sales. Yeah acceleration is going to that's that kind of uh
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:29.720]   confusing, uh, and then finally max let's talk about max sales a little bit
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:36.520]   Is max flat it was the most profitable max quarter ever or not profitable revenue wise
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:42.280]   It was the highest revenue for the max ever price max because of the cost of the max book pro. Yeah
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:49.640]   Uh fourth quarter if you look at unit sales, uh, this is a fourth quarter moving average
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.520]   Uh, it's pretty flat as you say
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.680]   but um
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:25:00.120]   But not it's you know the most interesting thing to me again was this quarter at least was apple watch when you looked at
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:06.280]   You can estimate. They said a record quarter. That's all they said. It was a record quarter idc said it was hugely down
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.040]   Uh, and tim cook took offense to that. Oh, that's why he says it's a record quarter
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:14.280]   So, uh, and neil cybert's numbers were 5.6 and he went over with me how he does those numbers
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:17.400]   I think he's very good at them. It's I mean that's one of 5.6 million units
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:22.120]   5.6 million units would be sold outsold, uh or equaled max sales last quarter
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.320]   Wow
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:27.080]   And that was severely constrained like you could not go into a store and buy one
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:32.680]   Uh, and there's that that leads people to believe that it could have sold a lot more of availability was higher over the holidays
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.680]   And it led to this great tweet from benet
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.680]   I think it was benetik devins who said that
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:42.680]   In the tech community there's a very big disconnect between what we think of a product and how people actually buy it and neils tweet again
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:48.360]   Was there are three times as many apple watches sold as amazon echoes where that's considered a huge success in the tech community
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.120]   And apple watches dismulfilliar
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:55.000]   So it's just a reminder that people out there are buying products in a way that are different than how we often report about them
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.080]   in context, you know, andy your your comment that the the phone is
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:03.960]   Is not distinguished so much anymore that it's really just a platform for facebook or snapchat
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:08.040]   Which worked the same no matter what kind of phone you have reminds me a little bit about the pc world
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:14.760]   Desktop computing has become very much like that most people live in in the browser, right? So, uh
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:22.040]   Yeah, I mean we we have to as we're we're all fans of technology. We are all people who can who
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:28.520]   Love ideas like it was an interesting to have a a tiny little oled screen on the keyboard that can change
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.480]   Based on the based on what you're doing. We understand
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:36.440]   Uh the efficacy of certain processors, but again, there are a lot of people
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.760]   I think the majority of people they just wanted toy at a camera
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.080]   They just want the basic car that will get them there
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.200]   It's it's a they they don't even they have no emotional attachment to it
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.640]   They notice if it's not working. They know if it's working slowly
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:53.880]   Uh and the even though people who really really love the design of a premium product and here
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.760]   I'm including a high end hb high endells
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:03.320]   That lasts about two or three weeks and that just becomes another thing to them. So it's uh
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.480]   I think apple is in a position where uh they can certainly
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:12.200]   Attract that kind of attention by being a design focused company
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:16.200]   They've I think one of the many ways in which we've been smart in
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.640]   And position themselves is that we are not the we are not the computer or the phone that you buy because you just
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.640]   Buy whatever phone is in the store when at the time that you need to buy a new phone
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.840]   We are the ones that we we make beautiful devices
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:33.640]   Device that you know if you that that you're happy to take out of your pocket and put on your dresser
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:38.360]   And a little in a little ceramic dish that you bought because it's exactly the right size for this beautiful
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.760]   Cartier style
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.080]   Piece of piece of metal that you put in your pocket every single day
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:49.000]   Um, that's the way that they're going to continue to sell so many iPhones the iPhone is going to be for people who do care
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.680]   Uh, and who are motivated to spend the extra two or three hundred dollars for these super expensive devices
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:28:02.600]   All right, let's uh take a break. That's the apple quarterly results in deep dive again. Thanks to jacie snell and six colors for
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.400]   That uh set of very
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.800]   Beautiful graphs that he does every quarter
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.040]   You know, he doesn't really it took me a while to find them on the front front page
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.920]   I don't under Jason you've been a whole week
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.880]   Well, it's just it's it's like sublinked in his
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.600]   In a in a post
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:25.080]   Jason you got a big like make it that big the front that should be a whole page. Maybe it is
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:31.080]   It'd be a podcast. Oh could be shy. He doesn't he doesn't want to be obnoxious. Yes. He doesn't want to be rude
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:35.080]   So if you want to read it you go to go do apple's leap quarter
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:41.080]   And then it doesn't even mention the graphs you have to where was it? I don't even remember now
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.840]   uh
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.840]   Is it down from this?
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:48.040]   Okay, I think as a week ago. I think you had on the front page a week ago and oh
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.520]   He just moves fastly. He's onto new things. He's got too many other things actually there's some other stories in here
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:56.840]   I do want to talk about a little bit in just a bit, but let's take a a little break
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:01.960]   Love Jason. I want to give him a plug anytime I can and a hug and a hug
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.440]   cuddly fella
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.840]   And a high end IPA a question
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.680]   Question for you. How many of you were watching the super bowl on sunday
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.720]   And had to go to john malcovich.com
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:18.360]   It was a super one sunday it was there. Oh, you don't care do you
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.280]   Uh
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.640]   So many downs
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:28.920]   It was a there was a great square space ad on there and and in which john malcovich is moaning because somebody's taken john malcovich.com
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:33.400]   Oh, it's back to back to his regular page now because for a while it was a fake page
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:40.040]   But it was a square it was a great square space ad talking about their domain registration and how get you should get your name
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.200]   Malkovich
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:47.560]   Swears he gets bleep, but he swears like four times in this it's like peeved
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.120]   He says i'm john malcovich
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:55.160]   It's quite funny. I love square spaces. They're super bowl ads have now become a tradition actually
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:00.440]   Square space is the place to make your next website. It's never too late
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:05.080]   To reinvent yourself to change careers to launch a creative project
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.680]   Make your next move known to the world with square space
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:15.320]   Dot com. I am such a fan. I love my square space site at leola port.com
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:22.120]   Chris squarespace sites are are graphical. They're beautiful. They really draw the eye and that's why artists
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.640]   performers creators of all kinds are drawn
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:32.680]   To square space. It's also great for e-commerce because every square space port template has an online store built into it
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.760]   So it's easy to create a beautiful website and look like an expert right from the start
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.880]   Select a template design that fits your vision
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:45.320]   But that's just a starting point completely customizable fonts colors page configurations
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:52.360]   Doesn't matter if you're not a web expert your site will look professionally designed because it is they have the best designers and behind the
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:57.080]   The look of the site the best engineers, but you don't have to do any coding or design
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:03.720]   And mobiles built into every single site so your website looks great no matter what size screen what device people are visiting
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.680]   Did you know I didn't know this?
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:13.960]   Square spaces rss built in so you can publish content directly from your blog people can subscribe update your content once

[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.400]   I do that all the time when I do a new blog post on square space. I just updated my
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:25.960]   List of audible reads. I added the year 2016 to it and I made sure that that got
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.480]   Tweeted and put on facebook and it's just it's all kind of automatic
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:33.240]   Share and pin it buttons let your visitors do the same share their content to you
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.800]   Share your content there to their followers
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.920]   Uh, you can put on forms of course contact or sign up forms applications surveys

[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:31.480]   Your initial purchase square space dot com the offer code mac break
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:37.640]   We're talking about the uh, the apple ecosystem with two experts
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:42.840]   Renee richy from imore.com and the anacos from the chicago sometimes
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:47.320]   Uh my friend roman loyola old friend from tech tv
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.360]   interesting article in mac world
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.240]   rumor has it
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.240]   Apple working on a new mac chip to reduce reliance on intel processors
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:02.440]   This coalesces what's clearly been kind of going on for a while in the apple ecosystem
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:08.600]   apple has such great arm expertise and more than a thousand engineers working on chip design why not
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:12.200]   Put it in the mac and if you put it in with an intel chip
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:16.040]   You eliminate the pain this also comes from a bloomberg report
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.680]   Uh for mark german, of course
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.240]   Uh, what do you think?
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:26.760]   Super interesting. I think this is an example where i was talking about earlier where you you get a bunch of information
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:32.840]   But it's what you make of that information that matters. So my understanding isn't that is that maybe tangentially this has to do with intel
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.080]   Apple has had mac books running arm for years. Well, don't we have an arm processor in our track or touchpads?
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:44.440]   Yeah, absolutely you have you have a very the t1 chip a variation of the one that's inside the apple watch
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:50.840]   Yeah, uh and what but apple is doing this thing called fusion and they've been doing it for a while and it sort of sneaks up on you if you don't pay attention
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:56.280]   But what that means is as you start to get super high performance in one area you you start exposing the underneath
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:01.000]   It's the same thing why they had big big indian little and in a long time ago with chips when you start getting to high bits
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:05.160]   You become inefficient on the low bits high performance have come inefficient on the low performance
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:09.640]   So what they started to do with a lot of products for example the a 10 chip is called the fusion chip
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:15.800]   Because it has two really powerful cores, but then two really efficient cores to do work that doesn't require those cores
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:21.240]   So they can sleep and it can do things more energy efficiently fusion drives does that with ssd and traditional platters
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:25.800]   They do that with local versus online in i cloud photo library and i cloud music library
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:31.480]   So the idea of this as far as i understand it is to sort of do what they did with a co-processor like the m1 co-processor
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:35.960]   That just does all the the data crunching for motion tracking while the big processor sleeps
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:41.480]   There's a bunch of things that need to be done on a macbook things like power nap and update processing and a whole and file
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:45.480]   Move things with new aps system that don't need to be done by the main processor
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:51.880]   So they can leave that big power hungry intel processor sleeping and they can have all of this done by a custom apple processor
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.040]   I think this is challenging though because
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.640]   Remember moto roller did this with the moto x
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:01.720]   We've seen other phones with co-processors apple has a co-processor
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:08.600]   But but and i thought maybe this would be the next big thing for instance german says power nap might draw on an arm processor
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:14.760]   Instead of waking up the intel processor, which costs a lot of energy, but i think it's challenging
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.960]   I think the operating system integration is difficult to do
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.240]   That's the sense i get because people have backed off a little bit on this
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.720]   That's why apple has you apples advantage that they make everything from the silicone
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:31.800]   Also, like you could do it. Yes, so you can start doing things like this and it really people still complain about macbook battery life
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:37.560]   And yes kb lake and coffee lake and cannon lake are coming but they're going to be incremental updates
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.760]   Found don't wait for intel to do it. No
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.600]   Yeah
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.080]   And don't depend on intel that that would be a mistake
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.600]   Yes
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:53.480]   Really if all if all they ever did was create a second mac inside the inside the housing that only works when the
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:36:01.080]   When the intel processor is asleep only works when the when the display is asleep only works when people are not actually at the computer
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:08.120]   There are a lot of possibilities there and that's also a really great way to start porting parts of the of the os permanently
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:12.600]   To arm it's it's there there are a lot of things that i think that will does that are really test balloons
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.320]   And this could be an opportunity for them to do that
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:20.520]   To start to say well how how much of the up of the mac experience can we actually run an arm processor?
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:27.720]   That would just simply enhance the experience solve problems for us stop us from having to wait for intel to ship a new processor
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.440]   Is it possible that we can just now just use
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:37.880]   Intel CPUs for the heavy iron the heavy lifting and just we're out all the flashy features like extended battery life
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:43.080]   Being able to receive email and deliver notifications and pass along notifications while asleep
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.880]   We can do all that sort of stuff in house will just require
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:51.160]   Uh, we'll just we'll just require intel and other makers to do our gpu work and our cpu work
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:56.840]   Here's the uh, well, it's mark kind of buries the lead the very last paragraph
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:04.360]   Uh, the bloomberg news is reported the new chip may first become available in an upgraded version the macbook pro laptop
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.840]   planned for later this year
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.600]   kb lake
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:12.520]   interesting and a faster version of the 12 inch macbook
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:17.240]   And new iMac with multi functional usb c connectivity this year. So
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:21.880]   Uh, that I think is the most interesting part is this might be available this year
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.040]   This might be something we'll see in new max later
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.520]   It's sort of like integrated graphics versus a gpu
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.760]   Like you can have both in the system will intelligently they'll try to intelligently switch between them and also
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:36.200]   It's huge differentiation for apple where you are becoming a pc market. You're not you're not an intel only platform
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:40.680]   Yeah, and again many people can't like maybe qualcom could make a chip that hp could buy to try to do this
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.400]   But it'll never be as easy as an integrated company doing all of this
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:47.960]   You know who's maybe kind of in this in this ballpark is google's chromos
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:54.760]   Where they could they can do arm or intel and because they're adding android functionality to chromos
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:58.840]   I wouldn't be surprised at all to see a multi chip solution there
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:03.480]   And the brilliance of this is that you at any point you can just toss out the intel chip and put something else in
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.560]   Because this is only dependent of that
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:09.320]   So like you get to advance the state of your machines regardless of whether you continue with intel or not
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.320]   And that's why intel stock dropped on this news
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:16.920]   Well people misread it again as the as apple switching to arm because that's the always the big sex
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.560]   This makes more sense to me than apple switching to arm
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:23.880]   Although, you know windows microsoft's doing the same thing they have woa windows on arm
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.880]   I mean they've announced it. This is a real deal
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.000]   Um, so I think that apples had it for years
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.760]   It just again becomes a question of does it make sense for those for the specific computers in question
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.240]   And like a macbook sort of computer it might make sense even if it runs ios it might make a lot of sense
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:41.000]   But I think like for now my sense is they hang it over intel like a sort of damically saying hey
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.160]   Are those chips gonna be ready soon guys? Yeah
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:49.720]   Yeah, absolutely. It just and we can't as I've even when the original macbook came out the macbook
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.760]   Nothing the first thing that I thought is that oh my goodness
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:58.200]   This really is the platform for an arm based arm based mac. There's and everything about this reminds me of
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:02.280]   Machines are designed around arm like mobile processors
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.200]   Um, and so I think there's a lot there's a lot of truth the idea that this is
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:12.760]   Uh, this is a very very shrewd threat against intel to say that we don't have to
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:18.120]   You we've used your stuff because it was easier than developing our own hardware
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:22.680]   But if you're developing our own hardware is now easier than anything going with your stuff
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:27.400]   That's certainly something that we can do. Uh, but that said we can't uh, we can't ignore how
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.600]   how big of a shift it would be
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.960]   to uh
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:36.440]   Create a two CPU platform for mac OS
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:41.800]   Um, they the ideal would be to make sure that all you have to do in an x code is just click a checkbox
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:50.200]   Say yes, please build a fat a fat deployment of this so that it has both support for uh, uh for arm and intel and and power pc
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:56.440]   Why not? Uh, but it means that they have to really re re engineer everything to make sure it works perfectly
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:01.400]   And so that you don't have a so you don't have a uh, a situation where there is what?
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:05.960]   Apple would be apple would be perfectly okay with having two different levels of performance for max
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:10.520]   But not hey, I'm sorry. You can't run this spreadsheet because it requires this kind of hardware
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:15.800]   So it wouldn't be trivial, but apple likes to control its own destiny and in a situation with
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:23.080]   Uh, the mac where I think that they're willing to take more risks with uh redefining what the mac is because
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.960]   laptops aren't what they see as the future
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:32.200]   IOS devices are what they see as the future and if they are as we saw with the new macbook pro
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.920]   They're willing to say that we are not in that we're not
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:38.680]   Developing laptops the same way that the windows side is developing laptops
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:42.680]   We have a very clear idea of who is using these things and what we want to do with them
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:48.360]   So if apple decided that we want to have our second or a third major break in apple history
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:52.280]   The first break being when they went from OS 9 OS 10
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:57.480]   Second break being when they went from power pc to intel now they could do a third break saying
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:02.440]   We know there's going to be a disruptive point in the development of the mac. We are going to go completely to
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:06.600]   in-house processors, uh, if you really do need
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.600]   12
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:13.080]   12 cpu's if you really do need to build the next version of toy story on your desktop
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.800]   We are not the platform for you anymore because we are now making
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:22.680]   Uh machines that are just as useful deeply useful, but not for everybody anymore. I do think that's an interesting way to differentiate
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.240]   It's kind of a two pronged approach one ecosystem lock-in
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:31.400]   Two kind of hardware differentiation that that the other guys on the pc side can't do because they don't own the stack
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.280]   Yeah, that's up. That makes sense and your tweet
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.160]   last year is prescient, uh, uh,
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:43.960]   Renee because you know and we mentioned this apple acquired pa risk some years ago. That's a whole chip design company
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:51.960]   Uh, uh, they have thousands of at least a thousand people working on silicon and now they have a lot of chips a 10 m10 s2
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:57.800]   W1 t1 came out since you did this. Um, I think I think that
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.120]   They
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:04.920]   Snuck up on us, but they've really become amazing team a chipped a chip company haven't they?
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:10.680]   It's an amazing team and and they don't have to sell chips and that gives you an enormous amount of freedom because you're not worried about profit
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.840]   Or loss or keeping anything on the shelf and the thing that there's a couple of things that are super exciting about this
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:18.120]   I mean like you can imagine a world where apple became an x86 licensee
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:23.800]   You could also imagine a world where apple was thinking about an ipad pro but also thinking about what would be like if we had a macbook that
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:28.760]   Ren ios and had a touch screen and then tries all these different products and launches them when they think that they're ready
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:34.440]   They can literally do anything they want with all these platforms that they have and some of those won't be great products and we'll never get launched
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.200]   But you're they are absolutely experimenting with all those things. Yeah, very interesting
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.840]   really really uh
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.840]   Kind of exciting if they I
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.720]   Boredom ships their own modems. Maybe we'll have to worry about quilcoma
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:49.800]   All right. Well, I think they're only they want to do that. I would guess they'd want to do that
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:53.720]   And they wanted they wanted to have five k monitors. They made their own timing controller that
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:57.960]   You have to love a company that does that it's not like hp is going. Hey, we want a five k monitor
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:01.480]   Let's make it on timing control. Hey speaking of five k monitors. Let's update that story
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:06.840]   Uh on the monitor that you bought the nice monitor you bought and did not have any trouble with your router
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:14.200]   Uh, I managed to cause the problem. Oh, did you so what I what I realized is that I had enough crap on my desk that there was creating enough
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.640]   Interference not have any problem. Yeah, I just had I had uh
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:23.400]   A certain difference shielding so if I put the router right next to the back of the display, I can get it to turn off
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:28.920]   So lg says yeah, okay. We're gonna put more shielding on these in fact. It's can be retrofitted, right?
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.280]   Yeah, yeah, I don't know what that is. It's like and this is this kills me
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:37.160]   We were looking at samson saying there wasn't enough tape on their batteries and no lg saying there's not enough tape inside their display
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.520]   Is there some huge tape out here? She did rocket raccoon take all the tape
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:44.920]   There's a clear bob and not leave is it so that so if you buy a new lg 5k
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.000]   monitor
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:53.800]   Uh yet the ones manufactured after february will have this at some point. Okay, so we'll have extra shielding and it's unclear yet
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:57.960]   They said it could be retrofitted how they're going to do that. Yeah, do I go to an lg store?
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:03.880]   I'll go to the apple store or do they just send you you know a roll a tin foil and some tape say put it here
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:11.320]   Actually, and uh, I mean if you had if you were able to fix the problem by putting stacking stuff on your crap on your desk
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:16.040]   It shouldn't be too hard. How far away was the router once you removed the shielding?
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.280]   Uh, well now it's a foot away
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:23.080]   But if I put it like on the other side where I had like a computer and a display just it was fine within like a foot and a half away
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:27.800]   Okay, it has to have some opportunity sitting pretty close to the the computer for it to be an issue
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.840]   Yeah, I mean, I'm sure that'll depend on the exact circumstances
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:34.520]   But yeah, that shouldn't have happened like both apple and lg should have caught that that's a dumb thing to ship
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.400]   Well our route is another good at all
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:43.160]   Mine was mine was in a closet across the across the room. So it had no problem
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:49.240]   There was another really interesting update. Um, and that was mac world ran, uh battery tests on the macbook pros
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:52.440]   And uh, they had some surprising results as well
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:57.240]   But what I loved about it is they did it just the way I wished the consumer reports did it was multi-factor
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:03.080]   So they did web tests. They also did video playback tests and a bunch of other tests when they they found another bug
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:10.280]   That I believe has since been fixed, but at least they found another bug that would sometimes cause a process to keep going even if you quit the application
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:16.600]   Which led to um, uh, much better. Sorry much harder. So basically the if the external gpu shut up turned on
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:20.680]   There'd be some cases where it wouldn't turn off and the external gpu always external so the
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:24.600]   Um, screte gpo will always use more power than the intubated gpu
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:28.600]   But they did a bunch of tests and I understood the test they did they explained them
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:33.400]   I knew what the problems was what caused them and they even explained a couple times when they got extraordinary battery life
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:37.000]   And I just thought like everyone who was complaining about us complaining about the tests
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.960]   That was how you do those tests right. So kudos to mac world a couple of more updates apple
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:46.200]   Is now going to build a plant in india to make the iphone?
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:50.200]   This was a deal with the indian government that allowed apple to put stores
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.680]   in india
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:46:00.040]   Uh, benga lauru will have the new iphone, uh, manufacture is it fox con that's going to build the plant or apple?
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:08.120]   I believe it. It's not apple. Okay, because apples manufacturing plant india is agose as forbs
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.400]   But it's really
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:15.080]   Manufacturing apple stuff, but you know fox con built a plant in brazil to do this. So i would assume it's fox con
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.480]   I didn't i didn't even think to check that that's a good idea to look into that
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:23.560]   Apples decision on initial manufacturing and mengaluru has further enhanced the reputation of benga lauru
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:27.320]   as the most preferred destination for foreign investment
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:34.680]   And further validation of the state government policies aimed at fostering manufacturing innovation and investment in carna taka
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.480]   Sound guy going really stuck it to mumbai on this one
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:43.480]   Go ahead india
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.480]   India's really
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:48.920]   There's so much potential india right now. They seem to have a government that
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.680]   Understand
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:53.880]   Excuse me. It's going to be a big market. It's as big as china almost right?
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:59.000]   Yeah, not not just that but also they could be another china in 10 or 15 or 20 years
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.440]   Because they're making all the right moves there for instance
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:08.440]   They they understand the great potential in given given that their own power grid is and i'm kind of in a mess
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:11.000]   The further outside you get outside
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.240]   The further outside you get from a major population and even even in major cities. It's kind of a mess
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:21.000]   This has given them an opportunity to basically create a truly 21st century power grid from the ground up
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:25.800]   And there are no huge power companies that are trying to stop these things from happening
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:30.120]   They're also trying to mobilize its workforce in in productive ways
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.200]   And they're starting to attract
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.680]   They're starting to attract a good a good deal of manufacturing not just for the indian market
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:42.520]   But for a lot of the asian market and there's that will they're doing it in such a way that could scale up to a global marketplace
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:46.360]   So if if i think if definitely
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:51.080]   Foxconn and apple's interest is in making sure that they could develop products that they can sell in india
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:58.520]   Maybe part of their eye is there might be a time when this going to be the place where you want to make the the iphone 23 or the iphone 40
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:02.040]   If they're if we're still making iphones back then the other thing apple really wanted
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.200]   Uh, and i don't know if they got this concession
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:08.600]   Uh, although i think they did was the right to sell refurbed iphones in india
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.760]   Which no one else is allowed to do
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:14.520]   And uh, that would give them the opportunity to do a low cost phone
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.760]   They don't want to make a low cost phone
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:21.160]   But they could sell refurbed iphones to the indian market for under 200 dollars and that would
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:27.240]   Uh, that would give them the you have to have you have to have that or you're not going to be able to sell them
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.240]   You're competing against your dollar phones
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:35.880]   Is actually to think about how they would actually do that though in an official capacity what would be the apple what would be the apple workflow for
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:39.240]   uh taking a trade in phone and turn and
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:43.320]   Absolutely wiping it to make sure that there's no way this could possibly be reconnected
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:50.200]   Uh to uh to any previous data or any previous iCloud data and what would they what would their standards be for
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:54.760]   Designating this as a certified apple refurb uh, and if there's some of them in india
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:59.240]   Why not consider it in other markets where they can't really
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:04.200]   They're having troubles competing with dirt chiefs a 30 dollar Android phone by the way, uh, rene
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:07.800]   It's wistron that will be making the phones wistron had the deal
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:10.280]   Uh to make the phones in uh car
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:17.720]   When they started doing the trade-in program it was because they were looking at reselling those phones in latin america africa and some of the other
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:22.120]   Um, that's what's gonna happen to your trade-in. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, and they do
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:25.960]   I don't think they sell them directly, but I think they sound apple authorized resellers within resell
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:29.960]   Yeah, there were other incidentally, uh, things that uh apple wanted
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:35.240]   We don't know exactly what it got it, but a 15 year tax holiday on imported parts and equipment
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:39.400]   Uh waivers on import duties lots of you know lots of concessions
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:41.480]   So the EU hears about that
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:47.240]   Well and uh or or president trump because of course this is something he would like to see happen as well
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:53.800]   Uh, he's been uh saying that uh since the campaign he wanted apple to bring manufacture back to the united states
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:58.280]   I mean like again like it's gonna be interesting because there are a lot of really powerful emerging markets
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:01.800]   They call him the brick countries bizzill russia india, uh, and china
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:07.640]   Yeah, the last one and all of them are going to want some form of manufacturing and if other countries decide they want it too
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.480]   Like germany wants where about canada?
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:13.560]   Why where's where's where's jason on all this? Why is it? I know right like so what do we
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:17.320]   Reminds me of the newsroom. There's like a hundred there's 203 countries and 103
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:21.320]   Other one iPhones made locally. I mean I just don't know how that scales. I don't know how you do it
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:26.840]   I know so keo the the iphones are pretty high precision device. Can you really assemble one more wearing mittens? I don't know
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.360]   Hey, yeah, who would you like you make an iphone?
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:33.640]   Talking about it
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:37.880]   But it does point out the the uncertainty of a of a change in administration
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:40.600]   I think that apple if nothing else they want to make sure that they have a
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:46.360]   For lack of a better word a disaster plan in place if they are forced to move up certain percentage of their manufacturing
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.720]   To the united states they want to make sure that they have a plan for how to do that
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.760]   Interesting
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:59.160]   It was a really interesting debate going on because apples adjusted for the brexit price differences on the app store
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:03.800]   And I don't think google play had for a while and people were saying it literally cost way more money to buy
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.640]   Like dumb things like poca balls on on the app store than it did on the android store
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.720]   That's gonna change because everyone's gonna normally those prices
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:12.760]   But there's been this out christ saying why can't apple help them?
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:17.000]   Why can't apple stop these price increases and it really seems like something beyond apples control
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   But I don't think the consumer is gonna see it that way
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.720]   Uh
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:26.440]   Did apple have a representative at the meeting of the president's tech advisory committee?
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:29.080]   Not as far as I know. I don't think so
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:31.240]   um
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:34.440]   I'm just seeing if I can find the list of people there were 17
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:40.200]   High-powered executives there the business council so it wasn't just tech. So there was gm
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.040]   Isn't he I think wal-mart
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:44.040]   Bob iger was not there
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:50.360]   He said he had a scheduling conflict. Of course, uh, travis caloneck of se ceo of uber resigned a day prior
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:57.480]   Uh, but I don't see anybody from apple. I don't believe yeah. Yeah. Yeah elan musk was there. We saw him
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:00.360]   come out, um
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:03.560]   You know, tim cook would like a seat at that table tim
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:08.520]   You know has a uh, you know a lot of things he just as he's visiting with india
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.240]   is a lot of things he'd like to get uh
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.880]   Concessions
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:17.560]   It's one of those things that happens when you have financial but not but not social parity
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:23.320]   Right like or interest across over and everyone's going to have to decide and also apple has a long standing history of engagement
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:26.680]   These issues they've often said that they believe that if you're not at the table you can't affect change
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:28.920]   Which is sort of what elan musk's uh
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:32.120]   State of philosophy has been but that might not sit well with all their constituents
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:35.720]   So it's it's it's gonna be an interesting balancing act for a lot of companies for a long time
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:36.040]   mr
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:40.280]   Cook was in paris over the weekend lucky guy and uh, apparently apple
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.800]   apple has secured a lease on a space on the shanzi lee's a the the
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.840]   shopping boulevard in paris
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.000]   uh, and uh
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.320]   Cook said apple's deciding what to do with this space
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:57.080]   Be interesting to see an apple store there. I don't know what else you would do
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.400]   You could do croissant croissant and buggette
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:03.080]   Uh, he said uh france has always had a special place for apple
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:06.920]   It's the best place to discover and chat with all musicians graphic designers
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:12.520]   Designers or photographers who use our products. There's such a creative energy and of course. Yeah great coffee
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:19.160]   Yeah, you didn't say that I did and he tweeted out some pictures of him in a fashion. Yeah at otkoture. Yeah
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:20.840]   um
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.720]   Cook uh reiterated that apple pays more, you know
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:29.000]   It rub with regards to the tax dispute with the ireland and the european commission apple pays more taxes
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:33.160]   Than any company in the world and is not involved in tax evasion in our view the law is clear
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:36.360]   He said we have to pay taxes where we create value
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:40.200]   Also talked about iphone production
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:44.360]   He says the whole world is representative in apple's supply chain
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:49.160]   Discussions often don't take that into account instead focusing on where products are assembled
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:55.000]   He says we have 46 supply 4,600 suppliers in europe and have spent 11 billion dollars
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.560]   on the content
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:59.080]   he also
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:03.000]   once again said apple's interested in augmented reality
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.840]   and
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:09.000]   Artificial intelligence saying ai has become an indispensable makes the iphone
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.560]   Uh, even better
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:15.960]   You have to say that iris and sundar puchai went on that stage at google iyo and talked about ai
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:20.760]   Everyone has decided that if you don't mention it's like the local mobile social was for three or four years ago
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:25.720]   Now you have to be iL machine learning and computer vision or you're you're not trendy. Yeah
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:33.000]   Well because it's it's uh, it's uh apple is particularly vulnerable here because they make money off of selling hardware not software
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:41.800]   The services aren't quite there yet and the more smarts you can put into the software behind your hardware the less important the hardware itself gets
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:46.040]   Uh google just published a paper last week that i was reading this morning
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:52.280]   About because about a ways to they call it this pixel recursive super resolution
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:55.400]   For enhancing images where if there's like a blob
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:55:00.200]   Of pixels that it doesn't know and it looks like there could be something there, but doesn't know what it is
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:07.880]   Uh, this this algorithm compares that blob to millions and millions and millions of blobs is generated from known pictures
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:13.560]   And can statistically say that well in 80 percent of the time a blob that looks like this actually
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:16.840]   Covers up a face that's a corner of a human eye like this
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:19.800]   So we're going to resolve that as something that looks like a face
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:26.840]   It looks like part of a human eye and the before the before image is like an eight by eight grid of just a blob of pixels
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:31.720]   And the after is a human face that when compared to what the actual source
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:36.440]   Image was is actually pretty damn close like surprisingly close to your comp
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:42.760]   So that means that instead of having to pack a phone with all kinds of like new lenses and new new image sensors
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:48.920]   You can just using ai may be fixed that so that you're just packing you're just packing pixels inside there
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:52.040]   So isn't that wild i don't understand how it could even
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:55.400]   Uh, dude is showing the images that google's ai
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:01.480]   Started with them left which it basically looks like a blob and ended up with
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:06.840]   At the other side, uh pretty um, you know, is it accurate? I don't know i'd like to see
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:11.800]   Well, it's not you when you the point of this is it's not that you'd use that to say oh my god
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:16.600]   I thought that was a glory estivon. Uh, it's actually somebody else. It's more like
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:23.080]   Uh, you start off with an image a raw image from let's say a camera sensor that is okay, but not great
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:27.240]   But after being sent up to the cloud and then back down again
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:32.520]   It is um, it is as good as what you would get off of a decent like one incenser pocket camera
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:38.200]   As good as what you get with uh, camera hardware inside the phone that was involves a lot more hardware engineering
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:42.040]   So the only reason why i bring it up is that once again if apple is not saying that we're
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:46.840]   It basically it's a ai is a force multiplier that can negate a lot of their
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.920]   A lot of the ways that they make money
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:53.160]   So if for no other reason they have to say that we're going to get the same advantages that everyone else gets
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:55.560]   And if you can imagine this this wasn't part of the conversation
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:58.760]   But if you can imagine how much of an enhancement that this
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:04.040]   This algorithm can produce on a mid-range kind of okay, but not great camera phone
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:08.040]   Imagine how it could enhance a really great camera phone like what you got me iphone seven
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:09.560]   That's the source that we're talking about. Oh, yeah
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.920]   Absolutely i'm not only a couple with that i think a lot of technologies that had different names a year ago
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:16.680]   Or now all being called ai because it's easier for the market to understand and they like the trendy term
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:18.040]   Right
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.040]   It is a lot like blade runner though
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.040]   Zoom
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:24.040]   Yeah
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.320]   So maybe that isn't so far fitched
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.560]   But it's also like this like Andy said he's been used in photographs
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:30.280]   Apple as far as i know is also using it in silicon like it's gonna
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:35.160]   It's gonna run the entire stack and it's gonna do almost everything and tim cooks talked about it improving battery life already
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:38.920]   On the apple side. They're gonna it's gonna be everywhere. It's not gonna be just interface deep
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:41.240]   We're gonna see it pervasive through our technologies
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:44.360]   Tim also tweeted visited the
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:46.360]   Marseille
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:48.520]   apple store and tweeted in is it looks like
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:51.560]   Renee you'll have to tell me idiomatic french
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:56.120]   Do you think tim did that himself or did he have somebody right for him?
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:58:00.440]   He's got accents in it. So when i usually see accents i think that somebody helped because i don't know how that's hard to
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:04.680]   Yeah, we're like how would you know that it's good off or so complex like you like
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:07.480]   How do you get rid of the new vlogs?
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:10.440]   Do you like all three notes? Ratellentes a creep
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:17.880]   our mouth say our talented talented talented team and more say it's nice the team is equipped in french a keep it keep yeah
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.960]   I really want to salute that one guy who's like pointing at the camera. Hey, hey, i'm tim
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:34.680]   He has uh, yeah, what has he got there? These guys are all wearing a
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:38.920]   Earphones he's an arc. He's an arc
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:41.880]   This guy
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:45.720]   He's never gonna wash that shirt again. It's had tim cooks hand on his shoulder
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:49.640]   Yeah, and this guy and the right looks like he's looking for
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:53.240]   No, where where are the airpods?
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:58.600]   Uh, like what guys distracted the back. Yeah, you know, he's gonna he's gonna regret that
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:02.200]   He's he's saying wait. Wait, are they gonna look at me in this? Oh, how do we want to smile?
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:05.160]   Yeah
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:09.240]   That's kind of fun. All right. Let's take a little break. We'll come back with more mac break
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:13.640]   What are you laughing at mac? No, no, i'm also realizing that
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:19.880]   I would not respect that guy in the beard if he did not crop that way way way way the hell down
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:23.800]   That it just becomes a picture of him and him with with tim's cook on his shoulder
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:28.440]   Tim's gonna shoulder. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I can't even zoom in enough for that
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:31.720]   This is again
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:34.440]   This looks like a job for pixel recursive super resolution
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:39.640]   There it is. There's there's my instagram post. I would totally be doing that
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:44.440]   Scribble out these people
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:52.920]   I showed it a brought to you by the ring video doorbell. Did you see the uh, southern california town where they uh,
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:57.480]   part ring partnered with the police department there to put ring doorbells on
[00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:02.760]   Uh one in tan homes and they reduced crime by nearly half
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:08.440]   Because crooks said we're just gonna bypass that old town. We're not going anywhere near that town
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:12.840]   That's why the ring video doorbell is so exciting. I love it. I mean it's a convenience for me
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:16.680]   Well, I installed our ring. It's gosh. It must have been almost a year ago now
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:20.360]   Uh, it was easy to do that I have the original ring in the kit
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:24.600]   When you open up the box comes with everything you need the drill bit if you need it
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:30.120]   Screwdriver even a level the cable if you want to charge it because you don't need to have a wired doorbell for this
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:33.800]   The ring doorbell has its own lithium ion battery good for a year
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:38.280]   We don't use it because I use it on a wired doorbell. I don't need the battery, but it whoops
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:44.280]   It's great. I have to say because now I have a camera at my front door. I have a microphone at my front door
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:48.200]   I have a uh, uh, uh, uh, speaker in my front door
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:52.120]   So I know when somebody's at the door, but I also can talk to them
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:57.000]   I can see them and even if i'm not home, I can I can okay a little white. This is a white look
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.040]   Kids don't lie, but a little white lie
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:05.080]   If a bad guy comes to your door rings a doorbell say, yeah, what do you want? I'm in the bathroom
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:12.600]   That's a good. That's okay. That's okay. Isn't it a little white lie even if you're not even if you're in marsay visiting the apple store
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:16.680]   Anywhere in the world your phone will go ding dong
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:21.880]   Wall street journal named the ring doorbell the best of ce s for 2017
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:26.600]   I love this ring neighborhoods. You can find out more actually at the website the wilshire park
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.280]   story
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.680]   55 reduction burglaries
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.400]   in six months
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:39.880]   I just I think this is just what a great story you ought to have the ring video doorbell not just for security, but for convenience
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:45.880]   The idea that you'll know when somebody's at your door. I was getting dressed this morning. I heard my my phone went juneen
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.080]   Not because somebody rang the door, but because somebody was at the door
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:53.880]   And uh, and I and I didn't go to the door, but I looked to see who it was. It was okay
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:58.840]   It was a family member, but you know, that's the kind of thing that it's really nice to know
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:04.200]   When uh a couple of days ago when they delivered my june oven it was a big box and I we were we were on vacation
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:09.080]   We were up in the wine country and I saw the guy come and I and I said just leave it there
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:13.080]   Because I think he was gonna take it back. He rang the doorbell the ups guy rang the doorbell
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:15.720]   That usually means and he had his little box out there to sign it
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:19.800]   But he I got him to leave it there. It's awesome ring.com slash
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:24.360]   Mac break take a look if you go there at the ring of security kits
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.360]   That include the ring video doorbell either the original like I have with the battery or the new slim pro model
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:35.560]   Uh, they also have the I love this this what they call the stick up cam
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:38.280]   Which not because you you're gonna
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:45.400]   Commit a robbery because you could stick it up anywhere. It's wireless. It even comes with a solar panel that keeps it charged
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:49.800]   So it can run all day all night. It has night vision 10 AP HD camera
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:55.560]   And just like the other ones a speaker and a microphone so you can hear if somebody's prowling around back
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:59.080]   You could say something to them. You could scare away the neighbor's dog whatever
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:06.120]   Uh, they also have the ring chime that plugs into any electrical port joins the Wi-Fi and rings when your doorbell rings
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:10.280]   That's great for you know, if you've got an area where you can't hear the doorbell like your garage or your shop or
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.200]   You know, you're a studio or whatever somewhere away from the main house
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.480]   You can still hear the doorbell ring and of course my phone rings
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.200]   I love it. Actually, it's
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:24.440]   I I know whenever anybody's at the door now. I get a notification and a ring on all my devices
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:29.000]   The ring video doorbell and the security camera and all of this

[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.440]   Mac break we thank them for their supportive
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:51.000]   Mac break weekly new ad
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.560]   for speaking of night cameras
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.320]   late night
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.320]   with the iphone
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.920]   This is another shot on iphone seven ad and these are these are remarkable
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.800]   Not only as stills but videos
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:07.240]   uh, uh, uh, uh late at night
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:12.120]   And that that really just showed now there's this is pretty remarkable
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:15.800]   Um, is it this good?
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:19.880]   I guess it is must be right. These aren't these are real unretouched
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:23.160]   Yeah, they mean they're selected they chose the ones they like best
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:24.360]   Yeah
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:28.520]   Some of these I mean we talked about this we we saw the still of some of these uh last week
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:31.000]   And uh, we were talking about this
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.560]   With uh, Alex Lindsey like that shot is so hard to do
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:39.000]   a woman, uh, you know in the foreground in the background bright fluorescent lights
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.120]   Hmm
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:45.320]   It's the biggest difference for me with the iphone seven camera, especially the seven plus camera is it's not that the camera itself is any
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.480]   Technological way a leap
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.600]   In terms of just the raw numbers
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:54.040]   But I can get photos that I couldn't get before and I liken it back to when I first took my mark, uh, my 5d mark
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.640]   3 to ww dc
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:59.160]   And I was out at 3 in the morning taking pictures of the lines and it was better than what my eye could see
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:03.320]   And I didn't have that with a camera phone until the iphone seven srenity and I went walking
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:06.200]   across the brooklyn bridge at night, um, and
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:10.680]   We've taken photos that were better than what our eyes were seeing and that to me was a huge leap forward
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.920]   It just meant that I had a better chance of getting the photos
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:15.720]   I wanted in a wider range of circumstances than ever before
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:22.760]   Yeah, whatever you say about these these are obviously selected and they're probably professional or certainly you have a very accomplished photographers
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.640]   But it just shows that you can now with a camera phone
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:31.960]   Take images that it compete in every respect with the best images taken by it. You couldn't take just a year or two ago
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:39.640]   Yeah, yeah, and it's not it's not just how good that camera is it's how good these phone based image enhancement apps are
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:42.280]   Uh, I'm a big I'm such a big fan of snap seed
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:46.200]   uh, but even the even the tools you get an instagram can
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:54.760]   Change the the picture that the camera took into what you remember the scene looking looking like after only like two or three minutes of tweaking
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:59.160]   It really is a golden age great article in roighters speaking of videos
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:03.080]   Uh, we've seen a lot of videos of the new spaceship campus. It's getting close
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:07.800]   A really interesting article on roighters about the design perfection
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:13.080]   Sawed in this new 2.8 million square foot
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:15.800]   uh campus the spaceship
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:22.120]   Uh campus app is that behind the fence? Yeah apple hasn't said how much it's going to cost former project managers estimate five
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:26.760]   billion dollars, uh, tim cooked it not dispute that a few years ago when he was
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:31.160]   Went off that's an amazing a billion allocated for the interior
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.960]   Of the main building alone
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:39.880]   And some really high standards the in house construction team said no vancer pipes
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:43.080]   Could be should be reflected in the glass
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:48.600]   And they don't want anyone to stumble going into an entrance because it might distract an engineer from a brilliant idea
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:53.880]   Special the guidelines for the special wood used throughout the building ran to some 30
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.960]   pages
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:00.600]   Uh tolerances are very high many projects the standard eighth of an inch
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.840]   Apple often demanded far less even for hidden surfaces
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:12.120]   Minute tolerances 13,000 full-time construction jobs over the last few years
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:19.080]   Um, this is a I don't know where they got this uh document, but this is really fascinating too
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:23.880]   This must be why they've been working on internal mapping so much because I still don't know like if you and I were in that building leon
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:26.280]   I was like where are you leo i'm at 13 degrees
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.480]   13
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:29.560]   13 minutes on the clock in the third
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.200]   For
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.200]   How do you find yourself without technology?
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.880]   Yeah, I'm wondering
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:41.960]   I'm wondering if like are there enough people left over from the apple two days that like if there's a if like there's like a
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:46.200]   Burst pipe or something say oh, sorry. We got a we got to fail on track eight sector four
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:49.960]   We're gonna we're gonna have to remap that sector
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:54.040]   Great a bit uh great piece in this writer's article
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:59.080]   Talking about the door handle for conference rooms and offices when apple
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:05.400]   Tapped general contractors hold her construction and root off and sledding to finish the main building in 2015
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:10.840]   One of the first orders of business was finalizing a door handle after months of back and forth
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:17.720]   Construction workers presented their work to a manager from apples in house team who turned the sample over and over in his hands finally
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:20.200]   He said he felt a faint bump
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:27.000]   The construction team double checked the measurements unable to find any imperfections down to the nanometer
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:34.680]   Still apple insisted on another version the construction manager who was so intimately involved with the door handle did not see its completion down to his
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:39.320]   His last day apple was still fiddling with the design after a year and a half of debate
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:47.800]   It's like a and they quote bret davis regional director of the district council 16 union for painters and related crafts
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:54.440]   Uh workers often had to wear gloves to avoid marring the delicate materials. He said it's like a painting. You don't want to touch
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:00.040]   It's definitely going to be something to see and then he must have been thinking of me when he said this last bit
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.760]   If they let you in
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.920]   It's like I don't know anyone working on this building
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:10.040]   But I've I've known people who've worked on other buildings and they say it really is a different mentality than they've ever encountered before like they'll say
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:13.800]   If we do it this way you'll save a bunch of money and apple will just say we don't want to do it that way
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:15.960]   They'll say but you don't understand if we do it this way
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:19.640]   They'll save a lot of money. They say no no no you don't understand that is not our priority here
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:23.480]   And it's just they're completely speaking different languages and they're very flummoxed by apple
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:25.800]   But apple just wants it done the way they want it done. Yeah
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:29.240]   Five once you you know once you're in for five billion dollars
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.120]   That's a billion here
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:37.320]   Does it really does it really matter? They're polishing the concrete on the inside and the outside
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:44.520]   Yeah, it's good. It's going to be fun to see what this place becomes like a year after everyone's moved in
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:47.160]   And maybe some of the some of the engineers are like
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:51.720]   I know this is a beautiful statement in door handle design
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.840]   But I can't open it when I've got my hands full of stuff
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:58.280]   That's why I ripped it out and replaced it with something. I got a true value
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.160]   And kupertino
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:04.520]   This is why I'm propping this door open with a brick
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:08.040]   Get deal with this anymore
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:14.440]   Last week we played the Matthew Roberts video Duncan sibfeld has also been doing
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:18.920]   um video from uh drones of the apple campus
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:24.840]   Um, they're both 4k, which is neat and they just it looks it's but apparently it's very close to being done
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:29.240]   The landscaping is being done and that's that big circle in the middle is a is a uh
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:33.880]   Fountain yeah, and you're fountain and they're installing the rocks
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:38.760]   God, I don't think I'll ever get in there, but I sure would like to see it
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:42.280]   I'll find you swimming in a fountain one day. Yeah naked
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:45.000]   high on roof fees
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.840]   I'm particularly keen to see if they're putting if they're investing any money in art
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.440]   Uh, if they have got if they're hanging out in public spaces. We've seen
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:58.520]   Oh in the 20th century like one of the things that large companies like to do is show off
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.720]   Uh, their taste and their culture by actually commissioning
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:08.440]   Met like jacks and pollock famously did a whole bunch of murals for just simple financial services companies and insurance companies
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:13.320]   Uh, and not only was it good not only was it good for for their rep, but it was also you know a good investment
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:18.200]   So if they were to commission sculpture if they're commissioning things to hang on the wall in public areas
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:22.280]   I really would love that's the art book that I would pay 100 bucks for if they actually wound up doing that
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.160]   You mentioned that the beats
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:29.320]   Uh, ex headphones will be coming the official launch date is now february
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:30.920]   10th, these are
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:34.360]   Also, these are the second headsets after the airpods to use the w1 chip
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.720]   These are a little bit different. They have a wire connecting to the two
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:42.680]   I guess making it a little harder to lose the second small one the larger beats use them almost at launch
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:45.880]   Um, so I didn't know that. Oh, the person. Oh, okay
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:50.600]   So the ones the ones on your head the over the ear ones have used them. Yeah, okay
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:53.080]   Those are the solos
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:56.280]   Yeah, I think they were called the solos. I just double checked that but they were the wireless, uh,
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:02.120]   On ear over ear cans that you put on and these are and then you're famously the airpods were delayed by a month
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:06.120]   And then these were delayed by long longer than a month, but we're getting two extra colors
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.720]   So in that gain, I'm not sure
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:10.600]   I had such trouble with my airpods yesterday
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:15.480]   I was trying to make a phone call and they they dropped the call three times in a row
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:17.480]   You update the firmware on your airpods
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.880]   There's new firmware. Does it do it automatically?
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:26.120]   Uh, it should eventually do it automatically some people were going into the uh, a general about
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:31.000]   Scrolling down to airpods and then seeing what the version was. Oh, all right
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.200]   I'll have to find them
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:39.400]   I'm sure they're kicked them across the i might have I was really frustrated three times. I'm trying to do a call
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:45.400]   This is uh, you know important work call conference call and uh, actually wasn't a company with an individual's kind of embarrassing
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.960]   He's I you know, he started talking and then
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:51.720]   And then I'd have to call back three times
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.040]   Very good. It operated. It just revert back to the phone
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.840]   If revert back to the phone
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:02.280]   But then I couldn't go back to the earpods and then the phone hung at one point. So I went to my ipad mini
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:05.480]   Started using FaceTime audio same thing
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:09.720]   It's probably you know, I'm not saying there's something with it wrong with the earpods, but
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:12.360]   Oh, here's a tweet in German. Thank you
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.240]   Uh
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:15.320]   He speaks every language. Mr. Cook does
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:18.280]   Here's a tweet. I'm not going to attempt this one
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:22.920]   But one does what I'll show I don't know how to say that hundo was a guy by
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:26.360]   Of the park mark work to read this one
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:29.000]   I'm other be sort of appointed me. Yeah
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.760]   Tim's having fun. He's traveling all over the world now doing all sorts of fun things his european tour. Yeah
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:42.360]   It's kind of you know being being an executive of a multinational like apple really is like being the
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.320]   president of the of a country, right you really
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:53.160]   Yeah, here are the German developers. Tim. You're the french developers. Yeah, shake hands put medals on people. I don't know
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:57.320]   Well, it's it's a it's a great way to get troops energized
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:59.240]   Uh, not just for your own troops
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:03.000]   But also if you want to make a deal with somebody you want to have a good work and relationship in the future
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.960]   And you are on the level of tim cook
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:11.480]   You're not just the person that got hired eight months ago after your previous ceo tanked and got kicked out with a 30 million
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.480]   golden parachute
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:16.040]   The idea that you're walking the floor your meaning people
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:21.640]   In five minute and five minute chunks. Everybody who wants to run into the lobby at that point is free to do this
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:26.440]   So at minute number six the people in the black the black polo shirts will like
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:33.800]   We'll push out of the way. Yeah, that's that's just good diplomacy. It's it pays back tenfold. Yeah
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:36.760]   um
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:41.000]   Some more apple iphone news this story coming out of
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:46.200]   the cult of mac looking at a patent trademark filing for apple
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.840]   For using lasers
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:51.160]   You know to polish ceramic
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:57.400]   Phones iphones. I would love a ceramic phone. I would buy a phone just for the ceramic
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:02.040]   Yeah, that was on my mind. I was I was speaking before about some things being trial balloons
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:07.960]   I was wondering if the ceramic apple watch is a trial balloon for let's see what the problems are about
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:11.640]   Using a ceramic case design and manufacturing at at scale
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:16.360]   What's the can we get the reject rate down can figure out exactly what the problems are before we try to sell
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:19.720]   These to a hundred million people a week
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:21.560]   For 10 years
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:26.600]   Because this is exactly the sort of thing that I think that floats apples both the idea of here is an exotic material
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:29.800]   Here is a design that no one can no one can even do
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.280]   They can't just work out the engineering on that
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:38.180]   And then something that will make it look even more and feel more like a premium device that earns every penny of the night
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:41.860]   $100 that people spend for this thing. So that's that's right up apples alley
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:46.340]   I was dreaming about that and then uh, Greg. I know I forgot I pronounced his last name
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:49.220]   You just he's uh, he's the guy who made a bunch of the different accessories
[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:55.220]   He's a product manufacturer through a bunch of cold water when he started to explain how many CNC machines apple has bought
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:58.580]   How many kilns they would have to buy now? Harder process it is to convert
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:03.140]   To a kiln based manufacturing system at iphones scale. So I would love to have that product
[01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:05.140]   But he made a compelling argument for why that's
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:07.780]   So really hard thing to do
[01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:08.980]   Oh
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:10.980]   So they are making
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:13.300]   As you point out the apple sta apple
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.940]   I watch studio
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:18.740]   Uh the $1,200 high end now and replacing the golden
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:23.700]   Uh, out of the addition sorry out of the studio surface out of the
[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:28.660]   White ceramic is very I have it. It's very white. It's beautiful. I'm getting one leo
[01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:31.060]   So are you good my boss my boss had one
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:35.780]   Well, no my boss had one but now he's reverted to being crackberry kevin because there's a new blackberry coming
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:39.540]   So he doesn't want his apple products anymore. So I very quickly did the lucky
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:43.300]   I know I haven't scratched it. It's there's no visible
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:48.740]   Marring on the surface. I'll have to get a little magnifying lens and look at it, but uh, it it's
[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:51.140]   I've had ceramic
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:54.340]   Watches before for years and I love the material
[01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:57.540]   Um, I would be I think it would be a perfect phone material
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:01.700]   But you know it is telling that no one has done this yet and they haven't made a band a ceramic band for yet
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:04.740]   Which would all would be expensive, but also be very nicely. Yeah. Oh, I miss
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:08.100]   I had a german youngins was a german watch
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:12.020]   He's got a ceramic. Yeah, he's got a from a watch too and it has a ceramic band on it
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:16.340]   It's a white one too. It looks beautiful. I don't know what I had it black youngins and I miss it
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:22.740]   The apparently it's really strong. Oh, I never scrap it looked brand new I had for years
[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:29.460]   My it's my all-time favorite watch at a titanium youngins in a black ceramic youngins and I's my favorite watch and I can't remember
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:31.860]   What happened to I think the watch stopped working
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:36.980]   I should I should get that fixed. It was so strong. They couldn't get in to fix it. Yeah, the band went forever
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:39.700]   But the it was like superman when he
[01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:41.940]   He's an operation. Yeah
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:46.980]   Uh, let's see. Oh, I kind of buried the lead here and I'd like to get your thoughts on this one
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:49.780]   This is a story we should probably have led with although
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:53.140]   I don't know like this comes from a medium post will traffic
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:56.500]   76 popular apps confirmed vulnerable
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:59.780]   to silent interception of TLS protected
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:01.700]   data
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:04.020]   It was a super super smart guy. Okay
[01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:10.340]   There's there's a few people who know like as much about iPhone in our workings as people inside apple and he's probably close to being one of them
[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:18.500]   Infosec expert they have a program a web based mobile app analysis service called verify dot lee
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.980]   uh, and
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:22.980]   apparently, uh, you know, I mean
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:29.700]   There there are a lot that's a lot of apps, but it but the real concern is 19 iOS applications
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:32.500]   it's a high risk vulnerability because
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:37.300]   They've confirmed that you can intercept important information
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:45.060]   Financial or medical service login credentials. We end our session authentication tokens for logged in users with a man in the middle attack
[01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:51.700]   Uh normally of course when apps send data you want to use TLS you want to send that data
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:53.700]   secured
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:59.540]   But uh apparently there is a is it a flaw in apples implementation of TLS?
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:04.820]   So just for some background will was I believe he led the chronic jailbreak team back when that was a huge
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:07.220]   You know when when jailbreaking was a very big endeavor
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:11.380]   So he's been doing a lot of the sort of spelunking into the inner workings of iOS for a long time
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:14.980]   And he's been interested in security for a long time so he put together this the sort of scan
[01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:20.260]   So this is really hard to stop because we've seen this problem before that someone makes an app
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:23.780]   And then they get a little bit of code from somebody else and you have no idea what's in that code
[01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:25.700]   And it could be all sorts of bad things buried in there
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:30.020]   It could be a way like a way of getting bad code into iOS apps and this looks like
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:33.060]   Either the company doesn't care or they they're using
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:37.060]   They're linking to code that doesn't care about respecting these things
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:42.820]   And i'm hoping apple will figure out a way of again every time someone these stuff gets through they figure out new ways of auditing it
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:45.620]   But it looks like something that's just not caught automatically
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:48.260]   wheels attack involved
[01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:50.980]   Uh on iOS 10
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:56.180]   Uh inserting a invalid TLS certificate into the connection using a malicious proxy
[01:19:56.180 --> 01:20:00.980]   Something that would be uh not so hard to do at an open Wi-Fi access point or yeah
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:06.020]   Anywhere where you were on Wi-Fi that some that some malefactor could get access to
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:14.420]   Um, he mentions which apps are vulnerable. I won't mention the low risk apps because all they all they give up is you know
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:19.540]   You know, maybe something that you know your log in name or something
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:24.500]   Nothing I believe he's being responsible by alerting the high risk apps before he's public. Okay. Okay. Publishing
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:27.540]   Uh, so he isn't mentioning anything that's medium and high
[01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:31.940]   He's going to post those within 60 to 90 days after reaching out, but it's banks
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:34.500]   medical providers. It's serious
[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:37.300]   Uh serious stuff
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:41.940]   And this is one of the parts of security community that I really like is when you start auditing these things and then you do
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:45.620]   Responsible disclosure just makes all these apps better because mistakes are going to happen
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:53.380]   If they're not doing it done without doing it maliciously, these mistakes will happen and we need people finding them and it's not a flaw in apples app transport security
[01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:59.140]   Uh because they have to trust the app only the application developer
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.380]   Conmitigated
[01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:05.380]   Uh because it's the it's the networking code inside the app
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:10.500]   That is allowing this false TLS certificate
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:14.980]   So app transport security on the iphone will see it as a valid connection
[01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:20.100]   Yeah, and uh, and it can't, you know, it has to let the application judge certificate validity
[01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:24.260]   Like leo, did you lock that door? Uh, yes leo, did you do you lock that door?
[01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:27.620]   I know the lock works on the door. Did you lock the door? Yeah? I swear I locked the door
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:32.580]   So the mitigation for everybody is listening to this if you're using an iphone is to not
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:37.620]   He says there's a short-term trick which can be used to mitigate this type of vulnerability
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:40.740]   It's very likely only to be exploited if your connection is flowing
[01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:48.260]   Over wifi whether you've joined a public wifi network or a determined attacker has forced joined your mobile device
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:52.900]   Onto a rogue network without your knowledge as you know iphone sometimes will join
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:57.620]   Open wifi access points without letting you know if you're in a public location
[01:21:57.620 --> 01:22:01.940]   And you need to perform a sensitive action on your mobile device like opening the bank app
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:05.220]   Uh open settings and turn off wifi
[01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:11.780]   The vulnerability does does exist on a cellular connection, but it's of course much more difficult to
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:17.380]   intercept the cellular connection and that's common advice for people who are even using computers
[01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:20.900]   Uh, not to be on public wifi networks when they're doing sensitive financial transactions
[01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:23.300]   But switch to you know using a cellular hotspot
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:27.620]   You know it's really dangerous to use these open wifi access points for a lot of reasons
[01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:32.900]   I've started using uh, vv uh hardware tiny the tiny hardware firewall vpn in most cases because
[01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:36.660]   It's just it's once you set it up. It's very easy
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:40.900]   And uh, you know, you could size of a little keychain, uh thing
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:44.900]   Um, and you can use it with your phone just as well as your computer
[01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:51.380]   And uh companies you should analyze your builds using the verify dot least service
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:53.380]   Uh
[01:22:53.380 --> 01:23:00.020]   Just make sure you aren't using some of that dangerous code developers be extremely careful when inserting network related code
[01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:03.540]   And changing application behaviors many issues like this arise
[01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:09.060]   From an applique as you said rene from an application developer not fully understanding the code they've borrowed
[01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:13.300]   That's a very widespread practice you take you take libraries or snippets
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:17.140]   You go, you know, you you go to stack overflow say how do you do this?
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:20.020]   And he somebody gives you you know a link and you just paste it in
[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:29.220]   What about the rumor this is uh, this is uh, coming to uh barons tech trader coming from barons tech trader daily
[01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:35.860]   Um, that the iphone will be manufacturing will begin earlier than usual that would make sense given the
[01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:37.700]   shortage
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:42.500]   That apple suffered for the last few quarters or less few at least yeah, especially if it's a new design
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:47.700]   They've they've when you push the bounds of technology whether it's the retina display and the iphone or or it was
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:50.260]   E a chip set some of the h chip sets have done this
[01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:52.180]   It's just hard to make really hard to make things
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:55.780]   So if they can get ahead of that curve it means that they'll have better quantity when they start to ship them
[01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:00.420]   And it also means committing to a feature set earlier than they usually do you be surprised at how
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:04.660]   Relatively late in the process they finally decide that okay. We will definitely include this
[01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:07.060]   We will definitely wait for another time to include that so
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:10.900]   Yeah, one one has to think that they've been kind of working hard
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:15.300]   On the on this 10th anniversary iphone for a little longer than usual
[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:18.660]   It might be a little closer to uh to finalizing it
[01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:24.820]   I still don't know whether they're going to do anything special about it. I'm sure that I'm sure that I do something special about the event
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:28.580]   I think that I'm not sure if they're going to say that we
[01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:34.740]   I'm not sure how we'd go down how they would say how they would say that and believe this time we decided we were really
[01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:37.460]   Going to try hard. You were really going to make you a nice one this time
[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:40.180]   I think that I think that they're more apt to say that no, no
[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:43.300]   This is just the our next level of greatness as usual every year
[01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:47.780]   But i'm sure that there's going to be more dogs and more ponies in the dog and pony show with the september
[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:49.620]   Well and as uh
[01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:51.780]   Robert scoble pointed out on sunday
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:55.460]   Um, this is likely going to be the first event at the new apple campus, right?
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:25:01.620]   So it's 10th anniversary of the iphone new apple campus and that's his one of his arguments
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:07.220]   Uh for why this phone might you know, they might do augment a reality this phone might be clear or whatever
[01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:08.660]   This is going to be a
[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:13.620]   Big time you like the rumors are edge to edge and the wireless charging all the the there's a bunch of big rumors around
[01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:19.620]   He was adamant the wireless charging is possible. I just don't think long range wireless charging is likely at all
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:23.060]   It might not be long range is the dream, but it might just be like you like the problem with the
[01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:28.020]   Uh the inductive charging and I have this with the apple watch is it's so easy to not put it on properly
[01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:32.820]   Or knock it off like i've knocked it off with my comforter at night and not realize it and we'll come up to an uncharged phone
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:38.420]   So if you could just put it down within the vicinity of the charger and if it moved a little bit during the night or you didn't put it
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:42.260]   Perfectly down and it's still charged. I'd be super happy. What do you think the distance recently?
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:47.060]   3 dead mice around it too. Yeah, what do you exactly? They're cooked their breakfast and eat
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:50.340]   I mean bacon there you go perfect perfect
[01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:54.420]   You can finally have your breakfast bacon without getting your foot trapped in a george form and grill
[01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:59.060]   It's just physics. You know, I mean the the the amount of energy attenuates
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:03.780]   At the inverse square of the distance. So it's very distant sensitive
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:08.020]   So uh you'd have if you get a foot away, you know, you have to
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:12.980]   To you know 10 times more energy than you do it half a foot away. So it really gets difficult
[01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:15.860]   To to get
[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:19.460]   My thing with apple is that they again they don't care at all about chip sets
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:23.140]   So like just just to have sort of we like to put a new technology into the interest them
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:24.660]   It's like what problem can they solve?
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:27.700]   They didn't do inductive charging on the apple watch just to do an octave charging
[01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:30.420]   Is that you know like philish alert said people are coming home. They're tired
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:33.220]   They're putting it down and if they don't have to flush with a tiny little cord
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:37.620]   That's way better for them and the problem here is that people sometimes like they have trouble plugging in the cord
[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:39.780]   They don't plug it in right. They don't put on the octave charger, right?
[01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:44.180]   And if they can just make it more convenient three of my time machine with just swap of three inches
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:48.020]   Totally just like time machine like you you don't have to worry about backups
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:52.180]   You don't have to worry about charging put it down here and it will charge and you'll be fine in the morning
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:57.540]   In the case of the watch, I think it was more like they they just found pogo plugs to be vulgar
[01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:01.220]   And they didn't want to have something like we have on the fitness bands
[01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:05.300]   We have to clip it into something to make it work. I really think I was I prefer inductance charging
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:11.140]   Wait, no, no, that's it. It's perfect for for things and realize that there's so many simple ways to solve this
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:15.860]   Like for instance on the I have never had that problem with my uh moto 360 watch
[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:19.380]   Simply because the charger that they give you to it. It's a drop-in charger
[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:22.420]   It's inductive, but you can't put it in in a
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:27.060]   Will not stay in the charger unless it's lined up properly with the charging thing
[01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:29.780]   So it's just as mechanical stand and also
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:37.940]   I think that both the both watches are helped by the fact that when you drop it into the charger the face actually changes physically
[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:42.740]   Observably into like a nightstand sort of mode. So you know you've got it or not
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:48.980]   So it's it's something to do. Do we know what apple if they do wireless charging is they're not going to do you beam?
[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:50.980]   Which is using sonic?
[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:52.340]   charging
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:56.420]   There was a rumor they were using another company for but then it's wish to say they were doing something internal
[01:27:56.420 --> 01:27:59.860]   And if it is something internal though, it's whatever it gives them the desired result
[01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:05.060]   They're not religious about the you beam did have a demo. Although, you know, if all we have is shaky
[01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:08.660]   Cam footage of it. We don't there's a lot of details. We don't know and
[01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:14.900]   You know, maybe maybe they were able to uh, they were the only thing they showed is by hovering
[01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:19.380]   A phone over there and they're not non-inductant. It's a sonic charger
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:26.500]   Uh, maybe six inches from it. They could get the phone to say i'm charging what we don't know is you know, maybe it's charging for eight months
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:32.580]   We don't we don't know what the efficiency is and what the time because you're trading efficiency with a massive amount of efficiency to do this
[01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:40.100]   And of course sounds I think ultrasound would be a I think a little safer than some sort of RF or inductance charging
[01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:43.700]   I'm gonna nuclear magnetic charge in that last about a half life
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:46.100]   Anyway, I
[01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:54.020]   We'll see we have we have what you think september the announcement. Yeah, no reason to take it any sooner than that. Oh, oh
[01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:58.420]   Uh, let's take a break and I'd love to get some pics from you gentlemen
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:01.300]   As we wrap up mac break weekly for the week
[01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:06.900]   It's been a lot of fun rene richie from my more.com Andy and ico from the chicago sun times
[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:10.900]   Our show today brought to you by texture. I love magazines. I still love magazines
[01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:15.060]   What I don't love a pile of magazines on the coffee table the expense
[01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:23.060]   Uh of buying a magazine in the newsstand just because I want to read one article the ridiculous waste of subscribing to a magazine
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:25.300]   That I don't read
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:30.900]   All of that just made me nuts and so as a result, I don't subscribe to magazine anymore and I was so thrilled when texture came along
[01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:33.940]   Texture is kind of like
[01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:38.660]   Netflix for magazines you pay one low monthly rate
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:43.700]   And you get 200 of the top magazines you get the full every page
[01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:51.540]   From sports illustrated consumer reports in new yorker national geographic vanity fair rolling stone vogue i can go on and on and on every page
[01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:56.100]   Of the current issue back issues as well plus bonus features you can't get
[01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:58.900]   Uh on a magazine
[01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:01.940]   Like video and I have to say if you like photography
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:08.580]   The way these like national geographic for instance looks on a on a ipad is so much nicer than the screened
[01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:10.980]   Print version of those photos. It really looks
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:15.700]   Good whether it's artificial intelligence or self-driving cars or wireless electricity
[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:24.260]   All of this is covered by these magazines every tech breakthrough every story from pc world mac world wired magazine
[01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:28.580]   Texture of course makes it easy to find and enjoy the articles you want
[01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:32.660]   Daily recommendations exclusive interactive features videos and more
[01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:37.940]   And I think that the other thing to remember is texture is supporting great journalism
[01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:41.220]   By doing this you are subscribing
[01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:48.980]   You are supporting these magazines without the waste of paper and so far the magazines save money printing a magazines expensive
[01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:56.980]   magazines love this you get some of the most trustworthy credible publications in the world time magazine in New yorker vanity fair the Atlantic
[01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:05.700]   It it texture in these times is a great go-to source to access not just your favorite not just people magazine
[01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:13.540]   But the ladies and greatest and investigative journalism u.s. Politics domestic and international news keep up with the world
[01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:20.340]   At normally 999 a month and you get over 200 magazines and by the way up to five
[01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:26.100]   Devices which means you can share it with your family which is exactly what lisa and I do
[01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:30.180]   And you can favorite magazines have them automatically downloaded
[01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:33.700]   So they're they're on your your iPad when you get on the plane you have to worry about it
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:38.660]   In fact texture was selected as one of apples top 2016 iPad apps good reason too. I love
[01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:40.820]   texture
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:43.380]   Now texture by oh searchable too
[01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:50.740]   Right you can search it you can mark what you like you could check out back issues right now texture is offering a 14 day free trial

[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:09.060]   We and it's one of the reasons I don't have to take anything but my iPad with me these days
[01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:11.060]   I got everything I want on every trip
[01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:18.180]   I've got my audiobooks. I've got my music and I've got all I've got 200 magazines texture dot com slash
[01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:25.460]   Twit and the in our code time for a pick of the week my friend. This isn't this is an upgrade from a previous pick
[01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:27.540]   I previously did a pick of the uh
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:32.740]   Silicon the silicon does hd home run. This is a like this was an 89 dollar box
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:37.780]   You can just plug into any antenna or your cable and then plug into your your ethernet
[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:43.940]   And it will simply serve tv to any app on any platform anywhere on your network
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:48.820]   Uh that can tune in tv broadcast so you can just download an app for your app or tv
[01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:53.940]   An app for your uh for your phone after your app your ipad anything and now you can watch live tv
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:56.980]   If you've got a plex server or other compatible hardware
[01:32:56.980 --> 01:33:01.860]   It will even act as a dvr and record stuff that you can watch it later or transcode it and then
[01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:04.180]   Keep that to your at your video library
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:07.700]   I still like it a lot, but just this week i've created to
[01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:11.620]   uh the next level up which is the hd home run extend
[01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:13.780]   uh, it is
[01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:19.460]   Does the exact same thing the only thing that it does extra that this will automatically
[01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:23.060]   Transcode on the fly to h.264 format
[01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:26.660]   Uh the 89 dollar version of it the the smaller cheaper one
[01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:33.700]   Uh will record will will will stream it in the whatever format the cable company or your your intended delivers
[01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:40.100]   Which is just basic mpeg the problem the only problem with that is that it's uh, it's not a really efficient
[01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:45.300]   Mechanism for streaming also one of the reasons why I wanted to get this in the first
[01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:50.980]   These these two owners in the first place is because I want to be able to record things like the super bowl and have it
[01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:53.620]   Permanently just have it permanently part of part is my library
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:58.980]   I can do that with the cheaper one, but it means that at some point i've got to i've got to uh,
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:03.140]   Tossen into handbrake and convert it to an h.2.64
[01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:06.980]   Just so that it'll be an easy thing for me to copy onto my phones
[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:10.180]   Uh and an easy thing for devices to play
[01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:17.540]   I noticed for instance that my apple tv even my current generation my latest generation apple tv has a problem streaming the
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:19.780]   the captured
[01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:25.060]   Stream directly off of antenna, but this will this box will again just will deliver a signal
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:30.740]   That's just simply h.264 not only that but you can also through configuration tell it like how
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:38.340]   What kind of what kind of stream do you want to convert it from so versus the uh, the the antenna is delivering a
[01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:41.060]   1080p
[01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:45.780]   Broadcast but you can have it automatically transcode it down to let's say 480
[01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:48.900]   If you if you're just capturing it for something you can put on your phone or
[01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:54.980]   It's something that you know that the only reason why you have this is so that while you're traveling you can still watch tv
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:58.420]   That's been recorded the night before you want something that's super compact great
[01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:00.980]   It'll could transcode automatically something super compact
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:06.980]   But that's that's basically what i'm getting it for and you can tell the difference between the two because the the other one is
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:12.820]   I still got plugged in upstairs so I couldn't I didn't bring it down, but it's about half the size and it's made out of plastic
[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:17.060]   This is like this is like big and it's got like venting
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:20.660]   It's got heat dissipation on the sides and back in the sides
[01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:25.780]   So the upshot is that with this not only could will I be able to watch live tv
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:30.420]   But when I play back the uh, my uh, cobear report if it's a great show
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:32.740]   Excuse me the
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:38.820]   Play show with the sevin cold bear if I really really love it. I don't have to then put it into a into a desktop
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:44.100]   Conversion queue. I can just simply say great. Let's save that and it will just simply because of a plex
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:46.980]   I could just simply keep it in my in my library. It's there forever and ever
[01:35:46.980 --> 01:35:53.060]   Uh, it's so it's about a hundred bucks more. There's a hundred and sixty nine dollars versus 79 for the other one
[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:57.620]   Uh, but the other advantage is that now i've got because each of these boxes has two
[01:35:58.180 --> 01:36:06.580]   Independent tuners inside them now I can watch and record for different channels simultaneously or be watching different shows while i'm recording others
[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:14.180]   Uh, so as as you can guess i'm kind of i'm kind of really happy with the way that uh, all these little tv devices have helped me
[01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:16.260]   uh, become sort of a
[01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:19.860]   OCD if it's worth watching it's worth recording got a guy
[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:21.940]   Uh
[01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:26.420]   hd home run a lot of people from silicon dust have been telling me well how great this is
[01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:30.020]   So i'm glad to hear now you got to have over the air signal
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:33.620]   So well, it got if well means you have to be in the united states of america
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:38.900]   But the other great thing about no i'm up here. We veer we you know all I need is channel 50
[01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:44.340]   Well, here's here's the other thing i had a problem i had the same problem where i could
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:48.580]   Obviously the only all the channels i could get were like yet nbc
[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:53.060]   But I vehemently don't like the tonight show i want to watch the cober show
[01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:57.300]   But the great thing about this is that you can put this anywhere so i've got this actually
[01:36:57.300 --> 01:37:04.500]   Way way way upstairs in a guest bedroom. So it's on the second floor and it's also in a window that's facing the broadcasting
[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:12.020]   Broadcasting towers so for the first time i'm actually getting every single network and even all the weird channels like the one that shows
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:14.180]   The reruns of the decavut show
[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:20.180]   I didn't know existed because you can put the you can put your physical antenna wherever it has to be
[01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:22.740]   You don't have to put it like right next to the tv set
[01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:28.340]   So definitely with trying out especially with the first time you're in a situation where i'm i'm in the kitchen
[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:30.580]   I can now have like i can now watch tv
[01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:35.140]   On my on my ipad live without having to
[01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:38.180]   Drag another tv set into another room
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:43.780]   I used to use the the sling box for that the cable of this box you plug into your cable
[01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:50.340]   And it works nice, but it will only work with slings sling box software, which is good on some apps
[01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:55.940]   Some platforms not good on the other this streams in a standard format and there are kinds of third party apps
[01:37:55.940 --> 01:38:00.980]   That will allow you to tune in the signal. So it's not as though it's just going to work on your apple tv
[01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:05.620]   Or it's just going to work on your phone. It worked it literally works on every single device that has a screen so
[01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:08.100]   It was a great value for me. Nice
[01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:10.660]   Renee was it you taught me about french girls
[01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:15.780]   I don't know, but I don't know how to answer that without moving the concept and we have a show title
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:17.940]   I'm trying
[01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:20.740]   I know it was somebody told me about this and I just what I don't know
[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:24.180]   I don't think it was ever a pick on this show might have been on ios today or maybe I just
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:30.900]   It was a fever dream, but this is this is a really great app called french girls, which by the way has the best
[01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:34.260]   App icon ever of a red-headed bearded man
[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:37.460]   So it's not a french girl. It's not a french girl
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:40.980]   But the and in fact it has nothing to do with french girls the idea is
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:44.340]   This is a place for artists to share their art
[01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:49.060]   It's kind of instagram for drawings, but you can also post
[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:55.780]   Draw me like one of your french girls. I get it. Yeah, that's what exactly it's from titanic and I have it
[01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:57.860]   Let me let me uh open it up here
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:01.860]   Um because it's really fun to go through the explore and just see
[01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:08.180]   Now I have no artistic ability so you're not going to see me posting any of my paintings all those
[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:10.820]   You know, I'm looking at the best of right now
[01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:13.860]   I mean there's some of the silly stuff people posted but some of it's really good
[01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:18.580]   And I just thought rene might have told me because you like to play with your iPad and your pencil
[01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:21.940]   I think it's serenity. I think you guys would love this
[01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:24.900]   App it's basically think of it is instagram
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:29.940]   For for drawings. You see it has commenting looks a lot like instagram
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:34.740]   You can heart not a bad man pictures. I got a fixed up. Yeah, well you could put some batman pictures in there
[01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:37.620]   Uh, and also you can uh post your own
[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:43.220]   Uh photo in here and somebody will might if you beg nicely draw it
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:46.100]   Like a draw me like your french girls
[01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:48.740]   So I just think I think this is kind of a fun
[01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:54.660]   It's a free app although they have in-app purchases for a variety of filters and each of them 99 cents
[01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:56.420]   Um
[01:39:56.420 --> 01:40:00.340]   I just I don't know. I'd some I just thought for some reason I thought rene might have
[01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:03.860]   No, but I know I'm upset. Now you got to do it. Now you got to do it
[01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:07.140]   I swear this guy has a twit logo for an eyeball. I don't
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:09.700]   I don't know if that's a coincidence or what
[01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:12.900]   french girls on the uh on the ios
[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:15.700]   platform
[01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:17.620]   Rene, what do you got for us?
[01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:21.940]   So we kind of spoiled it a little bit during the show, but it's it's big news so it's hard to avoid and that is the beat x
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:24.740]   Uh headphones are going to be available starting this friday
[01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:28.980]   A couple things to be aware of they're going to be in more colors and apple has on the page right now
[01:40:28.980 --> 01:40:33.540]   Right now you can pre-order them or you can't put it, but they're they're up there for you to look at pictures of
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:38.100]   In black or uh white, but you'll also be able to get them in gray and a blue color
[01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:41.940]   No, sadly, no product red yet. Although I hope that that comes in their next big promotion
[01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:46.900]   And what's neat about the beat x is they have the same the beats x is that they have the same w1 chip in them
[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:50.740]   Which means they'll get the same easy pairing interface and management that you get from
[01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:55.060]   Things like the air pods or the beats solo, but unlike the air pods first
[01:40:55.060 --> 01:40:56.740]   They're not the apple ear pod shapes
[01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:59.140]   And you know some people just can't wear ear pods either
[01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:03.060]   They don't have sufficient area in their ear to hold them in or they find them painful
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:05.140]   So this is more of a traditional in ear
[01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:09.140]   Experience it's just you have a little buds you stick them in and you're fine
[01:41:09.140 --> 01:41:13.780]   Also, they're connected to each other and one of the big selling features of air pods is that they're not connected
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:15.620]   You don't have to worry about a cable
[01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:17.940]   But some people really like the security of a cable
[01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:20.580]   If the ear pod falls out it just sort of dangles around your neck
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:24.260]   It doesn't fall down into the ground or the snow or the water or something else
[01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:28.900]   So this gives you that sort of long lanyard loop that goes from the left to the right hand side
[01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:34.020]   And it has built-in physical controls, which again, some people lament the lack of on the air pod
[01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:37.380]   So you can control voice you've got a microphone on there you can control the volume
[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:41.620]   Playpause all from the little remote control built into the wire
[01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:44.820]   So they are wireless and that they don't have to be connected to your phone
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:49.300]   But they are wired and that one connects to the other and they get the advantages of the control and
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:52.420]   the security that comes with those so
[01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:56.340]   149 so they're priced relatively the same as the air pods
[01:41:56.340 --> 01:42:00.580]   But I think they're gonna hit a sweet spot for people who like the idea of all this technology
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:05.060]   But really wanted a more traditional sort of bluetooth headphone form factor. Nice
[01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:07.620]   You haven't tried them yet though, right?
[01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:12.020]   I I have tried them, but I do not own a pair nor do I have a pair for review
[01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:13.780]   Are you gonna buy one you think?
[01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:17.620]   Yes, um, I think I'll end up using the air pods more but I just want to try these out
[01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:21.220]   I like to sort of get an internal barometer for these things that people are gonna ask a lot
[01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:23.860]   So I feel like it's my duty to be able to have an answer
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:29.060]   Absolutely, and we should reiterate that the air pods have a firmware update and uh, yes
[01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:32.500]   Check and see if you've got it and if you haven't you should update. What is the current?
[01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:39.620]   Firmware do we know I forget the noise? It's a small chat. Yeah, it's a small number and it should happen overnight if you plug them in
[01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:42.340]   Ah, okay. Yeah, okay
[01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:46.980]   Uh, and I and I maybe wasn't as clear as I ought to have been that french girls
[01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:50.260]   The whole idea behind it is that you get a take a picture
[01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:54.980]   And you and you choose an artist and you and you then pay them to make a drawing for you
[01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:57.540]   So you can you know, so there are a lot of artists on here
[01:42:57.540 --> 01:43:03.380]   Um, and I think that that I haven't done it yet. I've been but I'm gonna pick a nice picture and get a drawing
[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:07.220]   For sure, maybe I'm thinking well, I'm thinking of lisa for valentine's day
[01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:09.380]   Ooh, would that be a nice gift?
[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:14.900]   And they and and they have a good monetization strategy because then you can get canvas prints
[01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:20.500]   Uh from them of the drawing and belated happy anniversary. Yeah. Oh, no
[01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:25.220]   I gave her a nice gift for that birthday and anniversary. So now it's but see it's all comes together
[01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:27.220]   I got a w now a few days for valentine's day
[01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:33.060]   She was she was smart. She clustered. Yeah. No, I know how smart that is next week is valentine's day
[01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:37.620]   And we will be back for maybe I'll get for both of you. I'll get a beautiful pair
