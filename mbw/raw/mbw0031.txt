[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Time for Mac Break Weekly, our regular Tuesday adventure
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   to the land of Mac.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Well, really, with Scott Bornz, really the land of the iPhone.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Hey, that's on Trix.com.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Do you have an iPhone Trix.com up your sleeve, Scott Bornz?
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Actually, it's called the Apple Phone Show.com.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Oh.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Is there something there?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   There is.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   We got a blog going and the first podcast goes up late March.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   I apologize for not knowing about that.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   That's okay.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And why did you call the...
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Because you weren't sure whether the Cisco Apple thing would pan out.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I actually had numerous reasons.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   One is that I looked at the ITV, which became the Apple TV,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   and thought maybe the iPhone will become the Apple Phone.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Secondly, I thought because of the Cisco thing,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   it would help produce confusion.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   And thirdly, it makes it harder for Apple to sue me.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   That laughter...
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   That jolly laughter is Merlin Mann from 43Foldsers.com.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Never been sued by Apple yet.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Oh, man.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Why you got to jinx me?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And the host of TheMurlanShow.com.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   We're going to do five episodes a day, Leo.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   We're going to push out content.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   You've been...
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I'm with Alex Lindsay too much.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   It's true.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I interviewed my desk.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And what we're going to do is we're going to start a podcast
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   based on me talking to my desk.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   We were having a debate, and I'll introduce Alex,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   and then we'll kind of return to that debate
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   about how many podcasts should one put out a week?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Alex Lindsay is here who believes the answer to that is well over 40.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I really think there's a business in them.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   There's a market there.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I like to do one every two minutes.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I'm not really working on Joe.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   He's launching 40 a week.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I think that's where you're off.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   You think I'm joking, but I think you do believe that.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Don't you, Alex, that the more podcasts is better?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Well, I actually think that we really look at podcast lengths
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   and then also the frequency,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   and different depending on how long the podcasts are,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   and whether they're video or audio.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   It seems that people will listen to audio forever.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Video tends to want to be typically less than 10 minutes
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   if you can make it worth it.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Also, the files get really big.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Yeah, but we do think that in one specific area,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   well, it's not even the size of the files.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It really seems to be a sensitivity towards absorbing people's time.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   You know, so they don't --
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Well, that --
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   They like to watch little things and little chunks.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   That's kind of -- and I was being kind of pompous,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   but to Merlin saying,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   "Well, I don't think you should do a young man.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   You should do a wall at once."
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I just -- where that's coming from,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   and I don't know anybody else,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   but where it's coming from is just kind of the sense I get
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   of people being overwhelmed by the number of podcasts.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I think you're absolutely right.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And I think Alex is really onto something, though.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And it's clear to me that -- I mean, gosh,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   you put out an hour -- that last -- that last twit
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   that I was on with you was on --
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   It was an hour and 40 minutes.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Hour and 40 minutes.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And the biggest complaint that people had
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   was it didn't fit on a CD.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Yeah, I hear that once.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   But you know, but I hear that lesson I do before.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   But I guess I'm saying that they --
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   That was the only --
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   -- say --
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   -- say --
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   -- for the love of God, please make it 10 minutes long.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   They were saying -- so for audio, yeah.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And you can listen to it while you're driving or commuting.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And I think you're right, Alex.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I think for video stuff,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   you want to really -- we're trying to keep ours
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   at under definitely under 15 minutes.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Well, we're doing it.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   We're going to do an experiment with this Mac break weekly.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Thanks for joining us, and we'll see you next time.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   So let's talk about the Cisco iPhone controversy.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   They've reached a settlement.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And I am so shocked.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I'm so shocked, Leo.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   You are really -- no, this is probably just a big publicity
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   ploy from both of them to begin with, in my opinion.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   You know, it was bound to happen.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   It's in both companies' best interest.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And, you know, Apple probably didn't care one way or the other.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   They were going to do what they were going to do.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And I think it's --
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   It was a somewhat weak trademark, as we discussed before.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   They hadn't done anything with it for seven years.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Then, right before Apple comes out with the iPhone, they --
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Oh, look, we found something.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And they used it.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And everybody seemed to agree that there was legitimate case for Apple.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   To at least try to fight it.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And it doesn't appear that Apple had to give up much in this deal.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Well, do we know?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Well, I mean, there's different stories.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   The reason --
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   The reason was 25 or 50 billion.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   The main story is that mostly they just had to promise that they would work very hard
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   to create some interoperability with Cisco.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Which is what Cisco wanted all along.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   In fact, that's, according to the Cisco folks, what broke the conversation broke down on that single point.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Hours before the iPhone was announced, jobs walked away from the table.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   That was -- the Cisco guy said that was the only thing that we hadn't agreed to.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   That was the only thing they asked for.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Well, that's why I'm wondering about this 25 to 50 million dollars.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Why would Apple give them any money, especially since they might have had a pretty good trademark case anyway?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   I think it brings certain to it.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   You know, it just closes off the -- it just closes off the issue.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   You say, "Is chicken feed to Apple? Why not pay the money?"
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Yeah, just get it out of the way so you can focus on what you need to do with branding and everything else
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   without having a big cloud over you.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And Scott, you think they didn't pay any penny?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   I don't -- they might have paid some legal costs or something, but I don't think it was that much.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   And frankly, even if it was, like you said, that's -- you know, Steve and I, you know, we share the same couch.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   We both leave change in it.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   So --
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   So the estimate for 25 to 50 is an estimate.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   It's a guess from an analyst at Piper Jeffery.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   I -- I would bet -- I would bet some of that money that it's a lot lower than that.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   And I really don't think it's relevant.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   I think the only thing that Cisco really wanted was the interoperability.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Steve went to do one of his typical negotiations, which is, "Give me everything I want.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   You get nothing, and we'll walk away if we don't get it that way."
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   He walked away, and then he said, "Okay, what the heck? For once in my life I'll give one thing away."
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   He gave him what they wanted.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   But what it was now is a promise.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   It was a promise to try.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Yeah, and we've seen promises like that in the industry before that really never get anywhere at all.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Though I think it's interesting to look at this, though, when you're looking at what's going on there,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   it'd be really interesting to see if we see VoIP on the iPhone, because that's something that right now,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   we've been pretty much told we're not going to see, because Singular would be blocking that.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   That's part of the agreement of not making VoIP available there.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   So it'll be interesting to see if maybe the SOPHENS it up,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   or maybe that's where Apple wanted to go, have a version of an iPhone that is Wi-Fi VoIP enabled.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   That'd be great.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   What did you think, Merlin, about the Apple ad and the Academy Awards show?
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Oh, I thought it was pretty well done.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Everybody at our Oscar party said exactly the same thing at the same time.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I can't believe they got all these clearances.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   That's amazing.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   That's a lot of questions.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Everybody from Lucille Ball to...
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Big Lebowski, the dude.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   The big Lebowski, the dude on the phone.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Hello.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   I thought they showed it twice, I think, right?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Maybe three times.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   We saw last night on regular old TV.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   I really thought there was going to be a final one at the end, right before the best picture,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   where they're all talking the same thing, but it's an iPhone.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   I really thought that's what they would do.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Isn't that the natural next step?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   There's that creepiness of, remember Fred Astaire dancing with the vacuum cleaner?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   That stuff's getting creepy.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   That would have been a cute idea, though.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   I thought it was good.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Again, it's the kind of thing Apple's good at.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   They don't need to tell you a damn thing about the feature set.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   They need to go, "Okay, this is really cool and good looking."
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   You know you want it.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Just blah, blah, blah.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   iPhone.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   It's got more.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   You're greasy.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   I think it's just branding.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   They're just starting the branding machine.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   They're getting it out there that they're doing it.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   It was a cool commercial.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   The only thing I think they could have done better was perhaps hand one to Scorsese to tell him
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   that he won the best director.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Oh, wouldn't that be nice?
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   You got a phone call, Mr. Scorsese.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Here's your iPhone.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   You probably couldn't afford that one.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   It's Evan Costner.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Didn't he beat him for good fellas?
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   He did.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   That still hurts me.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   That is painful.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   It's hard.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   He lost some pretty weird movies.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Merlin, how come I didn't get invited to your Oscar party?
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Oh, you know.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   You don't see...
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   It was a very heavily Wii-based Oscar party.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   You have not expressed an interest in playing Wii before.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Wait, wait.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   You let me know you're interested in Wii.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   You played the Wii game during your Oscar party?
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   It's all about the PVR, right?
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   You're recording it.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   You play about it.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   You have some drinks.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   You play about an hour of Wii.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   That's the best way.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Because it was a four-hour.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.800]   Oh, and these were some hardcore people where we had to get the red carpet and the pre-red
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:47.320]   carpet and with the glamestrator for... did you see that?
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.320]   I did.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.320]   It was painful.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.400]   That must have been on E because I missed that.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.400]   It was all on E. So here's the list.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.000]   This is from Mackerel magazine of the stars.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.940]   Lucille Ball, Jackie Gleason.
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.400]   Although they're not sure if it was from the honeymooners of the Jackie Gleason show.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.400]   Humphrey Bogart.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.400]   I'm going to hum and hum and hum.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.400]   They say Melty's Falcon.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.400]   I'm pretty sure it was from Casablanca.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.400]   Marlin Brando.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.400]   Jerry Lewis.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.400]   Marilyn Monroe.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.400]   And there's a question mark there from some like a hot Clark Gable.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   Peter Sellers, Steve McQueen.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.400]   That's the height of cool, of course.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.400]   Of course.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.400]   Richard Dreyfus from American Graffiti.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.400]   Petty Rubble.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.400]   Remember that from "Flintstones"?
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.400]   Hello, Marty!
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.400]   Robert Redford.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.400]   Michael J. Fox.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.400]   Back to future Harrison Ford.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.400]   John Cusack from High Fidelity.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.400]   Audrey Tattoo from Amalie.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   Kevin Spacey.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.400]   William H. Macy.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   Dustin Hoffman.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.400]   Will Ferrell.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.400]   Sarah Jessica Parker.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.400]   It's 31 clearances.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.400]   Jeff Bridges.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.400]   Billy Crystal Cameron Diaz.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.400]   Samuel L. Jackson.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.400]   John Dravolta.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.400]   Robert De Niro.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.400]   Ben Stiller.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.400]   From Zoolander.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.400]   That was funny.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.400]   And his puffy sweater.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.400]   Michael Douglas.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.400]   And Mr. Incredible.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   From the Incredibles.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.400]   31 clips.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.400]   You guys are always into the dollars and cents stuff.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.400]   What do you think something like that cost?
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.400]   Ballpark.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.400]   I mean, are they dealing mostly with a few studios?
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.400]   Or do you think how do they have a deal like that?
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.400]   That's half a word dead.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.400]   You call a lot of agents.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.400]   They're probably fewer than you think.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.400]   There's only a few, especially the dead ones.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.400]   There's a few agencies that represent many of these people.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.400]   So you might be able to place one call.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.400]   But what figure?
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.400]   A couple hundred grand for some of these more.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   I mean, Kevin Spacey's got to charge you a lot of money, right?
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.400]   Unless he doesn't own the rights to that.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.400]   But I think he must.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.400]   Do you think they've lost your word island people though?
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.400]   And like the first 50 who responded, they dealt with.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.400]   I mean...
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.400]   Well, they paid 1.7 million for the commercial just to put it on the air.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.400]   And they hear this three times.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.400]   So I think that the amount of money they spent for the stars is probably dwarfed by the amount.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.400]   But wait a minute.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.400]   I want to point something out.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.400]   I think they really screwed up on.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.400]   I looked at that list on Macworld's site and I kept reading through it.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.400]   Because the thing flashed by so fast, you missed everybody.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.400]   And there was one really important person who would have been perfect.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.400]   And that was that phone guy.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.400]   Oh yeah.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.400]   And that would have worked if it was Verizon.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.400]   You know, it was...
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.400]   Oh, that phone guy.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.400]   That phone guy.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.400]   He's been thinking of upgrading.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.400]   So...
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:15.400]   There was, if you looked really closely, one appearance of an apple, another apple product in that ad.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.400]   Oh, really?
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:21.400]   Sarah Jessica Parker, when she's on the bed and that's the scene from the Sex and the City, she's on it.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.400]   Oh, she's got her, like her, Palantard.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.400]   It's on the panel.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.400]   You know, there was a very prominent Mac appearance that a lot of people have noted in the last
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.400]   few weeks.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.400]   And did you guys see Children of Men?
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.400]   No.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.400]   Oh gosh.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.400]   You really...
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.400]   I hear it's wonderful.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.400]   I hear it's wonderful.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.400]   You think, Alex?
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.400]   Children of Men?
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.400]   I thought it was an amazing movie.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.400]   That's extraordinary.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.400]   It's really, really well done.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.400]   It would be like that from your point of view.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.400]   But yeah.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.400]   And there's a scene where Michael Caine's character has a 20th anniversary Mac.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.400]   And there's a lot of people who have, like, $10,000.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.400]   But it looked like it belonged in the future, didn't it?
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.400]   That was the kind of vision.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.400]   But no, everybody's been buzzing about that.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.400]   And I think it's poised to become hot again.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.400]   That's the one thing I have to say is Apple, whoever does their...
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.400]   Whoever works at Apple and product placement, you know, with those computers is...
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.400]   should really be...
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.400]   It paid a lot.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.400]   Because man, it is just everywhere.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.400]   I just saw one the other day in a movie.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.400]   What was it?
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.400]   Oh, well.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.400]   You see them all the time.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.400]   Of course, Sony has a...
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.400]   Never in a Sony movie, of course.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.400]   But what's interesting is you can always tell whether they...
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.400]   Because there's a lot of people that are using them.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.400]   And you'll see these laptops that just are all pure silver.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.400]   And they actually either put a sticker over it or they literally wrote it.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.400]   If Apple hasn't, you know, paid the...
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.400]   No, no.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.400]   Paid the freight.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.400]   And made that possible.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.400]   But overall, they do really, really well.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.400]   You'll watch something like 24 and you'll see that certain people have...
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.400]   The certain cool people have Macs and then other people have PCs.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.400]   And they really kind of...
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.400]   There's this whole separation that goes on there.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.400]   On loss.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.400]   They have the only command line I've ever seen in Palatino, which I think is a clue.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.400]   [laughter]
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.400]   Nerd!
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.400]   Nerd!
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.400]   [laughter]
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.400]   Apple TV delayed till March.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.400]   I got the email last night from Apple.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.400]   I'm bummed.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.400]   You said...
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.400]   You got the email from Apple?
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   Well, because I pre-ordered it.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.400]   So Apple said, "Hey, I'm sorry."
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.400]   I was like, "Hey, tell me they give Leo up to the day reports."
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.400]   You have to pay the report.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.400]   You have to pay the report.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.400]   You have to pay $300 for the privilege of getting that Apple email.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.400]   It says, "To our valued Apple customer, thank you for ordering the new Apple TV and easy
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:30.400]   to use and fun way to wirelessly play all your favorite iTunes content from your Mac to your
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.400]   PC on your widescreen TV."
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.400]   Wrapping up Apple TVs, taking a few weeks longer than we projected.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.400]   And we now expect to begin shipments in mid-March, not in February as originally anticipated.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.400]   I was predicting would be this...
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.400]   We all were because this is it.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.400]   Last few days they could...
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   It funny me last week Alex when I was saying Leo should try and get one of these.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.400]   They said February and you really thought February was going to happen.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.400]   We believe in saying so.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.400]   We believe in people.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.400]   They're pretty good at their dates, aren't they?
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.400]   I mean, they're not a company that...
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.400]   I guess.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.400]   Well, when they...
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.400]   We know when they give a date certain, it's one thing to say like some kind of mushy, you
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.400]   know, annual date.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.400]   But when they give like a monthly date, aren't they pretty good at hitting that?
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.400]   You think they're going to hit the first half of 2007 date?
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.400]   Or what was it?
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.400]   First quarter?
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.400]   2007 date for Leopard?
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.400]   For Leopard?
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.400]   First quarter?
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.400]   I think it's first half.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   I don't think they say first half.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.400]   They say first half.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.400]   I'm pretty sure first half.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.400]   WWDC.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.400]   Yeah, I'm respecting the C.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.400]   WWDC.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.400]   WWDC has become the little...
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.400]   Everything.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.400]   Notional treasure test where we all put all of our hopes in Germany.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.400]   Yes.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.400]   There's going to be that subcompact.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.400]   There's going to be...
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.400]   I know I'm going to get my Octo, Mac Pro.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.400]   I think the Octo is more likely to come out at NAB in April.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:53.680]   It may take longer, but it would build up on typically Apple shows off some of the Pro
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.400]   apps at NABs, the Final Cut Pro Studio.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:04.400]   If they wanted to show any kind of acceleration, that would be a good time to do it.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:10.400]   That's the group that it makes the most difference for our Pro graphics professionals.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.400]   I'm hoping that we're going to see it a little earlier.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.400]   I just want to watch that handbrake gray bar go really, really fast.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.400]   Now, are you still using handbrake?
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.400]   You know, there's a fork.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.400]   It's called Media Fork of Handbrake.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.400]   I think they fork back.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.400]   They fork it back?
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.400]   I think they worked it out.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.400]   They worked it out.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.400]   They're no longer fork.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.400]   Well, if you go to handbrake, he actually promotes Media Fork because I was ripping some
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   movies yesterday to put on a device.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.400]   Those home movies he made and put on DVD.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.400]   Yes.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.400]   You like those.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.400]   Yeah, of course.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.400]   Oh, I love those.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:47.400]   I would never put the departed on an Arcos device and never, ever do that.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.400]   To a leaf, to no.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.400]   So when you go to handbrake, it promotes Media Fork.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.400]   I guess it's fork back.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.400]   Anyway, they're happy about it.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.400]   You guys play with visual hub at all.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.400]   It's kind of the big brother of ice-squint.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.400]   No.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.200]   It's, you know, you got these, there's all these, boy, a little bit of rut hole, but it's
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   actually kind of good.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.400]   You know, there's all these apps out there for, you know, doing things with your movies.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.400]   I'm changing them in different formats.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.000]   And some of them like FF, you guys, you guys, Alex, you guys, like Ben uses FFmpeg.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.400]   You guys are really into that, right, for command line.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.160]   And you know, the X version that the GUI, that's pretty nice.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.120]   It's got a huge amount of flexibility, but it's a little bit more bit twiddly than most
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.120]   people want.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.760]   Visual hub is kind of the grown up version of ice-squint.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.320]   Ice-squint turns whatever you want into an iPod movie.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.320]   This turns whatever into whatever through like a super easy, very Mac-like interface.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.400]   And I've been using it for the Merlin Show to make stuff.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   And it's terrific.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.400]   You can make flash out of it.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.440]   It's like one-click conversion for stuff.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.640]   That's actually what we use it for.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.040]   And you can do stuff like really cool stuff, like say, if you want to burn a DVD, say,
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:51.160]   "Stitch all these AVIs into one movie," assuming you get movies in the AVI format, you can
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.920]   stitch them all together onto a DVD.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.080]   It's a really nice visual hub.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.680]   Yeah, that's actually the format we use.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.240]   We have a couple clients that we do work and they want stuff in Flash.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.560]   And I really don't know anything about re-enrenew to Flash and don't have a lot of tools.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.040]   Flash files can be really big.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.040]   I had no idea.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.040]   I ripped something to Flash today.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.520]   It was larger than the source file.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.520]   That's the issue.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.400]   That's the problem that we have.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.040]   We want the quality that's as good as H.264.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.600]   It has to be significantly larger than H.264.
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.480]   But you have so much more about this stuff than I ever wanted to know.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.000]   Hey, if we're going to talk about this, let's not forget, "Hey, watch."
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.320]   You guys ever use "Hey, watch?"
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.560]   No, what is it?
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.840]   Heywatch.com, H-E-Y-W-A-T-C-H.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:37.000]   You can go there with any video format and convert it to pretty much anything else.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   You can use it for free.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   That's good to know.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.280]   You can use stuff for free.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.280]   Oh, that's good to know.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.280]   Yeah, I saw that.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.280]   That's very cool.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:50.120]   Yeah, and it can't be longer than 10 minutes.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.960]   If it's free in 25 minutes, if you're using the paid version.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.800]   I could see this being really useful.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.200]   Because it's web-based.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.200]   So it's very straightforward.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.200]   Yeah, you don't have to do anything.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.200]   You just go to the website.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.200]   I use it all the time.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.760]   There's a website that I saw, and of course, I don't remember the URL, that would do that
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.520]   for file formats too, for free.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.520]   It was really cool.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.520]   There's a couple of these floating around out there.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.800]   So this whole video conversion thing is starting to--
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.800]   So you upload it?
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.600]   And then it crosses for you?
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.160]   That's it forever.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.600]   It's not speedy.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:25.440]   But you can do something else like listen to Macbreak Weekly while you're doing it.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.800]   It depends on how big the file is, I guess.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:32.280]   I mean, we have a lot of even our little shows, the raw format that we begin with starts out
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.000]   at a gig.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   So it would be uploading that as a--
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Subject for future Radhole.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   I'd like to talk about X-Grid.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   I just want to put a stake in the round.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   I want to talk about X-Grid and what you can-- whether that's something that I should look
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   into.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.840]   We might be getting these Radholes quick because I don't see a whole lot of Mac news to talk
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:49.840]   about.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.840]   I mean, there's the Cisco thing.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.880]   We didn't really say anything about ApplePete TV being delayed.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.880]   Do we care?
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.880]   Is it OK?
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.880]   I mean, what are you going to do?
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.880]   You've got to live with it, right?
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.880]   It's going to be solid.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.680]   I'm quite happy to have it come out a little later.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.680]   The system you have to--
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.680]   Home rate, I'm sorry.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.680]   Go ahead, Alex.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.680]   The only thing that I think is going to be interesting is that I don't know if you saw
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.680]   the U-verse.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.280]   This is something we're going to talk a lot about on this week in media this week.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.600]   But U-verse, which is what AT&T is putting out, is an IPTV solution.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.920]   And I think that what we're seeing is that there's going to be this collision of a lot
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:21.920]   of different vendors.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.800]   And we've talked about this a little bit in the past of really going head to head.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.960]   Oh, there's no question about it.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.360]   With getting this on demand kind of TV experience.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:33.540]   When you see all of these companies turning their back on YouTube starting with Viacom.
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.560]   Now, CBS, it's clear that everybody wants to do their own thing or find a different--
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.560]   So you're going to have each network with a different company.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.640]   It's going to be a consumer nightmare.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:48.400]   I'd really prefer the Apple model where if you just, you know, buck 99, you know, just
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.080]   put your shows up there.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.720]   Let Apple sell them.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   I hate to see them.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.760]   I hate to think that NBC is going to have their site.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.560]   CBS is going to have their site.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.560]   Oh, yay, yay.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.600]   And they're each going to have their own Squirly DRM problem that you're going to have to
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.600]   deal with.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:07.120]   Yeah, that's the last thing I want to do is have an AT&T IPTV site.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.120]   Well, it's not a site.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.800]   It's literally going to be just a service to subscribe, run on your TV.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.800]   You're watching the cable.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.200]   Here's the thing that's interesting about the AT&T thing is you'll have a regular cable
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.160]   subscription of 30 channels or 50 channels or whatever.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:24.680]   But then you'll also have custom stuff that they're working on, custom content that they're
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:29.160]   working on to kind of augment that, you know, I think that's a lot of the value added there.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.400]   You know, they're kind of working on.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.800]   Well, and that Amazon has that deal with Tivo.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:39.200]   So if you've got a Tivo, you can download movies from Amazon's unbox or inbox or outbox
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   or whatever the heck they call it.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.880]   That's, that's, I think, everybody's going to be doing this and it's going to be a hundred
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.880]   different ways to do it.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.880]   And that's going to be very confusing for consumers.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.120]   This is what API is the API is the singularity.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.840]   You know, I mean, it's, you know, it's so crazy.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.480]   But these companies don't want API is it breaks the DRM.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.880]   Well, you know, go, go ask 1997 if they want their business model back.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.440]   This is the one after all allow mashups.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.440]   You're going to have to make it easy.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.000]   And you know what thing is having an API key.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.800]   So you could make it so that you could have all this stuff and have it interact through
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.040]   other sites.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.680]   And I mean, God, think about the affiliate models that you could build on that.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.080]   There's just a million things that you could do.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.840]   But this whole idea of having to go and plug my cord into this one site to go get this
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:17.840]   one thing.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:18.840]   It's so annoying.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.880]   Unless you're somebody like, like, I stock photo or somebody who's got like enough of,
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.400]   you know, if you've got, if your iTunes and you've got that kind of a collection, well,
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.480]   then you can, you can pull something like that off.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.360]   Well, I think we thought Google was going to do it.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.400]   I thought, I think everybody agreed, Hey, YouTube is in a big IP TV play and Google's
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.400]   going to do it.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.800]   They're going to make deals with all the networks.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.600]   And I think the networks are saying right now, we don't want an API.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.040]   We don't want a single site.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.040]   We don't like it.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.040]   We're afraid you're going to steal from us.
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.600]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.600]   They don't get it.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.600]   I think.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.400]   And a YouTube, the other problem with YouTube as somebody who's been fiddling around with
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.240]   video podcasting is that it's.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.680]   YouTube, from what I can gather, does not represent the best version of almost anything
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.680]   that does.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.680]   No, no.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:59.680]   You can roll your own.
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.040]   There's a guy out there, the guy, there's a guy out there who has a Creative Commons
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.160]   license flash player that you can get.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.880]   So you basically just rip your own flash files and make your own player and anybody can go
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.880]   out and do this.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.800]   You paid it's got like a $20 licensing fee and you can go out and use this thing.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:17.000]   So I mean, it's not like YouTube has, you know, any special ownership of the whole idea of
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.560]   taking your video to go in a, in bed code.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.360]   And if you're a blogger, stuff like BlipTV is doing it so much better.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.360]   I mean, they need to figure out who they're trying to serve us and then provide the tools
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.640]   for them, you know, that are going to, you know, match what people need.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.320]   Isn't it this place where we're supposed to play a certain kind of jingle?
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.600]   We could play the rat hole boys.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:38.800]   You see somebody's actually taken, taken the song out at the end of the show last week
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.000]   and, and said, I saw that.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.920]   Named us the rat hole boys and they've got an MP3 up on the, on the site.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.120]   Maybe we should do tour.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.080]   I would say somebody actually said that this week.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.840]   They said, you guys should take this show on the road.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.520]   We could have been like thin Lizzie or something.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.920]   Can we get like a really big tour bus and I would totally do it.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.800]   I just want Stonehenge on the stage.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:06.680]   Well, I was sitting down the other day.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.280]   I bought one hand by a phone.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.680]   Everybody's fine except that singer.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.200]   They've got to lose that singer.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:12.960]   No, it's perfect.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.960]   It's a talking blues song.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.040]   You're, you're selling Woody Guthrie.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:15.960]   It's awesome.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:20.760]   Somebody, somebody thought there was a Jawshard, Jusehar, Bajawharp in there.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.760]   What, but I don't think there was.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:22.760]   I think that's the didgeridoo.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:23.760]   I think that's the didgeridoo.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.760]   I think that's the didgeridoo.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.760]   I need to, I need to refrep my guitar.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.760]   It might just be buzz.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.760]   So, wang on, wang on, wang on.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.360]   The rat hole boys.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.360]   I like it.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:39.280]   Hey, speaking of rat holes, musicians and Macs, we should probably get Michael Jackson to
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.280]   sing it for us.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.280]   Why?
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.040]   Well, because first of all, he's a big Mac user.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.040]   Yes.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.240]   And second and second of all, you know what this day is?
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:53.280]   This is the anniversary of his first Grammy win back in 1980 back when he had his first
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.280]   nose.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.280]   Wow.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.000]   That when he was black, you mean?
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   27 years ago.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.200]   Instead of being, instead of a white woman.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.200]   Before you call me.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.200]   Back I should call it a letter.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:10.120]   I'm sorry I said that.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.600]   You can leave my nose joke though.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.320]   That was okay.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.320]   That record is so good.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.400]   That off the wall record still sounds so good.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.200]   Is that was at the record you won the Grammy for?
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.200]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   It's just solids pack of kids.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.200]   Oh, I love his music.
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.200]   You know, that's not too hard on the guy.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.200]   He's obviously got some issues.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.680]   No, no, he clearly does.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.560]   And he's a great guy and a wonderful person and wonderful human.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.560]   And a heavy Mac user.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.320]   And Andy uses a Mac.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.320]   So we'll forgive.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.320]   How did you guys hear that?
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.320]   How did you guys learn that he's a Mac user?
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.320]   Where'd you hear that?
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.680]   I was back from Scott Warren.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.680]   I was back.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.840]   I was a woman from Scott.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:43.960]   I was backstage at one of his concerts and there were Macs everywhere back in the day.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.760]   You were backstage at a Michael Jackson concert.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.160]   What did you have to do to get back there?
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.160]   I was actually working for a radio station doing an interview.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.160]   Thank you.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.240]   You interviewed Michael Jackson?
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.800]   Actually no.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.640]   I interviewed Tito.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.640]   Tito.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.280]   Tito is the front man.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.920]   He's got details.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:08.000]   Tito is the one who gets to do the all the interviews with the DJs.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.320]   Was Tito the bass player?
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.680]   Was that Marlon?
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.680]   I have no idea.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.680]   I play this only.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.680]   Actually, you know what?
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.680]   I'm looking at it now.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.680]   I think it's actually old.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.160]   I'm just not with it.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.600]   This was from 1991 when he was a Pepsi commercial.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.600]   He's still a spokesman for Pepsi.
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.200]   You want me to play it?
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.200]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.040]   No, I don't want any for the rat hole.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.040]   The rat hole.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.040]   Oh yeah.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.520]   I don't have a rat hole queued up.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.120]   You should just keep your finger on that rat hole button when we're on the mic here, Leo.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.120]   I'm going to get that.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.120]   Where's my rat hole?
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.560]   In fact, you can create an entire bed of nothing but rat hole music and then just edit out the
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.880]   few pieces where we don't need it.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.880]   Rat hole.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.760]   Good times.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.080]   Have you recorded any of the other bits that we asked?
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.720]   No, I got busy this week and I did and I have a running list.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.040]   I shared the stick it with you guys where I have a running list and you can add items.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.040]   I think we've got iPhone.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.640]   I don't know if we really want to go overboard on these.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.120]   I'm telling you, man, we could be a morning zoo.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.220]   We could start making really...
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.560]   Yeah, I mean, I've got the offensive comments.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.640]   You've got the excellent voice.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.440]   I was the offensive comment guy.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.120]   I was listening on our last show and it sounded exactly like a morning zoo, but a morning
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.840]   zoo with no point, right?
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.640]   It was like, oh, there's such a thing as a morning zoo with a point?
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.880]   Well, I mean, just, you know, we were talking about Mac stuff.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.280]   You don't hear a lot of morning zoos all about the Mac.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.520]   There were even money on the table.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.520]   I've got to.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.520]   There's a...
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.520]   Yeah, for...
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.480]   I actually had a 5%.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:44.200]   I have a friend who suggested that if we were not to discuss Macs and just to do our
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:49.360]   show as a regular morning show team, we could get hired at pretty much any big radio station
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.360]   we wanted.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.360]   So if we need a second job, there you go.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.280]   Your friend needs more medicine.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.200]   Pretty much any radio station in the world would hire us to talk about the Mac.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.600]   Well, they'll hire you at least, Leo.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.080]   Some of them were getting there.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.080]   Ten of them would.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.080]   How's that going?
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.040]   I think we were launched with 11.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.640]   I don't know how many it is now.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.120]   So you launched with 11, you're doing it.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.120]   You don't lose it one a week?
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.120]   That's pretty good.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.120]   You still got a few good weeks in, you know.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:22.480]   I got Sacramento, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver, Tampa, Houston, San Antonio.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.880]   Where are you in San Francisco?
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.880]   KGO.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.880]   810.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:26.880]   The AM dial.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.680]   So, now we're doing all right.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.680]   It's doing okay.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.240]   You know, we'll see.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.240]   Got spots.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.480]   But are you wanting Gotebo, Oklahoma, Leo?
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.640]   No, but Eau Claire, Wisconsin.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.640]   That's close.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.640]   Is that near enough?
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.640]   That's as close as I'm.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:44.160]   It starts with it starts with, oh, Gotebo.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.360]   Any other Mac news, any Mac news at all, please, I beg of you.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.560]   Have you seen this thing about display eater?
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.000]   Well, I saw the link.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.040]   I haven't gone to it.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.040]   What is it?
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.040]   Don't touch it.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.200]   It's a trap.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.720]   So there's this thing kind of building up and I'm trying.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.600]   I've been trying to kind of get all the information, but it's basically a coder.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:11.960]   You know, working on this thing called displayed, which is kind of like snaps pro or evidently
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.960]   like snaps.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.960]   I'm afraid I even touching it.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.840]   So, you know, it's or I show you.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:21.280]   And but evidently it has this thing that if you pirated it, if you put in the wrong serial
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.120]   number or whatever, the rumor was is that it actually delete your home file.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.680]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:32.080]   Is it a rumor or did it actually do that because there's a big difference between doing
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.400]   that and somebody saying you do that?
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.320]   Well, you know, it's I'm looking at the lines for you.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.720]   Well, the guy used to have an explanation on his home page and he took it down.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.720]   I know.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.000]   I think it I think it rm'd your home home directory.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.080]   I believe that's what it did.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.840]   So what happened was I'm doing this from memory because he told a jail for that.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:55.240]   He had a there were apparently I think there were if he wants to fact check me on this later,
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.240]   I'll accept it.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.760]   But I think there were two rogue codes out there.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.600]   And basically, if somebody with one of those codes ran it and they would run into trouble
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.160]   and he was just he obviously was afraid of screwing it up.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:11.040]   And so basically he decided to open sources app and he's released it reverse code.com.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.040]   Interesting.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.040]   Interesting.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.040]   That's pretty scary.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:17.400]   Anybody who puts the letters R and M together and I just start getting the heebie GVs.
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:21.800]   Oh, I just have to say, you know, that's that's going to get really big guys coming
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.400]   to your house very upset about the stuff that they lost.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.600]   Well, he did the right thing, which he made it free.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.840]   He basically said, I'm sorry.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.840]   That wasn't the right thing to do.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.840]   Bad move.
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:31.840]   Bad move.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.680]   How's this for cross promotion?
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:38.960]   So Jeff Veen, who actually is my happy interview subject today on the Merleland show, has a
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.360]   wonderful anecdote on his site.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.080]   He says, I was waiting for a friend in the lobby of the Hilton in Union Square.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.720]   Nimi was a middle-aged woman speaking loudly into a payphone.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.640]   Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.640]   You got it.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.800]   Now here's what I want you to type.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:49.800]   R M.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.800]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.360]   The letter R, the letter M together.
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.360]   Now type a dash.
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.360]   Yeah, like a hyphen.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.360]   Okay.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.360]   Then another R.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.360]   Then R M space hyphen R.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.360]   Okay, you got it.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.360]   Then a space and a star.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.360]   Shift A.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.360]   Back to me.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.680]   Okay, here return and tell me what happens.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.680]   Okay, thank you.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.680]   Goodbye.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.680]   And Jeff says, she hung up and walked away while the command line geek inside of me stood
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.280]   paralyzed with fear.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.280]   Oh my God.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.280]   That's very funny.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.720]   You know, I think Merlin, you should just go around and pay phone, random pay phone.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.360]   And just do that.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.800]   I just imagine that seems like a very maximum sit-out moment.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.880]   I just imagine someone executing remote.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.880]   Oh my God.
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.080]   I think that's a phone guy.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.080]   That's a phone guy.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.080]   It is.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.080]   That's not a bad idea actually.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.200]   Now, do we have a pay phone version of the phone guy, Merlin?
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.440]   Find a pay phone first.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.440]   Are there pay phones anymore?
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.440]   Not often.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.280]   There's there are very hard to find.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.280]   Wouldn't you be.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.120]   He uses his wallet as his cell phone.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.280]   Perhaps he could use an old shoe box as a pay phone.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.280]   You know, Scott, I like the way you're thinking, we're going to extend this brand.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.920]   You and I need to drill down on this.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.640]   Really just kind of net net figure out what we're going to do.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.640]   Really.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.640]   All right.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.080]   Hey, speaking of changing some news items in here.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.080]   Put some news in.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.080]   Yes.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.320]   Not that I would ever in my entire adult or even child like life use this product, but
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.720]   parallels has done an update.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.720]   Another one?
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.720]   Yeah, go Scott.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.720]   You do.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:16.080]   USB 2.0 functionality, built-in eyesight stuff.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.920]   In other words, you can actually start to make it work like a Mac.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:21.920]   No, it's good.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.120]   They get, their parallel is amazing.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.600]   I did download that one.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.320]   It's 31.70, which came out the day after Valentine's Day.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.320]   Plus, I've got a new one since then.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:34.520]   Well, I, you know, they've done, this, this, it's getting, this is the newest version,
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.720]   which is still in beta, but it's really getting good.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.720]   Very rocks.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.520]   They sent me a press release and I was just, you know, trying to create some actual.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.520]   Let me check.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:42.520]   Let me check for an update.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.520]   See if there's a new one.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.520]   Thank you, Scott.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.520]   Are you, are you, are you going to get these updates?
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.520]   Yeah, I bought it.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.760]   But in order to get these updates, you actually can't go to the parallel page.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.600]   Parallel's page doesn't advertise the beta yet anyway.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.160]   You go to the forums and the links are there in the parallels.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:03.480]   Do you buy the Microsoft argument about why the upper level of the VISTA are required?
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.480]   No, it's, it's.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.480]   The stuff in CNN.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.240]   What was their argument about?
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.320]   That you, that security issue.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.320]   Yeah, right.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:15.280]   They, this is, this is what their argument was and this is on cnad.com.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:21.600]   That the least expensive versions would work, will work with virtualization, but Microsoft
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:25.600]   wants to restrict it because of new security holes spawned by the technology, which is
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:33.320]   connected to specifically Intel and AMD, AMD have built virtualization friendly hooks
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.880]   directly into the microprocessors.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.480]   The goal is to make virtualization work better, but would gale.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:44.240]   Yeah, it would, they said that it has created a security flaw, essentially that malicious
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:48.040]   programs can run undetected alongside an operating system.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.400]   And they're really concerned about that.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:54.240]   And their argument is that folks with upper end will be people who will be able to deal
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.240]   with it.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.240]   Okay, that's utterly bogus.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.440]   I'll just say that right now.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.360]   Blue pill, nobody can deal with blue pill.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.760]   Very tricky.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.560]   It was a demonstration of, we talk about insecurity now, demonstration.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.560]   What is blue pill?
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.360]   What shape are these blue pill?
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.560]   There's blue pill and there's red pill actually.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.640]   They, and you've got to take the right pill.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.560]   Make sure you take the right pill.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.640]   It, the, the, what it does, it takes advantage of something called a hypervisor mode, which
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.640]   is.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:21.640]   Is it a virus?
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.640]   Is it what it is?
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.640]   Yeah, effectively.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.640]   And it's, it's an exploit.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.760]   A researcher created it.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.520]   It is not in the wild.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.240]   It's probably fairly difficult thing to do.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.880]   The theory is, join a root causka created it.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:39.080]   And the theory is that by using hypervisor mode, you can effectively put the entire operating
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.080]   system in hypervisor mode and run underneath that.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.720]   And there's no way the operating system can detect the fact that it's in virtualization
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.200]   mode and that you're controlling everything.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:52.280]   In other words, you turn, and this would work on Unix, Mac, Windows.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.280]   Is that different?
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.640]   How's that different from root access?
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:57.200]   Well, what happens is it's invisible.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.200]   It's basically a root.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.880]   It's a kind of a root kit, but it's a very sophisticated root kit.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:05.360]   So by, by running, you turn, you essentially run the operating system in a virtualization
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.360]   mode.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.600]   It doesn't know it's virtualized.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.880]   It thinks it's running in full control of the system.
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.280]   And then you interpose yourself between the outside world and the operating system.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.000]   You have absolute control of everything it does.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.340]   It is like the matrix.
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.340]   It is the matrix.
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.340]   That's pretty cool.
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.340]   That's what you call a blue pill.
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.340]   No.
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:21.740]   It's a undetectable.
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:26.460]   Now there are, and again, I would refer you to security now if you wanted all the details.
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.120]   There are all sorts of people saying, "Well, you can tell things take a little longer
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.600]   in hypervisor mode so you could do a timer."
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:35.480]   "Ah, but yes, you control the results of the timer as well as everything else so you
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.400]   can lie about the timing."
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.600]   I mean, it goes on and on and on.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.160]   It's basically undetectable.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.600]   And by the way, it affects every operating system.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.960]   It's completely bogus for Microsoft to say that, "Oh, people who own Windows Home Professional
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.200]   are more likely to be able to deal with this."
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.200]   No one can deal with it.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:57.060]   If this exploit has a problem, that's just absurd.
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.580]   That's Microsoft blowing a lot of smoke.
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.580]   Insane.
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:02.180]   Well, there you have it.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:03.180]   It's insane.
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.180]   Let that be a lot of seeding.
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.180]   It's very clear.
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:08.060]   I mean, the argument that would be a more reasonable argument, I'm surprised they're not
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:12.700]   making, is merely that, look, that's virtualization is an advanced use of the operating system.
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:16.220]   If you're going to do that, you can't use the cheapest version of our operating system.
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.380]   We want you to buy a higher-end operating system.
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.380]   That's completely legitimate.
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.000]   That's an advanced use.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.480]   By the way, there is no reason you can't do this.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.040]   It's just a violates the EULA.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:31.600]   There's nothing that looks at and says, "Oh, I won't run."
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.600]   To my knowledge.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.440]   I don't see, again, I haven't tried it, but to my knowledge, there's no reason you can't
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.440]   do it.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.440]   It's just that it can't--
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.360]   Would it leave you in some kind of future danger of them turning it off?
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.240]   No, because they can't tell their--
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.360]   This is the same problem with Blue Pill.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.360]   They can't tell their in a virtualization.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.360]   Right.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.800]   There's no way Windows knows that it's not just in a very generic machine.
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.800]   You know what?
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:54.860]   This sounds like, perhaps, computer Alzheimer's.
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:55.860]   How so?
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:59.140]   Well, because it doesn't know what it's doing.
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.220]   It doesn't know something's happening to it.
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.580]   They can just call this-- instead of all these complicated things, you just rattle it off.
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.740]   They can just say it's the Alzheimer's virus.
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:10.100]   A Buddhist would call it an unmindful computer, because you're walking around thinking you're
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:14.140]   doing one thing and not really aware of what's actually happening.
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:17.660]   You're living in this dukkha world of exploits.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:18.660]   Wow.
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:19.660]   That's beautiful.
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:20.660]   That's just profound.
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.020]   Shall I get the guitar?
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.020]   When do we risk no one?
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:26.020]   How about-- so what are our picks for the week?
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.020]   Yeah, we got to do those because we got to wrap up here.
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.020]   I got to pick.
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.020]   All right.
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.020]   Pick away.
[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:38.700]   I'm using my MacBook Pro as my primary computer now, and that means hard disk space is always,
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.580]   always precious.
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:46.120]   And I read somewhere, I can't remember where, but you've got all these four languages on
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.840]   your disk, whether you want them or not.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:53.160]   So I found this program called monolingual, and it goes in and it asks you, which languages
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.400]   do you want to keep?
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:59.680]   And really, you want to keep English and maybe Spanish or whatever second language you speak,
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:06.280]   but you probably don't need Armenian and Amarian and Gali, and you can delete those.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.480]   And I got like four gigs back on my hard disk.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.480]   Wow.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.480]   That sounds great.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.480]   That's a significant amount.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:18.960]   So monolingual, all one down right now, L.I.N. takes out all those.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.680]   I think it actually, in the latest version, there's a couple of those out there.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.960]   There's another one that'll do even more of the kind of like, you probably don't need
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.720]   this template from here.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.720]   Right.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:32.920]   Like if you open up some of those iLife apps and some of those iWork apps, man, there's
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.640]   a lot of stuff in there that you really probably don't need.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.640]   Is that right?
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.160]   In your experience, Scott, it seems like there's a lot of craft and templates and sounds
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.160]   and all this stuff you know.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.160]   Yeah, but you know what?
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.120]   It doesn't take up near as much room as the languages.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.520]   The localization stuff.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.520]   That's extraordinary.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.520]   Four gigabytes.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.520]   I got four gigabytes.
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.480]   That's four percent of my hard disk.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.560]   There's another one is the other program that does this.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.560]   It's a.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.040]   Yeah, I can't remember.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.360]   This one's free, by the way.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.360]   Right.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.960]   This is a zero percent of an Alex.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.360]   It's a lot.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.440]   Monolingual is very good.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.280]   I think that's, and I think it's pretty safe.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.560]   There is one that's more aggressive.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.840]   Takes out localizations from all your apps as well.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.840]   And other stuff.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.280]   Do you localize her?
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.920]   No, that's been around.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.040]   That's my bomb, which is I'm trying to remember the name of it.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.040]   I can't off the top of my head.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.840]   I tried it for a, and I got nervous.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:25.360]   I actually ran it and I got some warnings and I said, yeah, maybe I'll do that.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.800]   I bet you somebody will do it in common.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.800]   I got a big hard drive.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:29.800]   I don't know.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.800]   I'm not going to really worry about it.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.000]   Leo, here's what I want you to do.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.880]   I want you to open up the shell and I want you to type this.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.800]   I want you to type an R and an M. Okay, you got that?
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.800]   Okay.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.800]   Okay.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.800]   Like a little bit of space.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:46.600]   And then by the way, she left out the capital F, which really makes it work better, I think.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.000]   Is that without our capital?
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.160]   Don't warn me.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.800]   That means just do it no matter what.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.160]   Don't do this at home, kid.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.160]   You know what I did?
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.160]   I changed my profile.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.880]   I forget the code, but I changed my profile.
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:59.700]   So I can't, you know, oh, no, I only just mind to like, you can't ever do this without
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.240]   like the big red letters going.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.240]   Are you sure?
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.800]   I think they call it noclobber or whatever.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.120]   We should we should we should mention that what that command does.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.120]   Oh, please don't.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.760]   By the way, and do by the way.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:10.760]   Please don't type the thing.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.400]   We didn't really we didn't really disclaim it appropriately.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.320]   People probably thought it was a funny joke that when you did it, it's something funny
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.120]   happened.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.120]   What should we do?
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.120]   Nothing funny happens.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:23.040]   You might want to preinsert some disclaimer.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.800]   Maybe you just go.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.360]   I'm just going to say, what you're about to hear is very dangerous.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.960]   Do not attempt it at home.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.960]   That's good.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.320]   All right.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.720]   Uh, Scott, you just hit his, uh, who's next Alex?
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:37.720]   You want to do one?
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.720]   Mine.
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:41.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:42.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:45.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:46.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:47.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:50.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:52.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:53.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:54.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:56.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:57.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:04.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:16.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:26.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.720]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.720]   I'm going to go super fast because they're both really good.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:30.720]   I'm going to beta something called Skitch by Plask, P-L-A-S-Q.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.720]   They do comic life exactly Skitch.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.720]   This is just in beta.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:40.720]   If you go to plasq.com/skitch,
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.720]   you'll figure it out.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.720]   Oh my God, it's such a cool application for capturing screen stuff,
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.720]   for capturing stills on screen.
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.720]   That's an annotation.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.720]   Dude, you're in a whole other ballgame.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.720]   Go look at it.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.720]   It's got the ability to annotate.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.720]   You can draw on it.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:57.720]   You can do all kinds of cool stuff.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.720]   It's really well done.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.720]   And get this.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.720]   Looking at lower right, you see that web post?
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.720]   You can figure it for Flickr or an FTP account.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.720]   You have one click posting based on a screen grab, which is huge.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:07.720]   You can email it from here.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.720]   You see that little drag me tab.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.720]   If you grab that and drag it, it drags it anywhere you want.
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.720]   There's no say that.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.720]   There's no export.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:15.720]   There's no whatever.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.720]   It's all video though.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:17.720]   It just stills.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.720]   No, I still use I show you for video.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:23.720]   And if you're in beta, you got to ask to be in the beta I think still, but the Skitch fantastic
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.720]   application, the other one.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:29.720]   So for the first time in my life today, this week, I had to roll my own RSS feed for the
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:30.720]   new podcast.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:35.720]   And so because I want to host much stuff at Libsyn but I wanted to be able to run it through
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.720]   feed burner and lotta, da, da, da.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:38.720]   And I'm not freaking Ben Durbin.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.720]   I don't sit there and write long hand XML.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.720]   I have no idea what to do.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.720]   So I found this application that I love a lot.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:46.720]   It is called Feeder.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:51.360]   And if you need to do anything with making an RSS feed, Feeder is going to make it very
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.360]   easy for you.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.360]   It is located as...
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.360]   Reinvented software.com.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.360]   Reinvented software.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:59.200]   And what it does is you go in there and it looks, if you open it up, it looks a lot like
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.200]   Mail.app.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.960]   It's a very familiar interface.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.640]   You go in there, it's going to help you make a pod.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.640]   It'll say, do you want to build a feed?
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.640]   Do you want to build a podcast?
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.120]   What do you want to make?
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.880]   It's completely configurable.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.880]   You put your art in.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.240]   It gives you the iTunes tags.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.200]   You pick what category you want to be in.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:18.440]   Being like 15 different ping services every time you post fantastic application.
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.920]   I bought it in a minute, $29.95.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:21.920]   Terrific application.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.400]   I'll second that emotion.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.400]   We've been using that for Twit.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.400]   Oh, you've been using it.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.400]   Oh, for a year.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.400]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.960]   I mean, it's a lifesaver, frankly.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.440]   And there's nothing as good on the PC side.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.480]   It really is a unique application.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.800]   And a little secret for the listeners of Macbreak Weekly that I'm not making a big deal
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.720]   of just yet as we have two versions.
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.440]   There's a high res feed as well as the iPod feed.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.560]   And so this makes it easy.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:42.560]   I go in.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:48.280]   of magic, I make everything happen, and then I can drag the entry into another such a time?
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:52.600]   >>I do that because we have five Twit feet. So I'll make one master feet in the contract,
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.720]   built in pod track, takes care of that for you.
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.680]   >>Is that nice?
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:57.420]   >>So anyway, those are my two.
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:00.400]   >>They've been updating that, and they update it very regularly, and I'm-
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.900]   >>That's right. I've got an update just since I bought it.
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:06.880]   >>You would know. I'm sure you know this program, but it's been updated, and I think
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:11.420]   it's better than before. But this is the kind of program that you would certainly use
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:14.960]   yourself, Merlin, that's called "Slife", from SlifeLabs.com.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.120]   >>The neat little app, yeah.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:19.360]   >>Yeah. You probably even mentioned it before. In fact, I probably-
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:22.960]   the original app used because of you, and I'm trying to remember the name of it. It was
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:23.960]   "Onlife".
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.200]   >>Onlife. I think it was called "Onlife".
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:29.680]   >>Onlife, that's right. And I ran it for a little while. The idea is it watches everything
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:35.240]   you do, absolutely free, keeps track of everything you do, and kind of keeps-
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:40.200]   >>You get basically these horizontal bars that go, "Okay, I spent this much time in
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.460]   Safari, and I was looking at these pages. I was in iTunes, and these were the songs
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.420]   that we're playing. I was in Mail.App for this song."
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:49.300]   It's a kind of a visual indicator. It doesn't support every app from what I can tell, but
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.500]   it's within a certain kind of cocoa app. It'll tell you, "Here's where you spent your
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:53.500]   time."
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:57.100]   Have you changed? I'm curious. Have you changed any of your behavior as a result of what
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.100]   you've gleaned from your life?
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.340]   >>You know, I only use it when "Onlife" came out, and I've just downloaded the new
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:03.580]   "Slife". So I haven't had a lot of database. You know, it's interesting about "Slife"
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:05.220]   now is that you can share your "Slife".
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.220]   >>That's right.
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:10.120]   >>They have a- you can do- it's social "Slife".
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:14.120]   >>My secret shame. Like I want to tell everybody how I work my day.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.120]   >>Yeah, but sure. Would you do that? I don't know.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:17.120]   >>Never.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:19.120]   >>Let's see. How do you go to create a point-out?
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:20.120]   >>I've got a career to protect.
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:25.800]   >>But it even makes pictures of the websites you go to and stuff, so it might be really
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:31.000]   a little bit too revealing. But I find it does not slow me down in the background. Of
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.800]   course, I have pretty fast machines, but it seems to do it pretty transparently. You
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.780]   can add new applications to it. I think they've got a better database than before than the
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:40.780]   last time I used it.
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:42.780]   >>I couldn't get text made in, so at most-
[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.420]   >>Oh, it's got to use text made. I mean, what's the point? Let me see here.
[00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:48.900]   >>This sounds like something a private investigator would like to know how to use.
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:54.980]   >>Yeah. Camino, Firefon's iTunes mail word, which is surprising. It uses Microsoft Word.
[00:46:54.980 --> 00:47:00.100]   NetNewswire, OmniOutliner, OmniWeb, QuickTime, RealPlayer, Safari, TextEdit, Text Wrangler,
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:05.100]   Vienna, Xcode, IBM, and iChat. I see no reason why I couldn't handle text made.
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:10.280]   >>Well, the inside baseball text make does a weird thing with the kind of NS field thing
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:15.040]   that it does. It's kind of non-standard, I think. So it's Coco, but it's got a weird
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.800]   text entry format. I don't know if it has any effect on it.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:22.800]   >>So you could actually share your RSS posts or what media you're listening to or what
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:25.760]   websites you're going to, and people could really be really stalking you.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.680]   >>This is the, I've called this phenomenon personality spamming.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:29.680]   >>Yeah.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:33.520]   >>The ability to share everything every tiny, which we're doing with Twitter, let's be
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.520]   honest.
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.640]   >>You got Twitter, you don't need anything else.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.460]   >>Tumble Log's fun. Are you still doing yours?
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:42.100]   >>Oh, totally. I did it. I just did it a little bit ago. I found an awesome video on
[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:43.940]   YouTube I just put up. Are you enjoying yours?
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:50.440]   >>I love it. Tumbleio.com. What I didn't really realize was that this is done by the
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:55.340]   Fredirator guys. David Carp sent me an email and I was kind of stunned. I thought, "Oh,
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:59.140]   my gosh, because the Fredirator is great. I don't know what their relationship is to
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:02.620]   this, but it's t-u-m-b-l-r.com."
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:05.980]   >>You see that photo of Justine with Axel Rose online?
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:08.940]   >>No. Justine met Axel Rose at all.
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:11.300]   >>Oh, that's true. She's everywhere.
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:16.220]   >>If you go to tumbleio.com and click the link that says banana, that will take you
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:20.580]   to Merlin Man's Tumble Log, which is Merlin.tumbler.net.
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:23.660]   >>I created one with one picture on it. That's all I got.
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:24.660]   >>Have you played with it?
[00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:25.660]   >>Yeah, it's kind of interesting.
[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:26.660]   >>Oh, my God. Axel Rose.
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.540]   >>By the way, Fredirator is being sued by Ralphirator.
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:30.540]   >>Oh, really?
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:35.100]   >>Yeah, and Joe Rader and Bob Rader are going to be soon too.
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:38.740]   >>Oh, Charlie Callus, I remember him. Oh, my gosh.
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:43.180]   It's so fun to go to these. Oh, and you've updated the design. You've actually started
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:44.660]   to use a different design on yours.
[00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:46.140]   >>They just added a bunch the other day.
[00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:47.300]   >>Oh, I'll have to check them out.
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:50.100]   >>Tumbler.com, really cool little site.
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:54.100]   >>Yeah, it's that blogger. There's no comments. It's just a tumble log. It has very simple
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:56.060]   kind of dump of everything or whatever.
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:59.620]   >>Where else are you going to put your Charlie Callus video? You know what I'm saying?
[00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:03.660]   My thoughts exactly. Oh, I like this new design. I might have to change my design.
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:07.660]   Well, we're going to wrap this up because I have to go do the daily gizwees now.
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:10.100]   And it's not that I don't love you guys, but...
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:11.780]   >>Day. We're going to miss you.
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:15.180]   >>Today's Tuesday. You got your, today's, what is it? What are you called today?
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:16.940]   >>Tuesday? Tuesday.
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:17.940]   >>Around Tuesday is what's called?
[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:19.940]   >>Turn the tables Tuesday. I'm going to talk about the art.
[00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:24.420]   >>Tables 2004, which is a very interesting, you know, it really makes you appreciate the
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.060]   iPod. Let's put it that way.
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:27.060]   [laughter]
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:31.100]   >>Well, it's just so easy to do everything with the iPod. And the Arkos, it's not Arkos' fault.
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:34.660]   They don't have content deals. So you have to figure out how to, you know, it's great
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:38.460]   for geeks. But you have to do it all by yourself, by hand.
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:42.740]   All right, guys. Starting to rain in beautiful petaluma time for me to get off. We're going
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:47.740]   to say so long to everybody. Another Mac break weekly is down the tubes.
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.740]   [music]
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:52.740]   >>It's over. >>Break time is over.
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.740]   >>Is that what we're calling it? Break time is over?
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:55.740]   >>I don't know. We're saying whatever works.
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:57.740]   >>I have a thump. >>The rat hole.
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:00.740]   >>Yeah, we just kind of wander off. You know, we don't really see anything like that.
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:01.740]   >>I think it's good. >>I think it's good.
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:03.740]   >>I got somewhere to go. >>I got somewhere to go.
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:05.740]   >>It's been fun being fun.
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:07.740]   >>Ratt hole!
[00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:09.740]   [laughter]
[00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.740]   >>All right.
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:12.740]   >>That shows up.
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:15.740]   >>At least in the old days, you could run out of tape.
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:19.580]   Now, I guess you just fill up your hard drive. You know you're done when you've filled up
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:20.580]   your hard drive.
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:22.780]   >>There's unfortunately, there's many drives with the rat holes.
[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.780]   >>You know you're done when Skype cuts you off. How about that?
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:27.780]   >>That's much more likely.
[00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:29.780]   >>All right, guys. Thanks a lot.
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:30.780]   >>Bye.
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:32.780]   >>And we'll see you later.
