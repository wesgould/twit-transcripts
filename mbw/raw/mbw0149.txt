[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Welcome to another episode of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   That's right you hear my voice got born instead of that
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   of the golden dulcet tones of Leo the port because
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Leo is in China and I'm not.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   So yeah, I get to host the show.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Now it's been about 142 episodes since I did this.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Believe it or not, we're almost in our third year of the show.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And I did a long time ago when we first started.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I hosted a couple of weeks.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   But since then, Leo and his wisdom has seen fit not to let
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   me host.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Unfortunately, he was out of options because our little
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   buddy Alex Lindsay is not here today.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   He would have hosted, but he and his wife had a great-looking
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   baby girl.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   So congratulations to them.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   The little baby is fine.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   The mother is fine.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And most importantly, Alex is fine.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I mean, you know, not that he did any hard work or didn't take
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   pictures, but he's not here.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And Andy's not here because he's in China.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   So basically everybody who's not in China is here and that's me
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   and I have a couple of folks who've bravely decided to come
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   on and help me with today's show all the way from Oxford,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   England and channelflip.com.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   It's Mr.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Will Harris.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   How would he be lovely to be here?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Hey, thanks for being on the show, Will.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   In case people don't know what channelflip is, give us the
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   60-second version.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   What's channelflip?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Oh, very simple.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   It's lots of cool sort of online video shows that you can go
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   and watch in your browser.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Very easy.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Or on iTunes.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Oh, well, that was pretty simple.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Also joining us today is Star of Stage, Screen, Hulu, Xbox,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   and anything else that shows video.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It's I Justine.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Hello.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   From the cottage.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Hi, Justine.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   How are you?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I'm holding down the fort here.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   That's right.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   We had to have somebody on Hi Def video that actually looked good.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   You would work.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Well, I'm excited to be here.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I'm so happy you're here.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Now, your I Justine experiment continues.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It does.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Yes, that's my ultra ego.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And how long has that thing going on?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Since the first iPod came out, 2002-ish.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And you were about nine then?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I was nine.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I mean, about nine.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Yeah, okay.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Well, thanks for being on the show.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   You usually are in LA doing things like your beautiful Mosey
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   commercial.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And today you're not in LA.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   You're in San Francisco helping us out.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   We appreciate it.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Yes.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   We actually have a few pieces of Mac news as shocking as that may
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   be.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And by the way, when I'm the host, we will occasionally actually talk
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   about Mac things because I don't know what else to do.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   I'm not as smart or as witty as Leo.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   So we're going to talk about Mac stuff.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And I think it might be worth noting that Apple is trying to
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   recreate something that I'm old enough to remember.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And I think it's called the 45, the digital 45 now.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Have you all seen this?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   I haven't, but I just googled it now.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   So you know what a 45 record is by any chance?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Yes.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Well, I was thinking that I didn't really know what a 45 was
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   because I'm pretty sure they're from before my time.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Yes.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   It's for old guys like me.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   We used to go to the record store and we would buy a 45 record.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And it was smaller than an LP.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And it would be too sided.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   There's the A side and the B side.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   The A side was the hit and the B side was a lesser known song
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   from the same group.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And you paid a lesser price for this than you would have paid
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   to get both songs individually.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Apple is trying to boost sales by coming up with a digital version
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   where you get two songs from the same artist for slightly less than
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   it would cost you to get each one individually.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   So there you go.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   That's what they look like.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   My first one was my gosh.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Now this is really quite some time ago.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   It was a Beatles.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   It was a Beatles tune.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   It was paperback writer.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   You know, I can't say I've ever actually used a record.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   I mean, once maybe at my grandmother's house,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   but I broke the record player and she's like,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   don't touch that ever again.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Yeah, it's nice to be known that I'm in the age range of your
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   grandmother.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Thank you.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I'm just saying that.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   I'm just saying that that's all she had at the time.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   So my other grandma on the other hand is the biggest social
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   networker you'll ever meet.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Well, this is a cool marketing tactic.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I don't know.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   It's sort of gimmicky, but you know, we'll see if it actually works.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Also related to some more straight up Apple news from the app store.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Can we say 1.5 billion with a B downloads in the first year?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   1.5 billion.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Does that surprise you?
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Actually, it really doesn't surprise me because I know how many apps
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   I've downloaded and I'm probably 80% of that.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   So I'm not surprised at all.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   And there's so many apps, especially with the free apps.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   I mean, there's nothing you don't pay anything.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   You just click download and you're done.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Well, first when I saw this, I thought it said 1.5 billion text
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   messages and then I knew it would have been something to do with
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   you.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   But no, it was apps.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Will Harris, do you download lots of apps from the UK version of the app store?
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Hello.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I think we're having technical difficulties where will is concerned.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   I'm going to be will here for a second.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Yes, I download so many apps from the UK app store.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Some of my favorites I play games all the time.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And you know, all those great photo enhancing applications.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Those are my favorite.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Yes.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Well, okay.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   You know, I actually have more apps than I thought I would.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I have my iPhone right here.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   And, you know, I have to say that my apps aren't probably anywhere near as
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   exciting as most people's.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And I don't have as many as some people.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   But you know what's really valuable?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   The flashlight app.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   The flashlight app?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Yeah, the flashlight app.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   It turns your iPhone into a flashlight.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Then you can walk around and point your iPhone as if it were a flashlight.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Now, do you have the one that has like the little disco strobe lights?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   No, like I said, I don't get too fancy, Justin.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   I'm old.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Are you going to stick with the face?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   You never know.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Your flashlight, it turns into a little disco app.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   You can change the different colors of the flashlight.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   No.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   No.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Once again, I just, I'm old.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I just want a flashlight.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Okay.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   This is this.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And I have a level.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   This is the one that really excites on my friends.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   The carpenter level.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   The carpenter.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Oh, that'll tell you if something's level or not?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Yes, here.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   See?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   That's pretty awesome.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   So I put this on all kinds of flat services and so far very, very few of them are actually
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   level.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   So anyway, and then, and then, you know, I have all the basic ones, but I only have two pages
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   of apps.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Leo, I think has 10.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Ten applications?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   I think, no, he has 10 pages of apps.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   I think you can only go up to nine.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   That's all my old iPhone.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   He has nine.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   He's got as many as you can.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   But on my new iPhone, I'm trying to keep it to three pages.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Really?
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.800]   Just because my old phone was so bogged down, it would take forever to restart and, or
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.800]   to back up.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   So now I just kind of keep my favorite three pages and I keep deleting.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.040]   Well, okay.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:42.840]   Have you heard the new iPod touch rumors, including the fact that there might be a touch with
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.840]   a camera, Justine?
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.840]   You know what?
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.920]   That's actually pretty exciting because, I mean, a lot of people don't really carry cameras
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.920]   anymore.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.200]   They kind of just, I mean, I, for me personally, I now use my iPhone as a video camera, as
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.200]   a photo camera.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.200]   Yeah, I mean, everything.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.280]   So you don't have the flip or anything?
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.440]   I don't, I do not carry my flip at all anymore.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.040]   It's pretty much- And you don't carry a standalone little compact digital camera.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.560]   Sometimes I do, but most of the time I know if I have my iPhone, I'm covered in all aspects.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.560]   That's very interesting.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.000]   Did you hear that the iPhone was the number one camera on Flickr?
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I saw that.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.600]   That is insane.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.800]   So I, I think this is very interesting for me as a professional photographer.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.080]   Of course, the quality of the iPhone isn't going to get the job done.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:33.720]   But for grab shots, snap shots, for blocking out a scene that I want to shoot seriously
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.600]   with my big cameras, I have been using the iPhone camera and I'm very impressed with the
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.600]   new one.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.760]   I really like the ability that I can touch to focus, touch to expose.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:49.040]   And I wonder if they'll bring that level of functionality to the camera in the iPod touch,
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.160]   assuming that this rumor is true.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:58.520]   But, you know, how this convergence thing, have we taken it as far as we can?
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.040]   I mean, what else could they put in this phone justine that would cause you to carry less
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.680]   in your purse?
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.040]   I would like some more editing capabilities.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.040]   I mean, trim.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.040]   Okay, that's all right.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.720]   But I want to be able to, you know, put a few video clips together, you know, render
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.480]   them out and then export that out to YouTube.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.640]   Then I want to have to carry my laptop.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.680]   So, I mean, I'm not asking for a lot, I don't think.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.680]   Now, wait a minute.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.960]   You really think you could be doing full-fledged editing on this thing?
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.960]   Well, not full-fledged editing.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.800]   I mean, you know, maybe I can take like four clips, maybe trim them together and just,
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.120]   you know, do a few little jump cuts.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.720]   I mean, that's not asking too much.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.520]   I think it's possible.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.520]   Okay.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.080]   I think surely the thing that turns this into a complete convergence device is the thing
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.960]   that Andy keeps rounding on about, which is a keyboard for it.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.960]   Yes.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.520]   Once you've got a keyboard in it, surely, then you can do anything.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.880]   You know, that really disappoints me, Will, that we don't have a keyboard because way,
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:57.480]   way back two years ago when the phone first came out, I actually interviewed some companies
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:02.000]   who had asked me to keep it quiet, but said they were working on keyboards and they never
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.040]   materialized, which begs the question, is this something Apple doesn't want?
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.800]   I don't know, maybe.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:14.080]   I mean, I honestly, I'm perfectly fine typing on my iPhone, but I think having an external
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.880]   keyboard would be pretty amazing.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.520]   You know, instead of going to a coffee shop, taking your laptop, just bringing your keyboard
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.520]   and your iPhone.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.280]   So there are so many, you know, I guess there were PDAs back then three or four years ago
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.000]   before smartphones, which you could get fold up keyboards for.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.640]   I mean, the windows, pocket PCs, they all had little cradles that you could dock, it
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.200]   will fold out keyboard.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.600]   And they were very much like the, the science five keyboards, which, you know, I'm sure
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.560]   Scott, you remember the sine five as being.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.560]   Oh, yes.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.560]   So it's typing ability.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.840]   And it seems bizarre that there's, you know, even with the new sort of iPod hot or sort
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:53.540]   of iPhone hardware program that Apple's announced, that nobody's really done any talking about
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.640]   keyboards, which is the most obvious thing.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.640]   Huh.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.960]   Well, you know, I remember the little roll up keyboards.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.840]   They would, they would roll out.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.440]   Did anybody see the latest Bruce Willis movie?
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.960]   You know, where he's got the kids got the little rollout keyboard.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.760]   I did not see that one.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.760]   That would be cool.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:21.680]   If we had that, then I could actually see taking my iPhone as my sole computing device.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.560]   I have to do far too much writing.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.360]   And I mean, you know, 500 to 1000 word posts to be able to sit there and tap it out on
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.360]   the keyboard.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.200]   Perhaps if I were born the decade that Justine was, I would be more adept at it and I can
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.480]   do it pretty quickly, but it's, it's not a very good accuracy.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:43.360]   I, I can't see this becoming much more of a convergence device without that.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:49.520]   And I do wonder if, you know, I guess I don't see why Apple wouldn't want somebody to make
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.520]   the keyboard as long as it became part of the approved for iPhone program.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.760]   And Apple got its 20, 30% whatever they're taking on that program.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.720]   I just don't, you know, I don't see what's.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.560]   I wonder if it's about how Apple likes to position these things, right?
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.440]   Because it likes to maintain a certain degree of coolness and usability.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.000]   And this is more mainstream than geeky.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.080]   And I wonder if they feel like bolting a keyboard on the bottom would just make it too computery
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.760]   and not cool, handsetty enough.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:26.040]   Well, I don't want to get too far into the crazy tablet rubers, which sort of have dog
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.200]   to show the way that, yeah, that's it.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.600]   We had in that direction.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.600]   Justine's got what I'm talking about right there.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.600]   Call us up.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.320]   This kind of creeps me out.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.320]   I'm not going to lie.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:43.320]   It just feels not like something that I want to be typing on for long periods of time.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.840]   You don't want to, you don't want to have something like that touching your skin, huh?
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.480]   No, it feels like it's like latex gloves.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.280]   It looks like the stuff they make those fake snakes out of.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:14:00.880]   It's like a sort of anyway, you know, on the Mac break weekly, we've got the meme of the,
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.040]   you know, the Mac SE backpack slash iPod.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:11.400]   Lately, it's the tablet and the rumors have heated up on the tablet.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:17.680]   I can see that perhaps one reason to not want a keyboard on the iPhone, external keyboard,
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.960]   I should say, would be that if Apple was going to do the tablet, then they wouldn't
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.520]   want, I would suppose, from a positioning point of view, to your point, Will, they wouldn't
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.520]   want one.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.520]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:30.520]   I think so.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:37.240]   They like to keep the iPhone as simple and not intimidating for newbies as possible.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.520]   And that they feel like, you know, just adding a keyboard can be too complicated.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:45.040]   But even with a, with, you know, the sort of this rumor will not die Mac tablet, I can't
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.920]   see that that's going to have a real keyboard either.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:54.920]   Well, yeah, I can't see it having a real keyboard from Apple, but I can see one perhaps
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.480]   coming from a third party.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:04.680]   And now, Justine, do you actually, could you actually write a thousand word blog post with
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:09.400]   any sort of accuracy and rapidity on the iPhone keyboard?
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.680]   Probably actually, this is really crazy because this weekend was the first time that I did
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.560]   not even use my computer.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.400]   I mean, I can't really remember a day that has went past that I've not like opened my
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.400]   laptop.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.760]   But this weekend, I was just like, you know what?
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.560]   I mean, I can do what I need to do on my iPhone.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:30.360]   I was posting videos, I was writing emails and I didn't even touch my computer.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.360]   Wow.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.960]   It's a monumental weekend for me.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.320]   Well, it's not something I could do.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:43.440]   We're going to skim past any further discussion of as will puts it the rumor that will not
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.280]   die the tablet and move on to this bit of news.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:53.360]   Apple apparently is blocking push notifications on unlocked iPhones.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.480]   Now, is this a big deal that we care?
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.040]   And are people still worrying about unlocking iPhones?
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.680]   You know, it's funny, I was driving through San Francisco and there was this big sign outside
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:12.000]   of this random mobile store that said, we unlock all phones and fix iPhone screens.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.160]   I was like, really?
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.160]   That's kind of interesting.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.160]   But I actually, I really don't use push notifications.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.560]   I actually had them on for a while and on I am, it was just annoying.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.640]   And I was like, you know what, I don't really need this.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.440]   So I think for some people it's probably not a big deal at all.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.480]   How about you, Will?
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:35.440]   Well, I mean, it used to be that, you know, the only reason I ever saw for unlocking the
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:40.040]   first gen iPhone was so that you could run all the crazy apps on it.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:44.160]   But now that there's the app store is so sort of mature at the moment, you know, there's
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.040]   have gazillion apps available for download.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:51.680]   I just don't, I've not felt any need to unlock it at all.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.680]   So I don't really think it's that much of a big deal.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:00.200]   And I'm missing some really obvious unlocking application, but...
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.000]   I've never unlocked my iPhone.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.240]   So I've found about it.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.080]   I think that, I think you hit it on the head.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:12.560]   I mean, I can understand why there was a lot of hula-blue about unlocking the phone when
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.880]   it wouldn't run apps.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.000]   But now that it runs apps, what are you going to do?
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.240]   You unlock it so that you can use T-Mobile?
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.240]   Well, at least T-Mobile...
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.040]   You know, that's the big takeaway.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.600]   Oh boy, I get to switch to T-Mobile and actually reduce my coverage map.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.600]   Well, at least I'll probably won't have dropped calls as much as AT&T.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.600]   It's honestly, it is ridiculous.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.600]   You can not...
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.280]   Well, I think it's ridiculous depending on where you live.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.280]   What's that?
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.280]   It depends on where you live.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.040]   I've never dropped a call.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.040]   I don't know.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.960]   I mean, if I'm driving, especially, it's really bad.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.560]   Even in my apartment, it's terrible.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:49.640]   Yeah, I have the one spot I'm sitting in right now is the only place that my iPhone doesn't
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.360]   work.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.840]   For some reason, the way my office is built, this one spot, I can't get any bars.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.120]   But if I walk 10 feet from here, I can...
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.120]   I'm fine.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.520]   But once I'm on a call, I don't have any problems with dropping.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.640]   I hear about this, but I haven't had those problems at all.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.720]   Well, consider yourself extremely lucky because it doesn't matter where I am.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.680]   I don't know if there's something wrong with my phone.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.680]   Maybe.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.200]   I cannot make it through an entire phone call no matter where I am.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.560]   I think it's also worth noting that those kind of coverage problems that you get with
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:25.080]   AT&T in the States don't really exist in most other places in the world.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:29.000]   The carrier that you have in England, O2, has some ridiculous...
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:37.200]   99.9% of the country covered ridiculously low amount of drop calls, 3G in most places.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.480]   No, in fact, well, it's slightly over.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.480]   I'm still aware.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.480]   Come on.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.000]   I'm just saying it pretty much sucks that we don't have MMS.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   I mean, really?
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.800]   AT&T, honestly?
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.800]   It's coming.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.800]   Relax, it's coming.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.840]   I know, but I just want to send picture messages to everyone in my address book.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.760]   I have heard two different numbers on the tethering price.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.920]   Has anybody heard the $30 a month price?
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:07.240]   You know, I actually just bought a Verizon, one of the Wi-Fi cards, and I love it.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.480]   I just switched from Sprint.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.680]   I'm a huge fan.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:14.840]   I actually carry that with me and my iPhone, and instead of posting videos through 3G,
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.600]   I just connect Wi-Fi on the Verizon card.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.600]   Send pictures.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.480]   So you're not going to care about tethering?
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.480]   I don't care.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.480]   No.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.820]   Originally, we heard the rumor it was going to be 55 a month, and now we're hearing the
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:31.040]   rumor it's going to be 30 a month, which would make it very competitive to use the iPhone
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.040]   tethering.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:36.200]   But me, Andy got me to buy one of those MyFi cards from Verizon, so I don't care.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.920]   I walk around with the Wi-Fi in my pocket, just like I predicted 20 years ago.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.360]   Yeah, that's the one that I'm using.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.360]   It's awesome.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.360]   I love it.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.360]   It is.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.080]   It's totally cool.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:54.280]   Before we get to the next little segment, I want to talk about Chrome, because that's
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.640]   one of those things that I don't think we can avoid, even though that's not a particularly
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.640]   Mac thing.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.160]   It does have some Mac ramifications.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:07.840]   I would like to take just a moment to pass it to Leo, who's got a very important message
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.520]   for you, even though he's millions of miles away in China.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.680]   So listen to this.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.680]   Hello guys.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.680]   Hope you're having a good time.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.920]   I know I'm in China right now.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:21.680]   I'm going to be back soon, but I had to mention our fine sponsors at Citrix.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.600]   The folks who do go to meeting.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.920]   It is a Mac product as well now.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:31.080]   I'm really pleased they've done a Mac version of go to meeting go to meeting is my favorite
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.840]   online meeting software.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.760]   And I've used it for an awful long time.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.200]   So I can say this with absolute assurance.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.200]   We use it even.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.680]   It's so good and so fast and reliable.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.960]   We even use it on the shows.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.440]   We use it on Maxwell's house.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.840]   So very Maxwell can show his screens.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.000]   We use it for meetings all the time.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.240]   And wherever we hold the meeting, we use go to meeting because it's just easy to install.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.320]   In fact, you could try it right now.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:59.200]   Go to go to meeting.com/macbreak and give it a shot.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.600]   You'll have it installed within a couple of minutes.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.560]   It saves you time, but really saves you money too.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.080]   And nowadays, business needs to save every penny it can.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.280]   I mean, you can't afford to waste time these days flying to meetings or going to meetings.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.560]   You can't afford to meet in person as much.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.200]   Go to meeting lets you hold your meetings online.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:21.240]   They include free voice over the internet and free teleconferencing in their $49 a month
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:25.080]   rate for as many, by the way, 49 bucks a month for as many meetings as you want as long as
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.160]   you want.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.400]   You compare that with anybody else.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.680]   I think you'll see why this is such a good deal.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:34.520]   Great for sales presentations, product demos, training sessions, collaborating on documents.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:39.040]   And as I said, we've even invented new uses for it on the air.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.040]   Just fantastic.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.520]   Any kind of conference call, make it more visual, make it more useful, make it more effective
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.520]   with go to meeting.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.520]   Try it free right now.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:51.560]   For 30 days, go to go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:56.040]   This is a time for you to show it to your clients, your colleagues too, show it to the boss.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.080]   So I've got a better way to do this.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.680]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:05.120]   We know you're going to like it and thank them so much for their support of our fine
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.280]   program.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:11.120]   We now return you to the Mac break weekly already in progress.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.120]   Thank you much, Leo.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.120]   We miss you.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.280]   I can't fill your shoes very well.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.000]   So please come back in a hurry.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.520]   Next up on Mac break weekly, let's talk about Dr. Eric Schmitt's role on Apple's board
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.840]   in the wake of the Chrome OS announcement.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.560]   Now first, yeah, let's mention Chrome.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.720]   Chrome is the new.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.480]   We knew this was going to happen eventually and it did.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:38.760]   Chrome is the new operating system and browser, of course, from Google that we have been told
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.680]   is going to make its way to the market.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.320]   So there'll be the Windows operating system, there'll be Linux, there'll be Unix, there'll
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:49.160]   be Mac and there'll be Chrome.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.400]   Is Chrome a big deal?
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.280]   Does anybody care?
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:59.120]   Okay, so it's sort of a big deal in that it is Google's first real operating system.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:04.280]   But it's also sort of not a big deal because it's only going to run on netbooks and netbooks
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:10.120]   are currently a percentage of a percentage of a percentage of the market.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.680]   And so there's been a lot made about the fact it is Google's first pure operating system
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.760]   play.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:19.000]   On the other hand, it is basically Linux with a new front end.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.920]   Yeah, now there's no guarantee though that it'll be forced to just stay on netbooks,
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.920]   right?
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:30.240]   Well, they're saying that's what they're developing it for because they don't think
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.640]   because it's one of these sort of ultra portable things, everything's in the cloud, you know,
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.880]   not designed for local storage and that kind of thing.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.400]   I guess theoretically there's no reason it couldn't make the leap to the desktop.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.960]   And I think that's probably what's got everyone excited is the idea that it could make the
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.840]   leap to a mainstream desktop and not just be stuck in notebooks.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.440]   And now Microsoft is really in the deep doo doo.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:58.200]   Well, yeah, how much does this impact if at all Apple, Justine?
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.480]   You know, I don't know.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.800]   I actually am a big fan of the netbooks.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:07.760]   So I can't really say that I'm too crushed by that.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:13.080]   But the HP netbook was the one that I was it was like the I forget what the model was.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.240]   It was like this pink and red.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.600]   It kind of looks ridiculously hideous.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.280]   And I'm actually kind of embarrassed to like pull it out in coffee shops.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.320]   But you know, I love the little things because you can actually type on it.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:28.320]   It does have a keyboard, but you know, it gets the job done.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:33.680]   So if you had your choice between Chrome as the OS on that device and let's say, Oh,
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.360]   the Mac OS, which would you prefer?
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:41.240]   I would probably prefer the Mac OS, but I mean, I can't be too picky.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.400]   I'll take it.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.640]   So my point is I don't think there's a lot of impact to Apple because I think everybody
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.400]   I've asked that particular question to you.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.560]   That's the question I want to encourage everybody to start asking.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:55.840]   If your choice was Mac OS or Chrome, which would you pick?
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.120]   And almost everybody I've asked has said Mac now.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:03.560]   Conversely, when I talk to my friends that own Windows smartphones and I say, if you
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:07.920]   had a choice to switch that Windows operating system out there and put Chrome on it would
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.920]   do it.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:13.320]   And it tilts the other way to about nine out of ten saying absolutely not much of a surprise
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.320]   there.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:21.160]   Yeah, I think it's the case that on the on the net book side, the dominating operating
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.800]   system is Windows and Windows XP actually.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:30.320]   I think most people who own Windows based net books would be really, really super happy
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:36.560]   to switch to a Chrome OS, especially, you know, as it seems it's going to be open source
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.760]   for the most part.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.920]   I think you asked the same question of Mac notebook owners.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.600]   I mean, there's an argument to saying that the MacBook Air really isn't much more than
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.440]   a slightly overpriced net book.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.960]   I think everybody would probably stick with Mac OS.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.320]   Some people in the chat were talking about mentioning the MacBook Air.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.160]   Is there a net book?
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.320]   And do you know what actually I really do not like my MacBook Air?
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:04.560]   The thing overheats, it does not work and it is just just sometimes wish that I never
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.840]   would have actually got it.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.920]   Christine, if I ever develop a product, I'm going to send it to you for torture testing
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.760]   because you have issues, your gear that I don't have.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.560]   I have an air that's never overheated.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.480]   I got a knife with AT&T that's never drop coverage.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.520]   So I want to send my stuff to you for torture.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.600]   I just don't understand.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.600]   I don't know.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.520]   I mean, I guess I mean, I'm trying to like edit video on my MacBook Air, which obviously
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.520]   on that.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.520]   Wait a minute.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.080]   I mean, you know, when you drive your YouTube like it's a Ferrari 599 and you're going to
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.080]   be disappointed.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.360]   Well, you know, I got to test it out.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.000]   I got a, I mean, but the bad thing is whenever I go through airport security, they're always
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.360]   like, why do you have two laptops?
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:44.000]   I'm like, well, this one is kind of like my email machine and this one I actually do
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   real work on.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   And I'm like, sorry.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.880]   And then like, so why do you got the net book as well?
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.240]   And it wasn't iPhone on top of that.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.560]   So what do you, oh, I will, I post with that.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.520]   So you're carrying four different computing machines I just seen.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.240]   Like, well, I take the net book to the coffee shop, you know, there's all these different
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.760]   scenarios for all of my gadgets.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.760]   Don't question me.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.760]   That's not a bad.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.760]   I promise.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.120]   And then right after that, they asked for your phone number.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.360]   So I don't know.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:14.160]   Now, where this fits in that's interesting to me as a business guy is Dr. Eric Schmidt,
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:21.640]   who's been on the board since I think, oh, six, you know, he, he's, he's basically said,
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:27.360]   he's going to talk to Apple's board and ask them if they would like him to recuse himself.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.440]   But then he said something that I found very interesting.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:35.400]   And then he said that at the moment, there's no issue.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:43.600]   So that tells me that Apple's initial reaction to this is, because, you know, if they were
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.840]   mad about it, they'd say you're out of here right now.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.360]   They don't seem to be too upset with this.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.360]   Does anybody disagree?
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.000]   No, I don't think so at all.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.720]   I think Apple well knows that, you know, any ally in the fight against Microsoft is
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.640]   a good ally.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:06.080]   And if Google ends up taking another 10% chunk out of Microsoft, then that's all to the good.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:13.200]   Yeah, apparently Dr. Schmidt did recuse himself from discussions regarding the iPhone at Apple
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.680]   board meetings.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:20.320]   And now it appears that he'll do the same when it comes to operating systems where there's
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.160]   overlap.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:28.240]   You know, I can't imagine long term him being as good a fit because I think eventually while
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:34.280]   you're right, well, the enemy of my enemy is my friend, that will only hold so long.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:41.120]   And once, you know, Google starts to get so big that Apple fears competition from it,
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:45.960]   I just don't see Dr. Schmidt having a long term role on the board, which is a shame because
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.520]   he's a brilliant guy.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:51.640]   I met him back when he was an MCI in the old, old, old days.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.120]   And I was very impressed with him.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:59.400]   I ended up at a lunch with him and a bunch of other famous people didn't understand why
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.080]   I was there, but I just sort of shut up and listen.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:08.640]   And the guy knows his stuff and he is a big, in my opinion, a big help to Apple.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.800]   But I don't think he's going to be there.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.440]   Well, I mean, you can say that there's competition elements, but actually sort of the way that
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.120]   Apple and Google are approaching these problems are pretty much opposite.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:24.680]   I mean, in terms of the iPhone, the iPhone is Apple's super closed platform, but they
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.200]   control that runs on one single device that they make.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.800]   You know, Android is an open platform that anybody can develop for and that runs on multiple
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.640]   devices across multiple hardware vendors.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.200]   You know, the same is true of Google's OS strategy.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.480]   It's going to be open source or run on a myriad of hardware devices.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.640]   You know, Apple stuff is closed and it runs on Apple.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.280]   I think you can even say the same is true of their attitude to things like web services.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.320]   And you look at Gmail, which is free and open for everybody to get out.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:56.120]   Whereas, but Mac, or sorry, mobile me now, is, you know, a super premium service.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.080]   You've got to pay quite a few bucks for.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.800]   So although they're in the same market, they don't really compete in that sense, I would
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.800]   say.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.080]   Yeah, I don't, I think, I agree.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.320]   I don't think they really compete.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:12.400]   But once again, I just don't think that long term that will necessarily hold true.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.160]   I think they'll start to compete eventually because, well, let's look at the yesterday's
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:23.000]   announcement, Microsoft announced the Office Suite 10 being available online to compete
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.320]   directly with Google.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.960]   That was their shot back across the bow.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.800]   How long will it be before Apple meets to look at all this and say, I guess we need to
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.160]   get the iWork Suite happening online as well?
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.960]   That's a good point.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.960]   So definitely need to be some.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.920]   And I do use all Google apps for pretty much everything.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:46.760]   I don't even have, I have nothing on my computer to do anything with.
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:50.560]   I mean, I even open up PowerPoint presentations in Google.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.560]   So it's.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:54.080]   I'm going to put you on the spot, Justine.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.160]   You're on this show a lot.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.200]   So I know you like Macs and I know you own Macs.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.880]   But what's your favorite?
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:04.440]   You have to, if you just tell me, this is my favorite computer slash operating system.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.440]   I prefer Windows.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.440]   I prefer Mac.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.200]   I prefer Google Chrome.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.280]   I prefer the Google system.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.800]   Do you have a favorite of all?
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.680]   Well, it's definitely the Mac.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.680]   Okay.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.680]   I mean, come on.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.680]   Really?
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.680]   I was just checking your loyalty.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.680]   I'm in front of my name, Scott.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.680]   I know.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.280]   I had my button, my finger on this button that would have ejected you out of that chair
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.720]   through the roof at the cottage.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:29.400]   Had you answered in any improper form or fashion, but you know, you're safe.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.400]   Don't you worry.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.320]   I just wanted to make sure your loyalties were in the right place.
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:38.760]   This is Mac Break Weekly, you know.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:43.400]   All right, we got a couple of more pieces of news to discuss.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.720]   Also want to remind you, if you joined in late, Alex is not here because his wife had
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.800]   a lovely baby girl.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.880]   And so Alex decided it might be appropriate not to make the show.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:58.520]   I thought that was quite the contribution on his part.
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.520]   It's like quite surprised.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.520]   He's not here and he didn't bring the newborn in.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.520]   Come on, Alex.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.520]   What's going on?
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.400]   He is busily making photographs.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.400]   I can tell you that.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.400]   I know.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.400]   I got a bunch of them.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.080]   Is he buying an iPhone for the new one already?
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.080]   How long?
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:17.000]   Come on, we're going to have a Mac Break Weekly sweepstakes on how long before that kid gets
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   an iPhone.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.040]   I'm going to share some inside baseball with you.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.920]   And if you knew Alex the way I do, you would understand this.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.160]   I said how the baby come out his response.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.760]   She rendered very well.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:33.480]   That's definitely a typical Alex statement.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.840]   The baby rendered well.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:40.080]   The only Alex Lindsey could think of that.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.200]   And you know, whatever.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:49.760]   Well between last week's show and this week, I believe Apple updated Safari to get rid
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.280]   of that dreaded security bug.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.640]   Did you download the new version?
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.840]   Well, I did.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:02.400]   I was less worried about that and more concerned with the fact that the Nitro engine seems to
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.320]   have gone an upgrade for JavaScript.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:09.480]   That seemed to be another decent update to Safari to get a little bit more JavaScript
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.480]   speed going.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.480]   Could you talk a little bit more about that?
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.480]   Any difference?
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:20.320]   Well, so Nitro is the bit of technology in Safari that renders JavaScript on pages.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:26.840]   So things like the wonderful, quit-life player that I'm sure everybody listening is watching.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:33.440]   So the Nitro engine that Apple developed is supposed to be the fastest at rendering JavaScript
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.880]   out of all the browser platforms.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.120]   And they reckon they'd beat it a bit faster.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.080]   So congrats to them.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:46.560]   Well, and there was a ton of noise about this security stuff.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.320]   So I think we've got that covered.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.320]   How about you, Justine?
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.320]   Did you download it?
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.920]   You know, I downloaded it, but I'm a Firefox person.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:58.080]   The only time I ever actually launched Safari is whenever I need to have two YouTube accounts
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.080]   open.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.600]   But other than that, it just, I don't use it.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.600]   And wait a minute.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.880]   Just, we just went over this.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.880]   What's your favorite?
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.240]   You're a Mac person, but you're using Google Docs.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.520]   You're using Firefox.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.080]   What kind of Mac person are you?
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.320]   Well, you know, I mean, I'm running it on my Mac.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.320]   I'm just kidding.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.720]   No, but I mean Firefox for me is so much quicker.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.000]   I don't know if it's 3.5.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.560]   3.5 is very quick.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.560]   It is.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.560]   It's a lot faster.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:23.800]   And I'm tab obsessive.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:28.000]   And whenever I open more than like five tabs on Fire or on Safari, it's like, please don't
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   do this.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   I don't like it.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.800]   It looks like I have like 50 open and it's fine.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.880]   But Justin, can you think your Firefox bookmarks, your iPhone?
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:41.040]   You know, this is really weird, but I don't bookmark anything ever.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.680]   So, yeah.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.680]   You don't bookmark?
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:47.120]   I do not bookmark anything.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:52.960]   If I can keep your reclamation of the things you can do.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.320]   Well, I just don't.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:59.840]   Your memory is so good that you can remember the URL of every site that you enjoy.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.440]   No, it's actually pretty terrible.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.040]   But somehow I just know where I want to go.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.560]   And if I don't, I Google it.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.560]   Like every week.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.200]   You write down people's phone numbers when you meet them or is that just another gift
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.200]   you have?
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.200]   No, I don't write down their phone numbers.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.280]   I bump iPhones with them.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.280]   Oh.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.840]   I think it's illegal in Oklahoma to do that.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.480]   I never used this app, but we were at the TechCrunch event last week.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.200]   And I was like, does anybody ever actually use this app?
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.200]   And I tried it.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.800]   And I was like, this is actually pretty awesome.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.160]   And it's kind of bad because I don't usually give my phone number out.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.400]   But for some reason, you know what?
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.400]   I didn't care.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.400]   I was bumping everybody.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.200]   That sounds very wrong, but I swear it's not wrong.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.200]   Download it's a nap.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.200]   There's a nap for that.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:44.760]   I'm going to be asking Colleen for this video later and I'm going to do a mashup with the
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.760]   last 30 seconds that I think might be entertaining.
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.640]   Not so much.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.920]   I just got big news.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.960]   Today July 14th is today July 14th.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:57.960]   Is that today?
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:58.960]   Yes, it is.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:35:59.960]   Pretty true.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:05.160]   You know, our good friend, Leo LaPorte won the Tech Republic's mock election for President
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.800]   of the United States.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.800]   Wow.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.040]   Yes.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:14.240]   He beat out Molly Wood by a substantial, you know, about eight and a half percent.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.240]   Mark Andreessen.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.240]   They're all looking on looks, then.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.720]   Yeah, it wasn't on looks.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.360]   We know that.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.760]   Mark Andreessen came in third.
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:25.280]   Jason Callackanus was a dismal fourth by a mile.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:33.160]   So Leo LaPorte has been elected president of the entire internet.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.680]   And someone also mentioned the SpongeBob turned 10 today.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.800]   They could be lying to me, but that's what the chat said.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.800]   Yes.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.680]   I don't even know who SpongeBob is, but congratulations on his 10th first.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:44.680]   And Bob Squarepants?
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:45.680]   Come on, Scott.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:46.680]   Seriously?
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:52.880]   You mean there's somebody we know named Bob Spongebob Squarepants?
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:53.880]   That's a real thing.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:54.880]   Google it.
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.880]   Okay.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:56.880]   I'm doing that right now.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.880]   See, I'm old.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:01.120]   I keep telling you, you want to talk about stuff I know?
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.760]   Oh my God.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.760]   Is that him?
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.760]   Yes.
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.360]   He's a Mac user.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.720]   I hope not.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.560]   Colleen said, yeah.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.480]   Oh, this is a cartoon character.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.480]   Okay.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.480]   See, you know, I really am this out of touch, Justine.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.280]   You want to talk about things that I'm interested in.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.160]   We'll talk about Mr. Ed.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.840]   We'll talk about Jethro Tolle.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.840]   We'll talk about...
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.760]   Oh, we can do Jethro Tolle.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:29.760]   We can do Jethro Tolle.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.880]   Crosby Stills Nash and Young Music from the right era.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.080]   Television shows like Mr. Ed.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.560]   Captain Kangaroo, these are the things that matter.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.880]   You need to do some history.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:44.880]   I hate to say this when I reference things that are in my youth as history, but yes.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.280]   I now know there's a thing called SpongeBob Squarepants.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.760]   Apparently there's also, he has a movie.
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.760]   Of course he does.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.760]   And I probably...
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.360]   It's probably safe to say that you don't watch Gossip Girl, right?
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.560]   You're just absolutely correct.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.560]   I do not.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.560]   Well, it's a good show.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.160]   I think you should look into it.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.160]   It's on iTunes.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.360]   Okay.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.440]   I just found out...
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:09.840]   I just found out that what John and Kate was too late apparently.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.840]   So...
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:11.840]   You cheated on the first day.
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:12.840]   You missed out on that one.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:13.840]   I have to face it.
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:16.480]   Talking about blast from the past.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.720]   Did you see this week that someone got Windows 95 running on an iPhone?
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.960]   I did see that.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.960]   My first thought was why would you want to do that?
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:26.960]   But yeah.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:32.600]   Well, performance is basically one to one with the machine that came out when Windows
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:35.440]   95 was released.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.600]   The benchmarks and the things that they've been running on, it's absolutely unbelievable.
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.720]   Well, you know, here's the thing.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.920]   I read all these stories about people doing these marvelous things.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:53.920]   My first thought is I somehow got screwed because in my life, I do not have that kind
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.920]   of spare time.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:00.720]   I don't know where I went.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.040]   I just don't know where I went wrong.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:10.320]   But having the kind of spare time one would need to do that, it's frankly mind-boggling
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.320]   to me.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.200]   I don't know where that's wrong.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.920]   But hey, that's just me.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.240]   All right.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.960]   Any other important Mac news that I'm missing?
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.600]   Let's see.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.960]   Checking here.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.280]   We covered the Safari update.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:30.600]   And I know that we probably already, it was probably already discussed, but the Firefox
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:33.480]   3.5 thing, I know that Leo's really loving that.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:38.480]   And for the first time, I'm finding Firefox usable with that particular upgrade.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.480]   I'm talking about Firefox fan.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.120]   Yes.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:47.400]   And by the way, we, Dane and Colleen, we do have a show title.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.760]   It will be Bump My iPhone.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.080]   That is going to be the show title for today.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.080]   It's a pretty cool app.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.080]   It really is.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.640]   I mean, it syncs photos.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.840]   Any contact information, pretty much your entire card.
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:03.480]   But it's like you take your phone and you hit someone else's phone that is running the
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:07.400]   application and syncs all of your contact information and saves right to your address
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.400]   book.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.320]   You know, we have to do a fundraiser coming up here at Mac Break Weekly, Justine.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.840]   And instead of the old-fashioned kissing booth, what I want to do is put you in a booth and
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.240]   then let people bump your iPhone for whatever.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:23.880]   I will be unchecking the sync phone number on the iPhone.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:31.760]   So the only couple of stories that I saw that we haven't mentioned are two Steve Jobs
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.760]   centric stories.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:40.880]   One of which sounds bizarrely that Steve Jobs is having an entire house on his land,
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.720]   dis-mattled and rebuilt somewhere else.
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.720]   Really?
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.360]   Did you see this?
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.360]   No.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.360]   I did not.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:54.800]   So Steve Jobs has got a massive, as you would imagine, estate in Woodside in California,
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:03.560]   on which is quite a historical house built in 1925 by a chap called Daniel Jacqueline
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:08.320]   and is considered a sort of historical, massive historical interest to the country.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:14.080]   Well, you know, Steve wants to build something substantially bigger and substantially more
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.120]   modern on his land.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:21.560]   And so he said, you know what, I don't want that crappy 1925 Paris, just knock that down
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:25.200]   at which point people sort of interested in the preservation of this sort of architecture
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:28.200]   to actually know you can't knock it down or went to court.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.200]   Well, it turns out he's not going to knock it down.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:35.080]   He's going to have it disassembled piece by piece and move somewhere else in California.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:38.560]   I mean, if you can do it, do it.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:43.120]   And that's what you can do when you're thinking you can have entire houses moved hundreds
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:46.000]   of miles down the road to take a view of you.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.840]   So he's just rebuilding a new house where that house was.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.480]   I hope he'll let me visit.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.680]   That's all I've got to say.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.680]   I'm not creepy.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:04.560]   Well, you know, there was, there was a similar story about Bill Gates when he built the current
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.920]   house for his when his wife was new and they got married and they were building a new
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:17.200]   house that apparently they sort of had to start over and sort of knock down one house
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.200]   to build another one.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.440]   I never heard if that was true or not, but that rumor went around quite a bit.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.800]   It was similar.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:30.840]   So apparently these super uber wealthy technology CEO types are able to do things like that.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:36.440]   Well, bit for them, the other, well, the other job story was that the SEC is officially
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:41.520]   announced that it's going to have a look at whether the Apple board knew more than it
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:45.720]   disclosed about Steve's health in the first half of this year.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:52.320]   Yeah, I did read that story and they certainly can do anything they want.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:59.880]   But what that story did not include, which I found very interesting, was any reference
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:06.960]   to what laws that would have broken, if any, if they did know more than they talked about.
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.160]   There was just that they're going to investigate.
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.160]   They didn't.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:14.000]   There was no nexus between, okay, we're going to investigate the CFE broke this law.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.600]   There was just we're going to investigate.
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:18.440]   Did you see any reference to any specific law?
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:24.440]   Well, they said that some of the if they made disclosures about Steve's health that
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:32.400]   were only partially true, that by being only partially true as opposed to outright false,
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:37.800]   they could still be breaking federal laws on disclosure of top employees.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:42.480]   Well, that's interesting because, you know, I didn't see that part.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:47.440]   I'm going to reference that if that's the case, that's going to obviously get a lot
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.840]   of folks attention.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:53.720]   So, but you know, it'll be like everything else, even if they find them guilty, they're going
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.320]   to find them and that'll be that.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:59.800]   So, yeah, I think if they did break the law, they should be fined.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:04.960]   But I think the laws too murky to understand definitively from what we know now, whether
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:05.960]   they did or not.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.480]   And imagine that from Apple's point of view, it's better to ask forgiveness and permission
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.480]   on this.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:16.160]   Well, and also how is the SEC going to prove what Apple did or didn't know?
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:19.000]   I mean, how can you prove what anybody knows?
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.920]   I mean, you know, a couple of years ago, I went to the doctor with some extreme stomach
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:24.920]   pain.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:25.920]   They said, "Well, you've got a bad gallbladder.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.440]   We've got to take it out."
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.760]   And so I went over to the place where they did the ultrasound.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.680]   The guy said, "There's nothing wrong with you, we gallbladder."
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:32.680]   So, you know...
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:36.120]   Well, I need to look at it that way.
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:39.960]   You know, Scott, I'm pretty sure that nobody can prove that I know anything.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:40.960]   So, yeah.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.400]   Well, I know they can prove that about me.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.400]   They...
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.080]   Okay, get told on a regular basis.
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:51.440]   It would be nice if Apple would just release a flurry of new products so that we'd have
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.680]   something to talk about.
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:58.160]   But it's not probably not going to happen because Leo can't buy anything from China.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.800]   So we have to wait for him to buy something for Apple to replace it.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.600]   Can't we get into buy something like on his iPhone?
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.240]   Just go into the Apple, just do anything Leo.
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.240]   Buy something.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.240]   Yes.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:15.720]   Buy something on the iPhone so that we can all then get the next thing.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:21.840]   And okay, so my ideas that we're going to start with the picks of the week and what
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.840]   you go first will.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:24.840]   I would.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:31.160]   I have an iPhone pick and a very quick Mac pick as well.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.360]   I thought I'd double up this week.
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:39.280]   My iPhone pick is a game that frankly I have not been able to put down since picking it
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:42.640]   up for, I think, 99p.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.560]   I know games are a little bit frivolous.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.240]   But frankly, we do as much traveling as I do.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.640]   This is an absolute winner.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.160]   It's called Parachute Panic.
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:55.640]   And it is absolutely my pick of the entire iPhone, Apple.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.880]   It's very simple.
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:01.400]   It's little people fall from the top of the sky.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.960]   You have to tap them to open their parachutes.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:10.480]   You have to guide them onto some little ships that sail beneath and navigate them away from
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:15.760]   helicopters and UFOs and other such dangers.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.920]   It's stupendous fun.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:23.080]   It's got a really cute kind of line drawing, math, paper, graphical style that you really
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:26.640]   appreciate when you take a look at it.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:31.720]   And frankly, it's just the most fun you can have with your clothes on.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.640]   And downloading it right now actually because that sounds amazing.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.880]   Yeah, going.
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.720]   It's so bizarre.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:43.280]   I have my, I spent my entire week on train journeys just playing it, playing it, playing
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.280]   it.
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.880]   I've so far got to a score of 156.
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:51.400]   If anybody can score more than 156 parachutes is saved.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.680]   It's listening to Macbait weekly Twitter me at will Harris.
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:59.280]   I will give you a special Mac break weekly prize because I don't think it can be done.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.760]   Well, you can just send that to me because I'm going to beat it.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.760]   I promise you.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:08.080]   I really every free second I get walking down the street, whatever it is, I'm playing an
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.080]   iPhone game.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.080]   So this will be my new challenge.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.720]   Well, I'd be, yeah, I look forward to the challenge, Christine.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:21.800]   The number of games that we recommend on this show that will waste people's lives is somewhat
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:22.800]   staggering.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:26.640]   I mean, you know, if you were to take the collective picks of things like the parachute
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:31.080]   game and the zombie game and all the other stuff we recommend, you could easily destroy
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.320]   several lifetimes.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.320]   My pickles.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.320]   Right now.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.920]   I can get that benefit.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.120]   Well, Miss I justine, what is your pick of the weekend?
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:41.880]   I'm almost afraid to ask you.
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:45.480]   My pick is also a lovely time waster.
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:50.280]   It's a game called global and it's only 99 cents, which is well worth the price.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:57.400]   You're like this little tiny glowing ball and you break blocks and it sounds ridiculous.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.080]   And I was like, okay, there's a light version too.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:01.000]   So you can test it out before you buy.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.120]   Oh, here we go.
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.120]   Here's global.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.120]   I can open this up.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.560]   And the cool thing is I know you guys are probably familiar with Smule, how they kind
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.560]   of have like the world interaction.
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:13.680]   Well, kind of I'm not even familiar with SpongeBob Squarepants.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.800]   How am I familiar with Smule is the ocarina?
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:17.800]   Come on, Scott.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.760]   What kind of Mac user iPhone fan are you?
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.600]   So it has like this little world.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:31.480]   So right now I have 237,000 points and I am ranked 5,229th in the area.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.480]   So that's pretty rough.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.400]   But yeah, the game is pretty simple.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:37.000]   You're just this little ball and you kind of roll it around your screen and you break
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   blocks.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.120]   But I promise you, it is addicting.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.120]   Okay.
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:46.680]   Again, I asked the question, where did I go wrong?
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:52.400]   Why do I not have the kind of free time to enjoy these sorts of mind numbing toys?
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:53.400]   I'm fine.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:57.440]   Scott, you know you're the only person that actually uses the iPhone as a fan.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.440]   You're the only one.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:03.080]   I do, I am the only person that actually uses it as a telephone.
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:04.600]   But what can I say?
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.800]   I'm stuck in, I'm a child of the 50s.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:08.800]   Okay.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:09.800]   It's the way it works.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.440]   That's not an excuse.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:12.440]   Okay.
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:17.720]   Well, I'm going to do a grownup pick today because we've had all these fun time wasting
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:18.720]   picks.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.720]   I want to do something serious.
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:23.320]   My pick is this guy right here.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:24.320]   Can we get video?
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.320]   Do I have video?
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.480]   Oh, maybe I turned my video off.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.880]   Well, that was smart of me to do that.
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.360]   This is my pick.
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:37.280]   It is the Lexar Firewire 800 CF card reader.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:41.960]   It's available from Amazon for $61.24.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.840]   I don't know how they arrived at that particular price.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:50.080]   But if you use compact flashcards in your digital camera, in your audio media, recording
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:55.920]   devices, your video cameras, whatever, if you've ever tried hooking those up to your
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:50:03.320]   Mac with a simple USB cable that came with the device, you probably know that it's all
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:08.120]   about getting some coffee because it's going to take a while for that card to download.
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:14.520]   But if you use this puppy, particularly if you're using something like Lexar's UDMA
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:19.720]   Compact Flash Media, which is really, really fast, and you put it in this UDMA capable
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:25.160]   reader, it's going to be seconds and your pictures are all going to be over on your
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.160]   computer.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:30.680]   So the thing I like about this one, and I've tried several, including some that work on
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:35.480]   USB, which are still faster than a USB cable to your camera.
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.200]   But this one is the fastest I have tested.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:40.920]   It is just blindingly fast.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:44.800]   And for, I mean, 61 bucks, it's not cheap.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:50.160]   But if you want to move data quickly, if you value your time, if you have more money,
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.880]   then you have time in particular.
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.160]   You will want to get this.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:59.720]   It's about 10 times faster than some of the USB solutions that I've tested.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:02.920]   And I've really beat the crud out of it.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:06.760]   You can actually daisy-chain this one, by the way, to have two of these connected at
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:12.680]   a time so that you could actually download from two different cards simultaneously.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:15.800]   But I've tested it and I have never been able to screw it up.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.160]   So that's my pick of the week.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.160]   It's the Lexar.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:22.360]   And while you're downloading your photos, you can play a parachute and global.
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:24.040]   Ha, ha, ha.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.560]   Yes, well, I have to admit that both those games sound like fun.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:28.560]   They do.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.560]   You know, they absolutely.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:33.360]   Well, just that in your free time, you can watch SpongeBob Squarepants and Gossip Girl.
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:36.040]   Scott, I think you have a new future ahead of you.
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:37.440]   It's going to be exciting.
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.440]   We'll chat back next week.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:44.160]   Just don't be holding your breath for me to be reporting on either of those two events,
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.160]   OK?
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:47.840]   Because I actually have a job after I get off the air.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.440]   I don't have time to do this.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.920]   You were going to chime in, Will?
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:54.160]   I was just going to say the Firewire 800 reader.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:59.840]   Because of the daisy chaining, that means you can still plug a Firewire 800 external
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.400]   drive into that.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.920]   If you had a portable map, it's only got 1-800 port.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.720]   In theory, you could absolutely do that.
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:10.160]   Although that's not what I tested.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:14.240]   What I tested was running another one of these into this.
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:17.000]   And that's what they designed it for.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   And I don't know.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.080]   I mean, that's going to be great for photographers on the go with laptops.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.280]   Well, yeah.
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:35.160]   And particularly since the Firewire 400 port has disappeared from the new book.
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:38.680]   I'm enjoying my 17-inch Unibody MacBook Pro, but it does not.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.520]   I repeat, it does not have a Firewire 400 port.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:44.960]   So if I'm going to use Firewire, I have to use 800.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:48.120]   And this little device has been the one that I've decided I like.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:49.280]   So it's tons of fun.
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:52.640]   I was just saying, I just ran on that issue because I forgot my Firewire 800.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:56.240]   And nobody in this area has one for me to purchase.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:57.240]   Really?
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.240]   Radio Shack staples.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:52:59.240]   Everyone just turned me down.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:00.800]   I was like, great.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:01.800]   Thank you.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:03.840]   Well, that's in Petaluma, right?
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:04.840]   Yeah, well, yeah, that's true.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:05.840]   Petaluma.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:07.240]   You might have to take it back to the big city.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:12.040]   I'm assuming you're going to go back through there eventually, right?
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.320]   Well, it's been fun to have everybody here.
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:17.000]   And I'm hoping Leo will back very soon.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:24.360]   I sort of got this dumped on me at the last minute because Alex's wife, that would have
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:25.360]   been big news.
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:28.240]   Alex's wife decided to have a baby.
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:32.640]   So hopefully next week we'll be back in order to some degree.
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:36.240]   Until then, I have enjoyed having both Will and Justine on the show.
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:40.080]   Will, where can people get ahold of you if they want to learn more about what you're
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.080]   into?
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:48.400]   Oh, come on, follow me on @willharris on Twitter and you'll get all my in-name updates every
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.600]   minute of the day.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.000]   Okay.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.400]   And Justine, you are everywhere.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.280]   What's your preferred way for people to find out what you're into?
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:02.560]   You can find me on Twitter @IJustine and I make a lot of YouTube videos so you can check
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:04.800]   those out at youtube.com/IJustine.
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:09.720]   And I tell you, my favorite one is and probably shall remain the parkour.
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.280]   Oh, that's a good one.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:13.160]   I should do a new one for next year.
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:16.120]   I show that to people as my demo of what YouTube is.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:19.280]   When I'm explaining to the old folks what YouTube is, I show them that and they kind
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.600]   of look at me and go, "Oh, let's still don't get it."
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:26.960]   Well, if you like, you can follow me on Twitter @ScottBorn.
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:28.280]   You might want to do that.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:33.040]   And I'm going to tell you why because this show is being recorded on Thursday.
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:37.000]   On Thursday, I'm going to be announcing one of my biggest Twitter giveaways ever.

[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.880]   In the meantime, I guess that's it.
