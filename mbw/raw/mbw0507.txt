[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.060]   Labs up there in more I a where it was snowing yesterday. No what it was
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.160]   It was all feel better in a nice tropical California drink. I don't know what's in there. I don't want to know
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.960]   I meant mojito coffee. Yeah, I try to make three kills a coffee. Yes

[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.600]   So I've been abusing them for the last week the coffee of choice in Silicon and Silicon Valley
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.640]   And also with his Andy and not co he's in blue today a vision in blue
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.440]   Yeah, I feel I feel like I'm in one of those like karaoke booths
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.240]   I've got the for for boring for boring reasons
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.280]   I've had to take down creme cam 3000 the future video podcasting temporarily
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.640]   And so I've got the camera like actually on the screen which means you get that really lovely hi
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.200]   I've got a fluorescent light panel directly in front of my face. Don't I look good? Yeah, I like it
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   It brings out the gleaming glasses
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.920]   Yes
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.200]   So I'm I'm really at this point unable to do the show because I foolishly said go ahead and update
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:35.160]   And we get a lot of updates. There's a new garage band iTunes 12.4 right or two everything. Yeah, and I
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.000]   What is this yeah, what is this is I mean Mac OS
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.220]   10.11.4 10.11.4. I don't know one of those four I think it is maybe it's about five
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.140]   I don't know and then I was 9.3.2
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.080]   Yeah, that came out as a shocker and Apple Apple TV OS 9.1. What is it 9.2?
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.280]   Point was they they're just completely for no reason they just make up these numbers now because it's technically the same
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.040]   Underpinnings but the watch is on to and the TV is on nine even though it's all OS iOS
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.200]   Right, it's a memory game. It's all iOS 9. So just make it all just yeah
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.800]   Oh, you're right it is 10.11.5 because my update on this computer just came through so it's 10.0. Which don't worry
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   I will not install
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:29.640]   So what is what let's start with OS 10 what is this a security update? Oh, it's always a security update plus right?
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.680]   Yeah, I mean they say it improves the stability compatibility and
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.960]   Security of your Mac is recommended for all El Capitan users
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.120]   So I mean I guess bug fixes and probably some security updates is what it seems like Renee
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.840]   I'm sure knows way more than I do. I'm assuming that it's literally probably just some security stuff and maybe a few bug fixes
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.360]   They're all there's a new category. I like to call whoopsies
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.520]   It's like there's bug fixes and performance enhancements and then things that they really screwed up previously that they have to quickly unscrew
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.400]   So it's things like the iTunes update and it's things like
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.320]   You can now use night shift for example when you're in low power mode, which is just
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.320]   something I
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.200]   This is an update an unusual in fact Alex Lindsey if you were here would always cancel us do not install
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.640]   The first update install the update to the update because that's when they fix the whoopsies
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.320]   There's red the code it like it's funny because people call these internally like red and blue updates and red are like
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.600]   Oh my god, something's broken push the update fast fast fast
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.080]   But that's a rushed update so you know what's gonna break in that so then the blue updates when they've had time to actually go
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.360]   All right settle down everybody take a deep drink now. Let's fix this and then you get the blue big update
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:42.880]   What are you laughing at no, I just we're talking about updates and we're also talking about the wisdom of don't actually push the big
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:50.000]   You're done. I'll just I want to quickly describe that I've got my I'm looking at a screen
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.920]   That's plugged into my my Macbook Pro, which is my daily driver Mac
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.680]   It's got a vert. It's got a remote access window to the Mac mini that drives that that
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.200]   Drive Skype and does all the podcasting stuff from so right now
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.080]   I am looking at in the corner of my Macbook window the upgrade to El Capitan
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.280]   Notice that I've been looking at for the past two months and
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.480]   And in the smaller window the updates available
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:21.960]   dialog box for the Mac mini that has also been up for at least four or five days that as because always pops up or
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.560]   Andy are you actually doing something you need to finish? Yes? Okay, then we don't need to see that right now, do we?
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.640]   So - supposed to run every night
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.880]   But I've always forget to turn off Photoshop and then Photoshop wants a confirmation to close Jason
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:41.240]   This is telling me do not do the iOS 9.3.2 update because it's got problems with the iPad pros
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.080]   So I guess what we should first say is while updates are always very important
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:52.960]   We want to also report to you as is our job of any issues that are being caused by these updates
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.700]   So should I not do this on my iPad Pro Renee? I didn't have any trouble
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:03.320]   I have seen some the thing is that there's so many people so many devices now running in so many different configurations that even
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.240]   If it's 1% of people that's still thousands of people who have an issue
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.440]   I haven't had any problem with it. I installed it yesterday
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.280]   Everything seems to be working fine, but that doesn't mean you know like the update for iPhone fixes the Bluetooth issues for iPhone
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:19.640]   SE that I never had but you know some other people did have so it depends on what your pain is if you currently have pain
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.840]   The update might fix it if you don't wait a while let your friends try it out. Let us try it out
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.240]   And then you know I think that's I learned that lesson with the iOS update that broke
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.760]   There's a fingerprint reader
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.780]   I was about to install it and Jeff needles who worked for us and was a Apple aficionado was always the first to install anything
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.360]   scream
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.640]   And that's what I stopped. I haven't heard any screams like that yet
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.600]   Okay, so here becomes my question because at this point, you know Apple's turning on auto updates for everyone right?
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.520]   So what happens when your auto update is pushed out?
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.280]   Yeah, and and like you're just said oh go ahead and update this
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.480]   You know usually at that point. I'm like, okay. I go ahead and install and and everything will be fine
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:06.340]   In the interest of protecting you everybody. I'm gonna download install 932 on my iPad Pro
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.240]   I've already done it on el capi 10 on OS 10 now
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:19.320]   I noticed I have to go back through each time even a point update like this go back through kind of okay
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.320]   Do you want to save send diagnostics usage to Apple? Yes?
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.080]   Do you want to send crash data to Apple developers? Yes?
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:31.800]   I hope I'm not gonna have to log in again because I if I if I did I really hate it when they make me log in
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.160]   I cloud again, let's see setting up your math. You can show this. It's okay. It's okay. They're too late
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.720]   You missed it. They're just a lot of different layers. You did get kittens, so
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:45.600]   There are a lot of different layers to these kind of problems not not only that
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:51.320]   But you also have to be aware that this is a time where a lot not not just Apple is just in general a lot of
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.800]   service providers and a lot of
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:09:01.280]   Appmakers will sneak new things into the terms of service that this has nothing to do with actor activating the fingerprint reading
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.880]   But but this is a really good time to
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:13.480]   Technically speaking say we got your authorization to start selling marketing information about you to other people because we buried that on page 21 of the new updated agreement
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.920]   and
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:20.480]   It's just something to be really really careful about every time you see we are in that we are in the habit of just
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:25.720]   Pushing the okay button to move forward to the next to the next thing Google as a matter of fact
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:33.560]   They had they had a they do a lot of AB actually ate through the triple z testing as they're pushing out new features
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:39.600]   They found out the first is one feature in Gmail the problem was that the they were it was throwing up a dialogue box
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.080]   It simply said do you want this to happen?
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.440]   Okay, and people are just used just blindly clicking okay
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.360]   There's they're seeing the dialogue box as you have to click the OK button to make this thing go forward
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.600]   And I really wanted this thing to go forward whereas it was presenting here
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.880]   Here is an actual warning that we need to make you read so instead of presenting it as an okay dialogue
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.760]   They would decide to present that information elsewhere and otherwise
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:08.040]   But the I just want to add one thing though to what we were talking about a second ago makes I'm a little bit more
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.680]   Of a risk-taker when it comes to desktop operating systems than stuff on my phone stuff on my phone
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.160]   I'm willing to be a whole issue behind for a month because
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.880]   Think about what happens if Wi-Fi if I lose Wi-Fi on my Mac on my desktop back
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.880]   Well, it means that I'm tied into ethernet no problem
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.040]   I can it'll be a bummer to not be able to use my my notebook in the living room
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.280]   But I'll get by if my phone gets bored for any reason
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:38.480]   God forbid I'm trying I'm in an airport. So now I don't know what my booking up for information is
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.240]   I don't have my boarding pass my I've just got a text message for my bank saying oh by the way
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.520]   There's unusual activity in your accounts. We've locked you down and now I can't turn that back on again
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:53.560]   I also can't move money into another account. I can't like a rebook a thing you are totally screwed without your phone
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:11:01.920]   So that's the one thing where I'm I actually do make that try to do that mental thing where what actual feature is being added
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.440]   With this update and is this a feature that's relevant to me?
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.280]   I'm really conservative when it comes to updating my phone. So
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:14.680]   Go ahead one thing worth adding is about the iCloud is it's that traditional battle between convenience and security
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:20.520]   So there are updates where you don't have to log back into iCloud and those are the ones where they never touch the iCloud chain throughout the process
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.960]   But anytime they have to either flush it or they rewrite something over it
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.880]   They can no longer keep that is they no longer prove that you are that you are secure and connected and authorized for iCloud
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:34.280]   They have to ask you again so they can generate that new token. I once asked our security guy Steve Gibson
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.000]   Show follows this one
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.280]   Why is Apple asking me for those passwords all the time?
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.360]   He says I don't know but Apple's good pretty good about this kind of stuff if they're asking you for a password
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.360]   It's because they have a scenario
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.160]   We're not asking you for a password to be risky
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.560]   So they're fail secure. They're not just doing it for you know
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.040]   Because they're smart. They're not stupid and they're not just doing it because well, you know
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:56.800]   It might be a good idea
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:02.080]   They're doing it because there's a scenario that they're that they're thinking about that they want to prepare a per pet protect you
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.840]   Again, so do it even though I bitch and moan the whole way
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:14.200]   Because I have to because I have of course as everyone should a non memorable long strong totally random iCloud password that I have to look up on my
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.280]   You know other computer and type in slowly by
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.360]   And I was on an Android podcast which was a lot of fun
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.960]   But they were complaining that Apple keeps asking for iCloud and they can never remember it and I asked them what they did with Google
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.960]   And I said well, I made that easy to remember
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:33.720]   Same thing because on the Chromebook I have it set and you don't have to have it set
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.960]   But I have it set that you log in every time you open the Chromebook
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.760]   Which means and you don't log in with a Chromebook password see a local password
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.200]   I don't think has to be as secure because it's just your local password that have to have physical access
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.540]   But the but my Google password should darn won't be secure. So I just like that
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:52.140]   I can memorize I turn that off on OS 10 because I don't want someone shoulder surfing me getting my
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:57.360]   Online my online point. So yeah, yeah, I've actually I've actually thought about that
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:03.480]   I've kind of wished that the one password people or every single password generator would not just factor in how tough is this
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:10.840]   Mathematically to break but also how easy is it to people figure out what word you're typing or what sequence you're typing?
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:16.000]   If I for certain types of passwords, I use themes
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.320]   They don't have to be as secure as my bank password for instance
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.320]   But there for a message board or something like that
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.240]   I will use a consistent theme that even though I change it every single month
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.600]   There's something kind of similar to it and sometimes as I'm picking something that I can remember
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.720]   I'm realized that oh it looks like if someone were just
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:39.920]   Blancing at what I'm typing it would probably figure out at least one or two of these words because it's a very very specific pattern
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.840]   I think that some of the best passwords possible would be something that involves
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   A lot of keys that are grouped close together
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.840]   So you can't really see which of these eight possible
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:55.820]   Shift key I put a little syrup to shift key action and there is
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:03.440]   And then if somebody if I'm in public I type backspace and a lot I
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.800]   Do it delete back and you do it you could do with your pinky
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:12.440]   So it's I think you just obfuscate if I if I'm in public I will actually just drop something
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.200]   I'll lower the lid my notebook
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:19.600]   Yeah, but even but I was also thinking about there there are some passwords right do that that thing that no one ever figures out
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.320]   Which is I'm substituting some numbers for letters
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:27.520]   But also I have to slow down to make sure I hit one which means I'm not typing up my usual 380
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:34.040]   Characters per second. It's like now. Oh, I can actually see this person. He's typing so what you want really you don't want to do is go
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.040]   metaphor D
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.040]   Three
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:44.400]   We should we should all be using random passwords generated by one password
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:44.920]   I
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.840]   I agree we are in we are imperfect vessels for the perfection of the universe unfortunately
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.880]   I use I shouldn't say this because I'm reducing my security, but I use song lyrics
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:58.920]   For passwords and I take I do I transform them. I don't take the song lyrics in fact. I often get the lyrics wrong
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.920]   So that's even better
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.320]   It's a perfect password mnemonic for me because no one's ever gonna guess it
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.360]   But but I sometimes make the mistake of humming the song
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.800]   That is not okay, that would be a bad way to have
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:24.760]   So I have now updated El Capitan that apparently a long list of security flaws fixed on this
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:31.640]   This is well worth doing yes, yeah, no, I look I look that up and it looked like that the CVEs that it's updating are all kinds of stuff
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.640]   So that's that's a good update
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:40.920]   Do it. Do it. Yeah, definitely do it. Is it also available for Yosemite Andy? Yes, I think so you wouldn't be seeing it, right?
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:47.400]   I think so you're not upgraded yet. Not yet. No. Yeah, I don't want to say for sure. I haven't tested it
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:55.000]   Security security patches do tend to be unless it's something that where there was a huge change of infrastructure
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.520]   They do tend to be pretty OS in unspecific right? They're not the way that as usually they're updating once
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:07.840]   Specific library or one specific command line tool that they can put on just anywhere. So yeah also update for garage band
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:13.840]   And iTunes and we'll talk about both of those in just a little bit my iPad now is reboot
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.720]   I'm done with El Capitan seems to be working. Of course, I you know can't be sure till I try every program
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.720]   And launch a hundred tabs, but so far so good
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.560]   It was only a 93 megabyte download for iOS
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:32.320]   So that's I always feel like that's less likely to be problematic. It's dumb because you could have a bug in one bite
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:37.200]   It's getting better at making those updates smaller. Yeah, 93 is not bad. That's a quick update
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.080]   And then so we'll talk about iTunes. I want to because we also have to update the
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.440]   You're deleting it wrong story
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:54.160]   Nobody knows Leo no one knows even apple apparently. Oh apple does not know this is it. Yeah, that's the irony
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.040]   Hold on hold on hold hold that thought because I want to take a break
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.680]   But we're gonna come back and Christina Warren is here for Mashable
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.400]   And it's I'm just thrilled to get you on Christina
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.040]   I know you're busy
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.480]   We're gonna run through this show as fast as we can because Christina's got somewhere to be in an hour
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:11.520]   Um, you're busy at Mashable aren't you doing a lot? Are you doing a lot of video now?
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.360]   I'm doing a lot of video now and yeah, we're just just rocking a roll in so yeah
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.560]   Stuff coming up and so it's good. It's good opportunity for you
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:24.000]   That's what I like good. No good good news for Mashable. Yeah, you know what? Thank you
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.520]   You're exactly right. They are damn lucky to have you
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.680]   We're damn lucky to have you on the show right now as with rene richies
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.160]   Always glad to have you from i'more.com
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.800]   He's you're my go-to guy if i'm if i think what's the problem is there a problem with this update?
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.840]   Who do I think i'm more right? Yeah, is that apple deleting my music? I think i'm more that's where you go
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:50.480]   Um really good for that stuff. Can I say one thing because the perfect metaphor just occurred to me and I have to use it
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:57.760]   It's like I feel as though like i'more and mashable are kind of like the good old days of the new york post and
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.600]   And the new york daily news like in the 50s and 60s where it's like
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:09.040]   They cultivate and attract really really great columnist and columnist and editors and seems like every two or three years the nay
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.920]   Daily news says okay. We've got we'll we'll we'll we'll give christina more money to get her away from
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.080]   See away from Mashable and then someone says you know what if they're gonna take christina
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.320]   We're gonna double whatever serenity kalbla is getting paid right more. We're gonna double their salary
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.800]   We're gonna get a firm or mashable. I would like to I would like to think that eight years from now the
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:32.480]   The three or four best people from both are each getting like 800 thousand dollars a year because each of you
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.800]   Each other's best talent because you you got these great people on both steps
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.440]   Looking for the daily bugle. Where's that daily bugle?
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.800]   Yeah, that'd be good
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   Shaving you can do that
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:52.560]   Also, Andy and ico the chicago sometimes i showed today brought to you when i told Andy the sponsors for today's show
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.240]   He said oh good audible
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.880]   Andy's always got an audible pick we're gonna get to his pick a bit
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:02.000]   Let me explain why you want an audible pick because i'm gonna give you a free book at audible.com slash
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.120]   Mac break it's the goal what is audible? Oh
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:10.480]   Gee, I did I thought everybody knew audible is the best audio bookstore in the world my friend
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.600]   250,000
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:19.360]   downloadable type titles fiction nonfiction mysteries science fiction
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.960]   self-help how to technology biography all of it
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:29.280]   Including by the way performances the great courses series, which means you could take all of those lectures
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:34.560]   Uh, and it could be part of your subscription. So we're gonna get you the gold subscription, which is a credit a month
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.680]   99.5 percent of all the books are one credit there few of the very long books are more than one credit
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.120]   So you'd save up but they're long so they get you through a couple of months
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:48.320]   Uh, you also get the daily digest with your subscription of the wall street journal or the New York times
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:54.400]   And the nice thing is this this is a 30-day trial. So you pay nothing for that first month or that first book
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.200]   canceled anytime
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.400]   Pay no pay no fee, but get you get to keep the book
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.880]   Uh, and then once you're a member, I think you'll see all sorts of other things the real hardship is
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:11.120]   And you know every month of what will I read next? Well, it's so much fun. There's so many choices
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.920]   That's why we give andrew an adco
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.760]   His chance to pick the audible book of the week
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:24.000]   Uh, this is one that i've been saving up. It's uh, joel gray. Uh, he you know him. He's a
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.400]   He's gone and rolled in
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:31.280]   Exactly the master ceremonies on cabaret and he's just done a really good
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:37.680]   theatrical memoirs called master of ceremonies by joel gray read of course by the author and
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.400]   every time you have a stage performer reading his or her own audiobook
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:48.000]   That's you've got nine hours of stage performance and that will get you through housekeeping
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   That will get you through your constitutional your drug and get you through everything
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.960]   Uh, and I like to sort of I've got a I've got a long and difficult audiobook
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:02.960]   Next that i've already bought it. It's queued up. It's like 40 hours and the sort of thing where you have to listen
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:07.280]   Really carefully and focus on characters and interlocking storylines
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.960]   So it's great to have a memoir like this, which is a really nice
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:19.440]   Engaging personal story because not only has he spent a life in the theater, but he had he had he comes from a very interesting background
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.800]   And also even though he's in his 80s, uh right now
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:27.280]   He the book also talks about his the unusual step of coming out
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:32.640]   As a gay man when you're elderly and you're already quite famous and you're wondering
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.360]   I have to admit that when that news came out. I'm I was like
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:41.520]   What why when you're 81 82 would you finally make that step because I
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:46.320]   Nothing to lose now. Well, I was gonna say I'm completely ignorant. I do not know
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:51.200]   Well, he grew up in an era and I think it's still somewhat true where as a performer you had to be closeted
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.200]   You couldn't be a leading man, right? Yeah, but he was but being in a
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:00.880]   It's it's I'll I'll let him tell the story inside the book. It's really really interesting just start to finish
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:06.400]   So I'm also again. Just listening to Joel Gray speak to you for eight or nine hours. It's it's good stuff
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:13.440]   Great stuff history fiction. I love the showbiz biographies and he's led me to quite a few of those
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.600]   Here's the deal go to audible.com
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:23.840]   And pick your first book then go to audible.com/macbreak it's sign up for the gold account that book will be yours for free
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.600]   ooh
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:30.880]   Deary the remarkable life of julia child, you know, I'm kind of on a julia child
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.000]   Kick because I'm reading a year in france right now and actually
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Lee and I are reading this together. We're looking we look now for books. We can read as a couple. We both have our own
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.560]   Subscriptions, so we have our own
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:47.040]   Books, but then we have some stem my life in france. That's it. We have our own
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.680]   And then we have books that we listen to together
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:56.400]   And this is because we're both Franco files. We both love food and we both love julia child. We're listening to this together
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:02.720]   It's so great. It's a memoir of julia child's life in france for franco files
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.760]   Nothing better. Anyway, you could see the problem
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:11.280]   It's hard to pick the first book, but just get started. You'll see audible.com/macbreak
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:16.400]   Um, so I somebody was saying how do I get the chinese instruments?
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.040]   I've opened up the new garage band and you have to create a new
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.920]   garage band
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:30.880]   Track and then go to sound library and you'll see you can download either download essential sounds or
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.880]   Can you show this cars and download essential sounds or download all available sounds?
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.640]   So I'm downloading essential sounds look there's a lot of new stuff bass drum kit guitar loops and all the all sorts of stuff
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:45.200]   But here's all the chinese traditional stuff. This is uh, it just really shows you how interested
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:50.080]   Apple is in getting that chinese market not that these aren't great things to have in fact, you know
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.120]   uh, many musicians
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.880]   um are
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.120]   Love having the kind of the
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:03.920]   Inspiration to innovate that comes from having new instruments and new sounds so I watched a bunch of those buschia
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.120]   The marshal hero movies when I was a kid and they always had these fantastic scores
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:11.520]   It just sounds so different than anything else you get in like western movies or western
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.200]   Opera and everything from the red junk opera to the peaking opera
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.800]   It's just magnificent the sound is so different and now you can experiment with them
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.120]   And like you said it'll lead to a whole bunch of fusions that you know weren't weren't just available on your laptop
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:30.000]   You were traveling before it is a apples garage band is a heck of it. It's free right if you buy a mac you get it. Yeah, it's free
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   These loops, you know, I've also my son is a loves this stuff
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.640]   So we I got him logic pro and I bought a ton of loops and I used to I've spent hundreds of dollars
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:44.240]   Music loops. Yeah and apple's giving you I don't know how many a ton of them
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:50.000]   Totally for free super interesting to see susan preskott. She's the vice president of marketing for apples apps
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.760]   He runs all the apps in apple marketing and she she got the quote in the rest release
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.800]   Which I really like because it shows that they're like this is not just you know an executive on down thing
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.160]   They really want to make these apps for everybody in China such a huge market for them
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.600]   You don't just get a vintage v3 organ
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:11.600]   You get seven different styles of vintage v3 organ out of here
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:18.080]   Bebop classic rock grand organ heavy metal organ jazz organ lighter shade organ and toen wheel organ
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.840]   I think that speaks to the to the bench strength of the people that they have working inside there because they're people
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.440]   It's not just engineers who have learned about music. They hired musicians
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.920]   I remember the story about uh in uh, uh, uh, paul shapers autobiography
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.240]   Talking about how he would as he as a kid as he as a man in his 20s
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.880]   Like working in gig to gig. He would sort of sneak over when he knew that this a legendary
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:45.760]   Uh blues music keyboardist was playing because he would want to see how he's got the organ set up
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:51.440]   Like what about the slider settings are to duplicate that sound so i'm sure we're seeing a lot of that in these instruments
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.280]   Let me play a little uh d what is this d minor? That's e
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.640]   Can you hear it? You can't hear it. It's so low. You can't hear it. I went on with the lowest octave
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.120]   Listen to that sustain
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.120]   If it were playing you could hear it
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.040]   I don't know man. I know something's going on now. I can't play anymore. I was playing
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.600]   Oh, well really cool and uh
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:18.080]   Yeah, cancel you know, it's going to take you a while and some considerable disc space to download all of the loops because they give you
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:24.160]   Gigabytes worth of free loops. It's really awesome. Really great. No, it's me. I think because i'm not seeing the uh
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.120]   I don't know what's going on
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.320]   Uh, all right now we get to iTunes
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.720]   because
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.360]   So so first of all we talked last week
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:40.800]   Uh, and I was I was really I want to kind of not blame the user
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.360]   It's really easy to and so I was really quick to say
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.360]   I'm not going to blame
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:50.160]   Jim dallerimple knows what he's talking about. I'm not going to blame. I don't know uh james pink stone
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.040]   Uh, but if if a user says look I did this and apple deleted my music
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.400]   I'm not going to assume that that's the error on the on the user's part
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.640]   We certainly and you showed this serenity show that uh jason snell tweeted it
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.600]   There are very confusing dialogues that could easily
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.840]   Cause you to inadvertently delete your music and I think that's likely that that's what happened
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.280]   Was it making you create the manner created the program that wanted to create the program to delete their music?
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:18.800]   Yeah, so it's it's likely it's not you know, but nevertheless apple and apple
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:24.400]   I'm actually thrilled with apple's statement, which is we're not going to blame the user
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.040]   We can't they said we can't reproduce it
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.600]   But we're going to keep trying
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.080]   Because a very small number of people are reporting this
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.200]   And we're not going to assume that it's their error
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.000]   We're going to make sure that because it could be a bug in iTunes
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.280]   We really don't know
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:43.760]   They did say we're going even though they couldn't they couldn't find the bug and couldn't reproduce it
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.120]   They are going to make itunes safer and that's this release, right?
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.920]   Right. So what is safer?
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.000]   Do we know yet?
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:52.800]   I don't think we know yet
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.520]   I have I assume and this is probably based on a lot of serenities reporting and jason snell too
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:01.920]   Is is that they are making those dialog boxes much more clear when you're actually doing something
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.240]   And and I think that's something that's necessary, right?
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:08.000]   Like like you I don't want to immediately go to the blame the user's place
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.800]   Although at the same time it did seem like in that this was a circumstance where something was deleted
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:18.240]   Maybe not intentionally, but certainly not without clicking some sort of dialogue
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.560]   Um, but but it should be very clear when you're deleting something off of your computer
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:26.800]   If it's removing it from your iCOD library that it's going to be lost and gone forever
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.040]   That this is actually you really want to do this
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.920]   I mean that's a circumstance where you should probably have a second dialogue box
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.160]   Are you really sure you wanted to leave this for my cloud?
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.120]   You know, I mean that might be annoying if you're trying to remove a duplicate album
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:42.240]   But but make it an annoyance that way rather than having someone risk losing, you know
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.280]   Um years and years worth of music from their library. Yeah
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:50.240]   Yeah, it is it really is a systematic problem because uh, you know, it's fair to explain this really really well
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.800]   You have a primary mac which is the mac with your music library
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.960]   Which you uploaded to uh, where apple music matched off of when you first set it up or iTunes match
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:01.520]   Mashed off of and it has physical versions of your albums on it when you're and your songs on it
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.320]   But then you might have a mac book as well and you're traveling and it only has apple music versions of those songs
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.360]   So if you delete the song there, it's just removing the record to apple music
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.160]   But that is essentially gone and you no longer see any tracks on that
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.560]   Where on your primary machine if you delete it, maybe you're just deleting the apple music reference
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.960]   Maybe you're deleting the physical file. Maybe it's moving to trash
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.120]   There's just so many states that it becomes almost where you want to fall down on the floor in a fetal position
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:29.200]   And just say make it simpler. Make it simpler. Well in honor of jim dalrymple. I've downloaded rock and roll ain't noise pollution
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:37.600]   And uh, so it's was downloaded. It was a match song. It's downloaded now and now what what would we like to do
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.240]   to simulate
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.480]   Uh, these should I just try to delete it? Yeah, try to delete it. It's matched
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:51.040]   Yeah, all right. So let me let me now there's two choices by the way, which immediately is confusing remove download and delete
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.680]   Yeah, that's removed download is like a cat
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.160]   Exactly removed download would remove it from the cache but keep it in your library where it's delete
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.840]   Well, wait a minute. I don't know is that the case? So if I remove download
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.640]   Now I don't have the song anymore. It's until in my downloadable
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.920]   It's exactly it's still in it's still in your library and if you double tap I click on it. It'll still play
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:16.080]   Oh, no, I don't think so. I don't think so remove download. I
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.120]   Now you're saying if I double tap this it'll play
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:24.320]   Even if I click it it'll still play it'll now stream it. It does well. It's streaming it though. Okay, it'll stream it. Yeah
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:30.000]   Now so I'm gonna so I am gonna download it now. So that's different because now it's on the hard drive in fact
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.360]   I could now show and find her and I would see
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:39.440]   A song. Yeah, all right. So let's go back here. Now. I'll take the other thing, which is delete
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.880]   Are you sure you want to delete this copy of the selected song?
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:47.280]   The song can still be played but will be deleted from any devices that synchronize with this computer
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:53.520]   And that so this is new I think right? This is a new dialogue box and then there's a checkbox that says also hide this song
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:58.800]   Yeah, hiding it will hide it from my available downloads. It's still not intuitive
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:04.560]   Yeah, it's a lot intuitive. So if you delete it then I think without hiding it. I think it'll now remove the file
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.680]   But how is that different from remove download?
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.040]   Remove download just means it won't locally be stored
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.680]   All right, I'm gonna delete the song
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.760]   Oh, do you want to move the selected song of the treasure keep it in the iTunes media folder
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:22.640]   Okay, you see the confusion here because I thought I was deleting it
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:27.120]   And now it's saying you could keep it in your iTunes media folder. What am I deleting it from?
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:32.960]   From you're deleting it from map on music. Oh, that's not what I want. I wanted to delete it from my computer
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:37.360]   Okay, that's the case and you just remove the file physically you remove download
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.160]   That's where you did delete and I say move to trash and then empty your trash
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:45.200]   If you move to trash empty trash grenade then that will actually
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:49.360]   My cloud so if you wait a minute. So if I okay, so I okay
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.080]   colon backslash
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.000]   If I delete this
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.360]   Okay, so if it's not downloaded it just says it will it will hide it from your iTunes purchases. That makes sense
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.400]   Now I'm gonna delete it if I delete this song
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.440]   move it to the trash
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.960]   it's
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:10.480]   Looks the same as if I said yes remove download
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:16.880]   Not lead it again Leo delete it again, but if I delete it again what happens
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.720]   It'll hide it but it can download it again
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:25.200]   Yeah, because it's matched so you'll do but now you won't keep your original DRM free copy
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:30.320]   You will get if you're not using iTunes using iTunes match. I think you will still get your iTunes match version. Oh, that's interesting
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:36.800]   Music and that's another okay now. I have two copies of the song even though I thought I'd moved it to the trash
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:43.120]   And one of them is copy protected and one of them is not maybe no and they're but not neither one is because I use match
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.320]   I don't use Apple music
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.480]   Can we drive your computer over to Craig Federighi's house?
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:52.560]   Had had I had iTunes music this would be an m4p not an m4a
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:58.800]   Yeah, you were in Apple music and you also did not subscribe to iTunes match if you subscribe to iTunes match and Apple music
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.800]   I believe and Renee correct me if I'm wrong on this
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.920]   I believe so too pretty confident this if you subscribe to both iTunes match super sees the app the iTunes music step
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:12.000]   And the only way that you have iTunes music files downloaded is if it is something that you added to your library from Apple music
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:18.640]   And you download that it'll and you don't actually it's not something that you purchased or uploaded
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:23.920]   That will be protected, but if it's anything so the reason so just this makes sense
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:30.560]   Yeah, protected files are so that when you stop subscribing to Apple music you don't have a copy you can play
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:35.600]   Completely exactly right otherwise you would have right unprotected music if you pay for match
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:41.840]   Right, you would just subscribe for 30 days for free or 90 days or whatever download all the music you want and then unsubscribe and then oh
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:46.560]   I bought all these free copies the problem is that because they still offer the separate match service
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:54.400]   Which is $25 a year which people like like I pay for that because I want a drm free copy of all my music in the cloud
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.320]   So that's why I pay that money. I don't really care about the matching so much as I want to upload
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:02.960]   Music from the that I purchased maybe from Amazon maybe from google
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.840]   I want to have it in iTunes available on all my devices
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:13.040]   If I did not pay for that matching service and I just paid for apple music apple music would still match those files and they put them in the cloud
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.280]   But when I left the service it would take all those files with it
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:22.560]   So if you don't want to lose any copies of your files that you've uploaded to the cloud to drm
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:28.720]   You have to pay $25 a year for iTunes match now just to make things even crystal clear
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:32.160]   What I just did and that's all I've done
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:37.200]   I now have three copies of rock and roll ain't noise pollution one in my trash
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.320]   Yep
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:42.480]   Two on my on my hard drive and one is uh the one in the trash oddly is
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.560]   Has the is the is the one with a one in the name?
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:52.160]   Which is it seems like anyway, I can't forget it. I see the problem is there's just so many states like you can have music
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:56.400]   And you all not completely apples fault. It's well. It no it is it's complicated
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.320]   They've allowed this system
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:04.400]   Yeah, and you can you can have stuff you've added to apple music but not downloaded things you've added and downloaded things that you've matched things that you've
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:09.280]   matched to apple music and then having to remove all these things is reversing all those states
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:15.600]   Which is just like any complex systems here. Here. Here's a crazy idea. Just just go with me on this guys
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.800]   What if?
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:23.840]   Rather than trying to replicate some sort of weird iTunes database library in the cloud that has all these states and syncs things with your devices
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.880]   What if you just were able to upload all your music to iCloud and then access them from all your devices?
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:34.160]   And if you delete it from iTunes, it still keeps it in iCloud unless you actually go into iCloud itself and delete it
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.160]   What if we did that wouldn't that be easier?
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.720]   You're you're describing. Yeah, I think
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:43.120]   You're describing my relationship with Amazon music that I feel is though I have
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.920]   Exactly. I mean, I I mean, I have everything
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:50.960]   I have a lot of cloud services that work and all of them are based on that model just just yesterday
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:58.080]   I was I was listening to eight hours worth of music. It was all being hosted by my house cloud off of my NAS
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:03.360]   With some music coming from my iPad, but mostly here is the truthful version of my music library
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:10.480]   That's being fed through through an app and there's never there just never needs to be any question about where the source of a music file is coming from
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:16.080]   If even if it's as if it's as simple as and I've said this before if it's just a simple ab switch
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:20.240]   That says or if the if the contents of the window view actually
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:27.760]   Rotates around visually when I need I need a degree to say you are now looking at the truth of your library as I see it on the cloud
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.760]   Okay, well, let's revolve it around. Okay. Now you're looking at actual files that are on here
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:38.800]   So if you delete a file with this view realize that you are looking at an actual storage device that you're deleting files from
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:45.360]   Not here is some place where I'd like to be able to access this file from it's it's it's really this is the sort of thing where
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.080]   A good a lot of the new services
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:55.120]   I think do music a lot better than the old services because they have the ability to simply start from scratch and decide what makes sense
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:37:01.760]   In this world in which people have a very very malleable idea of what the source of a music file is
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.040]   No, I think you're taking my hand out of windows help me
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.080]   No, I mean totally I mean it's just to me though
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:14.320]   It just seems insane that you know we have iCloud and in iTunes match as a separate service from iCloud apple music is a separate service for my cloud
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:18.960]   Why not make iTunes match an iCloud part of it? You can up you can even count it against my iCloud storage
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:24.720]   I can upload all my music to iCloud. It'll be stored there. The only way it gets removed from my library
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:30.480]   For real is if I like like you say Andy I go into iCloud and I do it when that's that's how it works
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.480]   It's on Amazon makes me go into their web interface and actually delete those files
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.720]   But if I delete it from the app or or or something else, it's it's not getting rid of it
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.960]   It's just saying okay now it's locally not stored anymore
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:47.120]   And and and I mean I wrote a story last week how to fix apple music and one of those ways was separating it from iTunes
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.040]   And I feel like that's a big part of it, right?
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:52.400]   Like they need to like make it very clear if this is an iCloud
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.360]   This is an iCloud
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:58.800]   But the the the libraries need to be separate because it's becoming too complex and people are getting too confused
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:04.560]   And you have a situation where we're on this show we're all very max savvy people and we're getting confused by what these options are
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.800]   If we're getting confused, I can't even imagine someone who's coming at this without
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:15.600]   You know, lots lots of time backup strategies and and patience. I can't even imagine what their perspective is
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.280]   Yeah, this is for me that would really help with this is if you know exactly that happened
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:22.240]   But then people will run out of iCloud storage because we're putting photos in there
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.800]   So it needs some sort of front end really friendly interface
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.840]   So your device is out of storage or iCloud is out of storage of exceeded iCloud
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.440]   I mean you press a button and you're presented with a really good and easy to navigate
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.920]   And people have done this work before we know how to present this data
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.760]   Here's where all your iCloud storage is here's your music. Here's your photos click into this
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:41.040]   You can go in you can delete stuff you want to delete and just let you manage that stuff
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.360]   And then you don't have to worry about people running out of storage anymore
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:50.240]   The thing the the hard truth we need to confront is that this isn't like every single country with an air force in
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:57.280]   1952 trying to whatever your was before the the sound barrier was was breached trying to breach the sound barrier
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:02.080]   Other companies not only have done this, but they they've done it routinely
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.440]   Yeah, so you have so apple niece if apple's gonna solve this problem
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:13.440]   It's gonna have to ask itself why are much less funded and much less experienced companies than we
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:18.800]   Able to solve this problem, but we're not they have to basically decide they have to start from a big
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.920]   This sounds harsh, but i'm speaking in the broadest sense
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:28.160]   Oftentimes the only way to solve a really big problem that you even you personally have been trying to solve
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:33.040]   Is to start from a place of utter humility and say i'm going to some going to
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:37.280]   Cross-legged in the middle of an empty room, and i'm going to say i know nothing
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:43.280]   I have no experience and every idea that I have had about this is of no value whatsoever
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.800]   I'm going to look at the problem and i'm going to look at the pieces
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:54.480]   I have available and i'm going to build a new solution to the problem assuming that nothing that I was nothing that I think is the right idea
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:58.160]   Is necessarily the right idea that's the only way that apple's gonna solve this
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:05.440]   This is not the rumored update to itunes that we're going to see at wwdc. This is right now
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:09.840]   How much i mean that that so that would make sense
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:15.040]   Maybe that they would do a little bit here and then really address the problem with a complete update revision
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:19.760]   Guys it's so easy to sit here and just say they need like i would just say do a do over make apple music
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:24.000]   Get its own thing use it an opportunity to launch all new music apps that are like these music startups that
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.320]   But you take all the baggage that is itunes and people sinking on windows with ipod shuffles
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:34.640]   And leave them with itunes and slowly phase that out and start with this wonderful new app the way you did with final cut and and
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.320]   And uh, I work and all that
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.040]   Uh, I don't have to manage that whole business so it's easy for me to say but I think that's that's the opportunity here
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:46.800]   And that they're hesitant I understand because apple very seldom has to worry about moving hundreds of millions of people through platforms
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.960]   Usually it's much fewer than that and they can be really harsh
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.480]   But it seems like that we're getting down to where that is the way that you have to mix this
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.760]   No, I agree
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.880]   You have to separate this too
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.720]   I mean when I was when I was thinking about that when I was writing my my piece last week about that
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.960]   That was the conclusion I kept coming to and and what I kept thinking about was yes
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.640]   You probably will have to reproduce functionality because if you have a new apple music app
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:11.920]   You do still need to have it talk to your itunes library so that you can see your local files or your iCloud files or whatever
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.440]   And that's fine. That's completely okay. So you can reproduce functionality
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.720]   So I might be able to play you know music that I own in two places
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.240]   That's
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.920]   To me an acceptable compromise to the reality which is right now
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.040]   You've got one, you know albatross of an app that is terrible that does not work for anyone that is confusing
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:34.240]   That is making people not clear what's being removed and what's not and if you move everyone to a new app
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:38.720]   I mean that it's still talking to your iTunes library. You know that can still exist
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:45.680]   You can kind of start over as you're saying and that's something that that google amazon microsoft, you know spotify plex
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:50.480]   Um, you know insert name of music service here can do uh probably even title
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:55.280]   You know, I mean like literally everybody has been able to to do a better job with this than apple and and
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.520]   I think that's because
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.720]   They've been so afraid of letting go of itunes and that's understandable
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.840]   But the only way that this is when to get better is we start to you know
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:07.280]   The only fix the problem is if you start to extricate it from itself
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.680]   So we've got to start taking taking this thing apart
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:17.680]   Well, I think we're all in agreement that something something should happen. I think it's difficult to know exactly what but uh
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:22.480]   I'll tell you I'll just to wind things up. I'll tell you again yesterday
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:27.280]   I was I spent the entire day listening to music. It was not even spotify. It wasn't even
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:32.960]   Google music it was actually the streaming music app that works with my synology disk station
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:38.080]   Uh, so it's not we're not talking about even a company that does that does music for a living
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:42.720]   It's just people if someone has a a folder with music files on it
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:46.960]   We will give you an application for your ipad that will let you create playlists and find plays
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:48.960]   And as i'm listening to this music
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:53.760]   I'm realizing that I am enjoying this simple app way more than I am
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:59.840]   I ever enjoyed itunes in the past three or four years that that is that seems like a a really significant point that
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:04.320]   I've got probably six different apps on my uh, on my uh, my uh,
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.560]   my iowice devices that can play music and
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:17.040]   Itunes is absolutely number five on that list to the extent that I would much rather have a web app
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.720]   I've got a web app hosted elsewhere than use iTunes. I don't hate it. There's no hate involved
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:26.720]   There's just this is but if I if I have options to using itunes
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:32.000]   I will always use that option and that is a chilling thought about an apple product
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.080]   What's a better app
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.480]   Or program for makintosh
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.720]   If you didn't want to use itunes
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.280]   I mean one of the problems is that once itunes came out
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:46.880]   All the they bought first of all they bought the number one music player app and then all the other guys kind of guys
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:52.480]   Got out of the business. I own vox you like vox. I like vox. I mean it's not going to be as full featured
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:57.280]   It's not as great with playlists, but it's good. It plugs into soundcloud it plugs into last fm
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:01.360]   It'll play local stuff. It'll also play from your iTunes library if you want it to do that
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:05.840]   But they think that's a good app vlc actually is is a decent choice. I think for some people
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:10.720]   Um a lot of people use video land. Yeah, yeah because I was I was looking into this last week
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:15.200]   I was trying to to give somebody some advice on something and and about what app to use in place of iTunes
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:22.000]   And it's hard because you're right, you know, there used to be apps. Um, what was uh, what was dvd john's app that that used to uh,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.880]   Doubles with doubles wish double twist which was great. You know, is that gone? It's gone
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:32.160]   So there are a lot of these things don't exist anymore, but but vox is still around and that's that's a pretty good player
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:37.200]   Vox has another advantage which it could play higher bit rate music. Yes, you can
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:41.920]   So that's a passive question. Are you a regular vox user? I am
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.120]   Okay, I I had it running for months and months ago
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.760]   I think I actually had it as a pic of the week like last year or something
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.240]   And I liked it for it's a nice simple clean player
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:56.160]   But then it started doing something I couldn't get it to turn off and it's the I actually screenshot at it because I thought I thought
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:03.600]   I might be imagining it that I'd be working working working working working productivity productivity creativity creativity and so alert box
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:08.560]   What's the alert box vox is saying hey, why don't you take a break and listen to just one song?
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:15.840]   I said no, I'm working and you got me to stop working to try to entire and tice me to knock off work
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:20.400]   I couldn't find it sounds like it's it is funny. I'm not sure but but I was
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.680]   I can't I couldn't figure out how to turn it off
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:31.200]   And I got so frustrated that I tried to uninstall the program and the dialects are still coming
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:36.160]   This is one of the problems with vox is they have a service called loop that replay and and
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:43.120]   Unless you subscribe to that. I don't do you subscribe to that? I don't know I subscribed everything else, but I do not subscribe to loop
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:47.120]   Yeah, I mean that's basically replacing itunes match and itunes storage
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:50.880]   And yeah, I just want to use it as a plain old player
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.720]   Yeah, then that that's what I use it for and I I don't use the phone app
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:46:01.520]   Um, I use seshiam on on my phone, but but um here's a question for you guys because this is actually a bit a bigger concern
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:06.720]   Do you know of any apps that make it possible to sync songs to your phone with other than itunes?
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:11.200]   You know, are they're good apps mean I know I you know phone do you ix or used to kind of let you do that?
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.480]   But they need a point of double twist one away. That's what I used it's gone
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:21.040]   Yeah, you know, I was gonna say I believe it's the same company that has they they're focusing on android development
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.640]   So they used to be the the ios my favorite music player and
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:31.280]   People always hate it when I talk about things that aren't uh iphone, but the same makers have made an app called
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:34.160]   Called cloud player the really specific
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:41.360]   Specific thing and all it is is it's a really nicely designed easy to use music player
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:46.080]   That just simply asks you here are here is every cloud service known to mankind
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:49.360]   No to humanity which where where is your music library?
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:54.880]   On is it on is it on dropbox great? We will hook up to your dropbox. It's on your uh, your google drive great
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:47:01.680]   We'll put it there and it basically means that you are responsible for putting files in a place where i the music player can see it
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:05.360]   But once I can see it, I will organize it. I will organize it into
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.080]   Playlists and to people into albums stuff like that
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:14.480]   And anytime you update it we will I believe they're update that that database manually or you can or i'll do it automatically
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:18.560]   But you are just I will not see anything that you don't put into this directory
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:22.080]   But once it's there every device that has running this app will be able to see it
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:27.760]   Uh, and it's six six bucks since one of the best i just i would almost i would almost like to run
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:35.600]   Uh an android virtualization window and on my ipad if that's a if that's a feature of android and being able to
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.880]   Basically do do a remote screen sharing on android
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:46.400]   I would keep i would buy a nexus phone keep it plugged in and running just so i could run this music player on all of my ios devices
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:51.040]   Andy andy andy
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:55.120]   I know I know I'm brilliant. I have such perfect taste. Thank you for i don't say
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.240]   Technology, I'm sure i'm only saying but every single ios user is now saying
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:05.920]   Really really want to virtualize, uh android on our phones
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:09.200]   No, but you're you make a good point. I mean, but it is ridiculous
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:14.000]   So that the that we're we're willing to go through all these all these hoops just to avoid using itunes
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   Is I think we're really what it comes down to yeah?
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:22.240]   And I have to say is I have used vox mostly because I have high res music, but uh if if I were um
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.160]   Forced to use it all the time. I might hate it as much as i do itunes
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.240]   I this is a hard thing to do well
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.680]   It is it is
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:34.720]   I mean I have to say even though their desktop player has leave something to kind of be desired
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:41.840]   Um, I kind of both enjoy google plays um implementation, but also amazon actually i think amazon even though I i do that in the web
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:45.200]   Right you do it on the web, but they have like a desktop app which is kind of terrible
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.160]   But but it but it works. Okay. The web app is actually pretty
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.240]   Web app to me is everything I want for google anyway, uh and I
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.840]   Definitely for google, um, it's on the web and somebody has made a mac wrapper
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:59.520]   I think there are a few things on github where they've built google play things on the web
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.240]   I think it's fine amazon's desktop app is kind of terrible
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:06.640]   But at the same time it works pretty well. It has a good search for their library if you're a prime user
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:11.200]   You may have access to that stuff. I mean there so I have to say I mean there are some alternatives
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:15.920]   If you're willing to not use apple as as your cloud and you don't have to use apple as your cloud
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:21.120]   They're all these other services that'll let you do that including things like s analogy and plaques and and other tools
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:25.040]   There are some things you can do. Um, the the the problem is of course, you know
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:31.040]   There's nothing as easy as itunes and and you know, but but I think for a lot of power users
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:36.160]   A lot of us are looking at or not even power users, but just people who don't have time to deal with some with with itunes
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:40.240]   We're looking at alternatives and going, you know, maybe I will move all my music all my playlists
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.560]   Everything that I've been doing from this one app this one library to something else
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:48.160]   I'll tell you why google works because it's it was cloud first
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:53.920]   So I go to music.google.com and because I have already uploaded all my music to google
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.680]   I can look at my music library and I have all my songs. Can you show this please?
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:03.520]   I have all my songs in the google music library. I can listen to them without downloading them
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.400]   You know, they're they're all there, but I can also and then it incorporates
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:11.120]   All of the google streaming stuff. So google has like apple music style
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:16.000]   Music's a solution and they bought songs and stuff. So there's the radio
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.640]   There's the playlists, you know, there's and I feel like this because it started in the cloud and never had to deal with this whole notion of
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:27.360]   In fact, it doesn't even acknowledge that you have music stored on your computer
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.160]   You play it from the cloud you can cash it
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:33.840]   But you don't but you don't have to manage it or pay attention to it particularly
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:37.760]   Wouldn't it be great if it's synced with google photos and that way whenever you look at the picture it played the music
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:41.920]   You were listening at the time you took that photo and just google it's only a matter of time
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.920]   But three I know
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:46.720]   Wait 24 hours
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:51.600]   They already released the big app that could have taken up 20 minutes of that
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:54.960]   But yeah, I looked at there is a plug-in if you subscribe to google music
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.280]   It's just a plug-in that you have on your desktop that
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:04.640]   It just keeps the cloud library synced with your iTunes library and because for all of the faults of the Amazon mp3 app
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:10.240]   It will also every time you buy Amazon music are automatically downloaded and put exactly so so
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:15.760]   Basically every time I buy something on am on Amazon mp3 that app automatically downloads it
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:18.880]   And then the google helper automatically puts it into google music
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:21.520]   And so
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.760]   Exactly triple back. I've got the local
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:32.080]   And I've also got like something running on my NAS that automatically keeps the NAS version of my library backed up to there
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:37.760]   So I think that that's I think this is the reason why I haven't had one of those really horrible experience with apple music because
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.320]   They would have apple
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:46.960]   It must tim cook would have to really hate me in order for iTunes to actually delete every copy of a music file app
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:52.400]   I would run utility away from a complete circle Andy where every every music file is duplicating to every service and opportunity
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.080]   I am with my photos
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.080]   Absolutely
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.240]   Here and then it's just it adds that same photo forever
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:03.920]   Yeah, I'm looking for the singularity of Diana Domra albums where all the every device becomes a
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:08.080]   Something that can host and play a day on a day on a day on a dollar. I was at a third party
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:12.480]   I thought google made an app that would I know amazon makes an auto uploader a google doesn't know
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:17.840]   That's google music that's an app from them right? Yeah, it'll actually appear in the toolbar
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:22.800]   Yeah, so that's really I mean you can do it also in the web, but I mean it's really handy to have
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:26.160]   Um something looking at your iTunes library
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:33.920]   And and syncing it and make it with that's not iTunes so no matter what happens one way one way syncing the idea that it will never ever
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.520]   Delete anything from a locally hosted library
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:42.080]   It will simply copy things from it to an off-site library and then whatever you do to that library
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:48.640]   Maybe apples considering that because we've seen the rumor although denied by apple that they're going to eliminate the next couple of years downloads
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:53.440]   I mean really a lot of the problems apple has is because it's legacy right it's supporting it
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:55.520]   Just to support all these old ways of doing things
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:58.880]   Yeah, they deny that they're going to be getting rid of downloads
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.600]   And I honestly think that it's too soon for them to be talking about that
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:04.240]   I mean at some point it's at the revenue costs
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:07.120]   Are are lower than the upkeep costs?
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:15.040]   Maybe they'll consider it, but I honestly can't see them getting rid of of offering downloads or whether they're their old purchases or new purchases
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:18.560]   Because why cut off a revenue stream that's working for you
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:24.720]   Rabelle and decide they want to own their music again in the service that still provides downloads will be a differentiator for that
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.800]   You know new hips those days are gone
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:31.440]   But also you have to actually you know, I'm expecting I've been mentioning twice now that but
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:35.360]   I'm doing the basic burn the entire my house down the ground all the way
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:39.200]   As well because with the big house cleaning in I've got a stack
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.960]   I could I'm not going to go and get it
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:46.160]   But literally this high of still shrink-rept CDs that I bought from Amazon because what?
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:49.920]   CD because sometimes there's there's a you're i'm about to buy an album
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:54.640]   mp3 album for like 10 bucks and there's a little sidebar when i'm about to buy so by the way
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.840]   We can sell you the physical CD for eight dollars
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:03.200]   And that will we will also automatically and we will automatically deposit all the mp3s into your account
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.520]   Absolutely, you never need to rip it exactly
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:08.320]   So i'm listening to the album and then two days later when i give oh, that's right
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:12.640]   Now I have now I have a delts new album, which I will then put one more thing new move
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:17.360]   Instead of a drive lio. This is a new off-site backup. Yeah, so i'm sorry
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:22.320]   So i'm sorry by the way why buy music on amazon because it's like kind of an automatic
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:27.200]   Way to get it around getting on a attraction amazon. Yeah, I have to say
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.920]   It would also be and I agree with christina
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:35.120]   I doubt that there's a financial incentive for them to like go to go to streaming only but also
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:39.600]   That may be under pressure from the record industry to do that. Well, that's that too
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:44.880]   But they wouldn't want to do that. No, especially not the indies because they like they like that 10 bucks. Yeah, you're right
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:45.920]   Totally
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:48.880]   But but I also have to admit that that would have to be like
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:51.440]   unless imagine an electric car company
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:56.960]   Failing to produce a car with range of greater than 120 miles and then saying
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:01.600]   Okay, we're just going to say that this is a 120 mile car
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.320]   as opposed to
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:12.000]   Saying it would be it would be terrible to make that statement that we do not know how to do this or we don't philosophically
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:18.400]   We can't adjust our thinking to sell to sell and serve music the way that almost everybody else does it
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:23.840]   They would it's not possible for them to go ahead and say that because I know that they can't I know that they can't do it
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:25.520]   I'm not I'm not angry with you apple
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:28.880]   I'm just slightly disappointed but I know that slugger you're going to pick yourself up
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:35.040]   And you're going to make an even better music service than ever and remember apple has an as a someone who's official job title is jimmy
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:41.360]   And he probably is not too keen on annihilating the download business. Yeah, I guess you're right. I guess that would be kind of silly, wouldn't it?
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:45.440]   Yeah, I'd love to hear that that I'd like to hear him in that conference room when someone announces that
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:48.160]   Right. Oh, totally
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:54.560]   I mean, I mean, I think I think I think idea is that at some point, you know in the future streaming revenue will
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:56:02.320]   It's for apple and the whole industry will will far outstrip digital sales, but you have to think they still sell vinyl and you have to think that you know
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:05.680]   There will still be people and artists who want to distribute
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:12.800]   Not just strictly through streaming services and so it helps when you are the number one music marketplace to still continue to be in music marketplace
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:16.640]   So I don't I mean we're talking five years down the line a lot of things could be different by then
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:23.200]   But I just I think even even bringing up the idea that they're going to be stopping doing that and at this stage is far too early
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:29.120]   You uh, you've heard dueling banjos ladies and gentlemen tim cook and it's dueling by in
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:32.000]   A little chinese music to take us out
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.120]   as we uh take a break
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:39.440]   It's good on the con
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:43.920]   See I love this
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:46.720]   I think it's great music
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:53.200]   It takes a little getting used to because it's dissonant to the western ear, but I think it sounds great and look at their plays playing it
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:57.520]   God they're so close to having a theremin
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:04.400]   They have a theremin if not they need to have what they invented the theremin a non-electronic theremin
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:09.760]   Yeah, I think some of the chinese is because they don't have threats. So it's very it is very fluid
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:13.360]   There you go
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.640]   Down
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:16.640]   Get down
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.040]   dueling bien our show and we're going to talk about

[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.840]   Chushin the new ride sharing
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:29.120]   Apple put a billion dollars into that and then warm buffet put a billion dollars in an apple so it all you know
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:34.800]   Pay for dds what we're saying. That's what happened. Yeah, we're gonna take a break come back with more great panel christina

[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:06.720]   Although some have reported incidents apple tv we mentioned there's an update there's an apple watch update also
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:12.160]   No, they did that there is yes everything everything all the things leo all the things got updated
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:17.280]   Okay, that they're doing that a lot more which is fine with me. Keep it up to date same software stack
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.680]   Cross most of the stuff now. Yeah, it might as well, right?
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.920]   um
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.920]   so uh
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:27.840]   Apple just bought apple really is very interesting how apple
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.480]   in their presence in china, but you don't usually think of apple investing in
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.040]   Kind of companies that aren't in their specific field dd
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.200]   choo shing
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:44.160]   Is the uber of china and apple just put a billion dollars?
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:48.240]   Into it a billion dollars into it
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:53.120]   Now remember they have hundred more than a hundreds of billions of dollars overseas
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.720]   They can't repatriate without paying taxes on it. So it's in their interest to invest internationally
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:03.120]   It's kind of like me putting 50 bucks into wealth front. I mean just to give you some sort of you're right for them
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:08.640]   It's not you know, and you think it's a pure investment for them. It's not there's not a partnership play or anything like that
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.400]   I mean there might be
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.480]   I mean because I don't think it's a partnership play right now. I'll pay I think it's alay. Wabapay
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.560]   That would make sense. Yeah, well, that's that that's what dd uses um over there
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:22.960]   So I don't even know if they could get into the I mean they might eventually want to see they could get into the payment space
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.720]   But I don't even think that's a primary consideration. My thought would be two things one
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:30.480]   Um, let them make some outside investments that would probably pay off
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:35.120]   Well, dd is a company that has actually ironically invested in lift in the united states
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:39.520]   But owns the has the vast majority of the wide-chain market in china
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:44.800]   Um, it is capitalizing a lot of other areas probably is is just a good on paper investment
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.160]   And then it helps them maybe get some insight into the chinese markets
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:52.560]   Um, and maybe even test the waters a little bit like they they unlike a lot of other companies
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.480]   Don't have a venture capital arm
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:58.400]   But this could maybe be kind of a precursor for them doing something like apple
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:03.440]   It's a good point google has a lot of money invested in a lot of companies through google ventures apple doesn't do that, huh?
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:09.360]   Yeah, well, I mean this is also china and apple china is an incredibly important markets apple that has recently become
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:13.760]   Uh, I don't know what the right word for it is, but you they've had more protectionist movements from china
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.280]   They've had struggles to move as much product is anticipated in china
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.280]   Have a good way to make nice you think
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:24.320]   Well, so yes, so there's a lot of people who are wondering whether you know china sort of held out their hand or apple held out their hand
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.960]   But either way it seems like this helps a lot of hands get together
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:32.320]   Which is something that is not uncommon in many me and alix was talking about this last week in terms of having to build things in the
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:39.520]   Country where you want to manufacture and you know apple apple's partner foxcom bill factories in brazil because brazil has exorbitant import fees
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.680]   Uh apple already has all the factories in china
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.840]   There's a lot of business being being taken place there
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:48.160]   But not the sort of business of china's interested in which is the infrastructure the servers the software the products
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.360]   This is all that kind of thing
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.400]   So this is beyond anything else and yet could be a good investment
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:56.720]   It could be a way to to get extra data although they collect a lot of data from my phones already
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:02.240]   But in many ways apple previously was apple doing business in china and this is now apple actually be
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:05.120]   It's sort of the best analogy i can come up with is if you want to learn a language
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:06.560]   Like if you want to learn chinese
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.960]   I can go to a local college and I can speak it a little bit
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.240]   But if i'm speaking it around english speaking people i'm only going to get so good
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.200]   If i actually go to china and live there for a year or two
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:19.600]   I'm going to get really good at speaking chinese and this gives apple the opportunity to in many ways get
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:25.040]   Savvy or about local businesses including all the politics of them and in a way that has to happen not that would be nice to happen
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:29.040]   Yeah, I everything that christina and rene has said and i would add
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.400]   Uh
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:38.080]   This gives them a really harmless way to run a transportation service a transportation
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:40.720]   infrastructure where
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.560]   That's an interesting word transportation
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:47.120]   Yeah, that's a great point
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:51.520]   It's not just as simple as hey look we can get the data from the phones the drivers
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:57.040]   But we can find out here's there here's the legislative problems that we had that we're gonna that has to have to be solved
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.520]   Here's how to figure out how to entice people
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.640]   What situations which people will use this instead of that here's when traffic patterns go this way or that way
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.720]   But a lot of it is going to is just management
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:11.120]   So I don't it seems like a natural thing that if you don't want to you don't want to have
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:17.360]   You don't want to have your first foray into trying to be a transportation provider in the united states
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:22.000]   Work as well as apple music did it helps if you did that someplace
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.920]   Someplace out not that not that china is way someplace else, but uh, it's not an apple product
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:31.040]   It is a company that they are investing in
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:36.640]   And it's it there I think that pretty much every every time they write a check with that many zeros
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:40.400]   It really is about transportation as a future service. I think that's very
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:47.200]   Yeah, they have a lot to learn in that and you know, it's beginning more and more clear that they have aspirations that way great article
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.040]   Did we talk about this last week we might have in the about Avalon article?
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:55.680]   Apple is increasing their rnd substantially and when they've done that in the past
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:00.400]   It's usually because of a launch of a significant product. You know for a long time
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:04.880]   uh people like uh ben tomsen and john lewie guys say pointed out that apple spent
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:09.040]   Kind of a less on rnd than a lot of companies in the same
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:12.880]   Position is them and they still spend a lot less than even ibm
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:18.240]   But they're now on track to spend 10 billion dollars this year. That's up 30 from last year
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:24.160]   And four years ago. They were only spending three billion dollars a year. They have a lot more product lines now as well
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:28.960]   I mean so that's what's interesting. So this article by niel seibart says well
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:35.440]   It must be more than just researching better iPhones and ipads. It must be about a new product line
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:40.080]   He called it a pivot. I don't think that's a fair thing to say but an entry into a new category
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:43.600]   It's like apple has been exploring televisions and explore vr
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:49.280]   And they explore almost any product any pundit on any show could think that apple would maybe be interested in they have run
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.400]   Investigations research to velligence have things in the lab about it
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:55.360]   So this this is like I think niel's totally on point
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:01.120]   I think a lot of the pushback on almost totally on point two that cars are something different that cars is not about a small lab
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:03.520]   You know pizza building it's expensive inside the apple cat
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.720]   Yeah, there's a lot of things that have to go into making a project like this
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:12.560]   Yeah, but really stop stop thinking cars and start thinking transportation
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:16.640]   I really the more I look into this the more I'm convinced that
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:22.720]   I'm reminded that it's not that the iPhone was a better phone than the rest
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:29.280]   It's because it anticipated where everybody was going. It wasn't that this was people here is just another kind of phone
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.520]   Here is a way that
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:38.640]   Here is here is a device that understands why the phone before this has become so important why the blackberry really took off
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:46.480]   Why the palm really took off not let's copy this but here is what has happened to society to make a palm and to make a blackberry to a successful product
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:51.760]   A car is a better version of a blackberry. It's a better version of a palm
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.480]   there's a but we
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.640]   Society is in a place where
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:02.640]   It has changed in our attitudes about where we are and how we get from here to there
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:10.160]   And the need to get from here to there is fundamentally changing and the first company that creates an iPhone for transportation
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:16.720]   Is going to be as successful as apple was when they created the iPhone of communications and information
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:24.720]   So don't it so again it could be as simple as we want to create a green lane on every single highway and a class of
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.400]   Transportation devices that are more suited for short hop transportation
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.920]   If it if apple does if apple makes an apple watch
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:35.360]   As opposed to an iPhone they're not going to do well
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:41.440]   But if they make an iPhone in this space where it's not just hey, we decided we saw tesla make a nice electric car
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:46.400]   Now we've made an electric car see it's a car and we put an electric engine instead of instead of a gas engine
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.720]   That's not a big idea and that's not gonna that's not listening to how society is going
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:58.080]   If they figure out how to create something that makes people not want to use their cars anymore and use this other device or this other infrastructure instead
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.440]   That's what will be the big thing for them. And I really think that's what
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:04.480]   Not just apple, but everybody is trying to invest in
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:07.520]   Yeah, I think that's one of the key points is that when apple was making the iphone
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:11.280]   Everyone was sort of focused on blackberry blackberry famously thought no one wants an iphone like that
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:16.400]   They want keyboard and they want data compression and you know google was busy copying blackberry and windows
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:19.520]   Mobile and no key we're all doing the same thing and apple did something fundamentally better
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:26.720]   Because they anticipated when things like lte and things like it was just the confluence of technology is really favored apple's model for the iphone
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:31.440]   But now we have a market where you know google is building a car amazon might be building a car that'll give you
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:35.040]   Discounts if you deliver packages on the way uber is building a car
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.720]   Tesla is building a car
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.560]   So there are all these companies that are really savvy
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:42.240]   It's not just apple alone ahead of the pack that's going to redefine what the experience is
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:46.480]   I mean, maybe they will in terms of a service or a partnership, but in terms of raw technology
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:49.280]   There's a lot of people working at this and that means it's going to be a much more
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:53.360]   Competitive much less open to an apple style disruption market going on
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:59.040]   But there's a lot apple can do within the value of their ecosystem that if you are an existing apple customer that they could maybe secure
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:02.320]   At least a better beachhead going into that than a lot of other companies will
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:05.040]   Might be hard though
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.920]   You know, I mean you also have to think I mean by making this investment
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:12.640]   You have to think that one of their ultimate goals has to be if they are creating a car at some point
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:16.080]   It's be a great way to get a fleet of your cars whether they're self-driving or not
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:19.200]   Adopted by your partner who has invested a billion dollars in you
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:25.200]   You know, I mean that there are or you know because uber and lift are obviously both very much thinking about self-driving cars
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:29.360]   You have to think the didi is as well and if that's the direction apple's going in and you know
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:35.600]   Having information about how logistical patterns work and and how driving patterns working anticipating what demand is going to be
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.840]   And having the ability to maybe build that into your car from the ground up could be interesting too
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:42.640]   We're gonna take a break because we got to get Christina out of here
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:47.680]   And I want to give you a chance Christina to do a pick of the week before you have to go in about eight minutes
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:54.640]   All right. All right. So think about what you want to tell people about and I'm going to tell you right now about wealth front if you are
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:57.200]   uh, young person
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:03.600]   An old person or someone in the middle you all we all need to save for the future
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.560]   You want a future don't you you want your kids to go to college? You want to buy a house someday?
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.840]   You want to retire?
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:14.400]   So you got to put money aside, but the key is putting it aside smart doing it smart
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:20.960]   And uh, I'll tell you putting a savings account even a certificate of deposit. That's not smart. It's not growing
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:26.640]   Uh hiring an advisor to run your money for you. That's expensive might be smart, but
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:31.840]   You're gonna put between one and three percent of what you've got on your investment in their pocket not yours
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:37.040]   And of course, uh, you could do it yourself. You're smart. That's what I thought I read these books
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:42.640]   All of them and invested the money then the problem is you get busy life goes on in 10 years later
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.600]   What happened to that money? I put away
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:54.960]   Let's do it better. Let's do it smart with wealth front wealth front is computer trading. It's not day trading. It's for long-term investments
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:59.600]   But it's doing it the right way and and they don't just check in every
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:01.920]   quarter to rebalance your
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:07.680]   Uh stuff because it's a computer. They do it all the time. They're always rebalancing and uh, you know evaluating
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:14.880]   Doing things like tax loss harvesting to increase your return while reducing your tax bill. These are these are things that are
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:17.360]   basic fundamental
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:23.520]   Well-known things, but but you know you forget to do or you don't do or you didn't know about even your advisor
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:26.560]   May not be doing it very often. He's got other clients too
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:32.080]   And the best part is they're only taking a tiny fraction one quarter of one percent
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:36.880]   Not one two or three percent of what you have on an investment, but one quarter of one percent
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:42.320]   Per year and there's never a commission transaction fee. No hidden fees at all
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:48.320]   Now, I look you got to go to wealthfront.com/macbreak and read up about it read about their advisors
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:53.440]   The the theory behind this it's really smart software getting smarter all the time
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:59.200]   You've probably seen the articles by traditional investment advisors in the wall street journal elsewhere
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:04.560]   They're terrified because frankly these guys the computers do it better. I hate to say it
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:09.920]   They do wealthfront.com/macbreak no wonder they got three billion dollars in assets under
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:15.760]   Management right now and they could have some of yours the minimum investment is as little as $500
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:20.640]   Again, I want you to read up in fact. They've got some nice free things you can go you can go right there and go through the
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.760]   Questionnaire it's very short. They have a very
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:30.320]   Streamline process of figuring out what your risk tolerance is what your time frame is your goals are
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:35.120]   They'll give you a free portfolio right then and there so you can see what the process is
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:37.920]   And if you want to take it and walk you could do that
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:47.200]   They also will look at your existing portfolio if you want and tell you if you're overpaying for fees if you're not fully diversified and so forth
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.720]   So this really this is all free
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:53.760]   Once you have a wealthfront account, you can also put all your other accounts in there
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:59.120]   So you have a single dashboard that tells you how everything's doing your bank and your brokerage accounts all your investments everything

[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:59.840]   It uh, it's a new kind of social network. It's actually a really beautiful app
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:04.320]   And i've been using it for the last week or so and i'm really enjoying it
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:10.480]   It's a really good way of finding discovering things and if you find something that you like like a tv show

[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:36.800]   I i've talked to the developer a little bit and um, they've got a great kind of team of people involved a lot of artists
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:43.680]   And and and creators have have picked it up. So rex is my pick of the week. I really like it really like that

[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.880]   Yes, plug something

[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.360]   You can find that at a relay.fm/rocket nice
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:15.040]   Great to see you, Christina. Thank you for being here. All right. Take care. Renee richy pick of the week, sir
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:19.200]   Oops, he's muted. We muted him
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:23.120]   Are you there? I muted myself. I apologize. Okay. No, that's good
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:29.280]   Um, so I was talking about this delicious coffee that I was making earlier and this is this is tangentially related to apple because
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:32.400]   There's a method to how I make coffee now. I'm just gonna grab it over here
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:36.800]   So I use an arrow press now. Oh, you finally joined the krill of club
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:44.240]   I have to think it's been recommended on mac break weekly specifically before because as everybody knows apple and coffee go together really really well
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:48.320]   The more coffee you drink the later you can say i don't know if we've ever made it a pick here, but god knows
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:51.360]   I'm a believer. I own several of them
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:57.040]   I love it because you know, I I cannot for the life of me fathom out how to use an express an espresso machine
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:02.160]   Uh, people have shown me pour over. I'm too impatient for pour over. I can't just stand. I want the coffee now now now
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:07.200]   I don't want to sit there impatiently. There's nothing zen about it to me coffee is about getting caffeine delivered
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:11.280]   But I want really good caffeine. So I got the arrow press and I've been using it for a while
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.720]   And it's really is great. You just put the filter into this little
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:20.640]   Trae here and it is made by the same people who made that erobe frisbee. So I mean they know how to make plastic
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:24.640]   Uh, you can you tighten it up then you take the coffee you put it inside
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:30.640]   You add a plunger you push down and it uses air pressure to extract what is really really good coffee
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:35.760]   If you if you just fill it up you might get something equivalent to an espresso add some hot water
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.840]   You'll get something like an americano
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:40.320]   It doesn't froth milk for you, but if you want to froth your own milk
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:45.760]   You can easily make a cappuccino or a latte or a flat white or anything like that and then you can just I made uh
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.480]   some ice coffee, so I'm just
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:52.320]   It's awesome. I put some ice and mint and I filled it up with this coffee
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:57.040]   And it's fantastic. It takes no time. It is super easy to clean up and it's cheap awake
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:02.080]   It's like it's super cheap. It's nothing. That's why we have a travel one. We don't travel
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:05.280]   We don't go on a because you know, you can get bad coffee sometimes. Yes
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:10.800]   Shock care everywhere you can get every hotel in the world service back office. So we bring the arrow press
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:14.640]   And we and you know, we I'm in charge of
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:16.960]   Finding hot water
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:21.920]   It's the best thing ever uh and a lot of connoisseurs a lot of coffee connoisseurs say this is the way
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:25.840]   If you want to really taste coffee to make it
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.640]   It's so different especially if you I subscribe to blue bottle
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:33.520]   Which was formerly known as tongs and some other people have local roasteries that they really like if you get fresh coffee
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:37.760]   You just grind it you put it straight in use a nice burr grinder because we're not animals here
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.840]   And then you just you've made you fill up your coffee
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:47.360]   You plunge it down and it is it is better that you will stop wasting all your money at starbucks and have more money to spend on apps and devices and things
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:51.440]   It's on amazon. It's uh, it's like 2995
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:57.760]   Um, you buy more filters when you run out, but there is the least expensive way you could make coffee
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:01.840]   And they're tiny filters. They're not giant filters that you don't use half of because you're busy
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:06.480]   Yeah, there's not a lot of waste. I have to agree with you. The only thing I worry about is this plastic
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:11.200]   Uh, and you're pouring boiling water in it, but I don't know if that matters. Does that matter? I?
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.200]   I pour so much water so much plastic
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:19.280]   The other stuff will take me out. I mean I have I have radio waves passing through my skull all day
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:25.360]   I know I know. Yeah, no, I love this and it really makes a great cup of coffee good recommendation the arrow press
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:32.080]   Ironically it is from the fake frisbee manufacturers araby and nobody knows about it because they don't they're not really in stores
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:35.440]   You have to kind of order them online some some high-end coffee stores will stalk them
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.040]   But most people just never hear about it
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:41.760]   So they get the kind of coffee that burns on the bottom where the kind that takes forever to make or they really expense a machine
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:47.440]   That is too much trouble to use and this is so simple. I once counted I have more ways of making coffee than I have computers
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:51.280]   I have like 15 ways and you know, we have a coffee station and I have
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:53.840]   15 ways
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:58.720]   Every way possible making coffee and this is my birthday. Georgia got me the boat. I'm that uses the fire induction
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:02.960]   You can't it sucks. I I've used it once or twice, but it looks beautiful
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:06.160]   Yeah, it looks like you're making meth
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:13.520]   Mm-methamphetamine, but I have I have a cold coffee drip solution that does really look like a chemistry lab all of that stuff
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:17.440]   The thing about this is it's easy to clean. It's fast
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:23.600]   You know and it sometimes a lot of times getting that caffeine right in the vein as quickly as possible
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:26.720]   I have a central line Leo. I mean I want I go from it's a priority
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:32.960]   It lets me go from wanting coffee to having coffee at ridiculous speed. That's probably the best reason to get one of these
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:39.200]   We have more love of the studio too. Yeah, these are great good recommendation. Thank you, Renee
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.200]   Andy and I co your pick of the week
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:46.160]   My pick is uh is simple. It's an I it's an ipad sleeve
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:49.440]   But is the it is the only ipad pro sleeve that has
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:52.960]   Has earned the end you not go seal of of nitpiginas
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:21:00.160]   Because I don't there are a lot of there a lot of like sleeves that will you can get that you can get the ipad inside it
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:05.360]   But it's too big because it's designed to hit there's a whole all kinds of different ipads
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:10.400]   Tablets or it's not designed for it's or they took a guess at the dimensions
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:17.200]   Which is the reason why I was using a camera wrap because I like to be nice and snug and this is this bin pad
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:21.280]   The cat is called the cash. It's also available. I think for smaller sized ipads
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:28.720]   But the ipad pro slits into it with almost no fuss whatsoever. There is no velcro here, which is unnecessary
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:34.160]   There is just a long tab that you just fold in and now you have your perfectly nicely protected hundred
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:40.000]   $1,000 piece of metal in glass that you can then drop in your laptop bag and if you drop it
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.560]   You drop your laptop bag. It will be nicely protected
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:48.880]   It's thick enough to give you some protection, but not so thick that becomes like traveling with the hyper
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:51.040]   Hypo allergenic pillow or something like that
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:57.840]   40 bucks, but if you looked at this it's really like all like all the bin stuff that I've been trying for the past month
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:01.760]   Really nicely made. I mean look at this seam. It's like double stitched here
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.320]   It's thick thick thick nylon
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:09.280]   It feels it feels like it's something that's really going to last you a long long time
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:12.240]   As opposed to something you're going to use until what you it gets
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:15.600]   Gets muffed up and about about eight months and then that's it
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:21.120]   Uh, I wish I knew exactly what these two straps were for I bet it's so that you could lash
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.840]   I don't know like you can use it. I can tell you you really want to know
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:31.120]   Tell me I like because tom bin I have many tom bin bags is this is not it's not just a sleeve. It's a solution
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:36.240]   Uh, so that integrates in to a larger tom bin bag
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:43.280]   You see it's part of the whole all right, right? So that's okay. They said they I made it
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.920]   I did a twitter question because I I mentioned like my
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:49.280]   I think my someone asked me a question about my favorite uh ipad bag
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:52.320]   And I said what it was because I I still loved my my Patagonia bag
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:57.280]   And someone said oh I like this one and then there's three people so many people came up with good suggestions
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:00.960]   I just said okay hashtag tell me your favorite ipad pro bag
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:06.960]   And enough people mentioned the bin bags that the bin company contacted me and said would you like to try some stuff?
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:10.400]   And then two big boxes containing pretty much everything they make
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:15.520]   Amen and I guarantee you not because they make that was it feels like thousands of it feel well
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.040]   It's too hickies
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:21.280]   I'll say that I get fourth time I mentioned the house cleaning one of the reasons is that and now
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:27.200]   As often happens huge boxes arrive and now I've got the house is just wall
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:32.800]   Around my box collection. Yeah, and it's like I need to find places to put all these boxes
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:40.000]   So so we have so uh there is there are other bags where if you want to take like a laptop out for inspection instead of having to actually take
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.040]   out of the bag
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:43.040]   There are two look at stuff. Yeah
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:46.640]   Now you're making me realize there are like some got a couple of rings inside the bag
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:52.400]   The actual big laptop bag so you can actually pull this out like a door and let it flop over with the
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:58.320]   Western flyer. I haven't read it's a beautiful bag and uh this thing you could carry
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:06.240]   They I mean this is actually luggage as well as you know and so the idea is to accommodate whatever kind of you know technology needs you
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:09.920]   Yeah, they sent me one of those two which I like it
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:15.440]   I like it. Yeah, I don't want to talk about any one of these things specifically until I've been using it for a while
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.680]   So that one's gonna have to wait until I actually take a trip
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:22.960]   Uh but it's as it turns out that is a bag that I kind of needed because there are a lot of times where I'm
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:27.680]   I'm gone for just two nights and unfortunately at one of those nights perfect address like a respectable
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:29.920]   Exactly what you want change of shoes. Yep, right?
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:33.840]   I've been using the restrado for years and I did her bone my former boss
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:37.680]   Uh who's now at the verge introduced me to them and they put out a new model where the pocket
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:40.160]   Things could fall out of the pocket and we tweeted about it
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:44.400]   And they're like, yeah, we know we're making a brand new model and they turned around and had one that was zipped closed
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:50.000]   Within I think a month or two used that for two years. It was it's just phenomenally good service and good quality bags
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.520]   Yeah, a lot of been bag manufacturers are really good that way
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:57.760]   There was a like I forget the manufacturer, but um they they sent me a bag to try out
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.200]   And then I said that's nice
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:01.920]   But oh I just really wish it had a strap right here
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:05.920]   And then two months later they sent me a new bag that had the strap right there
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:11.280]   That's now part of their product line that they said internally. This is known as the and you not go strap
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.680]   It's like the and it's like they're not go. They should make it a not go
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:18.640]   Well, they should make a lot of people who've had interrock with me
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:22.000]   It's that they should make it a not go strap because I would have used that on him about
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:29.280]   But but no, but that's that's why I love the the variety of bags because each one is a really specific
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:37.680]   Answer to an individual's question of what desk what thing do I have? I desperately wanted on in or around a bag
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:42.560]   What feature am I desperately missing on this bag? I spent 500 dollars for that's perfect
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:47.680]   Except for it doesn't have a place I can put this or it doesn't have a pocket on the outside where I can easily put something in and out
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:51.520]   And that's why you'll have two bags that are equally wonderful
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:58.640]   One is completely useless for somebody one is absolutely flawless and the only difference is that the the the bag that the the pocket
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:01.680]   That's perfectly sized for the sunglasses on one of them
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:04.240]   It's on the outside where you can get at it easily
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:08.240]   I don't know the one it's on the inside where it's protected against bumps and and slabs
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:09.120]   So
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:13.040]   If you like to it's like saying go go into go into any restaurant and just ordered
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:17.760]   Or order something order like a simple steak and you will find out here is what the chef thinks is wrong
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.920]   But everybody else's steak. There's the way they do it
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:22.480]   Steaks all the way down
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:30.720]   Good good recommendation bin is spelled b i h n t o m b i h n dot com and I uh, that's 40 dollars for the cash
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:35.680]   Incidentally, you don't know how how freaked out it was about five minutes ago
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:40.960]   But I was I was pacing in the URL and I saw the word cash and the oh damn it. I got out of the out of my
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:44.880]   Ls cash wait a minute get where's the actual official link that I realized? Oh, that's right
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:48.720]   It's called the cash so there will be the word cash maybe somewhere in the world
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:51.120]   I uh
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:54.480]   I'm looking now. I just see that they've created something called the empire bill there
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:27:00.320]   Which would allow you to add the horizontal cash for your ipad as well as a brain cell
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:03.040]   Which is the thing they have to protect your laptop
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:06.880]   These guys there you know the problem is they feed my fetish
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:09.280]   Yeah, which I well it's I don't know
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:13.440]   I will I will say in closing though having used bags for years and years and years and years
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:17.280]   The most expensive thing you can buy is a cheap bag
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:19.280]   I agree
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:22.240]   You can go you can go nuts and go stupid and pay a lot of money
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:27.920]   You don't have to pay but the difference between a hundred dollar bag and a two hundred dollar bag is a mess
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:32.560]   And maybe 10 times greater than the difference between a two hundred dollar bag and a five hundred dollar bag
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:37.760]   But once you once you at least get your hands on if you have a friend who spent 250 dollars for a good bag
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:40.000]   Like one of these bin bags you will say oh
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.880]   That's because look how thick this line alone is and look how it's actually lined up both sides
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:48.160]   And look how durable the zipper is and look how they're using all ykk
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:53.600]   Tabs and how their zipper pulls on both sides not just one and say oh, that's why
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:59.680]   That's why I buy a bag every nine to ten months as opposed to this guy who has had the same bag for five years
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:01.920]   The difference is pennies. Well, it is a day
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:05.200]   But then on the other hand if you have ten bags
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:10.480]   I confess coffee preparation problem
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:16.000]   Yeah 14 ways to make coffee 10 kinds of ways to carry my laptop. They're an aficionado Leo
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.800]   I'm aficionado. Yeah, connoisseur. Yeah
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:28.640]   Hey, here's something free that i'm surprised nobody mentioned. Have you played yet with gboard google's new keyboard for ios? Yes
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:32.880]   Yes, it's like use no other it's just done. Right?
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:37.680]   Yeah, just the ability to search for things within the keyboard
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:40.960]   Is just to access to search like so many times
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:46.080]   I'm having to flip between apps because I need to grab that thing or grab that picture or grab that URL as post
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:50.080]   Oh, I I guessing the the the key the keyboard instead says
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:52.880]   I'm guessing you were looking for this. Oh, thank you. Thank you
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:58.880]   The only negative and a number of people pointed this out is there's no voice dictation button as there is on android
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:03.600]   And that's I think probably an apple thing like apple wants to make sure you use the home button to launch syri
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:07.600]   Well, also, I mean like the keyboards are extensions so they have very minimal resources available to them
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:11.520]   Which is why they have to let some people get freaked out that it says, you know hit the share button
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:16.880]   And they think oh all my stuff is going to google no that just let's and I wish apple would clarify this and make that button more apparent
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:23.440]   But that also just means that the app can go the keyboard can go back to the app and pull more information than the extension itself to contain
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:26.960]   Right. So that's what's kind of cool if you have the google keyboard
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:32.400]   As I do on my apple notes program, uh, it looks like a regular keyboard. It's got auto correct
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.000]   Um, it has some you don't have to have a separate emoji keyboard
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:41.680]   It also has animated gifs and it will base those on the content
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:45.520]   Uh in your note, you can also tap that g thing and it will look
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.560]   Uh for stuff to match and you could do a search
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:51.920]   Uh and it includes not only the standard google text search
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:58.240]   By the way without leaving your note program or whatever but also image search and animated gif search
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:02.800]   So if you if you just you know you're saying I need more animated gif kitties
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:07.280]   I just can now I could put that in there and then you paste it in
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:12.800]   And you're the most interesting thing about this is apple spent years trying to disintermediate google from ios
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:17.360]   Like if you search you'll get i books recommendations if you search you'll like you could switch away from it
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:21.760]   You it'll go through serie. They'll do everything they can to stop queries going directly to google
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:25.920]   And then by making one fantastic keyboard suddenly everyone is sending everything back to google again
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:29.680]   And I love that because you're competing off quality you're not competing on the market lock-in
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:34.320]   And there are lots of settings. I mean if you're one of those people who wants all uppercase keys
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:38.240]   You know the old style app you can you can do that there's a ton of settings in here
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:40.640]   It's uh, I think I think
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:44.400]   It is has the same problem all third party keyboards have on ios
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:49.360]   Which is apple takes it back when even if delete the apple keyboard when you're entering a password things like that
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:54.720]   But um, you know this is this this is such a nice keyboard. I just as good as you can as you can
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:57.840]   I think it's a good ios. You guys agree. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:03.120]   It really does there are some places where you want simplicity and then there's some place where
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:07.840]   The culture of choice will just always make a better product and keyboards are right there
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:13.120]   I I really I really think one of the reasons why iPhones and ipads have gotten so much better in the past couple years
[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:17.680]   Is just simply that if you don't like x you have the option of replacing x with y
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:23.200]   Not system-wide, but at least the important places like the keyboard and this is it just goes to show you that
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:30.080]   This is not the sort of thing that you would think of unless you are a search based company that's used not not just based on search
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:32.400]   but it's also
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.320]   Has been spending years
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:39.440]   With online apps that let the manufacturer observe how people are working with information
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:44.800]   To see that well actually people usually do it this way. So why don't we make it easy for people to do it this way?
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:45.520]   Yeah
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:52.800]   Glide or swipe typing is built in emoji suggestions as you type it will if you want a happy face and type something happy
[01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:54.080]   It'll know
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:57.440]   Auto correction on a capitalization character preview. That's the pop-up
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:03.840]   I do wish there was a toggle that would let you switch between robado and san francisco because i'm one of those people who notice the difference in character
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:05.840]   Is robado is it yeah, yeah
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:09.600]   That doesn't mean type in san francisco, but the keyboard is in robado
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:13.120]   Yeah, it's just my brain sees two different fonts on the page and just keeps switching back and forth
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:18.320]   Yeah, not everyone cares. Yeah, that's because you're a designer. You see these things that we don't see
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:25.360]   See now you've got me once again picking up my my actual like google nexus phone that runs android
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:28.640]   And saying that no the new keyboard is not available. I
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:32.320]   It's
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:35.920]   It was it was released it was released a while a couple of weeks ago
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:41.440]   But app but google actually will just sort of say we will let the first 50,000 people have it
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:45.840]   And then the thousand it's it's one of the reasons why they don't have to do like a point
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:48.480]   001 update because they decided to
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:52.640]   Release it slowly to see what happens if people start mutating
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:55.200]   We put this in the water supply
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:59.040]   Did you get it because I don't have it on my androids? I guess you're
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:04.800]   Again, it just it was just check. I've been checking and it just arrived today as a as a bill
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.640]   Thing because
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:09.680]   Google technically doesn't have to make like there's no pressure to make this for android
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:13.440]   But they have a huge reward in making it for ios exactly in the search pipeline
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:15.520]   You're gonna be using the google keyboard
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:22.320]   Although I have to say android because they've had allowed third-party keyboards for so long has a very rich ecosystem of third-party keyboards
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:24.480]   Apple does now somewhat to
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:26.720]   Well, not not only that but just as a sidebar
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:31.520]   uh one of the problems that of the of the android ecosystem is that
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:36.960]   A company like samsung can reskin everything and make it look more like with samsung phone anything else
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:39.920]   So by releasing basically everything that makes
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:45.920]   The application launcher the photo system the the keyboard now all kinds of stuff are now just separate apps
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.920]   You can download into your phone
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:53.440]   No matter who makes it so you can make every phone look like stock android and also it means that now if they want to
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:58.080]   They don't have to push out a system update to update the keyboard. They can just update an app
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:03.520]   So it's it's one of the lot of reasons why android went from it sucks to
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:11.280]   Okay, it's good. It's not as good as the iphone to oh they solved so many of the pain points that now
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:15.440]   I really feel like i have a free choice and uh this sort of thing is uh is in there too
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:20.720]   Uh, i'm excited about a keyboard. I'm an idiot. I know gboard. No, it's awesome
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:22.960]   Gboard
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:28.320]   That's it's like that says my i got the apple to e is like oh my god. I've got i've got a upper and lowercase characters
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:30.800]   Yay, i'm excited about typing
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:37.200]   Uh, it's interesting google's releasing all a lot of stuff. They released a new uh social network called spaces yesterday
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:42.960]   Before google. I owe we will be covering the google. I owe keynote tomorrow starting 10 am pacific
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:46.080]   Uh 1 pm eastern times 1700 utc
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:49.840]   Uh, so our live coverage of google's keynote i imagine
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:54.560]   I don't think they've released everything but may they've released enough a lot of stuff ahead of time
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:35:00.080]   This is so unlike apple where they keep a lid on everything google's like kind of leaking all this stuff out
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:06.080]   Um, there must be no there all the Nutella waiting for nettrol. Yeah, wait there. They're also they're also encouraging people too
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:12.560]   They're also encouraging developers at iot use spaces for like just spaces is for io. Yes, exactly
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:17.680]   Yeah, it works great. I used i downloaded yesterday soon was available and i'm not
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:21.120]   I I like house we can talk about it next week
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:26.800]   But it's I like how simple it is that it's it seems as though every bruise and every welts and every broken bone
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:31.840]   They suffered with with google wave and g plus and everything else they did
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:35.520]   They've healed the bone has healed and made it a little bit stronger
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:42.480]   And by the way spaces is available on ios as well as android as well as there's a chrome uh plug-in
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:45.680]   Um, like mike elkins already started the largest
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:52.080]   Google space ever he's got let's talk about spaces and there's like hundreds and hundreds of people in there
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:56.000]   We're so lucky that virtual real estate is effectively free because we just keep building all these things
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:02.560]   I know and and I have to say i'm gun shy. I it's like well. I don't know if i'll invest in spaces they might kill it
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:09.280]   I have my minecraft server. I don't need space. Yeah, right. I don't need it. I got my minecraft server. You exactly right. Oh by the way
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:13.120]   As long as you're mentioning always 10 server was updated as well. Yeah
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:16.480]   Uh, one guy in the background. Yes
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:20.160]   One guy i'm running it. I'm running at home. I did a dumb thing
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:23.840]   I I was trying to turn off, you know, I had a ssh on there so I can log into it
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:30.800]   And I was trying to only allow it with uh with a sss with a key ssh key instead of typing in a password
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:35.520]   Because that's a little bit less secure and i've somehow disabled all logins of all kinds
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:40.240]   It's so secure. You can't get it. It's so secure. I can't even but I have to go home now and and
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:42.960]   Turn off whatever I just turned on
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:45.520]   Um, but that's the fun of running a server you get to do things like that
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:47.280]   Thank you
