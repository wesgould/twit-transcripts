[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:12.160]   another $5 million, I'm sorry, Euro fine, for Apple with the Dutch. What's going on there?
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.360]   AirTags, there's some changes coming to make them less useful for stalking.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.080]   And all the rumors, including a regulatory filing that indicates there might be

[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.480]   with our esteemed and talented Apple Co-respondents. Alex Lindsey's back in the house. Thank you, Alex.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.640]   Great to have you again. It's going to be your officehowers.global and 090.media
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.120]   from WG. B.H. Boston, it's Andy Anaco.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.280]   And famous YouTube celebrity Renee Ritchie, youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.520]   I'm on the mic, Leo. Don't hold your mic that closely. It's okay.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.000]   I ever stroke your mic. I want to feel like, you know, like, like, like, radio days,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.320]   we're just having this really intense conversation. Do it like Rogan does.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.120]   Oh, no, that's bad advice. It would take me a lot of work.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:36.800]   All right. You got to tell me, should I get excited? Apple files new Macs in the Eurasian
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:44.560]   economic database. This is a regular feature of new Macintosh announcements.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:56.320]   Usually how this is model number A26152686 and 2681. All list is running Monterey. So it's a Mac.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:04.720]   No other details, just those numbers. Apple has to file these. Of course, just like,
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.000]   it's like the FCC has to file these ahead of time. How far ahead of time? The question is,
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.240]   the question is, is it three weeks away? You look like you watch, Leo. I'm looking at my watch.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.560]   How close are we to a Mac mini Renee? It seems like that. I think damn closely. I think I'm close.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.600]   We are damn close. Is it a Mac mini? Like there's three of them. Three is odd. Like,
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.680]   if there was two of them, I could say like it's, it's the pro and the Macs. Those are the two
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.320]   SKUs, but three of them is like, that feels like maybe it's more than one. I don't, I don't want
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.840]   to get my hopes up. I don't want to get anybody's hopes up. I don't want to be that person. But
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.400]   when there's three of them, I'm like, what, what could it really be? Is like pro, Macs,
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.800]   something, what are Macs? Like, let's go crazy. And I'm Mac, a mini and a Mac book air. Let's go
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.760]   crazy. The air is craziest though, because that's M2. They really start M2 before the
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.600]   Macs and pros are roll. It's cats and dogs, Leo. They're living together.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.640]   I don't know. I just excited. That's all. I'm over excited. I'm so ready to buy more Mac
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.960]   minis. So yeah, we're always, it's all we talked about on the show the last few weeks.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.280]   It's just that it's just that it's so much power for the price. I think that's the big issue. If you
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.200]   don't need to, if you don't need a laptop, you just get a lot of power.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.960]   Well, and Lisa has an iMac, which we have to replace because it's a 20. I don't know what
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.160]   Intel. It's a 2016, I think. Oh, it's really. Oh, it's really. Oh, it's like a green bubble
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.040]   computer. It's starting to. Yeah, it's starting to bog. It's not it's not it's just having problems
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.200]   with it. She's got that for whatever it is, 49 inch predator monitor. And I said, honey,
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.800]   you could have two predator monitors. You have you can have 110 inches of screen
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.880]   curving around you. All you need is a little Mac mini in the middle.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.360]   You will have to buy her a separate space here though, because these are not going to be like
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.880]   if she's going to be used to the warmth that you get on those cold, cold petaluminites.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.880]   Not going to happen. Yeah. No, I mean, she says, well, I got to have an M1
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.760]   laptop. I could just use that. I said, you could you could dock that. Sure, you could.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.920]   Yeah, but you're the CEO. The woman deserves you deserve. You deserve. You deserve real estate,
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:23.680]   baby. Yes. And I'm sitting here with my 55 inch alien where OLED 120 Hertz OLED thinking, boy,
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.800]   you know, it's it's fine to have a PC plugged into it, but wouldn't it be something that
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.160]   find a Mac mini plugged into it? Then how much you pay? Get a Sun 10 and enjoy it.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:39.680]   How would I how would I connect? I think you want a single keyboard and mouse.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.960]   You've got a single monitor. How would you swap back and forth? What would be the easiest Alex?
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.760]   You must do this. Didn't you say synergy? But that's not what I want. Yeah, I will not recommend
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.040]   synergy again. Oh, I have a I have a mini here that won't work. I could killed it and bricked it.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.560]   So so the so here's what happened was I I had synergy and I I was just moving one of my drives
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.280]   over to the just to get it out of the way and it went a little over the edge to my other computer.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.200]   And synergy immediately asked for can I have permission to use the drive, but it went into a
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:16.800]   race condition right when it happened. I literally cannot plug my keyboard and mouse directly into
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.960]   the computer and have it actually work. The race condition is so intense. And even after I restart
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.760]   the race condition is so intense. And even with after a safe restart, the race condition is so
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.280]   intense that I can't get a word in edgewise with the computer. So I'm going to have to build a
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.960]   separate drive, you know, boot to an external drive to rebuild my my my Mac mini based on synergy.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.720]   So my my love affair with synergy is over. We were tracked like in a recommendation.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.680]   Like holy smokes. Like I have never seen anything nail a Mac so hard, you know, like it just just
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.320]   just just like I mean, it's probably a little extension. I don't remember how it installs, but
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.080]   it's probably it's got to be fairly low. Right. It is. And it's just it I I look really never had
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.360]   one that just pops up and it's you can tell that it's in a race because if I start pumping on the
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.400]   buttons on the on the keyboard, every once in a while, a letter comes out. So it's sitting it's
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.560]   sitting in a race condition and it's just yeah, I'm done. Like I'm just getting ready to install it
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.000]   and I'll just use a KVM. Let's go back to the old way. Should I get a KVM? Is that or I don't know?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.280]   Is it morning? You don't drag things. I'm thinking I'm really thinking that the mouse and keyboard
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.880]   are so different on Max from PCs. I should probably have to I should be like Rick Wakeman and yes
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:35.120]   and have a stack of keyboards. I don't know. I just I thought I was really in the synergy until
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.880]   this morning. I had one other issue, but it was like, wow, did it did it? I mean, I cannot get back
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.240]   into my Mac mini. I'm glad that it's not a production computer because I'd be really upset.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.600]   Right now, I'm just like, well, this is just a good lesson. Will Apple eliminate the headphone
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:08:00.320]   jack? We gave Samsung a little heat after their event last week because even on their giant 14.9
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:06.880]   inch tablet, there's no headphone jack. It's like it's not that there's no lack is a lack of room.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.800]   I don't understand why you would get rid of that for Jack unless you just wanted to sell bluetooth.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.360]   They had to make room for the notch. You can't have both. I know it has a notch. That's funny.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:21.920]   It's only funny because they made fun of the book. They mocked the headphone jack and
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.120]   the notch and they've gotten and they have the notch and they've got the power plug.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:32.560]   So they have courage to now. Yes, so much courage. It's like a secondary infection.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:39.920]   Anyway, I'm excited. March is we still think in March 8th. I know that's pure rumor,
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:45.760]   pure speculation again today. He did. Is he reliable or it or whoever is it a fraud?
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.720]   Eight out of 10.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.280]   On Apple Tracker?
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.400]   Yeah. Well, no, I think just in general, I mean, like the thing about Mark, that's not just like
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.720]   how often he's right, but it's how many rumors he puts out. Like it's okay. Like it's great to be
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.160]   100% off three rumors, but he's going to be like 800 rumors deep by now.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:10.080]   But let's let's let's check the Apple track source leaderboard. Right now, he's number two.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.800]   There's some guy named Ross Young, but that's only because probably Ross only has done a few
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.200]   things because he's a hundred. He's also he's also a supply side analyst and he just watches
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.920]   the stuff come by and then says what he sees. Yeah. Like it's a very different.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.600]   Germans given german situation that you know, he how many rumors he reports.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:34.880]   He's very 85.5% very accurate ahead of everybody else. Yeah.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:40.560]   Yeah. Yeah. I know his icon is a basketball. Yes, poor Ross has a fish.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:47.760]   So Ross is really good. It's just he doesn't have the quantity of them. And also, again, like he's
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.480]   he's he's a display analyst. So he sees the panels that are going through the industry and
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.640]   you know, therefore he sees what digit time sees, but he knows what it means. That's the big
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.600]   I like it. John Prosser's icon is a roll a toilet paper, but he's not that bad. 69%
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:08.160]   a little below. Quoming G who's 70.4%. We should do this every week now.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:14.880]   Now the football's over. I need I need I need some sort of statistical distraction.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:21.360]   Yeah. Apple. We're going to turn like go ahead, Annie. Oh, just going to say,
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:27.600]   no, I'm not. The best leakers have all retired this year. Like they like Dylan DKT is just left
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.280]   Twitter and Kang left and why? What do you think? I think I think it turns out the laws
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:41.040]   protected them in China were way. Oh, they're in China. Yeah. Sunny Dixon down to 54%.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.600]   Sorry, Andy, go ahead. He gets.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.560]   No, I was just going to say that if this is this is the next level of stuff and we stop
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.600]   being interested in the rumors and we start we start thinking about the beefs between the people
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.760]   who are actually generating the rumors. Yeah, that's sad. We're getting to a Lewis Hamilton
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.760]   versus Mac versus staff and like sort of situation like, Oh, but the thing is,
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:11.600]   Minchi quote. Yeah, I think he pre leaks something just to draw out somebody else.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:17.120]   That is happening in the chess world right now, because one of the top ranked super grand
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:24.720]   masters, Gary says his Twitter was hacked and then some revealing DMs have leaked out and then
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:31.840]   the world champion, Magnus Carlson tweets grow up. And it's so funny to watch these people who,
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.600]   you know, really, I don't know, I don't know how much of a life they have,
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.200]   but but they're living in their best life on Twitter.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.960]   It's it's more fun when it's the YouTube creators that are beefing with each other about,
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:52.080]   you know, I had this makeup line way before the person had them, but so look,
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:12:00.160]   to rewind to something else. So Renee, why do you think that they would they might,
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:06.160]   if they refresh the the the MacBook Air that they would have to have an M2 and they wouldn't
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.600]   just simply say, let's let's just keep this as the inexpensive low power, low heat one,
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.080]   we can put a lower power processor in there and get away with it.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.880]   Well, I already have the everyone you thinking maybe go to the pro.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:22.960]   Well, but it's got that fusty old old trade dress that this is it seems though,
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.440]   with the revitalization, the color, yeah, but you're gonna wait for the giving it the
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:33.680]   square edges, making it giving it the sort of the whole iMac makeover they gave last year
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:40.480]   for the iMac, which is just which is long overdue. It seems like that's that's the future of the
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:46.000]   design for for the for the for the MacBook Air, make it more colorful, make it more personal,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.240]   make it more look more like an iPad. Yeah, I think they're gonna do exactly that. I think they're
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:55.440]   waiting on M2 to do it one because they'll just get the boost off it. Like if it doesn't have a new
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.240]   a new chip and it people will just lambast them at launch, but I think more practically the things
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.960]   that are unique about M2, if it's based on a 15 or a 16, which it almost certainly will be
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:10.880]   probably a 15 of us anytime soon. It's it's better performance at lower power draw, which is even
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.520]   better for a MacBook Air that you're gonna make even smaller. So it'll be it'll be like the 12
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:20.320]   inch MacBook same size screen as the current MacBook Air if they call it Air might be called
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:25.920]   a MacBook, but it'll have just way better performance, way better efficiency, and it'll have at least
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.480]   one ProRes engine in it like a 15 does, which will be a huge help for just people who really
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.200]   want to edit a little bit of video, but really mostly one ultra powerful, but that and the
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.960]   le because it's supposed to go to mini led as well that adds a hundred bucks to the price tag at
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.840]   the least and that's not unusual. Every MacBook Air has come in like 200 bucks more expensive
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.520]   than the 999 predecessor, so they're just gonna leave the M1 around for a year and a half, two years
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.360]   until they get the M2 down to that price. And I think that lets them have the best of both worlds,
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.080]   they can pay off the R&D on it real quick. They can put in mini led display and they'll still have
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:03.440]   a low end for anybody who wants it. I won't make Renee recap his M1 M2 discussions,
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.720]   he's got some very good videos including the most recent one, M2 Max incoming ship.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:15.680]   I met 12 hours on animating chips, animating chips last night, like literal chip diagrams.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.840]   You've really you've really upgraded your production stats here.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.400]   I want to explain better because people still ask they're like why doesn't the iPhone have an M1
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:30.000]   and I have to explain it does the iPhone 12 had an M1 or why is Apple going to put out an M2 if the
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.920]   M1 like Apple can't put out an M2 because we're just getting the M1 Max like the number doesn't
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:38.560]   mean what you think it means. Yeah that's the real so just that's the bottom bottom line and I
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.080]   mean if you listen to Mac brick quickly or you watch Renee's videos you already know this
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:50.400]   but they're derivative of the of the A series chips in the iPhone. So yeah so you can get a newer
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:57.200]   M designation like because it's going to be the A15 but it's not going to be the killer chip
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:03.280]   that's coming down the road with a presumably an M2 pro and M2 pro or an M2 Max.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:09.920]   And it's not new like an Intel core i3 12th generation isn't more powerful than a core i9
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.320]   11th generation like the number of cores makes a huge difference in more workloads.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.480]   But Apple doesn't have as many designations so it's
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.080]   they will now Intel you know it's confusing Apple you expect it to be linear.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.080]   Well you're going to have like the nothing and then the pro and then the max and then a number of
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:31.600]   dies so it's good we're getting their Leo. Yeah yeah and I think that the that's one of the reasons
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.000]   a lot of us like the minis is because it's less of an investment when you need to buy another one
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.880]   you buy another one it's not three thousand dollars for each one of these yeah and especially since a
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.320]   lot more people are working at home it makes more sense yeah yeah.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.800]   Okay excitement is interesting. I just had one thing it's super interesting and this was a crux of my
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:56.640]   video from from this morning is that come the holiday season we might well have an M1 entry level
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:02.960]   Mac mini on the market alongside a Mac mini pro and a Mac mini max at the higher end and then an M2
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:09.120]   Mac mini in like delicious colors right in the middle of those and that'll be true for the iMac
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.680]   and maybe for the MacBook Pro as well so we'll like there'll be a large variety of choice come
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.960]   holiday seasons and that's something we've haven't had in a very long time.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:22.480]   The other thing we've had all along with Apple is this kind of linear progression
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:28.880]   of devices and this confuses it a little bit I understand why people are confused.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:37.200]   Yeah I guess you can still go by price though right instead of looking so much at the chip look
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.880]   at the price because that's still linear right the more you spare the faster you can
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.880]   like the earlier.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.600]   Huh? And it's what I think is what I think is interesting also is is that you are Apple is
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:56.080]   getting pretty close to giving you a linear line that goes from about $700 to about $60,000.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:02.720]   And this is the line you want to go in there yeah yeah they did that with the iPod remember
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.880]   it's a good it's a good strategy you come out with the this is really analogous to what happened
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.840]   with the iPod there was this high priced initial thing and they and then over a period of a decade
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:18.000]   they expanded the line so you really covered the whole range so that no matter what you were
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.800]   able to spend what you were in the market for there was an iPod for you and now I think they're
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:27.520]   doing the same thing. I mean the hardest thing is for those of us in the pro area still gets into
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:33.600]   the Nvidia problem you know where the GPU the problem isn't so much the GPU is there and the
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.000]   GPU is powerful it's just that there's a lot of apps that are written to the Nvidia card
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.400]   and so it's hard for us to you know there's things that we just have to use a PC for because
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.080]   it doesn't you know the Mac it doesn't matter how fast the GPU is it's not being written to
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:53.600]   so to be so to be clear the GPUs now in these new M1 maxes and presumably in an M2 max down the
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:58.240]   road are as comp are you would you say they're as they're not they're not they're not they're not
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:03.120]   as fast I mean they're they're fast and as they get bigger as there's more RAM available
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.040]   to them they may overtake the Nvidia that's one advantage they have because they're using
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.920]   the same memory that they're using shared memory so they're not limited to RAM that's on a video
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.400]   card they can use the entire available memory if it's available so there's a trajectory that has
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.840]   them pass them but when you start looking at quad records those are pretty powerful yeah
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:28.800]   and we had as firing on all four cylinders and maybe 80 we we we had we were in a discussion
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:34.400]   and after hours in our office hours thing about about crypto and you know people mining and they
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.080]   came up like have you mined with the M1 they're like yeah it's not worth it
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:44.640]   it's not it's not a question you're a interesting measure because of course Bitcoin and other
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:50.320]   following cryptocurrency are very carefully designed so that the difficulty of mining gets
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:55.200]   harder and harder as more coin is generated and it roughly corresponds I don't know if this was
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:01.520]   intentional with the expense of electricity so that as it gets more expensive you'd be get more
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:06.160]   more sensitive to the cost of electricity it's all about electricity I mean people have these
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.360]   they were talking about they have these cards that are like just connected to these tiny little
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.840]   pieces that are just hanging like literally hanging so that there's all airflow around them
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.400]   and it's just the card just raw cards thinking oh yeah you're trying to reduce the Nike
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.640]   or they sell bitcoin miners to hit your house I mean they literally do do both
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.680]   workers get a nasty surprise I hate to use that nasty surprise from Forbes but didn't they get
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.520]   a nasty surprise with their power bills this month I just thought tons of people California too
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:37.120]   and some of that at least in California all of it I think is then the cost of natural gas has
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:41.840]   doubled over last year that's a that's a that's a big hit all of a sudden because we don't usually
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.240]   heat until we're out about now so they have the tiny apartments and thousand dollar bills all
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.960]   of a sudden yeah yeah is that their elect is electricity it's a going up yeah I guess yeah
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.240]   Connet is that electricity yeah well no see we have PG&E and it's gas and electricity I
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:01.680]   bet Connet's both so I don't know yeah I don't know and of course you're heating most people still
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.560]   heat with gas or oil and we have hydro Quebec it's all nationalizing it's all water you know well
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:11.600]   and that's another problem because a lot of the hydro because of the drought hydro generation's
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:18.320]   gone way down so there's a there is a cost of energy to grow for geothermal I don't know what
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:25.440]   time to make a giant Sun collection mirror something we have I have reactors if you want them
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.360]   yeah we're happy to sound no we don't want them I don't our power bills are the lowest in the
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.240]   winter because we have these big windows that face out nice and so the house heats up on its
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.560]   own oh that's nice that's smart you know that's smart actually that's the there's a big
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:43.680]   train which I designed it building houses with an eye towards energy efficiency and how you
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:49.600]   oriented is really important it's not as efficient during the summer right a lot of AC right so
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:59.520]   um apple says a small portion of iPhones recorded interactions with Siri even if you
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:05.120]   opted out I know this because my apple TV update and all of a sudden I had to say yes it's okay
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:10.560]   or no it's not okay for apple to monitor and you're gonna when you get 15 whatever the next one 15
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.040]   two yeah you'll you'll probably get the same announcement as they fix this bug you have to
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:23.120]   re-enable Siri recording monitoring or disable it's up to you re-disabled re-disabled how much is
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:28.960]   this a big deal is this a big privacy issue Andy I mean are we are we like is this all is this
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:35.520]   of the end of the world or just no it's this this is always this is always a case of the biggest fear
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:40.880]   that the most consumers have regarding privacy of these devices is the always on microphone that
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.640]   you don't know if it's recording you don't know what's doing with anything with apple it's not
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.160]   going to be a problem because they have a really good reputation this this one the few companies
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.080]   that when they say that this was a legitimate mistake for sorry we're going to fix it you can't
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:58.320]   you have a tendency to believe them if it's Facebook no if it's Google you're willing to
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:05.600]   give them a steely glance for a good eight seconds to see if they break and if they don't break just
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.160]   just like like you're like your mom did when they're pretty sure you're telling they're telling
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.720]   the truth but you can't take the risk that you're lying and they're gonna try to sweat it out of you
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.560]   but yeah this is this is not gonna be this is let's put it this way this is not the biggest
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.440]   embarrassment PR nightmare that apple is facing regarding privacy and safety and security of
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:29.920]   customers of its hardware products 15.4 which is currently in beta asks you to if you would
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:37.120]   re-enable improve serial dictation the Verge says apple told them that the bug was identified
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:44.160]   shortly after the release of iOS 15 apples response was to immediately stop reviewing any recordings
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:50.240]   and inadvertently received and deleting info received from the affected devices after the
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.720]   discovering the bug they just turn this is why you have to go through the improved serial
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:03.040]   dictation setting again they immediately disabled the feature for many users and then in 15.2 corrected
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:10.240]   the opt-in setting so it's fixed in 15.2 but you you're gonna see this across all your apple devices
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.480]   you're gonna get a prompt asking for your permission to enable the improve
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:22.400]   serial dictation feature that's gonna happen at least for sure in 15.4 so in so apple
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.560]   once this is a little confusing with oh this is a Catherine Franklin from apple talking to the
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:33.840]   Verge with iOS 15.2 we turned off the improved serial dictation setting for many serial users
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:43.520]   while we fixed a bug introduced with iOS 15 so it's off but then they're gonna once I guess
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:49.040]   it's gonna be you're gonna have a chance to turn it back on if you wish with 15.4 I don't care
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:54.800]   I don't care if you know I mean is this the loud sex problem what is it people are worried about
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:02.000]   I don't know little snippets of things just in principle you know you don't want a recording of
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.800]   yours to go to to elsewhere but it's an important part of making this device work if the device
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:14.960]   sends feedback that says that by the way apple my creator I had a problem parsing a certain piece
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.040]   of text it is very very important to know well what text were you stumbling on and how do we fix
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.880]   that right because otherwise you're not going to be able to improve it makes it better but this is
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.880]   I'm this is one area in which people should be paranoid about people should expect a very
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.520]   high level of standard from the makers of these devices because you can't just simply wave them
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:36.800]   off and say oh well just trust us trust us why why would we be collecting information from you in
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:41.680]   2022 information is valueless there you know you need to be able to convert you need to earn people's
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.280]   trust and this is how you do it on the other hand if you use zoom on a Mac you might want
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:50.640]   updated because it too was well I don't know what they were doing with it but they
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:55.440]   we left the mic on by accident after your meeting and the only reason we know is Monterey tells you
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.960]   hey mics on
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:05.200]   yeah see this this is why I love the idea of hardware switches on microphones and hardware
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:10.160]   covers on cameras that there's I trust you trust the little LED you trust the little indicator
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:16.880]   this control by software but there's nothing like having having a a a stub headphone jack that's
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.680]   jammed into a microphone slot that says that look there is no possible way you could be getting
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.960]   it from getting sound off of this thing you kind of love cashmere hill New York Times
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.160]   oh what's that oh you get a little you get a little shutter just one of the webcams
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.600]   and one of the games but it comes with them a lot of them are coming with that about half of the
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.840]   ones that I'm buying right now for research come with a little yeah yeah that's the way it should be
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:43.440]   yes since all the work from home incidents we all had to watch on yeah loop oh yeah yeah
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:48.800]   I think that the key factor for me is that bugs will always happen accidents will always happen
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.440]   so it's how a company responds to them and how often they happen like there've been cases where
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.960]   companies have been told to stop like location tracking that oops it was somewhere else and
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.320]   it turns out it was deeper in a setting it was in another setting was in an account setting there's
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.800]   eight different times it happens that they're still recording this stuff then you're like okay fool me
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:09.040]   once you know shame on you fool me twice shame on me but there's a lot of times when these like
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.760]   it's just it's bad code gets pushed a mistake happens they fix it you don't hear about it again
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:18.720]   and to me that's the process working as design it'll never be perfect but if you have people who are
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.280]   of good intention they will fix it let's take a little break we'll come back i'll tell you the
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:28.400]   cashmere hill story in a little bit uh and a lot more in fact i want to know what's this reality oh
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:35.520]   as we keep seeing little tidbits about before that i want to ask have i told you about imperfect

[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.840]   and they're just like the apples i used to get when i was a kid we'd go out pick apples on the
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:42.640]   apple tree they're a little smaller and a little less engineered than the ones you get in the grocery
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.080]   store because apples you know they they they they hybrid them so that they will last forever on the
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.080]   shelf and that kind of thing these are like the old apples that i used to get they're sweet they're
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:58.880]   delicious little smaller every in every other respect they're perfect artichokes same thing
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.720]   broccoli we always have broccoli from imperfect foods i love it but Lisa and i've decided they
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:08.240]   have the best ground beef uh better than our uh really good grocery store better than whole food

[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.280]   it's so good it's in every way you're feeling good because you're combating climate change
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:53.520]   you're getting rid of plastics in the environment and you're buying food that otherwise would be
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:29:04.000]   thrown out which is insane customers have saved 139 million pounds of food by eating it by buying
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.240]   it and i just i want to reassure you it's not weird food it's delicious it's really if anything
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:17.680]   more like the old school food that we used to get before grocery stores got so focused on oh you

[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:26.720]   um another Dutch group is a man and apple i still we still haven't heard uh the response
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:35.600]   from the Dutch dating apps about apple silly proposal the Dutch App Stores claim foundation
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:43.520]   has taken on the iPhone maker and google too over claims that Dutch consumers have overpaid
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:53.120]   up to a billion euros one billion euros the foundation which is chaired by a journalist
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:31:00.960]   Alexander cropping cray name is asking for a refund yeah but are they suing that's the question
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:06.240]   so we have grounds i'd love to see the grounds yeah yeah they're they're calling for Dutch
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:14.000]   residents to sign up for the claim um any resident in the Netherlands who purchased at least one app
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.400]   service or subscription is eligible um they're pro they're saying because a 30 percent is too
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:25.200]   high they deserve money back yeah but here's the thing they've also promised to try avoiding legal
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:31.120]   proceedings so they're going to try to settle out of court yeah good luck they do know that if
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.400]   the 30 percent goes down the developers like a lot of them will just keep it right like because
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:38.480]   they need money too they have families to feed right like the money is going to be there yeah
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:43.840]   who's to who would be see that's really and i think that's apple's defense taking a page from the
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:50.560]   book of Alex Lindsey is we're doing what's best for consumers and if if we change this it would
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:55.680]   make it harder for consumers and developers who pocket the money so what do you want i'd like
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.400]   the donors to have it i'm happy good i mean and then they're all fighting for but i think the
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:04.880]   problem is is that so if apple changes it 15 percent does that end the problem like is the
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:09.280]   does that does that really solve it and if and if they do it kind of undermines everybody that's
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.440]   spent all this time complaining about 30 percent they now don't have a case because what they
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.360]   they're using 30 percent but what they really want is to be able to install outside the app
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:22.160]   outside of the store and outside of the store is not going to be great for the for the user
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:26.000]   you know outside of the store means that eventually they'll start only publishing outside the store
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.960]   because that's what you know that's what facebook wants right so they can track you and so so you
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:36.560]   start losing we start losing as users we start losing choice and then we also it increases friction
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.480]   you know like for instance a good example is the apple tv because of all the they don't have this
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:45.600]   rule for the apple tv you can do whatever kind of registration mess that you want to create
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.360]   and i don't even bother anymore i don't go to the app store in the apple tv because it's just
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.960]   too much trouble like it's just like i'm not gonna i you can't even get me to sign up for free for
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.280]   something because i got to fill out some form and so so that's but that's what's coming you know
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:01.760]   with with all of this and so i don't think that you know it's not going to be good for small app
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.200]   developers because small app developers depend on people going oh this is easy just like check
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:09.360]   let's i'll just go i'll just buy like i get interested in something at three dollars i just buy four of
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.000]   them and try to figure out which one is the best one that'll end
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.560]   becomes a pain to do you know little valentines day gift from the authority for consumers in markets
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:25.760]   yesterday in holland they uh another fine another week fourth week in a row now five million euros
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:33.920]   and they say that apples conditions the new 27 percent thing which requires developing a new app
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:39.120]   is unnecessary and unreasonable condition that apples imposing on dating app providers
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:46.240]   in its revised conditions apple apps well that's who sues third well yeah exactly it was it was
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:50.320]   the match group that uh the the conglomerate that owns pretty much every dating app they're the
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.840]   they're the company that brought this suit and that's why they limit so far they've limited it just
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:59.760]   to dating apps this is what uh they Dutch regulator writes in its revised conditions apple imposes a
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:05.520]   considerable number of conditions on dating app providers that wish to use an alternative method
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:12.720]   of payment uh ACM is of the opinion that this condition hurts dating app providers dating app
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:17.040]   providers that opt for an alternative payment system are thus forced to incur additional costs
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.800]   and consumers that currently use the app have to switch to the new app before they're available
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:26.000]   able to use the new alternative method of payment blah blah blah we already you know we knew this was
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.120]   a apple thumbing their nose at these guys um so i think it was up to 50 million dollars i'm sure
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:34.240]   that someone apple just said okay well this is going to cost us 50 million exactly there's a cut
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:38.240]   off like you remember what it is yeah maybe it's just ten weeks so uh they're gonna keep they're
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:42.960]   gonna keep doing it and i and i hate to think that apple would be a company i i don't i have no
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:47.200]   doubt that that is their part of their thinking but that's that doesn't speak well of apple that
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:52.000]   they're saying that well this is a lot we're we're forced to comply with we've already basically
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.480]   told them to go take a hike twice and been told back by the courts that no that's not sufficient
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:00.720]   you have to do better you have to follow our laws and if they were to simply say well 50 million
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.320]   50 million euro half we'll just write the check and we'll keep doing what the hell we want
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.720]   that would not speak ball to google as excuse me to apple it's something that google would do
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:14.400]   it something that facebook would do and it's just as bad for apple to do it i think we spoke about it
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.160]   in fact Andy thank you for joining us sunday on twitter it was great having you it was fun and
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:23.280]   we spoke about it on sunday and essentially uh you made the point look they're they say
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:30.240]   well we have to buy it by all rules in china so we're getting rid of whatever vpn apps but then
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:36.160]   in holland they're 50 million euros big deal so well but i think they're also trying to figure
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.760]   out where that line is they're they're like okay we're gonna give you a little and then they say no
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:44.080]   and they're okay well let's go back to them i mean they're not gonna jump in you know they're just
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:48.800]   they're just kind of doing it is there any law in china that apple does not adhere to that apple
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:54.960]   says oh forget it well to pay the fines fines fines and criminal in china it's criminal right in in
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:00.080]   europe it's fine so fines fines are just a calculated like so your secret vice to the Dutch regulator
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.920]   is start putting people in jail if you started making a criminal there would be a different
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.800]   nobody different problem or the numbers were bigger and apple would probably have to make it
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.400]   make it exactly the the other thing they could do if they don't if they're not if they're not
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.400]   if they're not digging human rights violations they could also be responsible for about 20 for
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:21.360]   about 21 21 percent of apples apples revenue that would also help yeah and that's another thing
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:26.000]   that doesn't make apple look good that if it's like if it's a small country that they don't feel
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.480]   as though they make a whole lot of money off of so they can afford to bully them around versus if
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:36.320]   china were to say if china were to simply it's a complicated relationship i absolutely acknowledge
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:41.920]   that china is also very very much dependent on excuse me very very much in favor of keeping
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:47.440]   good relations with apple going but yeah clearly apple is not going to tell them to go take a hike
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:54.400]   if there's a risk of losing again 20 percent of their of their annual money or any or anything
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:59.360]   like that and again that would not speak for apple if that were indeed the case apple share of the
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:05.120]   u_a_ differences the proceedings the proceedings in china are not public like we're watching this
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:09.760]   take place in front of us where everything apple has to negotiate with china is done long
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:15.440]   before we ever hear about it and they'll push back on things like they would just data repatriation
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.320]   china just wanted everything and apple's like well what about we do this what if there's like
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.920]   this company right there's eventually they come to agreement and then we hear about it
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:26.560]   with with holland if this was all behind closed doors and eventually it's that apples agreed to
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:31.360]   blah blah blah that'd be very similar but we get to see it in public so it's just like uh apple's
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:36.720]   negotiating in public and we've never seen that point in fact we we found out recently remember
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:41.840]   this five years ago apple and google and others made uh you know negotiated a deal with the chinese
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:46.960]   government which is about which is expiring now but um yeah that that's right we we don't see what
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:57.120]   happens apple's smartphone share in the u_s according to counterpoint going up going up uh let's see
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:07.120]   it it's teens yeah uh it's not its highest in q4 of last year they estimated apple at 65
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:15.120]   percent market share uh in q4 of this year 56 percent it's interesting though i don't i think
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:21.600]   i'm i'm gonna have to call foul on these numbers because the percentage of market share shouldn't
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:27.040]   vary by quarter by as much as 10 percent that doesn't make any sense at all people either have
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:34.080]   the phone or they don't have the phone so you know is samsongs did samsongs market share really go up
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:42.800]   from q4 2020 to q1 2021 by 11 percent that seems odd so anyway but here's that's the numbers i'll
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:48.640]   give them to you from counterpoint the problem is i don't know how they get it um you know there's
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:53.520]   only apple and samsong really uh really no for sure nevertheless
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:02.240]   still more than half uh but nowhere near monopoly size i think that's what apple really is worried
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:08.000]   about and cares about yeah if anything samsong should be worried because they they they own the
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.600]   android market to an extent to an extent that basically is for all types of purposes is very
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:19.040]   very close to what uh apple owning the iphone hardware market so a lot of stuff that's said
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:23.760]   about apple could also be said about samsong speaking of samsong course last week uh on
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:29.360]   wednesday they announced the new s 22 series including their top of the line s 22 ultra
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:33.680]   which starts at uh 13 hundred bucks you know it's funny when apple first broke that thousand
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:39.760]   dollar barrier it was a big deal now everybody's like yeah well 13 oh is the ultra is it like a
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.360]   galaxy note i'm unclear by the way the internet has covered it it is i wish someone would just
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.840]   tell me if it was like a galaxy notary is there's these samsong still hasn't said we're not going
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:53.600]   to do a galaxy note but for all intents and purposes this is the size 6.8 inches it's got a stylus
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.920]   housed inside it looks it's got squared off edges like the galaxy note as a long time note lover and
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:05.760]   owner to me it's the new galaxy note and whether samsong is my favorite samsong yeah i i ordered
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:11.040]   immediately i can't wait to get it yeah but don't get your hopes up you guys because even though it's
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:19.520]   got a very fast quark i'm snap dragging eighth generation one cpu it ain't an iphone 13
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:28.240]   cpu it's not an a 15 um in benchmarks uh while the this is from a pc magazine so you could trust it
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:34.880]   while the samsong galaxy s 22 ultra and s 22 plus outpace all other android phones we've tested
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:39.440]   on performance benchmarks that's because it has a new quong gum chip it lacks the raw processing
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:46.960]   power of apples a 15 can i make a bold statement leo yes please so like there was this art i was
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.720]   just looking back there was this article that came out last september that said apple is suffering
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:54.640]   this massive brain drain they've lost all these architects to nuvia they're being bought by
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:41:00.160]   qualcom the age of apple silicon is over and clearly clearly not the smartest take in the room but it
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:06.880]   occurs to me like just looking at qualcom's road map that uh the nuvia architects at qualcom to me
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:12.400]   feel very much like mike mattis when he left apple and went to facebook at apple he was working under
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:18.000]   you know greg christie and got forced all in steve jobs yet all these editors these oaturs
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.320]   shaping him to make some of the best computer interfaces we've ever seen at facebook he spent
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.480]   like five years making chat heads like he had no oversight at all he did do whatever he wanted
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.360]   did did barely anything and what he did do just was not good for consumers and i feel like you know
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:37.360]   these people worked under johnny seruji and under uh tim and for years and they they had everything
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.960]   carefully edited and now it feels like they're at qualcom and it's just like do whatever you want
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:46.400]   guys they're like everything that apple said no to we're doing now i just uh i don't know here's uh
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:52.080]   here's some benchmarks this is the base mark web the web browser benchmark the big long bar at the
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:42:00.640]   bottom is the iphone 13 pro max roughly twice the speed of the s 22 ultra geek bench uh doesn't
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:07.360]   fail a whole lot better that black bar at the bottom is the geek bench score for the 13 pro it's
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:14.640]   46 47 compared with the ultra's 34 33 on the multi-core score not quite as much of a difference on
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.640]   the single core score or the machine learning score but i think the multi-core is what you're
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:22.480]   going to care about but it's it's such a much higher power like what this doesn't account for is
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:28.160]   that where apple is sipping like six watts this thing is like a blast furnace 4,000 milliamp hours
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:34.240]   in the ultra so i'll be interested to see i mean i think that qualcom has done a lot to um to
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:40.400]   improve efficiency and so uh the early reports in there you know there are reviewers uh because
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:45.440]   nobody has dave 2d had a good take too he's like no no one plays genshin impact 24 hours a day so
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:49.440]   what i'm seeing on a lot of the benchmarks is not an accurate reflection of everyday life which
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:53.920]   totally fair enough but these processors need like samson just promised five years of updates like
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:57.920]   apple and how a processor acts today is not your indicator of what's gonna act like when you get
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:02.240]   that fifth year of updates we've seen that with apple already i'm super happy samson's doing it
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:06.240]   but qualcom really has in the areas where they use qualcom and not exenos because in the exenos
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:10.320]   areas it's samson's problem but in the qualcom areas they've got to make sure that that process
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:16.880]   area is great five years from now right one place that apple uh does lose to uh the uh ultra is in
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:26.000]   graphics in the graphics bench five um Aztec ruins the uh oh no never mind apple which they're
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:33.040]   a little never never mind well i don't know if they win they well they win over the 22 but there's
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:38.400]   a couple of them they're they're a little faster than the only place samson is uh is beating him is
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:42.560]   in the uh fhd the uh 1080p they're a little bit faster.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:47.600]   Goodening power to do it yeah yeah so we'll see i ordered it uh i'll let you know i get it on the
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:52.400]   25th so i'll let you know um you know battery life is going to be a good question because it is a
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:58.880]   relatively small battery although early reviewers say the battery life is very good so we shall see
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:04.160]   well it is the the known as a unique product but if if i were considering a choice between
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:10.080]   an iphone and the and the ultra it would large one of the factors would be oh man i really like the
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:14.800]   idea of having like the s pen i like the idea of having a stylus and a display is going to respond
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:20.800]   to it and that's what that's always been one thing that i've always one of my one of the long
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:25.840]   things i think about is like what if apple were to do an iphone just reserve it for the for the most
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:31.440]   expensive iphone only with like the larger screen but what if they were to do some sort of pencil
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:36.880]   support that is that will approximate what you can get on the ipad man i know that i i know that
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:41.600]   i'll uh originally most of the ball next board that while the screen doesn't refresh nearly fast
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:47.840]   enough uh the the the scanner does not refresh fast enough but now we're seeing native displays of
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:55.200]   how it can do 128 excuse me 120 of easy that's and i think that was the original refresh rate for
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:00.160]   the first generation of ipads that use the apple pencil second i could be wrong about that second
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:06.160]   thank you uh it's it seems like it's closer to something that's doable without having to basically
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:12.240]   create an ipad sub mini in order to make that happen but because that that would be imagine
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:19.760]   just a leather case that has that has a worm for a worm for a large ipad i i phone pro and maybe a
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:25.280]   stubby like a super sharpened apple pencil that that's one of the things that could get me to switch
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:30.400]   back real damn quick the same size has have the this stylus built in which is you know this is the
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:34.640]   other thing apple's gonna have to figure out sash is egan in his benchmark review on pc magazine
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:40.080]   does say i'm a bit concerned about the thermal throttling i saw in the galaxy s 22 ultra while
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:45.920]   running benchmarks the phone quickly became warm and as soon as it became warm it returned much lower
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:51.120]   results so just to your point rene uh they take a lot of power to get those speeds yeah and i think
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:55.440]   at this point fundamentally it's people need to feel like their phone is close to the other
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:00.080]   phones around it but it's really they're choosing as Andy pointed out feature sets yeah as opposed to
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:04.400]   it as long as they're like in the same range yeah no phone is slow at this point i don't think yeah
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:08.320]   we have very few applications that are really pushing the outer envelope of the phone's uh
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:15.280]   capability well it's the same discussion with 5g you know carriers are now rolling out the mid band
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:21.840]   c-band 5g i don't know did i mention on this show i happened to be standing when i was in the line at
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:30.160]   dmv i noticed my uh iphone 12 said uh i'm on t-mobile said uc 5g uc is it what's uc
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:36.560]   that a benchmark 500 megabits down uh and i thought well that's great but then i thought but what is
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:41.360]   it we do on our phones it needs 500 megabits down i can see at your home where you're sharing it with
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:46.480]   five other people i guess if you were doing a hot spot for five people in your pain form
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:53.280]   it'd be great yeah but but uh yeah right so you know while we talk a lot about millimeter wave
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:59.120]   getting gigabit and better performance and c-band getting you know half that but still 500 megabits
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:05.840]   the thing is you don't you don't take your laptop out when you're winning it landed at dmv even though
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:11.120]   god knows you can it's this this this the first line it's the first line we start to notice that
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:16.000]   my god i can't believe that i that uh that this stream started instantly and i'm doing
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.520]   much much better than i've been able to do previously yeah but a stream again a best quality stream
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:27.520]   you're gonna put on your phone right right now more than 25 or 50 so fast starts you know faster dns
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:32.320]   lower latency all of those things might end up being important but uh you know i don't know i
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.920]   think it when you start thinking about gaming you know gaming on it where there might be a lot
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.960]   of data coming towards you 500 still a high number but but i think that 100 or 200 isn't necessary
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:44.880]   nobody's gonna design a game that needs that much bandwidth because nobody would be able to
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:49.040]   play it well they're gonna do it now Leo you know what happens every time you say something yeah i know
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:54.480]   right well and what happens is that they scale it to what is available like so to your point like
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:58.240]   if everybody has 100 or 200 people will start using it you know and so things that we thought
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:01.600]   were impossible before because we didn't have the bandwidth and now when they're possible people
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:06.320]   start developing and and it's easy to also decide well i can see your bandwidth and i'm not only
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:11.120]   gonna send you this resolution if if you had more bandwidth i'll send you more resolution and you
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:15.520]   know and so it's just a matter of figuring out you know what that trade-off is and so it you could
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:21.760]   end up with a high-end game that is sending you much much more dense all you know polygonal count
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:26.720]   you know higher polygon counts and so on so forth based on your banding with you yeah
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:32.640]   kashmary hill writing in the new york times i used apples air tags tiles and a gps tracker
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.560]   to watch my husband's every move
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:42.160]   i mean at least to her credit like she did like this wasn't like a hit job on air tech she took
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.320]   a bunch of different trackers and then put her husband her freedom loving husband through the
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:51.840]   ringer yeah i mean the sub that subhead really tells you what this is all about a vast location
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:58.400]   tracking network is being built around us so we don't lose our keys one couple's adventures in
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:03.360]   the consumer tech surveillance state and apple has made some changes in response
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:11.040]   to you know all the the fears about stalking with the air techs this came out february 10th
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:16.160]   from apple an update on air tag and unwanted tracking they're they're taking this seriously
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:22.000]   um app you know blah blah we become aware that individuals can receive unwanted tracking alerts
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.760]   from benign reasons such as borrowing someone's keys the narrow tag attached or when traveling
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:34.960]   in a car with a family member's airpods in left inside um we've seen reports of bad actors attempting
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:40.640]   to misuse air tag for malicious or criminal reasons we've been working closely with various
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:44.480]   safety groups and law enforcement through our own evaluations and these discussions we've
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:49.200]   identified even more ways we can update air tech safety warnings and help guard against further
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:53.280]   unwanted tracking i got a good apple credit because as we've pointed out in the show they're
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:50:00.240]   inexpensive gps devices that do a far better job uh the you know in the article yeah on the article
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:04.320]   i mean the article yeah it was very clear by the end of the article that it was the apple was not
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:09.200]   the best the best one to use for what you really want to snoop on your spouse well we used we use the
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:14.320]   air seat airland scene we use those for our trucks so we used to use using for our trucks and it was
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:23.360]   that useful so um apple is providing a paired account details in response to a subpoena or
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:30.640]   or valid request from law enforcement so beware co criminals uh they you know apple knows who owns
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:37.600]   those air tags uh because each is unique in fact we have successfully partnered with them on cases
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:41.920]   where information we provided has been used to trace an air tag back to the perpetrator who was
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:47.360]   then apprehended and charged and apple's going to protect your privacy
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:54.320]   law enforcement shared their appreciation you know so just yeah but here's some things there'll be
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:51:00.240]   new privacy warnings during air tags set up just so you understand better i think this is a good idea
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:07.600]   exactly you know how this works uh still doesn't help somebody who doesn't have an air tag or more
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:12.320]   importantly has an android device uh addressing alert issues that's supposed to warn the
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:16.960]   the potential abuser that they're going to be tracked i think that's the air tag is designed
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:22.400]   it says to be detected by victims and that law enforcement can request identifying information
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.720]   about you so that's the that's the point of that addressing alert issues for air pods we've heard
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.760]   from users who've reported receiving an unknown accessory detected alert we've confirmed this
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:38.160]   alert will not display if an air tag is detected near you only air pods third generation air pods
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:46.960]   pro air pods max or third party five my network accessory so instead of uh saying unknown accessory
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:51.840]   they're going to say we'll be updating the alert so that indicates air pods have been traveling with
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:58.960]   you now that's actually yes thank you yeah uh that's should and it's also um updating it's
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:03.840]   unwanted tracking support article on apple.com to better communicate the safety features
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:10.560]   um and then they're thinking about some additional updates they want to introduce later in the
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:19.600]   year including precision finding that will help you if you have an i-4 and 11 12 or 13 see the
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:24.640]   distance and direction to an unknown air tag when it's in the range so you'll be able to track it down
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:29.040]   but it makes easier to find it as opposed to just getting a warning of hey it's time for you to
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:34.800]   tear apart your entire car or tear apart everything within a 20 foot radius or to find you yeah and
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:42.000]   that's the i mean the ultra wide band is capable of a pretty accurate position so you don't you
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.520]   should only have a box of about 10 centimeters that you have to worry about as an iphone user moves
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:53.280]   precision finding fuses input from the camera aar kit accelerometer and gyroscope to guide them
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:57.680]   to the ear tag through a combination of sound haptics and visual feedback i want that just
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:01.120]   for finding like you're really upset about this part because like well there's a whole group of
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:04.480]   people who just want to be Batman and batwoman and i'm discounting those because people get
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:08.800]   injured in secondary like locations all the time don't ever hunt down these are not meant for
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:12.640]   you to be superhero and hunt down your own stuff but also people are now worried because like this
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:17.680]   is a very very difficult needle to thread because apple designed them to find lost items they did
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:22.560]   not design them to stalk people and they did not design them for you to be batman or spiderman or
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:26.320]   whatever but there are people now who worry that if they leave it in their camera bag or leave it
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:30.240]   in their wallet previously the person like the whole network wouldn't know where your wallet or
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:34.400]   your camera was you would just know that it was there and you could go get it and now it's like
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:38.480]   all their precision finding my wallet and all their precision finding my camera bag but apple's
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:42.880]   making a conscious choice that's potential abuse is more harmful than the potential something you
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:47.200]   already lost and now you can at least have a chance of recovering it and by the way for $10
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:52.880]   less than an air tag you can get a magnetic mini car tracker gps real-time tracking locator
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:59.440]   with a sim slot so you know let's get real guys that's well okay but but but that is very very true
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:05.520]   and that's probably true for someone who has a specific target but the thing is a 20 a $25 for
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:12.640]   pack of four $29 air tag or tile tracker doesn't cost like $20 to $30 a month to operate and
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:17.280]   that's that's gonna be a difference for people who are not simply knuckleheads but people who are
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:22.080]   really out to make a business out of tracking people yeah and yeah it's it is a funny word but
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:28.160]   that's I always when it comes to term to matters of security I tell I always demarcate the
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:33.520]   difference between the knucklehead who might grab my bike if I don't leave it locked outside
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:38.560]   it's a look I just got a bike hey look let's throw it over the ravine you know who didn't go it didn't
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:42.880]   leave the house intending to steal like a thousand dollar bike and the professional bike thieves
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:47.440]   who are like okay that's a so-and-so model eight it's three years old I bet I can get at least
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:52.160]   $900 for this place I'm gonna come back and do it tomorrow and go get it I know that I can
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:56.480]   protect my bike against the knucklehead I know that I can't protect my bike against the person
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:00.960]   who's actually a professional air tags the problem of air tags is just that it makes it very very
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:05.120]   easy for knuckleheads to create those kind of safety and security problems yeah we have the
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:10.640]   security community uses the the term threat model and different you have different threat
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:15.280]   models and if your threat model is a talented hacker targeting you you're out of luck in a
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:19.520]   matter but I think if you're a pro it's not a good business because of the ability for it to
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:23.200]   reverse track oh yeah you wouldn't use this so the thing is is that this is not if you're a pro
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:27.280]   doing this I don't think these are the right ones for you no this is as any said this is for
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:32.400]   knuckleheads because the issue is is that is that once like if law enforcement decides to turn the
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:37.040]   heat up on this thing they can match you to every phone that's that was around you when you paired
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:41.520]   with the air with the thing so it doesn't matter what you have a burner phone or not it'll just go
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.720]   I know what all the people that were near this and I'm gonna follow them all to their friends
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:48.400]   houses and you know and so there's there's a lot that's what all that metadata everyone gets
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:54.160]   so upset about us for you know and so so the um so just a matter of how how high they want to turn
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:56:00.800]   it but there's it's I don't think the air the the air tags are a good business model for professionals
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:07.040]   because it's just too it's too easy to trace it back well to if I were going to be abusing it
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:12.640]   I don't last time it's been a while since I've signed up an Apple ID but you can get a stolen
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:17.120]   credit card use that to validate yourself you can basically give it the information that it needs
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:22.080]   in order to enable it and still give you trust for it however but you're right that the the
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:27.840]   ability for Apple to simply to snitch you out is way way way too powerful but that's not going to
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:33.280]   stop people who are also have already made the decision that stealing 20 30 40 50 000 cars is a
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:40.480]   good way to to have a long safe and free and freedom filled life uh it's this this is a problem that
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:44.800]   I was actually I was on WGN radio this morning in Chicago we're talking about this exact same issue
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:48.960]   and the thing that you I think that you have to keep mentioning is that this is not a problem
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:53.840]   that's isolated to Apple this is a problem that is not avoidable in any kind of technology that's
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:58.640]   similar to this when you got a Bluetooth tracker the question is how hard are each of these companies
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:03.520]   willing to go to minimize the problem and to contain it to make it make people think that it's
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:08.240]   not a PR problem they feel as though it's a responsibility that they have and to me I'm glad
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:13.760]   that Apple is doing so much work to protect people who have iPhones it really does make you feel
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:19.920]   though as though uh isn't it doesn't isn't it nice to have an iPhone isn't nice to have the
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:24.080]   security problem affect affect you by a prop by a company that's making the same company that's
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:28.800]   making your phone if you have an android phone good luck to you here's hey our solution that
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:33.760]   problem is that now we're releasing a new line of less expensive iPhones so make it easier for
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:38.400]   you to switch from from android iPhone I'm being a little bit facetious of course but it's like
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:43.440]   again it's it's not a good look and I really wish that Apple were giving android users a much much
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:49.040]   much better set of tools to defend themselves against their own trackers could this Samsung app
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:52.400]   work like I was just curious like if it because as far as I know tile and Samsung are addressing
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:57.040]   this by just making blanket Bluetooth scanners like they don't they never intent like they
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:01.440]   they never built anything they didn't prepare for anything like the pushback that they're getting
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:04.800]   Apple was like a little bit of the way there so they can expand on that but they didn't so they've
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:09.520]   made like blanket Bluetooth scanners so I wonder if like at any point the OS will just built in a
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:14.000]   blanket unknown Bluetooth device alert and then we won't have to worry about the apps or the
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.080]   specific um if you've already got the hardware that's just a software thing or maybe somebody
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:25.040]   could write it well I talked to someone about it a while ago and they said the problem is that
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:29.920]   how do you discriminate this Bluetooth device against others there are Bluetooth device IDs
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:34.160]   but are you going to be able to account for all of them so you'd have to you'd have to create
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:39.360]   specific countermeasures specific detectors for specific devices to make them really really
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:44.480]   effective and but the I think there should be so it would be great if there were some sort of
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:50.160]   consortium like this that some sort of an open API so that if you wanted to any company wanted
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:55.040]   to build a tracker into the hardware to make it as inobtrusive to the power demands and
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:59:00.080]   CPU demands of the device as possible they could simply use this API and the all these devices would
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:05.520]   also conform to that API it looks like a good a good a good example of lots of companies a good
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:09.920]   opportunity for example for people to get together and create a solution so that this business can
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:13.760]   continue to move forward yeah and then there's lots of stuff back together lots of stuff says
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:19.840]   what it is but I guess if you wanted to be surreptitious you have a problem to solve because like you
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:24.320]   and I are on a bus lio and we're traveling together and you've got a tag or you've got something it's
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:29.040]   following me it's not mine but I'm going to be on that bus every day right and if I start pressing
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:33.200]   ignore to everything and then I am being like a lot of this stuff is really easy to say apple
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:38.560]   shooter Samsung shooter googler or android or iOS should but they are very non-trivial problems
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:42.800]   to solve you want you want to have some fun I did this with the other day when I was riding a bike
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:47.440]   because my have a bluetooth helmet the pairs and I was pairing it and it inadvertently I left the
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:53.200]   bluetooth open just watch all the bluetooth the broadcasting bluetooth devices where you go anywhere
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:59.600]   just do it where you are right now I see three TVs a speaker an airplay device a couple of
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:07.040]   n-zero something a rent speaker I see two Nexus Qs I see the eave room I don't know what the eave
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:13.840]   room wait two Nexus Qs yeah that's what it says story there what's what's what are the Nexus Qs I
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:17.440]   don't even know those are that little speaker that google made and promptly has everybody to
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:23.680]   forget about we have it they never did it see that's the beauty if you turn on the bluetooth you
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:32.320]   can find us all sorts of stuff I I read stuff and I work on my iPad pro like when I'm on public
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:36.320]   transportation when I'm on commuter rail trains and Amtrak and the number of times I have to say
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:41.120]   no I don't I thank you for informing that there's a pair of AirPods pro nearby but I really don't
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.880]   want to connect to them but thank you yeah that was like that was worth pulling me out of my work
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:53.360]   for yeah it's it's a tough thing to solve um and maybe companies should have thought about this
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:58.080]   before they started making all these trackers they should have become watchmakers yeah they did
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:04.720]   they did they do that too yeah by the way this is completely out of nowhere but this morning as
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:10.160]   I'm changing my watch band I'm thinking you know apple gets so much credit for all the things they
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:15.600]   did with the apple watch they deserve a little bit of a credit for somehow understanding that we as
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:22.480]   men have very few ways to show flair right yes we dress in a uniform whether whether we whether
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:27.680]   there's literal or or imagine unless we pierce something from our own yeah yeah so you know sometimes
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:32.320]   doctors will wear flamboyant ties because they want to show off or or you know I'm wearing my mom's
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:39.120]   and he keeps breaking shots right to give to show some flair but I realized apple at some point
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:44.960]   probably Johnny I've said you know what men need they need a way to show flair we should make it easy
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:51.760]   to swap watch bands I don't have any other watches that can do this I mean this is incredible
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:56.240]   you know every other watching it's a tool to get that pin out you put a I've done it but it's a
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:01.600]   pain in the butt to switch watch bands and as a result there's a massive market in apple watch
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:07.360]   bands of all things you know god bless god bless Johnny I've I know he lives in a white room
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:12.080]   years with us manually resizing our own links and apple comes out and he goes no no no you can
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:15.920]   we look at our resize your links like an animal it's gonna pop them out yeah we'll pop them
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:20.800]   bless them and I have a you know like I don't know I don't have a rene richy size collection of
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:26.800]   watch bands but I have a fairly sized because it's fun sometimes you want to do something different
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:33.440]   it's and as I said men don't have that many options for flair it's it's it's become it's become a
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.760]   tradition to switch to the rainbow band when I look during pride month nice like it does it
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:42.560]   doesn't it doesn't go more few days realize that even even when even on the I do have an apple
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:46.960]   watch but I also have like a Fitbit as like yeah you know what I'm gonna buy it I'm gonna get out
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:50.560]   the pride band for the Fitbit because apple has trained me that this is the month where I need
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:54.800]   to have a rainbow band on my wrist you can't change a band of Fitbit did they do that after apple
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.400]   made it easy on the watcher before maybe apple took a cue from Fitbit
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:07.440]   oof i'm kind of a bit pebble yeah I think pebble there was there was there was a watch
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:14.240]   designed where it was it was still a traditional watch post design however the post instead of the
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.400]   spring for the post where you squeeze it using a tool there was actually a little sliding switch
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:24.160]   that could engage disengage that I I might be wrong in thinking that that might have proceeded
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:29.120]   by a little bit but if it even if it did proceed it it was no no nowhere near as convenient it wasn't
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:34.480]   the pebble it wasn't the pebble because here's CNET showing you how to change the pebble watch
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:40.080]   band and it's it involves a fairly scary tool that looks like a debt like a dental instrument
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:46.800]   so I'm oh god I'm gonna say it wasn't it wasn't the show the show the tool oh I skipped back too
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:51.680]   far I want to show the tool you know how these youtubers you know these youtubers they go on and
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:59.600]   on and on here's the tool oh my god it's it looks like it's a dental pick I really do I know
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:06.880]   okay okay if I need that it's not easy if I need a tool I have to call i fix it it's not easy yeah
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:12.400]   maybe Fitbit invented it and apple just said that's a good idea I'll probably mark Newsom
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:19.760]   with a with a with a candlestick in the library I like it so now you know my flare my watch
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:25.280]   and my socks let's take let's take a little time out last thing can I add Leo yes
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:30.000]   um the other thing that apple's doing is because the the alarms like there's a trilling sound a
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.400]   chirping sound that the air tags will make if they detect that they've been around an iPhone
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:39.680]   that's not registered to it for a while they're making that shriller is my it's my way of describing
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:44.080]   it they're going to use a higher pitch tone and make it louder so it's harder to not hear but also
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.640]   for people who are lower or have no hearing they're going to blurt out an alert an alert as well
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:52.960]   so that if you have an iPhone or you're running the Google tracker app it'll pop up visibly to you
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:57.280]   as well in case it's too far away or you just you can't hear it I think the biggest problem I have
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:01.760]   is that I just get so many alerts now but I don't know which one that's mentioned before I get so
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:06.640]   many that say your your AirPods are not with you I'm like they're in my pocket like I open them up
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:10.320]   they're in my pocket there's so many false alarms that I just don't know what to pay attention to I
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:15.200]   think that's the problem I have I agree well I'm gonna tell you about a false alarm that saved a life
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:21.680]   in just a second uh got a great team here for you Renee Richie and the Inako
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:27.840]   Alex Lindsey you're watching Mac break weekly if you're not by the way a member of club twit I
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:34.960]   just want to encourage you to sign up today at twit.tv/clubtwit $7 a month but you get some really good
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:43.600]   benefits including our discord and we're going to have oh dockeda next in our after hours conversation
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:51.760]   our fireside chats coming up Amy Webb her new book is out um it's just we also do the untitled
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:57.520]   Linux show in there we've got a brand new show we're uh trialing and club members get to see at first
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:04.320]   this week in space with Rod Pyle and uh Tarek Malek from space.com rods from the National Space Society
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:09.920]   we can do that because of the club twit members and so thank you club twit members and if you are
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:16.880]   not a member twit.tv/clubtwit no more ads not even this one and a lot of new content additional
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:25.360]   content plus of course access to the great discord server. Here's a nursing student from
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:33.600]   Sydney you might have seen this uh who had a thyroid problem and had a lot of bad symptoms
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:40.560]   she if had she not disabled the alerts on her Apple Watch she might have noticed
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:51.600]   back uh three months earlier because her VO2 Max had been slipping and uh and uh the Watch
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:57.840]   New the Watch New now the disease she has which is thyroid hemia genesis only affects
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:04.400]   about uh you know a small number of people but she looked up the Apple Watch history
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:10.000]   found it recorded a dramatic change in her health if she had known it I genuinely just went on to
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.480]   see if everything was turned on I saw that there were alerts at the top of the app that had never
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:18.800]   come through because I didn't have notifications turned on and looked and when I could see the
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:26.400]   trend that my VO2 Max had dropped literally in a matter of days so she's now awaiting treatment
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:31.840]   for condition but she wanted everyone to know you might want to check your health readings
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:38.800]   every once in a while if you've got notifications uh turned off interesting story that I think
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:43.600]   the more and more we're going to see stuff like that that the watch is really uh very useful.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.680]   I think that I still think that over time the other thing that's going to happen as we start to tie
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:52.320]   these things together is that the watch is going to start seeing behaviors that we haven't seen
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:56.560]   before because it's measuring it you know anonymized across millions of people
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:00.480]   that it's going to start seeing things that you know when your heart starts to do this
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:04.080]   six months later you're going to die you know like you know like it's you know like it's you know
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:08.720]   like but I mean eventually not maybe not six months but you know whatever it is it like sees
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:13.440]   something that you can't see unless you're just measuring people all the time you know so that's
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:16.800]   the whole thing is that it's going to change the way we do I mean I think that Tim Cook is right
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:20.320]   though it's going to change the way we think about health and medicine and a lot of other things
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:24.880]   because of the way because it's it's persistent you know and it's on our wrist all the time and
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:31.280]   it's going to see be you know data that can be correlated over time back to you know health risks
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:35.360]   well wait a minute my VO2 max has been below average for a year
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:41.840]   I've had to even see that deep deep trouble it's you know go to health
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:45.840]   go to your health app the health app has all that stuff it's very valuable
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:51.440]   um as at a below average fitness level you may find it hard to do some things
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:56.960]   wait a minute you son of a gun
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:04.160]   uh no I think that everybody should this nurse's point is well taken should check the health app
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:09.760]   and there's lots of metrics in there I turn everything on everything I've got should record
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:18.000]   to health blood pressure meters my scale my sleep trackers my food and take as I use
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.840]   new them and that goes into health so all of that stuff goes into health yeah
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:28.400]   it's particularly valuable for people who live alone that you if you have a spouse if you have
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:33.360]   people living with you that can notice that yeah you've been in bed a lot lately or you know what
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:39.040]   you stumbled a lot more than I'm used to or your speech is a little bit slower than I'm used to
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:43.680]   hearing that's the sort of thing that makes you that makes you think makes things add up makes
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:48.400]   you think about what was the last time you had a full checkup but a fitness device can even if
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:54.560]   you whether passively or actively make you think that yeah you know what my even if you're not even
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:59.520]   if you're not exercising for fitness goals just reminding you that it has been two or three days
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:04.960]   since you've done more than 500 steps which means that you've been working inside the house all day
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:09.120]   every day for three days you need to get some you get need to get some sunlight you need get some
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:12.720]   vitamin D yeah I think that's one of the other benefits that we're starting to see from all these
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:16.800]   fitness devices here's one by the way the other thing to look at you do look at your health app and
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:22.000]   look at things that you haven't turned on I have not turned on the walking steadiness notifications
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.960]   and you might say well I'm not gonna worry about that but nevertheless I mean what does it cost
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:31.920]   you to turn it on it says iPhone can measure your steadiness while walking a strong indicator of
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:39.920]   your risk of falling and we know the risk of falling is a big issue and as you age if you're
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:45.840]   walking steadiness reaches a lower very low level iPhone can send you a notification and exercises
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:51.840]   that improve strength and balance might help so I'm gonna I'm gonna turn that on that's good
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:11:00.560]   there's okay low and very low turn on notifications you bet good and I'm adding my walking steadiness
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:08.560]   it's okay by the way I guess it's been tracking it and I didn't even know it says my steadiness has
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:19.520]   been okay we know we notice a glide to your stride and your step yeah you've closed your
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:27.200]   hey daddy crud daddy ring oh for some reason back in September it was really low see that that one
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:32.240]   outlier there so that was that that I should be paying attention to that was very low
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:40.240]   maybe I fell that day I don't know but it's yes it's been low okay but there was just this one little
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:49.280]   low I wonder what that's all about maybe an error right iPhone 6 plus is now a vintage product
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:55.600]   can we moment of silence for the 6 plus was that the first really big iPhone the 6 plus
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:02.640]   yes yeah that's also when the hipsters get really interested Leo the vintage I mean it just like
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:09.840]   with the goes with your hat yeah your spats that's it's why you got to embrace well the thing is
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:13.680]   you get a key there's a certain warmth to the pictures that you get with a camera when you've
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:19.600]   got one of those two based camera images there is a new hipstomatic by the way I really love that
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:25.360]   does the old timey photos just like you know to gear types it's so cool the iPhone 6 plus first
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:34.160]   release September 2014 discontinued September 2016 weirdly the 6 is not on the vintage list
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:39.920]   because it was for sale for longer but good for apple I mean that's an eight-year-old phone that
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:50.480]   just now is going on the vintage list first devices to offer support for apple play the first year
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:56.720]   the iPhone offered was offered in multiple size options yeah same event the apple watch was
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:04.560]   was announced oh really okay yeah so the you get on the vintage list by if you have if a product is
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:10.560]   not been sold for more than five years and less than seven years apple provides service and parts
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:15.920]   for vintage devices for up to seven years or as required by law bus repairs or subject to parts
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:23.920]   availability so software updates ended back in 2019 with iOS 13 but now we're talking we're moving
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:30.000]   into that obsolete zone there's vintage and then there's obsolete old junk drawer in the sky yep
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:38.640]   I'm vintage but I'm not yet obsolete I believe I would get my till I tell them to my frailty indicator
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:43.600]   goes through the roof are you interested in Steve Jobs memorabilia some of it's a little weird
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:50.240]   some of it's some of it's feels a little snoopy this is from our not as license plate that's for
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:55.760]   sure yeah yeah there was none if you if anybody offers you a Steve Jobs license plate just just

[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:34.880]   all in one let me find the Steve Jobs lot that's there's 18 items in the Steve Jobs lot Alan Alcorn's
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:44.160]   apple to computer Steve Jobs assigned 1971 high school yearbook Steve wrote when this you see
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:55.120]   remember me little else I can say remember me as you may Steve Jobs okay currently a thousand
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:00.160]   even then he was a maverick even then did you see the Super Bowl add making fun of the here's
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:06.400]   to the crazy ones have you seen that it's all American Super Bowl add oh wait a minute okay
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:12.160]   here it's called here's to the lazy ones only there was a YouTube and it's uh I'll find it for
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:16.800]   you it's from a company called Cutwater Spirits I'll just play I could play a little bit of an ad
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:21.520]   who would take it down for an ad notice we've actually noticed that none of the Super Bowl ads
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:26.240]   are getting pulled down from the yeah everyone is making the top 10 of this and top 10 of that
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:31.040]   here this is I'm sure they're all good this is the tribute to the here's to the crazy ones here's
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:41.280]   to the lazy ones the renegades the outliers the unsung geniuses the ones who live life differently
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:51.760]   working smarter not harder you can make fun of them or ignore them but the one thing you can't do
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:59.280]   is disagree with them because they reach better results with less effort
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:06.160]   that's pretty funny isn't it human racing new way you got to see the video because they're doing
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:14.080]   all these lazy things and while some may see them as the lazy ones we see pioneers
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:24.560]   because the ones who make the most of their time are the ones who are ahead of it
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:31.200]   Cutwater bar quality cocktails in a can you get a drink you sure you could have got
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:35.840]   rifles you get cocktails in a can why would you make a cocktail when you could be lazy I think
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:41.600]   that's brilliant and yeah I don't I don't know why is it's it's not I guess it's parody right
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:45.440]   I don't think apple the only thing they could have done better if they've gotten Richard
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:51.120]   Dreyfus to do to voice it then that would have really eight plus if they'd just done that
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:58.080]   I'm Dreyfus I was in Jaws here's a photos of Steve job candid photos as a college freshman
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:04.560]   of course with a big watermark I don't know if I'd spend money on that minimum bid 200 bucks though
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:12.800]   you know he could have these apple computer check signed by was and jobs for three thousand four
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:19.120]   hundred three dollars to cure if electronics I think this was to buy parts from the apple
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:24.240]   computer computing company I always think I think about this in relationship to NFTs when people say
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:27.680]   well how can you have given NFT a bunch of money well this is a piece of paper that we're trying
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:32.480]   to sell for thirty thousand dollars yeah with an NFT you by the way have the knowledge that this
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:38.320]   is the provenance is genuine yes although he has a brilliant video today on on why like art is
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:42.480]   valuable because of so there be says art is valuable because of the certificate and NFTs say
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:47.760]   the board ape is valuable because of the blockchain yeah and I I'm not a big NFT fan and incidentally
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:53.120]   one of the houses had to shut down because of the counterfeits so there goes your provenance
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:18:01.120]   whole thing here's Steve job's Atari application by the way this one includes an NFT so you get
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:09.200]   both and that's why it's twenty thousand dollars here's a here's a Steve jobs business card vice
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:17.920]   president of operations from 1978 here's another business card from 1983 chairman board of directors
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:24.160]   a thirtieth birthday celebration table card somebody's really saved a lot of crap for the first
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:28.320]   thirty years of life you make your habits for the last thirty years of life your habits make you
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:33.680]   you've helped me acquire my habits good and bad thank you for joining me tonight to celebrate
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:38.800]   thirty more years of living with them and there's his bow tie as the trademark that's kind of cool
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:45.680]   that's the universal law if you if you save crap long enough it becomes culture and then
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:51.360]   becomes collectible yeah becomes currency yeah save it by the way this auction ends as a kid
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:54.240]   maria she threw it all out all your baseball cards you throw them out
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:57.600]   uh... just when i said mom come on since treasure she's like clean up your room
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:02.240]   treasure it's kind of interesting that he said that he said uh for the next 30 years like for
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:06.720]   the first 30 years this is the next 30 years you you you have it and he said he didn't he
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:11.600]   normally would say wow that's really depressing that you'd say you're only going to live in other
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:16.240]   30 years but he didn't didn't live in other 30s get the whole twenty six yeah he also stopped
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:22.240]   wearing bow ties so exactly exactly i was gonna say that was the that was that was the one narrow
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:27.200]   slice of history in which you can iconify steve jobs of the bow tie yeah yeah now then it became
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:32.800]   the turtle neck because there's too much trouble to sign bow ties here you go um you know i think
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:37.200]   we get the benefit of this just by browsing the catalog that's all i believe exactly yeah i
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:40.960]   know yeah my my thing was less about providence within a piece and more of the absurdity of
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:46.320]   collectibles yeah in general just like i'm just like yeah you'd have to be a big fan i mean what
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:51.760]   you know oh good i i have i have steve jobs 1971 high school yearbook what am i gonna do with that
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:57.840]   i don't even want my high school yearbook right so yeah well it see this is this is going to become
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:02.640]   more significant and like 50 years a hundred years because there there are people that think of
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:09.440]   every violinist who has like an autograph whatever by joshah heifetz in their violin case it's like
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:15.360]   the when you have something in your possession that you know was was held in their hands of somebody
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:20.000]   that you admire and look up to and is a model for a lot of your life decisions that's some
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:27.200]   powerful powerful mojo and so that's i i cannot imagine something that is as trivial as a numeric
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:34.480]   keypad for for mac 120 mac 512 becoming that kind of a touchstone for anything but there's
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:38.720]   the but there's some stuff that people are going to kind of enjoy having in about a hundred years
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:46.400]   from now bob bob marley bob marley special edition ipod classic again thousand bucks someone's
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:53.200]   already bid for it okay if you enjoy it that's great yeah i have i'll i'm sorry i'll just i'll
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:58.400]   just close off by saying that i have like within reach right now i have a set of twiggy drives pulled
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:04.400]   from uh from original lisa that i intend it's one of the it's one of the happiest things i own i
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:09.840]   will probably have it until i die and no one will want it after i go but it's like whenever i look at
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:16.560]   it i think about engineering i think about hubris i think about lawsuits i think about so much
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:22.240]   uh that it's involved in computer history and so this is why you can't you can't people will have
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:26.240]   us will find their own relationship to physical tangible objects that other people won't be able
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:32.000]   to understand here's uh a letter that's actually the provenance of this was kind of interesting this is
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.240]   a letter steve wrote to a kid it's being sold by mark miller who's a former executive vice president
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:42.960]   and general manager of herst magazines he says that in 1982 i was at a charity dinner
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:48.320]   three years after i purchased the first apple to computer to use at herst magazines i met and sat
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:53.120]   with a young fellow named steve jobs we talked about how his company's computer with a Hercules
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:57.840]   board boosting memory allowed me to ultimately reshape and optimize my analytical approach to the
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:04.640]   future uh at at that dinner i asked steve to write a message to my son brian about what he might
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:08.960]   expect in the future he said sure pulled out a scrap of paper from his pocket started to write
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:14.160]   this note he asked what his name was i said brian and he's six years old he immediately switched from
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:19.600]   script to printing so brian could read his note better and its simplicity steve was envisioning
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:25.440]   email and a very different future than that of the early 1980s it is kind of cool he switched
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:32.720]   from a handwriting to block printing that's pretty cool steve jobs and that the the note reads when i
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:37.840]   was six years old we didn't have computers you're lucky keep learning about computers and how
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:42.320]   they're going to help us communicate with each other you are our future steve jobs
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:49.520]   that's a current bid ten thousand dollars ps don't hire john scullie to do anything he will
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:58.160]   screw you over yourself that wasn't to happen for another seven years so he doesn't know it yet
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:11.360]   anyway that's at rr auctions or auction singular dot com uh apple leads the headphone market
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:17.920]   in case you're curious are you surprised by a lot of beats by beats is over 50 percent of the market
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:24.480]   yeah so this is from statista based on a multi-pick survey of 4,220 us headphone users
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:32.400]   conducted in four ways between january and december 2021 uh yeah apples 34 percent but
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:39.360]   beats is 15 percent put those two together you got half the market baby then bows samseung jbl
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:46.800]   sony skullcanny and lg but 50 percent of the market goes to uh to apple it's really an incredible
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:53.280]   number it is it's amazing yeah and a market that apple you know got into kind of almost it feels
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:58.640]   like as an afterthought i don't think it was out of courage they took courage took taking the headphone
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:05.120]   jack out fueled on courage by the way number four samseung who also took the headphone jack out of
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:09.920]   their phones all in all in order to sell but do they bury all those headphone jacks and the
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:14.000]   wilderness with the tarry cartridges what happened all those i still have them i still have had well
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.640]   i have had phone i still have headphone adapters you know i just bought uh because i'm getting the
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:26.560]   samseung galaxy 22 ultra and i realized oh i need an adapter for my headphones and the stylus but not
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:31.600]   a jack yeah isn't that wild all my headphones now have the little adapter on the end of them
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:36.080]   because i i try to keep it around i kept on losing them i was like no i just put them on the end of
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:42.720]   all of them so i did a little research actually and i found actually this this should work uh i don't
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:48.160]   know if it'll work with the uh apple phone and the apple jack will work with the samseung i'm told
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:54.240]   you need a DAC in it it turns out uh but this is from a company called jsaux and i saw a
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:58.640]   recommendation for this and i think it's good i this one allows you to plug in headphones and power it
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:07.360]   so that's pretty cool christmas type c obviously it's not a lightning adapter but uh i yeah oh the
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:13.360]   price went up since i bought it by the way i must have set something off um i bought a couple of them
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:17.600]   because i figured you know this is a good thing to have lying around the house and and i can use it
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:23.360]   with my uh ipad too which doesn't have a headphone jack either that iphone six plus had a vintage
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:30.240]   headphone jack leo that iphone six plus had a vintage headphone jack you're right was you know
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:35.680]   it was the last iphone that had the headphone jack iphone six s six s plus and uh and the yes
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:41.440]   original se and and rene that's that that goes to your point about like hipster is like wanting
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:46.320]   the vintage stuff like because you'll want that that warm sound of that analog audio output
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:51.200]   well it's got to plug into your turntable okay you guys
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:26:02.240]   uh all right anything else that we have neglected to mention um there's a weird rumor today leo
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:05.680]   that i don't know i don't know how much doc to put into it because it's such an outlier yeah that
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:11.200]   there we will be getting an m2 macbook pro uh at the event but it's going to be in the same enclosure
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:15.440]   with the with the touch bar and everything and that that would just i don't know how i would
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:22.640]   mentally parse that if that happened yeah i i'm gonna call bs on that one that makes no sense at all
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:29.360]   um how but it has been a has it been a year when did they announce the first m ones was a spring
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:34.800]   of last year? November of 2020. November 2020 so it has been and it has been a year for the 13th
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:40.160]   more than a year yeah uh interesting. Yeah it gets at saccine re-design and this doesn't even
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:44.320]   get the new macbook pro enclosure i'm just gonna feel that i'm overly sad this was published by mac
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:48.800]   rumors but i'm gonna call bs because not only does it have the same design as a 13 inch macbook
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:56.640]   pro it has the touch bar yes why doom developers to another year of touch bars is no way if they
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:01.920]   do this i'm just it's a head scratcher that makes no sense i just i'd be okay with the touch bar as
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:06.160]   long as i like to turn it off like i just the number one thing it does is i'm hit the wrong i
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:13.920]   just hit it by accident yeah all the time yeah um this uh lines up though according to mac rumors
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:19.040]   with a digit times report from last week saying apple will launch its first macbook pro with an
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:24.880]   m2 at its spring event so but i just they've i mean uh the old design at least exciting m2
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:32.160]   possible for them to launch yeah yeah i just strategically it seems to you know counter intuitive which
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:36.720]   is why they're gonna do it like i just i just right now yeah makes no sense then of course they're
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:42.960]   doing it no you know you're just i know what you're doing rene you're just hedging your bets in case
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:47.360]   you know you know it's you know it's fun we're we're talking about this earlier on office hours
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:51.520]   or after hours i can't remember which but but we were talking about the fact of trust you know like
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:55.440]   that the fact that apple could apple we have different levels of trust with different products
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:00.880]   that apple puts out like if apples said september one we're releasing three phones we won't tell
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:04.720]   anything about them but they're small medium large and if you want to order it right now you'll be
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:10.240]   in the front of the line they'd sell 20 30 million you know of them right there like with that
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:13.680]   sight unseen because we just know the phone will be better than it was the last time if they did
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:18.640]   that with them with a macbook i'd be like mmm i think i need to see it yeah i don't like like i
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:22.160]   think i don't i don't think i'll buy it right out of there i need to see what they're gonna do with
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:26.960]   it because i just don't have the same i felt like we spent like three or four years in unhappiness
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:35.200]   okay you hipsters line up because look what i got an iphone six s and it's got a courage jack
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:41.920]   built right in nice even a fingerprint reader a freedom jack and look they still have the plastic
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:46.640]   line in the back for the antennas because it's a metal body and that's not a mechanical eo that's
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:51.360]   not a virtual home but that's a mechanical home button yes oh it feels good when you press it
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:56.240]   that's the click of freedom vibrates the freedom clicker freedom the freedom
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:02.880]   phone the freedom jack the freedom jon's backup phone it by the way john i'm impressed it's in
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:07.520]   perfect condition oh is that his burner if anybody wants this yeah this is the funny
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:14.080]   uses when he puts air tags in my car uh if anybody anybody wants this john what would you sell it
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:20.960]   for no no price at all no fine nft of it yeah a headphone jack it's got a headphone jack
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:26.240]   and it has um freeze mcgee on the front so you know that makes it even more valuable
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:30.640]   look at that i'm going to put it back in the case that's how you've kept it so pristine isn't it
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:38.240]   beautiful a vintage iphone six s plus no six plus six s plus six s plus
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:44.720]   perfect condition a mere eight thousand nine hundred and two dollars
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:53.840]   how about it anybody takers yet and yet you know i have to say though it and for its time it must
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:30:00.640]   have been seen as huge because it's very close it's not that small even put next to a 12 pro max
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:07.760]   it's big that was it was a big phone remember they walked around with different pieces of of
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:11.280]   design where to see what the right size is where they had all these different
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:15.280]   everything at every quarter inch and they just walked around this feels right this feels proper
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:23.200]   this is inevitable and it's just it must be it might yes big bezels though big bezels you know
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:30.960]   big forehead and beard i think i think as i remember birk made us foam core replicas uh because
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:36.800]   we had heard we saw the size but we couldn't it was baffling so we had foam core replicas
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:43.200]   just to get an idea of what it might be like to hold it do we still have those foam core replicas
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:48.000]   because when i pass away that should be in my auction i'll autograph them now
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.200]   all right we're gonna take a little time out but don't sign it that way people know i did i did say
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:59.040]   i was gonna ask about the reality o s there's probably not that much to say it's the o s for the
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:04.320]   glasses right but we're starting to see more and more the headset the headset we're starting to see
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:11.520]   more and more uh lines in operating system code and things like that yeah in the in in developer
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:17.040]   tools and this is basically a repeat of something that actually going back to mark german i think first
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:23.920]   purport in 2017 that there's that there's something called ros that's in play uh as as apple continues
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:28.240]   to hire more people to virtual reality develop their own virtual reality classes but this is the
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:33.120]   first time that we've seen it recently and that's may or may or may not be assigned the phase still
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:38.480]   intend to create so really something this year or next but it is interesting that it would appear in
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:46.160]   developer tools uh for people who are excuse me and i'm sorry so on a github library created by apple
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:51.520]   so it exists it's a thing so if you want to if you want to get a get a get a jump on your tattoo
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:56.000]   uh reality o s is probably going to be a valid thing in the next years look at this
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:02.240]   birk has birk apparently saves everything this is the i birk six and i birk six plus
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:08.800]   with a little little dot where the home button should be and it's an exact foam core replica
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:13.920]   of the i buss explore it should be bagged and bagged and authenticated leo yeah birk will you
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:18.640]   sign these and we can have them at your auction how about that that's pretty cool isn't it that's
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:26.560]   really cool uh apple's reality o s has surfaced in github commits okay but also an app store logs
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:32.320]   which sounds to me like there's an actual device out there identifying itself yes
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:37.680]   if you see it in the uh logs they got to be tested something's tested something's being tested
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:44.800]   but that doesn't i mean i could be a prototype for years uh rens verhoeven tweets um what is
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:51.520]   apple's reality o s doing in the app store upload logs arvr confirmed question mark
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:56.240]   so and here's the picture i don't think we have any doubt that there's an ar device coming i think
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:33:03.120]   it's just a matter of when calm dot apple dot platform dot reality o s yeah no information
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:10.720]   they'll look at architecture blank product type blank support level unsupported compiled code
[01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:18.800]   required yeah interesting though that's interesting so yeah we're getting um maybe we're getting close
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:27.840]   i don't know i don't know i hope so uh i need something leo yeah uh if target here's here's some
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:36.160]   source code this is interesting too from uh github uh apple force pushed the ray pote to hide this
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:44.560]   but someone had grabbed the commit hash already so you can see it here it is if target underscore
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:53.440]   feature underscore reality o s and then it says allow ios executables to use reality o s dynamic
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:34:03.440]   libraries hmm hmm allow ios sim executables to use reality o s sim dynamic libraries hmm
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:09.760]   so uh an apple you know apple of course the best thing apple could have done is is ignore it but
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:14.560]   instead apple immediately deleted it which tells you whoo
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:24.480]   if you i see this all the time when people on you're on tv and somebody accidentally walks into the
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:30.000]   shot and instead of just keeping walking they go home and they duck and they scurry out it's like
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.160]   you're just calling attention to it just keep walking you're making it worse just keep walking
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:40.320]   an apple yep that's why my our advice to like all those people in third and fourth grade
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:44.960]   you know it's it's you're gonna accidentally call your teacher mommy at some point just pretend
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:49.760]   like it never happened and then when someone says you just call me said mrs. palisimo i'm sorry what
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:55.920]   did you hear me say exactly just keep just deny it kill people people will deny their own senses
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:02.560]   if you simply stick to your guns just deny it deny deny deny all right get ready it's time for the
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:11.040]   picks of the week coming up next as mac break weekly continues um i think i'll start with rene
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:17.440]   this week for our picks of the week rene okay so um this was something there's a is a tv show on
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:22.960]   netflix and it's not the newest show but it's it's something that surprised me it's called arcane
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:27.920]   and i didn't originally watch it because it's it's based on league of legends and i have never
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:33.120]   played league event legends and it just it didn't grok with me but then mutual friend of the show
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:37.920]   georgia dao started making videos explaining it and i watched the videos and like i think i
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:43.280]   would actually really enjoy this and so after i'd watched a couple of videos i went back and watched
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:47.920]   it and for people who worry about some of them it's not like it's not like canon to league of legends
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:53.680]   but it uses a lot of the characters and a lot of the sets and a lot of the just the general mythos
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:36:00.160]   of the of the game but it is what what attracted me it is it's just so beautifully done it's not
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:06.640]   computer animated in an era where even disney it's just like they're making fun in the latest
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:12.400]   chippendales trailer about how their characters all got these cgi upgrades over the years this is
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:18.720]   beautiful and done by a french animation company it's really gorgeous they do use models as references
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:22.960]   but they don't even use motion capture like they don't even use expression capture which is
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:29.120]   pandemic in the industry right now these are like you could freeze on any frame of this and it is
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:35.040]   gorgeous like even i will say even like beyond like the spiderverse style of gorgeousness because
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:41.520]   it is it is hand painted to a large extent it's frame by frame animated like it's still being key
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:48.240]   framed and it has this luxurious palette of characters like ensemble dramas we're aware of but a lot
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:53.600]   of times it's like he man you know it's like one character and then if you like really two-dimensional
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:37:00.080]   but it has such an amazing depth to it you have like the villains are all heroes of their own stories
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:04.400]   they have characters who are trying to raise you know other characters in their own image or
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:09.360]   desperate to avoid them being raised in their own image you have all these different relationships
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:14.640]   torn apart and slammed back together and i was i don't want to say shocked because that would be
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:20.080]   unfair to the rest of all of the Netflix and streaming shows that we've gotten recently
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:27.120]   but i was just amazed at like a video game company did what i would call like some of the best pure
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:33.600]   art in a in a show that i've seen in a really long time really really well acted like the
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:39.680]   everything the facial expressions the action the drama i was blown away by this series
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:44.000]   and i'm really happy that George introduced me to it because it was something i just totally
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.800]   dismissed when i first saw it being offered to me in Netflix over and over from the creators
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:54.560]   of league of legends yeah comes a new legend gorgeous yeah it's pretty cool
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:59.200]   reminds me of that magazine what was that magazine with mobius and all the others i was talking
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:03.200]   oh yeah yeah yeah talking about that the other day and how much i missed it heavy metal heavy metal
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:08.240]   yeah it has that real it looks a lot it looks like a heavy metal a come to life it's really beautiful
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:16.160]   i'm not a fan of animated action stuff but i'll watch it just because of you on Netflix arcane
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:24.480]   he's the name andi and echo pick of the week mine is a kind of an old favorite but it came up
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:28.080]   like in a couple questions on twitter this week and also we're kind of talking about this before
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:35.840]   the show about about about stuff uh my favorite apps of all time downy uh by uh charlie minro and
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:42.320]   it's an app that will just simply capture capture video capture audio capture pictures
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:47.520]   anything that is like a piece of media that you see on a website uh that you want to have in your
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:53.360]   library forever or for closer examination you just get the grab the URL from your web browser
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:58.640]   pacing it to downy it will find the actual source media file and download it to your
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:03.760]   download it to your desktop and it just you think that you see a lot of apps or oh this is a youtube
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:08.880]   downloader okay that and that's that's that's easy to find and you can get those apps for free
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:16.880]   this app supports dozens i'm sorry 874 different sites that that hosts content so like if you're
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:22.240]   watching an instructional video from somewhere and the player that's embedded just absolutely
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:28.080]   stinks and won't let you uh won't let you i i really need to see really really closely what this
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:32.320]   person is doing with their hands and whether the whether the needle that they're sewing is going
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:37.920]   through the stitch or behind the stitch at some point you give up i give up get downy downloaded
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:43.120]   and just use a much better video player in order to get at it uh it's it's just and if for the
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:49.040]   sites that it does it's not designed to work with there's also a guided extraction uh so that you
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:54.640]   can basically opens a firefox compatible browser window and then it will just simply in a little
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:59.280]   a little pain of that window it will show you all the media sources that are coming through that
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:03.360]   through that window and then you can say well click on one of them and tell it to please try to capture
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:08.720]   this i use that a lot for like live uh live arts presentations like live operas live theater
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:14.800]   where it would be a shame to sometimes it's just such a beautiful thing that i just really really
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:19.120]   just want to have it in my library and be able to watch it a few more times the only thing it can't
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:24.560]   i don't think it will do anything really really super shady like uh it won't let you it won't
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:29.120]   steal stuff from Netflix won't steal stuff that's a password protected and that nothing that stuff
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:34.000]   but stuff that is designed to be free the stuff the stuff where the content provider has done nothing
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.880]   to protect the content and under the terms of the web it's just simply a url that anybody can
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:44.800]   grab stuff from it'll work just fine with not it's not that expensive and he keeps updating it and
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:49.680]   updating it and updating it and it's just a solid solid piece of software we get highest recommendations
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:53.600]   you you will wind up using this and thanking yourself for having this thing installed i need
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:57.680]   it because now you know that i think about it there's a lot of videos i see i wish i could just
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:05.040]   save them so do i use to yeah love it downy yeah it takes a few hours it i'm sorry
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:09.840]   i talked over you i should have charlie winner wrote that net yeah it's it's for instance like
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:16.240]   apple uh they will put the keynote like on youtube or on another channels eventually but i need
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:21.120]   it right now i need i need to get a look at that screen grab of all the details and they flash
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:26.240]   by in eight seconds and yes i without any apologies whatsoever i will use down downy to download
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:31.280]   that thing and so i can actually save my poor fingers having to type furiously typing notes
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:36.720]   as a thing is happening anyways great stuff very nice Alex Lindsey pick of the week
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:42.160]   with andes is i use it as well i use it probably at least once a week and i think you were recommended
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:47.280]   arcane at some point too so i think i recommended the last two yeah okay so at some point yeah so
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:52.000]   you know you're two for two that's good yeah but the um transitor funny thing about the way downy
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:57.840]   works is that is that uh the you know a lot of this is just with unencrypted hls basically what it
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:03.280]   does it send you a segment of of data whether it's live or post and then your player normally just
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:06.800]   throws it away and down it just doesn't do that right i just keep i'll just keep on taking it
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:10.800]   and i'll just keep on taking it like two points all together so it'll work with hls especially
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:14.960]   well right i mean that's anything that's hls which is like 90 everything the web delivery is is
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:19.840]   hls and so if it's unencrypted so a netflix or an apple tv might not be but but if it's just like
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:23.520]   youtube i pull stuff off of youtube all the time like i just go i just drag drag drag drag drag
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:29.760]   and it'll look for it'll find all of the um it'll find all of the trans all the srt's as well so all
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:34.400]   of your translation tracks as like do you want english or do you want spanish or you know so
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:39.520]   it'll grab all of that as well so anyway it's useful my my pick is um is a is an app for the
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:44.240]   iPhone called shoot and uh it came up in office hours of course i'm not sure exactly who
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:48.720]   recommended it first but we started talking about it and the developer of course started
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:53.680]   responding to us and uh and talking to us about it and um what it does if i cut to it here
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:59.760]   is it's it's another app like um you know similar similar to film like pro that it will um you know
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:04.880]   here's just a live feed oh that's a good looking shot yeah it's a great a great looking shot and
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:09.840]   it's live feed from the camera that's from the iPhone camera wow yeah but what's cool is if i
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:14.160]   tap it with both fingers it freezes so now i'm moving my camera but you don't so if i want to
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:19.440]   talk about something oh i'd like that tap it again and you'll see it kind of go back to live so now
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:23.920]   it's back to live but even better if i want to talk about something i can tap it with two fingers
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:30.000]   and now i can circle it so it's got a little tele teleprompter and then double tap and it disappears
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.000]   and i can do something else i double tap and it disappears and then i tap it with two fingers and
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.760]   it's back to live and i can even draw over it while it's live too so if i want to draw on something
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:42.240]   that i'm looking at and so for the kind of stuff that we're doing when we're talking about things it's
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:48.880]   pretty pretty awesome um and it's i don't i can't run how much it is very little five bucks five
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:55.680]   bucks yeah worth every penny you know and a great little app um and uh i would highly you know highly
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:59.360]   recommend it especially if you ever want to like do something where you're gonna i'm sending this
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:04.560]   HDMI out of my you know out out to my switcher but it's just such a great thing because now your phone
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:09.520]   is a illustrator on anything you want to talk about it for teaching or talking about a subject and so
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:13.600]   it's just a it they really solved that really and it was funny because i was like be really good
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:17.440]   if i could freeze it and then well someone pointed out they're like yeah just tap it with two fingers
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:21.840]   and then it just froze and then and then i gets it there and circle things and talk about this
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:26.640]   and talk about that and then i can double tap and then use two fingers and so once you get used to it
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:32.000]   it's a really great way to to show stuff so anyway that's it it's my pick so there's three ways
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:37.760]   you're gonna take an extra computer if you've got a mac it'll do a usb connection yeah so you don't
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:41.360]   need the HDMI so you can use it as a web camera with the Mac so you can just go
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:50.000]   your your regular USB connection kit somehow or no well no you can just yeah yeah you can literally
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:54.320]   just do a type c yeah you can just put it in there and it'll just act like a web camera and then you
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:45:02.400]   have those and it's clean feed out super useful oh i was looking at the user comments and i can
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:06.960]   check me on this the user comments were saying that you can even use things like
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:13.040]   like blurring the background based on the based on the camera feature things like cinematic mode
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:18.240]   based on the iOS features that's true i don't know i've i haven't gone that far i got into it like
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:22.720]   a week ago and i'm i just been like this is amazing i just bought it i got a pick i got a pick i was
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:26.640]   like like yes last week i was like i got a pick i got a little hint though turn off notifications
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:31.360]   while you're using it because it doesn't block those that could be embarrassing
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:42.160]   shoot now you guys search for shoot pro webcam i found to really find it shoot pro webcam for
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:48.560]   Mac and pc it's ios app for ipad iphone and apple watch apparently i'm not sure how that works
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:54.800]   and it can also you work with e-camera obs or zoom or anything else that will
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:46:00.160]   understand a usb camera so yeah so just shows up with it would it that's cool so this e-cam does that
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:07.440]   too but with uh but on the on the backside this is this is on your on your phone so you're sitting
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:11.760]   there looking at your thing and circling things and i love that feature the fact that i could
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:14.960]   tell us straight i didn't look at the other features as much i was just like i can look at the
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:19.040]   and i think it has a couple different settings you can have different zoom settings it has shutter
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:27.120]   speed ev offset white balance presets yeah the premium version unlocks mike over hdmi or e-cam usp
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:32.160]   and the pause and the save images that's in part of the new version 3.0 that's really cool
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:38.560]   that's the big one now grids drawn top of light for live video with a virtual whiteboard wow
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:43.360]   yeah wow well done oh it works with cinematic mode
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:48.880]   oh very nice so for five bucks it's a great
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:56.160]   probably is as good you spend my money i bought the downy i bought the i bought the arcane
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:02.240]   one that was free because i have nefflux and now i'm getting shoot webcam shoot pro webcam
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:09.280]   thank you alex uh what's going on in office hours these days well we spent we had a great
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:13.920]   super bowl we we we watched the super bowl in after hours and but we didn't there was no audio
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:17.440]   and we and we didn't talk about the game at all all we talked about was the graphics and the
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:21.600]   and the commercials oh man what was i thinking i should have thought of that i could have gone
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:40.320]   office hours and oh that would have been fun it was the geekiest football game like
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:45.280]   100 people sitting there like watching from all over the world talking about about that and so um so
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:50.560]   anyway so we're wrapping up a little bit of that we have a um yes we've got today it is super bowl
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:54.880]   ads which i'd like to watch too and it kind of devolved it was really it devolved into just

[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:50.160]   the one you just scrolled to right if you go fair play dot IO under highlights yeah oh my gosh
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:53.920]   that's such a great episode if anyone oh yeah you talked about that a couple weeks ago yeah yeah

[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:06.160]   to get watching him do it like he he he has a piano that that accompanies you so while he starts
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:10.000]   playing the piano starts playing something with it like that he you know he sets up the rules for
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.000]   how the piano plays with him as he plays so he's moving some of the keys and it's moving other
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:17.440]   keys yes why was really and then he hasn't visualized it like he has a graphic it was over it
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:21.840]   sort of weird player piano he's got but he's got it yeah it is a crazy it's like i think it's a
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:28.400]   Yamaha piano polarized but you it's it's an episode that's really worth watching because it's just he
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:32.800]   he just kind of blew her mind like every 10 minutes i am definitely gonna watch that yeah
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:41.760]   andy and ako wg bh in boston when are you gonna be on next um a usual time friday at 1230 pm

[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:56.320]   ako project uh now now i'm hung up on monetization typical typical business head like first i
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:01.600]   created content for it then i created like the site for it and now oh before i actually release it
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:06.160]   let's think about how we can actually like get people to pay me for this and i'm stuck on that so
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:11.280]   welcome welcome to this is this is this is why i'm living this fabulous lifestyle that you see
[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:21.360]   always monetization always comes last yeah step three profit yeah uh maybe maybe maybe people will
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:26.960]   just like email me and ask say i'm really enjoying all this all this content is it possible for you
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:32.960]   to meet to maybe mail you a cashier's check or something there you go that's a good chance on
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:37.360]   the office chance that that's not going to work perhaps there should be i don't know like a
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:44.240]   sub stack or perhaps a patreon or a coffee or whatever you just have to watch i bet you there's
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:48.640]   somebody that has a it's like $60 million in a bank and they're ready to give it to you absolutely
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:54.640]   do this and i'll take it yeah it's like put your bitcoin wallet QR code up on the screen every
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:59.840]   one so that's all it takes you know what i got i've got like uh this this is what i use to like clean
[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:07.200]   out my my lenses here i can make that an nft no yeah just mint every content as an nft
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:11.760]   everything's an nft so still got some of the candles from that cake like five weeks ago that
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:17.040]   that's good we could put that right in the bit chain the blockchain you have to you have to put
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:23.200]   it nicely on the table and then take a picture that's the nft right right the you never have to mail
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:28.560]   anything just it's all it's all digital the point is that i do i do have like a roll away suitcase about
