[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   It's all downhill from here.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, a very good day to you.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Welcome back to the show that really doesn't talk about
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Mac's all that much, mostly.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   [ Music ]
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   We just wander off in our own little world.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Scott Born's a giggling over there.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Hey, Scott.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Howdy.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   From Apple Phone Show.com.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Thank you, sir.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   And podcastingtricks.com and iLifeZone.com.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   And, of course, the famous Padango.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Not to be confused with Padango.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   You're so kind.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Padango.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Well, we say Padango so we don't get sued by Apple's lawyers
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   for saying Padango.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Oh, yeah, really.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   That's a good reason.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   I told him it's Padango.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I think it's actually a Paudang show.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Paudang show.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Yeah, yeah.

[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   How's Muylin Man?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Nice 40th episode with the making of the Mac doll.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   From 43folders.com and, of course, the MerlinShow.com.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   And his tumble log, we're talking about you with David Karp on

[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I'm going to have to add that my own site to my host file.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   It has become like my slash dot.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   It's so great.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I can't smell.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   I don't know about that, but it's very fun.

[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Yes, yes.

[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   bizarre things that appeal just to me, it's definitely a

[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   It is.

[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   with colossal waste of band.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Colossal?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Colossal waste?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Thank you with the musical band with the clicking and the
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   dragging and the body.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   It's already time to play this.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I can't believe we're 30 seconds into the show and already.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   If you can see daylight from inside the rat hole, you're not
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   really inside the rat hole.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   We're digging deep into the rat hole.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Yeah, baby.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   That's of course Andy Ennaco, the Chicago Sun-Times.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And we are here to talk once again about the latest in the
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Mac world.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   First Leo, I'm sorry.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I need to apologize.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I thought we were meant to start to be going downhill eight
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   episodes ago.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I started way too soon.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I'm so sorry.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I missed a memo.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   You peaked early and you're collapsing already.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   No, that's okay.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I've got the PSP here, so I'm sure I can distract myself and
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   cross enough random neuromiss firings to keep completely off
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   topic and be saying things that no one will find interesting
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   or illuminating in any fashion.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I think I can do that.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   You guys can't actually hear this.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Can you?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   If I just...
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Merlin's a little hungry.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I think we're doing your cat.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I'm just a bonger.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I'm just a bonger.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Mine are so deliciously crunchy, don't you find?
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   That's a ways classic.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   It's a what?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Let me interpret for you.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Lays classic.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Classic what?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   What would it cost for us to actually get Jerry Lewis on the
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   show?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   What kind of money do you think we're talking about?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I don't know.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I think a small donation to Jerry's kids.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   It'd probably be sufficient to do it, don't you?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   If we let him talk about himself, he'll fly himself over.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   He'll probably bring to Canada as well.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   It'd be so great to have Jerry Lewis.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   The problem is they fear a genius in this industry.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   What people don't understand about me and Dean was the law.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   There was a law between us, deeper than brothers.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   That only people who had fought is an artist and a creator.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   You're going to be attacked from all angles by people who do not,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I think we're totally not going to get him on the show now.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   No, we will.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   We will.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I think it'd be so great if just to have him on, just to say, you know,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   he's so into that.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Why would I say it?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   He could phone it in.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   He could Skype it in.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   He could Skype it in.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Jerry, he's a gatchet.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   He's the classic gatchet guy.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   He was like gatchet guy number one.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   No, he invented.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Oh my God, he invented the video.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   He invented the video tap.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   He invented the idea of having like a video feed of what you're filming
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   so that you can show you.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Jerry is a little bit.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   He has the patent on that.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   He has the first person who was shooting video on the same, like,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   right alongside films that he could watch Russians every day.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   And he's about a huge photography and recording nerd.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   You ever heard his crank calls?
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   No.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Oh, he's got some really good crank calls.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Really?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   He also mic'd up his kids' room with my hidden microphones.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Oh.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And he had a secret room in his office.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   There was an interview with him that I once read that I had a double read just to make sure it wasn't parody.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Because as a way of basically illustrating his geekness, his nerdiness,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   and his power and strength and wonderfulness as a father, he talked about spanking his 16-year-old son
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   and then rushing back to his secret office that only he had the keys to,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   to listen, to hear what his son said to his other son about being spanked.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Dad is such a man.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And saying to the interviewer, and what Gary told his little brother,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   was that he deserved it and he was thankful that I loved him so much
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   that I was willing to undergo that sort of pain with him.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   And just--
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   That is so creepy on so many levels.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   It's so Rupert Pupkin, I tell you.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   It's so crusty the clown.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   It's impossibly delicious.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Wow.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Did you read the Sean Levy King of Comedy?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Comedy, one of my favorite, but one of my all-time favorite books.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   If you only read one book this decade, read the--
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   It began as an authorized biography and very quickly became authorized.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   And it's like the all-time great page-turning biography.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   It shows him--
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   It's good side.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   It shows him as a bad side.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   You feel as though they've created this brand-new character called Jerry Lewis,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   and you've just seen a double trilogy about him.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Only it's not like Star Wars that actually is good in the fact.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Scott, do you feel like somehow we just--
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   This all went wrong somewhere?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I was wondering if this--
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I thought what was happening next was those guys who were going to try to sell us
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   the old albums from Dean Martin.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   The King of Comedy by Jackie Chan, no.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   The King was probably a commoner of success.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Sean Levy.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Sean Levy.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   We do usually wait till at least 10, 15 minutes into the show to go into a lap.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   We're usually trying to get at least one Mac item in before we complete it.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   He's going to fix all of this in post.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I'll edit it at the end of the show.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   That's where everybody will wonder, wow, they've been talking for an hour and a half about the Mac.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Now they get around to Jerry Lewis.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   I can see somebody sitting there in iTunes and like an 80 that thing where you click
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   and you go like a 16th of an inch and you click again.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   I'll do an old talking about Jerry Lewis.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Hi.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   This is the old talking about Jerry.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   How about these?
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   How about this?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   This is the new Apple Get a Mac.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   They're three of them and they're very Vista focused like this one.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Hello, I'm a Mac.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   I'm a PC and it's time to play Choose a Vista.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   What's going on?
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Well, Vista comes in six different versions and I don't know which to choose.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I could spend a lot of money and get a version that has a lot of stuff I don't need.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   We're spent too little and gets stuck with one that doesn't do very much at all.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   We maxed just that one version with all the stuff you need already.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Oh, that's boring.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   I don't want to spoil it for you so we'll stop right there.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Turns out poorly for the PC guys.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   I'm guessing.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   I'm guessing.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Here's another one.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   This is the genius.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   A what?
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Oh, CPC only.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   I like how they have a short, young, one-man answer Mac genie.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   What questions you have about your Mac?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   If you want to go wireless, you want to answer your files over to a Mac?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Oh, a genius.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   All right, then.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   What's the square root of 4096?
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   64.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   What's pi to the fifth decimal?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   3.14159.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   On a scale of one to ten, how much do I loathe Mac?
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   11.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   She's good.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   That's the best one right there.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   That's pretty funny.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   There's also one with the parties over.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   It's the Vista party, the launch party's over.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   They say, "Well, I guess we'll do this again in five years."
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I have to say, they're good.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   They know what they're doing.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   You know the one that's lame though is the one where he says, "I'm trying to get my drivers.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   I've got to get out of here."
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   That one doesn't really throw me that much.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   This is a whole new series of these.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   You know what, Apple's so smart because they make these good enough that you actually go to the website
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   and you actually watch them.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   People play them on podcasts and all sorts of stuff.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   It's just really kind of...
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   It's like what we just did.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Oh, they do.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Did you see this new series of Mac versus PC parodies starring Marvel Comics versus DC Comics?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   They've got Spider-Man as the Mac guy, Superman as the PC guy.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Oh, I'm sure you'll...
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   We've got our own movies coming.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Oh yeah, I'm sure they'll be really great.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Shall I play it?
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   If you have it on hand.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I can find anything on YouTube.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   I'm at Marvel.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Oh, I'm at...
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Maybe I can't.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Mac parody.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Google's amazing.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   You're a magic of editing.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Through the magic of editing.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   I will have found that instantly.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   I believe it sounds something like this.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   A little like this.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Hi, I'm a Marvel.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   And I'm a DC.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Hey, by the way, welcome back to the movies, man.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   It's good to be back.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   It's been a while, but we've got plenty of projects lined up.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Oh, really?
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Like Wonder Woman?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   You may see that one eventually.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Oh.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Flash?
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   You never know.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Sometimes, possibly soon in the next few years, KP Rare's open.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Huh.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Huh.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   And we just asked a few writers to think about the possibility of maybe what it might take to theoretically make a Justice League movie in the next ten years or possibly more perhaps.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Not to mention negotiating for three more, am I?
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   I guess I'm not enough of a comic geek to really get this subtle.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   That doesn't reach me.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Subtext of what's going on there.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   It touched me on a profound personal level.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   It moved me.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   You know where Apple is?
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   It was a better person for having watched that.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   You know where Apple's agency was smart was in that little, the music box music behind it.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   It's so easy to fake.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And it instantly makes any parody work because, you know, it's just two guys standing there with a music box behind them and it's a parody.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Will Apple ever stop benefiting the user community?
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   [laughter]
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   It was a good one.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   They're amazing.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Have we decided, are these really there to movie units?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Are these there in their mind primarily to get people like us talking about them?
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   I think they're absolutely aimed at people who already sold on Max.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I don't think they do much to move anybody over to Max.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   One's the last time you saw one of these ads that actually mentioned a specific Apple product that you can actually go into store and buy.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   I think it's more like position people already have, people already see the hook dangling in front of them.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   This will just draw them a little closer and a little closer.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   They know that people are not necessarily plunking on $2,000 for a new notebook every single week.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   But in the weeks or months to come, it'll just put that hook in and say, "Oh, yeah!"
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   I think it's so that people have ammunition with which they can use to pick on their friends that are PC users.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   I don't think it's ammunition.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   I think it's totally about, "Look at us, aren't we cool?"
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   It totally reaffirms the fact that you're in the Mac fraternity.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Well, that's the ammunition.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   That's it.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   You can't say it's a Windows guy.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Look at us, see, aren't we better?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Windows guys look at those ads and they'll be like, "That's stupid."
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Ah.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Yeah, for the same reason, I think they look at it historically anyway.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   I looked at Max and said, "Hey, that's stupid."
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Right.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Same reason why guys like us on high school said, "We don't want to go to the prom.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Proms are stupid."
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Yeah, I did.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   That's a $200 on a stupid fried chicken meal as is.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   I got the meat done just a Dragon's D20 module, man.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   We're going to have some fun.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   If the original Nerd hadn't stayed home, we wouldn't have the wheel or fire.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   So just remember that.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Here's a good perspective.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Right?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   They were at partying and he was at home working on fire.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Everyone else go out and have a good time.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Gore stay home, make wheel.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Make wheel.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Oh yeah, right.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Gore, you nitwit.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   You'll never get laid.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   I've been laughing so long.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   You do have to wonder how long it was for Bill Gates.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   I mean, looking at Bill Gates in particular, you got to wonder, like, compared to his classmates,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   how long was it between the time that he was born and he actually kissed a girl?
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   It's got to have been like some kind of way behind time.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Let me put it this way.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Bill made up for lost time.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Yes, he did.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   He did.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   I think we can stop at that point, but I think there's no question he was famous.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   A famous ladies man.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Later in life.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Starting at age 40.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Which is ironic because it's not like he's going to leave any money behind on the bed.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Well, maybe he will.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   I don't know.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Maybe he will.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   He left an IOU for a future copy of this stuff.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Hey, that's worth some bucks.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Hey, could you not cash that for a couple of years?
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Don't worry.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   I'll be out for until 2001.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   I think he tries to make a joke about that old Sinatra line.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   There's $1.8 million in the nightstand because that's all you're worth, baby.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Okay.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Cool.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   I'll take it.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   So let's get some that in stock.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Let's get some Mac news.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   What do you say?
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Starting off with the rumor that tomorrow they'll be a touch iPod.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Touch iPod.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   I'm ready.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   No question.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   No question.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   It's going to be in the world.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Will it be a Beatles iPod?
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Oh, you think it was going to be four different ones?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   And they're each going to have a different haircut.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   And the hair's going to be a good one.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   I want the Ringo.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   He's the cutest.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   And it's going to be a zalified Ringo star.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   They're going to kill him and then bring him back to life just for the commercials because
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   they know it'll get media play.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   This has been a big week for squelched rumors.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   There's been a couple of big ones that have come and gone pretty quickly this week.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   That's been a very hot one with what appeared to be very little.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Initial reason to believe.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.480]   Well, there is the story and this is, I think, true because it comes from EE Times, which
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:19.360]   isn't known for its Apple rumor mongering, that Apple ordered a half billion flash chips
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.640]   from Samsung this month.
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.320]   Now before you get all excited, these are four gigabit chips.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:30.080]   So you divide by eight to their 512 megabyte chips.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:35.400]   But that's still, I mean, if you have had eight of them, then they make a four gig something.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.320]   That's the basis of the basic iPhone, maybe.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:42.440]   Yeah, but 62 and a half million four gigabyte units.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.320]   And the bigger story is how many iPhones are going to sell?
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.000]   Well, they're going to sell millions, but it's not 62 and a half million.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   That's how many they've over time.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Over time.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   I think that's for this year they've committed to those.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.760]   Oh, well, obviously, what to me means, yeah, I mean, I think it sounds like they might
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.400]   be doing a flash based iPod.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:01.080]   Actually, there's a worldwide flash shortage I've been reading about.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.800]   I mean, if you're into the futures market, that might be a place to look.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.800]   I'd love to see an iPhone iPod.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.400]   It's coming.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.200]   Everybody wants one.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.360]   What do you mean tomorrow?
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.360]   Like an iPhone that can play music and stuff?
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.840]   Yeah, without the phone.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.880]   Oh, because I already have a phone.
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.880]   But you want the you want the Alex version.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.920]   It's time to update the iPod, frankly.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.240]   And I think that that's the way to go.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.640]   I mean, are they even consider releasing an iPod, a sixth generation iPod that didn't
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.560]   have those touchscreen features?
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.280]   Why would they not wait until the phone is out?
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.080]   I mean, why would you buy the phone?
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.080]   So they're right.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.320]   Well, we're less than four weeks away from the phone.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.480]   Now, now you saw this.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.640]   I'm sure that singular employees were told not to take any time off between June 15th
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.880]   and July 15th because it's going to be very, very busy.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.880]   You are correct, sir.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.920]   And interesting that they said June 15th.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.960]   That's because that's the day you'll be able to get your phone.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.080]   So it sounds like that's the date now, although they've been saying end of June.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.080]   It has an Apple been saying end of June.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.600]   Well, I think there's a difference between when you'll be able to pull money down and
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.600]   leave with it.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.800]   So get it June 30th, but you can order June 15th.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:11.440]   And also, I think you're going to find out that the initial shipment is teeny-weeny.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.440]   Are you saying that as speculation?
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.440]   That is so smart.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.440]   That is so smart, of course.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.440]   They do that.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.440]   Look at the wheeze.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.000]   I mean, you know, it's sort of, you know, that whole kind of like invite-only culture
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.160]   that's going around on the web right now, that would be, you know, to give another shot
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.960]   to the whole iPhone thing.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.680]   People have been kind of debating should they have, you know, waited this long between
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.680]   announcements and getting it out.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.600]   That would be a huge shot to just put out.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.840]   Well, that's the, you can't think of that was planned.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.360]   I mean, if there are people lined up with money, you take the money.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.800]   That's rule number one of business.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.960]   If they could have the wheeze.
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.960]   So what happened with the wheeze?
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.520]   Well, they couldn't get them out fast enough.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.680]   They just didn't make them.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.680]   But I do say that there's a-
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.680]   Well, but I do say that there's a-
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.120]   You could always, you could always make a lemonade out of the lemon saying, well, yeah,
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.840]   but okay, maybe we can't sell as many as we'd like to today, but boy, we're sure going
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.000]   to boost demand tomorrow.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Right.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Didn't work for the PlayStation 3.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.760]   You still have to have a good product.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:02.280]   Well, looking at Harley-Davidson, they've operated for years on the principle of making
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.840]   sure that supply is short.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:05.840]   Right.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:10.040]   And you cannot go into any Harley-Davidson dealership in the United States and pay retail
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.040]   for a bike.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.360]   You're going to pay above retail because they get so few.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.920]   Now, they must be under a lot of pressure though from singular.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.560]   You can't think singular ATT wants to have a shortage.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.160]   They would like to have every single one they could sell, right?
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.160]   That's a good point.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.080]   They're, what each of them hopes to optimally get out of this is really at the end of the
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.080]   day pretty different.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.720]   Well, every month that you don't have an iPhone as a month, I don't have you paying
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.720]   singular rates.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:37.600]   Well, I mean, and the story that a lot of people are watching right now is how many people,
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.120]   you know, let's just say even between January and now have had to at least consider whether
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.360]   they want to re-app, you know, re-app a to- Yeah.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.360]   ... contract with some.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.640]   Well, in fact, that's the latest story is that it's killing the sell industry right now.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.640]   People are not re-apping.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:54.680]   Has anybody heard whether this is just FUD or if this is true?
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.680]   No.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.600]   This is a story on Ultimate Apple Web Log right now.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.840]   The top story right now is iPhone anticipation continues to shake up sell market.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.040]   I haven't read the story through, but that's- We don't need to read the story.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.040]   Just read the headlines.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.040]   That's, and then we'll comment.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.040]   It's fast.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.480]   Who needs the Twitter version of the news?
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.440]   It's good, like it was 140 characters in which to assimilate national, world, political,
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.280]   financial, and social, and economical.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.080]   We actually turned Twitter, the Twitter model on its head.
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:24.280]   The news is 140 characters, and then we go on for 140 hours on those 140 characters.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.520]   It's kind of a, kind of a new thing we're trying out.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.120]   Rat holes included, of course.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.120]   That would not surprise me at all.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.040]   I've got to tell you, because- What would not surprise you?
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.560]   I'm sorry, I've lost track.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.200]   What are we talking about?
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.720]   That would be having a dent, because there's so much, I mean, like, so where did we all
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.720]   start?
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.360]   We start with the idea that one reason the iPhone, if it succeeds, is likely to succeed
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.880]   because people hate their phones.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.880]   Right.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.520]   And to some extent, kind of dislike the phone company that's associated with it.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.400]   And so, I mean, it's not like people are going, "Oh, well, I want to make sure I keep
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.400]   my money with Sprint."
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.840]   There's not any emotional skin in the game.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.000]   So yeah, you've got to imagine if you're on the bubble, you know, and there's, you know,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.680]   of course, these phone companies will go out there.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.760]   And there's a great story I won't be able to find really quickly, but one guy talking
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:14.960]   about being contacted by Sprint or whomever going, "Hey, I just want to make sure everything
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.120]   was cool with your account.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.120]   I want to see if you wanted to blah, blah, blah, do these things."
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.200]   And it starts out seeming like a really good customer service move, but it's really all
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.760]   about the fact that any change, any, any, any change-
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.120]   It gets you two more years.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.120]   You bet.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.120]   I mean, I'm not sure anyway.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.840]   I've said this like I'm getting Alex about this, but I have three times now.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.680]   I've wanted to just go in and just add a few minutes to my-
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.080]   Oh, that's not real.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.080]   If you want to add anything-
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.680]   You can get out of that if you know there's no one.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.680]   No, that's not because of the iPhone.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.880]   That's because cellular companies are, by and large.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.880]   They have the bastard gene in them.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:52.240]   When I bought my- I bought my unlocked international GSM smartphone last year, and it turned out
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.680]   that my old- because I was a singular subscriber, but because I was like a grandfather that
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.440]   came from AT&T, I had the 32K SIM.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.120]   I needed the special new 64K SIM to make it work.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.880]   And they wanted to put me into a one-year contract just to give me a new SIM card.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.520]   No new phone, no new nothing, just new piece of plastic to the cost, eight cents.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.320]   Sorry, we're going to lock you into another year-long contract.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.360]   And I've got- I really get- I almost canceled out of spite, but then I realized that, well,
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.380]   it's not like I was planning on leaving singular within the next year and a half anyway.
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.160]   It's not like my ranks are going to change.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.080]   If I were 17, I would have started a few fires, but unfortunately-
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.960]   That's just- that's so galling to me.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.880]   Well, you know, there's this interesting concept around cell phones is like, we will hold you
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:37.120]   prisoner, whereas every other business has to actually try to deliver the goods.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.440]   And the reason I think people are excited about the iPhone, if you really- I mean,
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:46.600]   a Merlin constantly asked this question, and I decided it deserved some careful consideration.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:52.240]   And I think the answer is people want the iPhone because it's a phone that they'll actually
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.680]   want to use as opposed to one that they'll have to use.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.080]   It's the best way I can put it.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.120]   Yeah, the conversation- Go ahead.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.120]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:04.280]   And I think that that's what's going to drive the industry towards realizing that performance
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.840]   can actually do as good or better a job of keeping your customers as can taking the
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:12.160]   Andes of the world and putting a gun to their head every time they want something.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.680]   You know, it's this whole wild idea of, hey, let's just actually create something people
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.760]   want and like, and maybe they'll buy it.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.560]   Yeah, I was having this conversation with somebody just a week ago about that.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:27.200]   And I was trying to tell them that there is a possibility that the iPhone can do for cellular
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.200]   phones what the Mac did for personal computers.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.240]   Just communicating that, well, look, it doesn't have to be this hard to use.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.240]   It doesn't have to be this much of a pain in the butt.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.520]   Here's how a phone that's properly designed and properly engineered can work.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.240]   So I really think that most of the features aren't just the design and just aren't just
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.520]   the touch screens, just the fact that things work the way you anticipate and expect and
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.520]   hope them to.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.520]   I'm just- I mean, we don't know.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.520]   This thing isn't out yet.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.920]   Everybody's so over excited about this.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.920]   Come on.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.120]   I won't be one of them.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.120]   And I also think that-
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.120]   I'll get one.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.120]   I'll tell you.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.120]   I won't give you one.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.120]   If I didn't have to get one, I probably wouldn't get one.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.320]   I certainly would want to wait to the second generation.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.320]   True.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.400]   And also, I just, I mean, we'll see.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.800]   I mean, if this becomes, I think the, like with all of these, this is going to become
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.440]   my weekly chant.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.240]   But with any Apple product, you got to hold it in your hand and see what it's like.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.400]   And when people hold this phone in their hand, they may get really excited about it.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.840]   I don't discount that at all.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.840]   On the other hand, I think just because we're excited about it, I'm not going to
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.440]   extrapolate that into everybody in the world is ready to throw out their free Nokia to
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.440]   go out and spend $600.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.760]   I know they don't need, I know, I know they don't need that many people to do it.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.760]   It's a big industry.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.760]   Vada, vada, vada.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.760]   But I just, I don't know.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.880]   I think for most people, the Blackberry is, I mean, the people that I know that are out
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.880]   there and are like the power users of this stuff, the Blackberry and the Palm are what
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.800]   they need and they already have.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.480]   I mean, getting back to the original topic, every time I look at some, there's, there've
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.440]   been a full flood of these stories about how iPhone anticipation is killing sales of
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.600]   these other retail outlets, Verizon is down, T-Mobile is down.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.440]   But when you look at the paper, when you look at the paperwork that they did, you really
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:06.360]   can't see that they've isolated iPhone anticipation as the reason why they're citing the stock
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.360]   chart.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.320]   There's so many variables involved that they're just basically, it's, it's, it's, it's,
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.080]   well, but it's, they were overall an industry wide slump.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.720]   You could, you could blame that on the iPhone.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.240]   I mean, there's, I mean, it's not, it's not anything long.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.120]   Yeah, but I mean, it's not a definite correlation.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.880]   Apple, Apple got cut, got videotaped being drunk.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.600]   That's, that all causes love in iPhones.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.080]   It seems, it seems.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.760]   You could also, the, the, also there's a big difference between, I mean, I'm not even saying
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:34.720]   I agree with this, but if people are waiting because of the iPhone, which may or may not
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.400]   be true, but if they are, that's still no guarantee that that's the decision they're
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.800]   going to make, that that's the one that they're going to buy.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:40.800]   You know, and,
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.200]   It may just be wait and see, right?
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.200]   Well, it could also be the time, could be the time of year, you know,
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.040]   It's clear that Apple has to deliver on the promise.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.400]   And, you know, if we get an iPhone that sucks, you're going to hear me talk about it a lot
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.200]   because I'm going to be pissed.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.000]   And you know, I think they obviously have to do a good job.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.960]   The assumption, I think going on here, Merlin, is that people generally who listen to this
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.800]   show probably think that Apple does a pretty good job with the Mac computer and they're
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.680]   giving them the benefit of the doubt that they're going to do the same with the cell
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.680]   phone.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.480]   Now, if they don't deliver, they're getting their butt kicked.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.680]   And the other guy, why would a guy on Caltrain with a blackberry give them that same benefit
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.680]   of the doubt?
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.000]   Well, only if he's a Mac user and he's got heavily tied into his Mac apps and he sees
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   maybe some additional...
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.360]   6% of the market may be giving them that benefit of the doubt.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:29.240]   And then what percentage above that 6% are holding out on renewing their contract as
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.240]   a result of that?
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.520]   Well, obviously you're right.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:35.280]   The thing we don't know about is how these all gel out and what's going to happen.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.200]   I actually think the biggest threat to the iPhone still remains singular.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.960]   I don't think it's Apple's mistake.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:45.240]   I think, you know, I did a little test thing for an article I'm writing where I signed
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.840]   up for a singular account and then canceled it.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.200]   And let me tell you, nightmares.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.560]   I still have nightmares over what that entire customer service experience was like.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:00.200]   And I'm pretty sure that all the singular people that I've dealt with so far have been
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.440]   to the school where they teach them the new motto, which is, you know, we're not happy
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.440]   to deal.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.440]   You're not happy.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.440]   I've had bad experiences as a singular customer.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.640]   It was a singular customer for a long time and not the best customer service.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.880]   Well, you know, if not AT&T though, isn't it?
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.280]   I mean, are we really going to be dealing with similar?
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.680]   It was AT&T that I was singular now.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.680]   It's AT&T again.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:23.000]   But I mean, if I were a dentist, I would be the one out of every five dentists who recommend
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.360]   doesn't recommend sugarless gum because I'm the one I seem to be the one person who's
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.320]   had very decent, very decent.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.120]   You like sugarless.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:34.720]   No, it gives me major, major ear aches.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   Okay.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.720]   As part of me.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:42.720]   But at this point, I'll just, I'll just, I mean, just to be one loan defender of
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.360]   singular, when I was having that problem with the sim chip, it was customer service who
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.760]   eventually told me, found out exactly what the problem was.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:55.560]   I've wound up within 10 minutes talking to a, some, a former AT&T engineer, someone who's
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.520]   been along with the company and customer service for nine years, who, you know, was able to
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.880]   track the serial number and say, oh, yeah, you've got a 32K card.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.160]   We need extra space for this, this and this.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.960]   When, you know, when we had, when my identify myself as a nerd by identifying three beds,
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.360]   Star Trek, the next generation episodes.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.360]   Oh, really?
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.360]   He started talking really tech to me.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.560]   I was like, smart cars using the old version of the software.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.480]   We need extra stack for blah, blah, blah.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.560]   And then I got back to like the contract part of it and then I got screwed, but still.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.920]   It wasn't a horrific experience.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.720]   What you're describing is making a fantastic point though, which is something that I feel
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.240]   like, you know, I rag on sprint because they're a bi- and large piece of crap company in my
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.240]   experience.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.640]   But having said that, I cannot tell you the extraordinary amount of help I've gotten from
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.640]   a few people at sprint.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.120]   You can't even write people anywhere.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.120]   You're going to be busy.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.560]   This is the part that, you know, where I always, when people just kind of write off
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.880]   an entire company, I always kind of like cringe a little bit because I know, I know really
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.600]   great people at all of these companies that you do tend to get a preponderance of evidence
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.600]   about certain companies.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.600]   I will say that.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.880]   But as far as the sprint thing, like I was in there, whatever, they're stupid ambassador
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.680]   thing where they give you free phones.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:57.920]   And I was supposed to be able to use one of these phones as a Mac modem.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.840]   And I don't know about you guys, what your experience is, but in my experience, like
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.200]   this stuff works out of the box on Windows and hardly ever works on Mac.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.440]   It's just not supportive.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.080]   But almost all of these companies, they can put you through to this one little special
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.040]   broom closet where like the smartest guy in the entire company works, who's got, or
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.040]   Gorgal in one case.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.840]   I had a woman walk me through for an hour and a half at 9.30 at night just because she
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.960]   was clearly interested in seeing this problem solved.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.400]   She sat there with a big three ring binder and went and got whatever documentation she
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.400]   needed.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.320]   And she walked me through this entire thing like, but again, she was not, she's not in
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.480]   like the queue.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.240]   She's not in like the first level support.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.840]   You know, there's all these people, if you get the right person, they will help you with
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.840]   that.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.640]   But I don't think that's how they're trying to.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.640]   Doesn't scale.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.840]   Well, I'm hoping they do a good job.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.640]   I was just saying that's my big fear.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.400]   I think the cell phone is going to be fine.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.440]   I'll save my rant response to that for next time, but I do have a rant response to that,
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.240]   which is just in very short is that if it really did matter to phone companies to go
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.240]   out there.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.000]   And as you say, try and make this stuff that makes people want to use their phone more.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.320]   There's nothing that has stopped them from doing that for the last time.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.720]   I, Merlin, I agree.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:07.080]   All I'm saying is I think this might be the first time when someone actually tries it.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.080]   That's all.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.720]   And then I think drives competition as a result.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.800]   I think they could have and should have been doing it a long time ago.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.840]   Absolutely agree with you.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.360]   I just think we finally could be on the precipice of the potential.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.640]   And you know, there's a lot of if we are the precipice of the potential.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.480]   I mean, that's about as qualified a response as I can get because, you know, I'm going
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.880]   to come and commercial.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.440]   I just, I really, I really hope it works.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:35.920]   And if it doesn't, I will dedicate the Apple phone show every week to beating the crap
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:36.920]   out of these people.
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.320]   New, I'm going to move on because I'm sick of the iPhone.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.160]   I'm just really can't hear anymore about it.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.600]   Unless you have anything, anybody has anything really important to say.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.600]   I'm done.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:50.240]   The only, the only, the only, the only last thing I'd say to button it up is to realize
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:56.600]   that even Apple, even Steve Jobs, Mr. cheerleader, Mr, you know, reality distortion field, and
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:00.280]   in the big keynote, he said that all he wants is to get the tiniest microscopic,
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.960]   little sliver of the cell phone market and he'll consider the iPhone a success.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.960]   Of course.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.480]   That's, that's called the thing that the iPhone is going to kill, you know, kill, you know,
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.480]   the entire world.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.560]   He's saying, that's underselling.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.040]   Of course, he doesn't think that in his heart of hearts.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.600]   He's just saying that so that nobody will say it was a stop.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.600]   It's the master of understatement.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.600]   I mean, it's hard of hearts.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.600]   He think, no, it's very clear.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:24.000]   Steve thinks it's all other phones are crap and he and everybody will buy an iPhone before
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.720]   the end of the year, but that he's not going to say that out loud.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.160]   You know, he thinks that.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.880]   It is unwise to tip the vessel of wisdom, young Padawan.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.720]   I don't, I don't think it depends.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.120]   Are we on the precipice of the beginning or not?
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.560]   If you're trying to get them, please tip your vessel off.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.720]   They've been good to you.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.120]   They're hardworking vessels.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:50.400]   According to Mac world, UK, Apple is going to launch new Macs with LED backlit screens
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.400]   this summer.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.960]   They're quoting a digitimes who says that these screens will ship in the second or
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.640]   third quarter this year.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:03.880]   And they're sampling it already to Apple 13.3 inch screen, interesting and a 15.4 inch
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:04.880]   screen.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.440]   Hello, big iPod.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:13.320]   Really big iPod or maybe a kind of smaller Mac, especially these.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:17.000]   We're going to, I think we'll see LED backlights everywhere soon, but that would be a nice
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.240]   thing to have.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.080]   And would it mean a new laptop or just a new screen?
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.920]   Sounds like these sizes, but a 15.4, that would be a 15, right?
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.320]   I don't understand why what the story is here.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.920]   I'm not understanding the greatness of what LED what is what is it?
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.040]   Oh, there's all sorts of reasons why it's better than the.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.040]   Do you have fluorescence?
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.840]   You have fluorescence right now in the back.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.520]   LEDs use less power.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:42.720]   Their color control is better.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.600]   I think everybody's moving to LED.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.600]   They're just more reliable.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.080]   I think it's more even too.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.080]   Yeah, much more even.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.080]   You know how on your.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.080]   Yeah, you get hotspots.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.080]   I mean, the truth is we put up with really pretty crappy screens.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:59.160]   If we think about it, we and sometime soon we'll be able to actually admit that.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:03.960]   I guess the story would be more interesting to me if that number was 12.0 instead of 13.0.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.960]   I know.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.960]   You just want a little computer.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:06.960]   I want a tiny computer.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.280]   But that's still smaller than the 14s, right?
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.000]   I mean, it's still a little bit smaller.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   How big is the MacBook?
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   That's 14, right?
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.720]   That's 15 and change.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.440]   It's a little bigger than the old 15 inch.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.440]   The MacBook?
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.440]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.240]   The MacBook Pro that I've got is.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.040]   No, the MacBook itself though is 14, I think.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.920]   So this is a little smaller than the MacBook.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.720]   I actually know what this is going to be for.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:30.720]   Okay.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.360]   No one has ever even discussed on this show.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.760]   It's called the iPhone.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.960]   No.
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.600]   It's the tablet PC version of Apple TV.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.320]   There is a of Apple TV.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.680]   Oh boy.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.120]   That's combining three different rumors.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.920]   There is a rumor that there'll be a tablet Mac.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.200]   I'd love to see a tablet Mac.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.640]   I'd love to see a Mac ebook reader.
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.840]   I'd love to see a lot of Apple stuff.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.880]   But I think it's these likely you'll see LED Macs.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.800]   And they're saying that it might be just in time for at WWDC.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.600]   Will there be announcements at WWDC?
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.600]   Yes.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.760]   Here's your beta copy again.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:12.880]   And I got the email today says come to WWDC and get your beta copy of Leopard.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.840]   I don't know.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.840]   But I mean, I think you would always expect that, wouldn't you?
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.560]   Let me go into my, let me dig it out of my trash.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.520]   Don't you get a beta copy at every WWDC?
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.880]   So pretty much.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.440]   Well, I think that just didn't everybody get their beta copy last year.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.960]   And they say before anybody else.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.120]   Well, it's the alpha copy.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.240]   Remember that last year he couldn't show us all the new features because Microsoft was
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.240]   going to just steal those ideas.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.240]   There it is.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.240]   I took it.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.240]   I got it out of my trash.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.080]   See the future then take it home with you.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.640]   The Leopard beta available first to WWDC.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.680]   And then of course the day, a day later everybody else will have it.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.160]   At the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, we're planning to show you a feature complete.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.160]   Ah, that's important.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.280]   Feature complete, that's new.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.840]   Feature complete version of OS X Leopard.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.840]   Now that's important.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:58.240]   Yeah, I think this is what we're seeing is what we thought.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.560]   I mean, had they said, you know, like put it in stone that they were going to be putting
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.280]   this out at the WWDC in June?
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:08.440]   I had heard feature complete, but I don't know if it was a rumor or, I mean, this invitation
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:13.120]   came to me today at 9.41 a.m. so I presume, and that's the, and that's the body of it,
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.320]   is feature complete, take it home with you.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:19.000]   So I think maybe this is the confirmation we've been waiting for that, you know, will
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.440]   at least know what those secret features at Steve was talking about were or what.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.960]   Yes, but you won't be able to tell anybody about it.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.400]   No, well, you think so?
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.960]   I don't, I'm just kidding.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.840]   That means I think that'll come out pretty quick.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:37.080]   Every time I, you know, they give out a beta WWDC, it kind of hits the streets a few days
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.080]   later.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:41.560]   Yeah, but you sign that document and says you won't talk about anything except what's
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.520]   to, except what's to, you'll never get it out of me.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.920]   I'll never say.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.600]   All we have to do to bribe Merlin is just bring him a bag of Lay's potato chips and
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.360]   then he'll give it all up.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.960]   Can he just won?
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:58.160]   We'll just sit there and go Merlin for each and every tidbit about the new operating system.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.960]   We'll give you a new chip.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.280]   That's part of Apple's plan.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.120]   They check, they check his webcam.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.480]   The more he seems to be retaining water, they net the more apple knows he's been spilling
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.480]   secrets.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.480]   His ankles are huge.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.440]   Action stations, actions, friends.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.080]   Scramble, scramble.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.760]   It's when he has to put on those special socks that we know he's in real trouble.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.520]   Yes, my, my, my orthopedic pants.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.040]   You know, I'm struggling a little bit on today's show because I just, there isn't that much.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.840]   Hey, let's talk about the increase in Mac users online, Leo.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:32.840]   There is an increase in Mac.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:37.400]   Oh, yeah, because you can see in your log, how many people would come in there via a
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.040]   Mac browser?
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:47.240]   So they're reporting this on Mac life that now, where I was 3% of the browsers were Mac
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.600]   related last summer.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:57.080]   Now it's doubled to 6% on their site or no, this is based on a survey that was done that
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.160]   they're reporting on.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.000]   So it's quite the doubled, doubled, doubled.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.320]   See, if only Microsoft were as good as making really penetrating commercial.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.400]   So that's the way that they have like, hi, I'm a Windows machine.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.400]   Hi, I'm a Mac.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.920]   Well, Mac, congratulations.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.240]   More of you have discovered the internet in the past two years.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.960]   Of course, my grandmother's been using it since 1994.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.520]   Turns out you don't need a phone line anymore, Windows.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.520]   Yes.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.520]   It's called Wi-Fi.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.520]   I'm making air quotes.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:29.960]   Well, I'm going to, maybe I'll check my Google analytics and see if I have more Mac
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:30.960]   users.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:31.960]   I bet I don't.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.560]   Google analytics was updated today.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:34.560]   I know.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.240]   I've been there and all of a sudden I'm getting new version.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.880]   Jeff Veen can finally reveal what he has been working on.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.240]   Well, how do I, that's cool.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.120]   I want to, but how do I get in it?
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.120]   You know, I'm not kidding.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.120]   I'm not getting an updated version.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.160]   They might be doing their rollout thing.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.160]   Oh, okay.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:56.920]   After it has been made active, you will still have access to the old version for a month.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.920]   Confused.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.080]   I'm confused.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:03.120]   Hey, do you guys remember when we went to Mac world last year and all the green piece
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:08.640]   people stood at the door there and tried to hand us the thing talking about apples.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.640]   Yes.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:10.640]   Apple is now green.
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.480]   They are now green and that would be interesting.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:16.080]   Google analytics goes beyond additional mental mental.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.320]   I want to mention about the LED thing.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.320]   I think that was part of me.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.080]   This is the Google analytics guy.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.480]   It's just like Merlin Mann.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.960]   Retaining visitors and customers.
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.880]   We've taken a cross disciplinary approach to Google analytics.
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.880]   It is Merlin Mann.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:28.880]   This is Merlin Mann.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:29.880]   Merlin, did you do that?
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:30.880]   It doesn't sound anything.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.880]   What are you talking about?
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:35.760]   Just say a cross disciplinary approach to Google analytics.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.760]   Go ahead.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.760]   Come on.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.760]   Where were we?
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.760]   I got signed.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.760]   I got Apple.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:41.760]   I got Apple Green.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.760]   I got something about Apple Green.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.760]   Please play the music if you would.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:44.760]   What music would that be?
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.760]   Oh, Radhol?
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:50.240]   Google analytics goes beyond traditional web analytics reporting to help you manage the
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:59.880]   entire process of acquiring and returning and retaining visitors.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.880]   Radhol?
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.920]   We've taken a cross disciplinary approach to Google analytics.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:09.320]   Radh breaks out the specific reporting needs of each job function of brand executives,
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:13.600]   marketers, content developers, and what you got to talk about.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.800]   Leo, are you doing a mashup?
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:16.800]   It's a mashup.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.800]   It's a radhol mashup.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.840]   It's kind of a double radhol.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:21.840]   A meta-rathol.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.840]   A meta-rathol.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.840]   A meta-rathol.
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.400]   I'm going to break light switch wave here.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.400]   Okay.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.400]   Go ahead, Scott.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.160]   I'm really trying here, guys.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.760]   I know you're trying to add content to the show.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.880]   I'm trying to make the Mac show about Macs a little bit.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:37.600]   That's what infuriates us all.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.760]   This is our big chance to empty out that supply closet of interesting stories, funny
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:46.240]   anecdotes, and ways to switch our minds off and simply get through a podcast.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.800]   We've had in the past eight shows this total lack of Mac news.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.960]   It's like a snow day.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.120]   You don't understand that.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.000]   You don't do homework on a snow day.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.080]   You grab the sled and head for the golf course.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.080]   Yes.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.840]   You know what?
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.000]   Never mind Apple being green.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   I don't care.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.760]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.760]   I didn't mean to...
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.760]   They're green.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.760]   It's on the front page.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.760]   It says they're green.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:10.920]   It's another one of Steve's special little notes to the kids.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.920]   Like he did with the...
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.640]   He's doing that a lot now.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:14.640]   He's doing it.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.640]   It's very presidential of him.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:16.640]   You should get a blog.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:17.640]   Well, you know, here's the thing I think...
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:18.840]   You should get a blog.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.720]   I haven't seen people mention is it really...
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.080]   It doesn't matter what they say.
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:25.280]   It matters who they are able to appease.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.440]   And Greenpeace has doubled their green rating as a result of this announcement.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.440]   So I thought that would be...
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.760]   Double from nothing to OK.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:37.000]   It was 2.7 out of 10 to now 5.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   I mean, it's not exactly...
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.480]   It's not exactly a ringing endorsement.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.480]   Maybe it will keep those people from trying to stuff those cards in our pockets next year.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.480]   I like how they...
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:50.920]   You had to see them in a zodiac boat headed up to the Cupertino campus.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.520]   That's a long footage.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.520]   Even for hippies.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:57.640]   I love how on the Apple page, you know, they have the very slick Apple graphics.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:01.520]   But then the greener Apple looks like it's been printed on a recycled web page.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.520]   Yes.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.520]   I don't know.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.680]   See, did you notice the big change there?
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.680]   Greenpeace managed to do something miraculous.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:10.600]   They managed to get Steve Jobs to change his mind on one thing.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.720]   For the first time in what, six, seven years?
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.440]   We see an Apple logo that's colored.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.440]   Oh, it's green?
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.440]   It's a green logo.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.440]   It's a green...
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.440]   It's a green Apple.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:21.320]   We see more colors left to go and we're back where that logo is supposed to be.
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.120]   They couldn't do that until they made the deal with the Beatles.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.840]   Because that looks just like the Apple core app.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:28.640]   Tomorrow, yellow, orange, red, purple, and aqua in that order.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:37.920]   Says they're eliminating the use of lead, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, decabromide
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.920]   diphenyl ether.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.920]   Decabromide.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:40.920]   Oh!
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:46.920]   Arsenic, Mershg, Mercury, polyvinyl chloride, bromated flame retardants.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:51.920]   Now, are you describing a whopper or are you describing a new Macintosh?
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:52.920]   That's a new chicken McNugget.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.920]   That's what I was thinking.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:58.720]   Because that looks an awful, like the menu I saw over at the fast food place.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.720]   Typical.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:03.000]   So they're talking about CRTs and the fact that Apple was the first company in the computer
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.400]   industry to eliminate CRTs.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:06.400]   That's good.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.320]   Giving you the plant-
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.320]   Deathly-dramatic old mug.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.120]   Yeah, big hugs.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.200]   Arsenic, Apple plans to completely...
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.640]   This is good news.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:18.120]   Completely eliminate the use of arsenic in all of its displays by the end of 2008.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.120]   You know, I kind of...
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.120]   I'm going to miss that.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.120]   It's a little removed.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.120]   I'm going to miss that arsenic, you know?
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.520]   My dad's in the arsenic business.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.520]   Oh.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:26.520]   I don't know if they care about the jobs.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.680]   This is going to cost my family.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.000]   Don't worry, there's plenty of rats to poison still.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.160]   Apple plans to reduce and eventually eliminate the use of mercury by transitioning to LED
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:40.360]   backlighting for all displays when technically and economically feasible, like in June.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.360]   So there you go.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.760]   There's another reason Merlin for LED.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.240]   No mercury.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.200]   All right.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:50.920]   Apple plans to completely eliminate the use of polyvinyl chloride and bromated flame retardants
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:51.920]   by the end of 2008.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:55.400]   Now, if they're getting rid of all the arsenic, I just want to know, are they going to stop
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.400]   there?
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.400]   Are we going to get rid of the lace too?
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.200]   Oh, old lace, yes.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.200]   All the old lace.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.200]   Arsenic substitute.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.200]   A note of...
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.680]   Now, come on, Merlin, I didn't get anything out of you on that.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.680]   I thought that would be 1944.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.680]   I didn't get anything.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.680]   I made anything.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:11.680]   I made that joke 45 seconds ago.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:12.680]   Okay.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:13.680]   He made it in his head.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.680]   It doesn't kill.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.400]   You told me to get new material.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.880]   I get new material and I didn't get any of that.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:18.880]   You know, he didn't reject it.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:19.880]   He actually...
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.880]   He and Foster should hire a writer together.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.880]   Oh, God.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:27.200]   Now, that's like the biggest insult out of two Maykery millions.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.280]   Don't make me call John Foster and bring him in here.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.280]   All right.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.280]   Get him on.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.280]   I'm...
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.280]   Okay.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:39.280]   Any other stories at all, anything, please, I beg of you.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.280]   Um...
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.280]   Coda.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:45.080]   I scrapped and then I scraped enough hair out of my keyboard to make another cat.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.240]   I don't know if that's relevant for us in the community.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.960]   I saw that you were cleaning Lilith out.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.240]   I saw some keys removed.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.240]   It looked like.
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.240]   I had...
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.240]   I...
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.240]   The R key weren't working no more.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.880]   And so I got my dental tools and I popped it up and it looked like a crime scene underneath
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.120]   that one letter.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.480]   And so I just kept popping off letters to see how far it spread.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.320]   And before I knew it, I had done a complete cardiac to me.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.320]   And it took me four hours to get every single piece of gunk out of the...
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.520]   It's disgusting and it's satisfying.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:13.600]   Hey, I can take that step further.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.520]   I got a big Mac out of mine this morning.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.520]   Oh my.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.600]   One crumb at a time.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:18.600]   I just buy new keyboards.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:19.600]   It is really actually...
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.600]   Oh, they still fresh given McDonald's, these per server does.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.600]   Keyboard.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.600]   They don't advertise that but it's a keyboard.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.600]   Yeah, you know what?
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.400]   A good $10 challenge.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:35.120]   I bet the winner of the Gertie's keyboard competition, you sprinkle one half of a teaspoon full
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.120]   of grasses on the keyboard.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:40.120]   You can see anything grow within, let's say two weeks.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.160]   You win a gift certificate to the Outback Steakhouse.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.480]   Depends does grass eat Lays potato chips would be the same question.
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:49.960]   Well, I'll tell you who would win that competition out of our gang, heads down would be Alex
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:50.960]   Lindsey.
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.960]   Oh, really?
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.960]   Oh my gosh.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:53.960]   He's got some...
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:59.480]   You just go over to the Pixel Core office and look carefully at some of those keyboards.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.480]   They are dirty.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.480]   That's pretty bad.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:07.120]   If you guys could do a quick Google on keyboard grass and you can see an operable joke.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.760]   Somebody did where they planted grass in someone's keyboard.
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:10.760]   See what that looks like.
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.800]   See, that's why I hate the internet.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.640]   It's impossible to make a joke because there's a webpage for it somewhere.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.640]   Keyboard grass.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.480]   It really leaves the end.
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.480]   And you know what's really bad?
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.440]   It's like, I'm sorry.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:27.240]   That domain's probably taken.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.400]   Keyboardgrass.com is probably taken.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.400]   This is great.
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:31.400]   It's actually a tutorial.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:37.320]   It's a tutorial to actually walk you through how to do this to someone.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.560]   Step in front of the move, ease.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.560]   Yeah, this is awesome.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.840]   Do you have to add soil or...
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.200]   Well there's cotton balls involved.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.200]   I think that's cheating.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.200]   Yeah, you shouldn't have to.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.200]   And then what do you get?
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.960]   Do you actually have grass growing up between the keys?
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:50.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:51.960]   It actually looks pretty.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:52.960]   It actually looks very pretty.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:53.960]   You've ever seen one of those cool ones on the wall?
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:54.960]   It does look good.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:55.960]   It hasn't been weeded.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:56.960]   Yeah, like a terrace or like stepping stones.
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:58.720]   Is this still usable?
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.720]   I don't think so.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:00.720]   I guess no.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:01.720]   I'm guessing the five key.
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.680]   The five key is not looking real good.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:10.360]   You know, when John Foster does the show notes for this show, Merlin, keep in mind he has
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.640]   the chance to get back at you.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.800]   Sorry, that just kind of popped up in my mind.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:15.800]   Oh, that's all right.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.800]   It was a...
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.560]   I tell you, it was a weird show notes last time.
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:20.320]   I think John was a tippling.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.320]   Just the smelly.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.320]   We have to be careful that John doesn't do these around the time he does the beer cast.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.440]   I think that was the problem.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.840]   He just completed beer cast.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.480]   Each week's notes get a little weirder.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.640]   And every once in a while he actually mentions some of the things we talk about.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:42.640]   Sometimes conflicted about whether to include them with, should I make some editorial comment
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.640]   here?
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.200]   Should I just put them in without comment?
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.200]   I don't know what to do.
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.600]   Well, you know, here's where the turn came.
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:51.600]   One week he put in the show notes, "It's like I'm on the show, but I'm not."
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.520]   Because he just started talking about the kinds of stuff that we did.
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:57.400]   He wants to, you know, we should just invite him for crying out loud.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:58.400]   You know, he's a great guy.
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.400]   Yeah, I love John.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.960]   I don't know why actually why I haven't...
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.920]   We'll just get him on next time.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:03.920]   So sorry, John.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:04.920]   I don't know why we didn't...
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.400]   I mean, funny to John, but we miss you.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:09.160]   We love you, dude.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.240]   And maybe he could bring some news next time.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.480]   Is that a hint?
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.400]   Would you like us to come up with some news stories?
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.640]   Someone starts stealing just the green iPods from stores.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.080]   Like do 50 of you.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.240]   50 stores, 50 green iPods stolen.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.240]   Just so we have something to talk about.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:27.280]   Plus we'll have a week to think of material on jokes to make, but why just the green ones.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.280]   This week happened up...
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:31.840]   Not as green, because they want some iPods.
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:34.360]   Another outback steakhouse gift certificate to whoever commits this.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:37.360]   You have to videotape yourself doing it in YouTube so that it winds up...
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.360]   You've got a quick talking about outback steakhouse.
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:43.360]   And I don't think it's really appropriate to encourage theft on the show.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.040]   You're eating the only thing that's more healthy than a blooming onion.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.040]   I congratulate you.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.040]   A blooming onion.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.520]   I like blooming onions.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.720]   Blooming onions should be served by cardiologists.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:52.720]   They should actually...
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.920]   Somebody in MD should actually come to your table and set it up.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.080]   Medically, contraindicated cuisine.
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.080]   My favorite kind of...
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:01.960]   They should give it to you with a do not resuscitate order while you're eating it.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:05.600]   Well, look, if you don't start building up antibodies against cholesterol, you're gonna
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:06.600]   drive a heart attack.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:11.000]   But you like me to replace your dressing IV?
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.240]   I suppose you want to live in a jaundry, volteplastic bubble like vegetarians.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.240]   I love that.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.600]   Behold the mighty cockroach.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.400]   Let us learn from his example.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.400]   Walt Mossberg.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.040]   Everything he's indestructible.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:26.400]   And Walt Mossberg in the Wall Street Journal, "Should I wait to buy a Mac?"
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:30.020]   He says, "Leopard is in an entirely new operating system, but a major new version or
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:33.100]   addition of Apple's Mac OS X operating system.
[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.060]   It will replace the current version called Tiger.
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:36.780]   As you noted, it was supposed to become available this spring.
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:39.620]   It's now been delayed till October."
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:42.780]   He says, "I'm still reading.
[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:44.300]   I'm sorry I even brought it up."
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:46.900]   Is there a point in this hole?
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:47.900]   No point.
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:48.900]   I'm not related to that hole.
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:49.900]   Un-ungrateful.
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:53.980]   Upgrading to a new operating system has generally been a very good experience in recent years.
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:57.820]   If you tend to upgrade to leopard, then the biggest downside for buying a Mac now may
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:03.340]   be financial, not technical, if Apple's practice prevails, $129.
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.860]   Memory could be an issue.
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.140]   I recommend doubling it.
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:09.380]   I suspect he doesn't even answer the question.
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:13.500]   Well, buying a Tiger Mac and then upgrading to leopard gives you an advantage that you
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:14.940]   don't have if you buy a leopard Mac.
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:18.980]   And that is downgrading back to Tiger once things start to go pear-shaped.
[00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:21.060]   Good point.
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:24.180]   I know where those installed DVDs are at all times.
[00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:27.780]   Any time I want to slam back to 10.4, I'm breaking that glass.
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:28.780]   There you go.
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:29.780]   Slam in that disk in.
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:31.020]   Let's send a note to Walt.
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:32.180]   That's exactly right.
[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:33.180]   There's the right answer.
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:35.980]   See, I knew I was a reason I brought that up.
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:36.980]   Don't worry.
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:37.980]   Buy that Mac today.
[00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:42.060]   Did you see the Apple Insider thing where they're talking about the, like is it the patent
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.220]   for a cube interface for Dashboard?
[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:46.740]   Did you see that last week, didn't we?
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:47.740]   We did.
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:48.740]   Who are you guys?
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:49.740]   What are you doing in my room?
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:51.740]   What have you done with that?
[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:53.260]   I'm here with a ghost of technology past.
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.940]   You have one chance and one chance only of my procuring.
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:58.180]   Okay, I got one.
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:02.820]   I don't know if you guys saw this, but there is a guy who made a backpack out of a Mac
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:03.820]   SE.
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:07.820]   See, I think we actually went, you know, how many times do we have to do that?
[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:10.700]   We actually, Andy Hurdsfeld is working with this great app called Switcher and looking
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.700]   at the two programs.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.180]   They don't have to be desk access.
[00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:14.180]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.180]   Back up.
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.180]   Two at the same time.
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:19.900]   Yeah, listen, this is the morgue from Oark version of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:23.980]   We're actually reading the news as we go back and get, you know, younger and younger and
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:24.980]   younger.
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:28.620]   We did a whole, we're holding back through a wormhole.
[00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:29.620]   We did last week.
[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:30.620]   Last week.
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:33.700]   We did do antique hardware.
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:35.380]   What if we did antique software?
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:36.380]   Your favorite.
[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:37.380]   Your favorite.
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:38.380]   There you go.
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.180]   Apps from the system seven days or the nine.
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:41.180]   Now you're going to something.
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:45.100]   No, no, no, no, we should do the 1988 edition of the Mac Break Weekly.
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:46.100]   Oh, that would be fun.
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:47.100]   Oh, that would be fun.
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:49.460]   In which we agree, we will talk about we will pretend it's 1988.
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.140]   We will do talk about nothing but 1988 hardware.
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.500]   Let's take some time and work on that.
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:56.180]   I think that's a great idea.
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.180]   We should actually write that up as a show.
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:59.180]   Well, we'll do it.
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.060]   We'll see what needs some effort to think about it.
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:02.060]   That's probably what will happen.
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:03.060]   Get some gas.
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.060]   Get like Dave Weiner on.
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:05.060]   Like it's a big one.
[00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:06.660]   Yeah, like the work on the body hurts too.
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:07.660]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:08.660]   Long hair.
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:14.820]   We could do that April 1st of next year for our April Fool's Day/32nd anniversary of
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:15.820]   Apple Computer.
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:16.820]   Yeah.
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:17.820]   How about that?
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.060]   I've got it in my cow already.
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.220]   All right, putting your eye cow.
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:21.220]   Remind me.
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:24.420]   Looking at the Talking Moose page on the week you can be dealing.
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:25.420]   Talking Moose.
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:26.420]   What a great app.
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:29.020]   And then there was Tiny Elvis that followed that on.
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:30.620]   I don't remember Tiny Elvis.
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:31.620]   Oh, Tiny Elvis.
[00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:35.700]   I have a follow up from last week show I forgot as my best piece of Apple hardware.
[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:36.700]   Okay.
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:41.700]   I still have my chip puller from my Apple two days.
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:43.300]   You would pull chips on your Apple.
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.100]   Oh, I guess to put new RAM in?
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:48.420]   They, when you got the box, you had to put everything together and they gave you a little
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:49.420]   chip puller.
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:50.420]   Wow.
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.420]   You had a logo on it.
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:52.420]   And I still have--
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:53.420]   Mac warehouse used to do that.
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:57.060]   When you order your RAM, they send you a videotape about how to replace your RAM with
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:58.620]   a little tool kit.
[00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:00.260]   There was no video with the Mac too.
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:01.260]   But this is before video.
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:04.540]   In fact, then they send you a wax cylinder and a scroll.
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:05.540]   And I--
[00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:08.020]   So you're excited to put more RAM into your computer device?
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:09.300]   Well, I still have that thing.
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.100]   It's pretty cool.
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.540]   I still have on my keychain.
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:18.620]   Ever since I was like 15 years old, the hex wrench tool they used to get with a disk tool
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:22.420]   disk drive for installing the disk drive inside the Apple 2E.
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:25.980]   We're taking it on every single keychain.
[00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:27.460]   The case removal thing or the--
[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:33.300]   No, it's like a little hex wrench because to secure the ribbon cable to the cards that
[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:37.540]   it wouldn't rip out the contacts from the card, you have to actually put in this little
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:42.180]   like-- these two little nuts that would just sort of camera it and like wrench it into one
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.420]   of the slots.
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.020]   And everyone got one of these things in the package.
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:47.500]   I used to install all the disk drives in my high school.
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:49.420]   So I wound up with a big collection of 18 or 19.
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:50.980]   One of them survived the cut.
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.140]   And it's right there on my keychain.
[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:54.140]   That's kind of neat.
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:57.260]   Did you ever use 256K RAM chips for Christmas ornaments?
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.380]   I used to miss Christmas gifts as early as late last year.
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:04.340]   I used to get-- I mean, the thing is, there was a point where like every Mac out there
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:05.580]   was just full of these chips.
[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:06.580]   And then I don't know.
[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:11.060]   At some point, I'm going to say around probably '92, '93, when they started having more where
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:12.220]   you could put in one Mac chips.
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:15.100]   I just had-- and I was a Mac-- that was the Mac geek for my company.
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:19.340]   I just had this enormous pile of 256K chips.
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:20.980]   And it looked very high tech, you know?
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:22.220]   But you couldn't really do anything.
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:25.220]   I think we all have leftover RAM that's really pretty much worthless.
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:26.580]   It was hugely costly at the time.
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:27.580]   It doesn't take long.
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:29.140]   It really doesn't take long.
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:30.140]   And yeah, totally.
[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:33.900]   Well, if we're going to do classic Mac software, I want to go first because I want to get this
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.900]   one out of the way, but for someone else who uses it.
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:36.900]   Hypercard!
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:38.980]   Hypercard because you love hypercard.
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:39.980]   I do love hypercard.
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:42.340]   In fact, I miss it so much I can't stand it.
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:44.140]   Do you have any trinity of variants like supercard?
[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:45.420]   There are so few still out.
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:46.420]   I keep thinking I should.
[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:47.900]   I just never get around to them.
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:51.300]   But I had so many hypercard stacks that I wrote Leo.
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.380]   I mean, it just-- oh, it was--
[00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:56.540]   The last time we talked about this, I got a lot of email from people who said, "Oh,
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:52:01.100]   there's still plenty of ways to run hypercard stacks on the modern Mac."
[00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:02.100]   It's called runtime revolution.
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:04.780]   Didn't you time contractions with hypercard Leo?
[00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:06.540]   I tried to, but yeah.
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.220]   But then that all went by the wayside.
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:10.260]   The minute the baby started coming.
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:13.980]   So runtime revolution is one.
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:15.740]   Have you tried any of these Leo?
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:17.060]   No, Andy probably has him.
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:18.060]   Have you, Andy?
[00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:21.700]   Yeah, three or four years ago, I had to try to resuscitate a whole bunch of different
[00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:24.420]   stacks and revolution worked just great.
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:29.660]   Someone actually still owns the rice to supercard and they were making some sort of heroic but
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:33.380]   desperately futile attempt to resuscitate it.
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:34.460]   And so I wound up not using it.
[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:36.420]   But runtime actually worked just great.
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:40.020]   As a matter of fact, I think it went open-- either was open source or as someone took
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.020]   the project open source.
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:42.020]   Oh, good.
[00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:43.020]   It's the easiest way.
[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:47.740]   I was able to recompile that stack into Linux versions and Windows versions.
[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:48.740]   And it runs.
[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:51.380]   You don't even need the hypercard player.
[00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.900]   Yeah, I don't believe it supports X commands.
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.900]   It might or might not.
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:55.900]   You know what?
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:59.660]   It's interesting because if you look at the hypercard's language, it really is the predecessor
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:00.660]   to AppleScript.
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:01.660]   It's basically AppleScript.
[00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:07.260]   Yeah, I mean, it was probably the first language in which I could really say that it was a
[00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:11.980]   credible development environment for just about anybody who wanted to do just about anything.
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:16.260]   Because if all you wanted to do was just drag buttons in and just collect them to other
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:18.100]   cards, you can make useful stuff that way.
[00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:21.380]   But once you start saying, well, geez, I just saw the stack that did this really cool thing.
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:22.380]   How does that work?
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:23.380]   Click on the button, look for the script.
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:25.180]   Oh, it's just three long, isn't it?
[00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:26.820]   And then you just paste into your own stack.
[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:28.820]   Then before you know it, you're building a--
[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:33.140]   Do you have to use the British accent or can you use a German accent?
[00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:35.620]   It helps if you're trying to get that $100 an hour consulting fee.
[00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:37.820]   They really respect a non-American accent.
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:39.540]   Hey, it's your problem, Governor.
[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:40.540]   What?
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:41.540]   It's the frame.
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:43.420]   I'm reading-- I'm looking at tidbits.
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:44.700]   You're a fucking fool.
[00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:50.380]   Matt Newber's review of HyperCard 2.2 from 1994.
[00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:51.380]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:53.180]   HyperCard 2.2 is here.
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:55.020]   HyperCard with eight colors.
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:57.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:58.020]   HyperCard--
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:59.020]   My eyes, they're dead.
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:04.260]   Game to Life in 1987 is a brainchild of Bill Atkinson, who, of course, wrote "Mac Pain"
[00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:09.420]   and is one of the great early Mac system programmers.
[00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:13.980]   And "Mac HyperCard 2.2."
[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:16.460]   Let's see if there's anything interesting in the new features.
[00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:19.020]   "It's Sports Quicktime" by the movie X command.
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:20.020]   That's nice.
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:24.420]   Was that the first version of HyperCard that revealed the new updated Bill Atkinson icon?
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:25.420]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:29.260]   I didn't freak me out just a little bit because Bill Atkinson looked like this wild-haired,
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:31.580]   glasses-wearing, t-shirt-wearing fellow nerd.
[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:32.580]   Right.
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:33.580]   And then suddenly he had a haircut.
[00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:34.580]   Yeah.
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:35.580]   He wasn't wearing glasses anymore.
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:36.580]   I don't know.
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:38.740]   He had one of those extreme makeovers, whatever.
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:39.740]   Rice was $249.
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:41.940]   Used to be free, remember?
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:42.940]   Yeah.
[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:43.940]   $249.
[00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:47.580]   So now all I have to do is figure out a way to get all my stacks which are stored on 3
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:48.580]   and 1/2 inch flop.
[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:49.580]   Yeah.
[00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:50.580]   You need to flop it.
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:51.580]   You need to fly to my computer and I'm good.
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:52.580]   You need a floppy drive.
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:53.580]   It was the first color HyperCard.
[00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:54.580]   Interns.
[00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:56.740]   For a long time, HyperCard was black and white only.
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:57.740]   Yeah.
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:58.740]   Figure it out.
[00:54:58.740 --> 00:54:59.740]   You're getting a high school credit for this.
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:00.740]   Figure it out.
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:01.740]   Figure it out.
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:02.740]   All right.
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:04.380]   So HyperCard's one switcher we should mention.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:05.820]   Another great switcher.
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:07.740]   That was really the first multi-finder.
[00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:11.220]   The allowed you to run multiple applications and switch back and forth.
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.220]   That was very cool.
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:16.060]   Originally in the final, you could only run one thing at a time.
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:20.100]   That's why desk accessories were first created.
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.900]   Just to prove that you could write software in Pascal, I think.
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:25.940]   That is actually true.
[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:31.060]   And that, by the way, another achievement of Bill Atkinson, he was the guy who brought
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:32.740]   Pascal to the Mac.
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:33.740]   Yeah.
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:37.100]   Really believed in Pascal.
[00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:39.140]   And he's a really good photographer.
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:40.420]   That's what he's doing now, I think.
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:41.420]   Yeah.
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:42.420]   And his nature photography, isn't he?
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:44.300]   He's an amazing nature photographer.
[00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:46.300]   Not just good, amazing.
[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:47.460]   All right.
[00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:48.700]   What other ancient Mac--
[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:49.700]   Wow.
[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.300]   I'm looking at the Wikipedia page for the desk accessories.
[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:53.300]   Oh, man.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:54.300]   Oh, man.
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:57.660]   See, I forgot about the turtle, a little turtle with the rabbit.
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:58.660]   The turtle and the rabbit.
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:55:59.660]   What was that?
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:02.620]   How fast will an Azure keyboard to respond?
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:05.660]   So like a turtle for slower and rabbit for faster.
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:08.260]   Why would anybody want their keyboard to respond slower?
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:09.260]   Well, no.
[00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:11.100]   It said like the before it's just repeating.
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:12.100]   Oh, the repeat.
[00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:13.340]   Yeah, I remember that.
[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:14.340]   Yeah.
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:16.300]   That was kind of early system preference paints.
[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:17.300]   Look at this.
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:18.300]   These are black and white.
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:19.300]   The calculator.
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:20.300]   Puzzle.
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:21.300]   Puzzle.
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:24.140]   No pad, which frankly is late and long limited.
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:25.300]   People miss no pad.
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.300]   Remember scrapbook?
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:28.700]   What a great application that was.
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:30.100]   I also, I just remember when--
[00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.100]   Really?
[00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:32.100]   You're Jimbo now.
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:33.900]   Yeah, you're Jimbo not as--
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:34.900]   Jimbo is quite new.
[00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:36.260]   I like that book, but not the same.
[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:38.060]   Welcome to the Geezer edition of MacPray.
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:39.060]   Yeah.
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:40.060]   Yeah.
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.620]   There was an app I remember getting.
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:42.620]   The one that the first one--
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:43.620]   They're not imagining it.
[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:45.860]   That is the sensation of your prostate getting smaller.
[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:46.860]   People.
[00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:47.860]   OK.
[00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:48.860]   Fun one thing.
[00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:49.860]   Whatever it is, it'll be 11.
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:50.860]   I think it's bigger, not smaller.
[00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:53.100]   So, we have 12 onions in our belts among us.
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:54.860]   Readers, listeners, watch your viewers.
[00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:56.300]   That was a style at the time.
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:57.500]   There was a-- I remember there was an app.
[00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:02.860]   There was a sound app where you could replace the system sounds.
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:04.060]   And this is very--
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:05.060]   This is like 1988.
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:06.060]   I think it was called SoundApp.
[00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:07.060]   Yeah.
[00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:08.060]   And was that right?
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:12.220]   But I remember you could like-- you could play like a 30 second clip of David Letterman
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:13.220]   bit or something.
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:14.220]   Oh, great.
[00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:17.420]   But back, I mean, that was really revolutionary that you could go in and change that--
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:18.420]   Because computers didn't have sound.
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:20.780]   I mean, PCs didn't have sound.
[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:23.420]   Well, that's what made stuff like this talking mousse just seem so magical.
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:24.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:27.620]   Because you flip it on, you type in and it starts talking and it's mind blowing.
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:29.900]   Right, they beeped, didn't they, Leo?
[00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:34.020]   They beeped out of the computer speaker and some early PC games would-- in fact, have
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:37.380]   you remember Castle Wolfenstein for the Apple II?
[00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:39.820]   A frittage, fine talking German.
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:44.140]   I'm not going to understand what these people are saying anyway.
[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:45.140]   We may as well make it a German.
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:46.140]   Oh, fuck!
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:47.140]   Go for broke.
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:50.140]   Because it was coming out of that little speaker, but even the fact that they could
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:52.660]   do that was amazing.
[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:53.660]   It's funny.
[00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:56.500]   And then remember that you would-- there were applications.
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:58:01.220]   I think the guy who writes type it for me wrote the first one that would make typewriter
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:02.860]   sounds when you typed on your mouth.
[00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:05.460]   God, I had this totally annoying control panel.
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:07.060]   You could assign any key.
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:09.460]   Well, also, back in the day, the trick was resedit.
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:10.460]   You had to do everything in resedit.
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:12.260]   Oh, resedit, there's a-- there you go.
[00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:13.260]   There you go.
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:15.260]   So you get resedit and you open an application.
[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:19.020]   The first thing I learned with that was that whatever application-- what about program
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:20.020]   or whatever they called it.
[00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:22.340]   It had a hat sounds in it.
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:27.180]   You could pull the sound resource files out of there and turn them into desktop, you
[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:28.180]   know, friendly sounds.
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:30.140]   It's fun to play with the sound resources.
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:33.980]   Resedit, you could really screw something up good really fast with resedit.
[00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:38.300]   So by the way, I had a buddy who took resedit and he would get every piece of Mac software
[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:39.300]   and change the--
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:40.300]   Customize everything.
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:42.300]   --it had been authored by him.
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:43.300]   That's funny.
[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:46.660]   So that sounds like my kid.
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:50.220]   So it's Ricardo Ettore who writes type it for me.
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:52.820]   And he has-- and you could still-- I'm not sure you'd want it.
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:58.060]   You could still get it-- sounds for fun will replace any sound for any activity on the
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:58:59.780]   Mac with any other sound.
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:00.780]   So you could have typing.
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:02.820]   You know what's hilarious is I went in.
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:08.220]   This is so bizarre that I'm just describing my first crush on the Mac, apart from being
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:11.700]   able to type my papers, was that ability to go in and fiddle with this stuff.
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:12.700]   And it was just yesterday.
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:13.700]   Sound control.
[00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:14.700]   That was it.
[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:18.980]   Like just yesterday, I opened up the package contents for Addium so I could go in and steal
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:20.180]   some sounds out of there.
[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:21.940]   Did you-- and you knew how to do that.
[00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:22.940]   Yeah, you just go--
[00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:24.420]   It's like we said, a senator, isn't it?
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:25.420]   It's just a folder.
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:26.420]   You don't need it.
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:27.420]   Yeah, you don't need it.
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:28.420]   But it's the same idea, though.
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:29.420]   The resources are still there.
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:30.420]   Yeah, people don't know.
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:32.420]   There's all kinds of great stuff inside all these applications.
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:33.420]   Right, right, right.
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:35.660]   You can show package contents you can get right in there.
[00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:36.660]   Yeah.
[00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:40.980]   And I wonder how you managed to get those great like three inch wide icons for whatever
[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:42.500]   thing you are trying to do.
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:44.860]   Well, no, it's actually a file that's actually inside this folder.
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:45.860]   Oh, no, it's not a folder.
[00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:46.860]   It's a double clickable, isn't it?
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:50.100]   I can highly recommend the Tokyo Subway sound set from Addium.
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:51.660]   It's really good for alerts.
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:55.460]   Oh, you know, because-- you know, that's a good Mac wine.
[00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:57.580]   The system alert sounds are pathetic.
[00:59:57.580 --> 00:59:59.580]   Oh, my God, they're so Jurassic.
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.620]   Oh, they're just-- oh, they're really annoying.
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:04.580]   Yeah, that's a really-- why is it that they have such lousy sounds?
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:08.980]   I replaced mine with the sound of the Zeppelin rolling in at the house of Brian Ribb.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.620]   Oh, I like that.
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:11.620]   Yeah.
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:15.540]   The sound of your heart clenching at the sight of the beef.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:17.020]   Do you have Addium on your machine now, Lee?
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:18.020]   I do.
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:19.020]   I'm going to go look at it right now.
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.020]   I use Addium.
[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.020]   I love Addium.
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.020]   I'll give you the path for this.
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:24.020]   Does it come with the Tokyo sounds or do you have to download this?
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.460]   Oh, that's a good point.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:26.460]   I'm kind of--
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:27.460]   I'm looking right now.
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:28.460]   I'm going to go look at the content.
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:30.540]   Usually, it's in Mac OS, right?
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:31.700]   Or no resources.
[01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:32.700]   Here we go, resources.
[01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:33.700]   Oh, sorry.
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:36.900]   And look at all the stuff in here.
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:37.900]   Lots of stuff.
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:40.100]   You don't need a software program to change that.
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:41.780]   No, you just right click on these.
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:44.540]   You can drag it out.
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.540]   Is it under set out?
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:48.900]   I really stopped being excited about system alerts, I don't know, like 10 years ago.
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.740]   Yeah, but I'm so sick of hearing history.
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.740]   I'm always just looking for something more subtle.
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:53.740]   Yeah.
[01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:55.740]   I mean, if I really want to be reminded of something--
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:56.740]   So sue me.
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:57.740]   Yeah.
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:58.740]   Why, why, guys?
[01:00:58.740 --> 01:00:59.740]   Don't--
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:01.620]   I also like the startups.
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.660]   The old startup sounds better, I think.
[01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.180]   Who's doing that?
[01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:06.180]   Come on.
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:07.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:09.380]   That's actually not bad.
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.260]   That's not an Apple sound.
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:12.260]   That's good.
[01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:14.020]   No, no, it is like the droplet sound.
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:17.620]   The worst thing in the world is to let me know that your system alert sound is droplet,
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:20.100]   because I will walk behind you as you're working and go.
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:22.100]   Oh, you're just-- what is going on?
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:23.100]   Oh, you're doing it.
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:24.100]   I thought it sounded good.
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.100]   I thought it sounded good.
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:30.220]   Because they know that-- like, I know something about Macintosh.
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:33.460]   Do you have eye chat open and do you have the video camera enabled?
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:38.420]   Because there was a security update like three, four weeks ago, where it gets patch
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:39.420]   on the sound manager.
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:40.940]   It keeps referring-- it doesn't dislike--
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:44.780]   If you could do submarine or tink, you'd be really set.
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:45.780]   So I found it.
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:48.980]   It says Tokyo train station subset or sound set.
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:50.420]   But how do I get into that?
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:52.020]   I won't let you double click into that.
[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:53.020]   Where are you?
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:54.740]   Are you in resources?
[01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:55.940]   Installation success.
[01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:57.700]   Do we have some rat hole music please?
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.700]   I see column backslash.
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:00.700]   Adume content.
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.500]   No, but we're in Macintosh.
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.020]   Oh, show package contents.
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.020]   You're right.
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:06.020]   It is a folder.
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.020]   Oh, look at them.
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:08.020]   Yay.
[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:09.580]   Now, how do I get that into my--
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.580]   You should be able to drag them to the desktop, I think.
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:13.020]   Now you're following it home.
[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:15.380]   Leo, this call may be monitored for the progress.
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:16.980]   And then what do I do with them?
[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:17.980]   Helping some of them.
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:19.980]   So how do I get them into the sounds of the system?
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.180]   In library, library, library, library.
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:24.660]   Next week, Merlin teaches Leo how to use--
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:25.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:26.660]   If you're--
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:27.660]   That's the most of the right.
[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:28.660]   Now I'm scared.
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:29.660]   No, don't you fuck!
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:30.660]   Ah.
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.660]   Now this is fun.
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:32.660]   OK.
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:33.660]   They're subtle.
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:34.660]   They're very subtle.
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:35.660]   They're good.
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:36.660]   They're well at the Tokyo train station.
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.900]   I'd play them for you, but you guys wouldn't be able to hear them.
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:41.060]   But I could play them for the-- or listening audience.
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:42.060]   I can now.
[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:43.060]   I can do it online.
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.060]   What can I mention?
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.060]   Hang on a second here.
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.060]   That's good.
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:47.060]   I like that.
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:48.060]   That's a nice one.
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:49.060]   That's contact on.
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:50.060]   That's contact off.
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:52.060]   Yeah, don't touch it much.
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.060]   That's message sent.
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:54.060]   That's message sent.
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.060]   It's a good.
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:56.060]   I like them.
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:58.020]   I use these for alarm sounds.
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:02:59.220]   They're a nice subtle alarm sound.
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:03.500]   Now is that an actual guy walking around with white gloves and a little funny hat and a chime?
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:04.500]   Shoving you in.
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:05.500]   Shoving you in?
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:06.500]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.500]   I've never been to Tokyo.
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.500]   I don't know.
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:09.500]   Oops.
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:10.500]   That was a mistake.
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.500]   I don't really leave the sun right.
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:12.500]   I mean, it's like I moved them out.
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.500]   I actually have to copy them.
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.500]   Red cars are non-fondling cars.
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.500]   There you go.
[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:17.500]   That's it.
[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.180]   Fondles girls, if you're in a red car.
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:20.180]   What?
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:21.180]   Do they really have to--
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:25.820]   You have to divide them by the sexes in certain places.
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:26.820]   Because people--
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:31.500]   All right, because there's this notion that perhaps the inadvertent touch might occur.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.500]   Goodness, all right.
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.500]   Inadvertent.
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:34.500]   Okay.
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:35.500]   That'll hold up in court.
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:38.020]   All right, so we got-- what do we got here?
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.020]   We got red cars.
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:40.020]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:41.020]   I thought that was my point.
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:42.420]   We got talking moves.
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:43.420]   We got hypercard.
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.420]   We got switcher.
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:45.420]   Yeah.
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:46.420]   We covered quite a few.
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:47.420]   I miss Shufflepuck.
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:48.420]   Soundbap.
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:50.420]   The greatest shame ever created for Shufflepuck.
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:51.420]   Oh, Shufflepuck.
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:53.860]   It was an air hockey game.
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:59.100]   And the brilliance of this game was that it gave you a 3D view of your perspective view
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.900]   of the knock hockey table.
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:07.980]   But you had a mouse in your hand that you were just stroking across the desktop just like
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:08.980]   an air hockey camera.
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:09.980]   Oh, that's great.
[01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:12.340]   And so I got more exercise playing Shufflepuck.
[01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:15.940]   And I probably broke more glasses and spilled more beverages off my desktop.
[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:16.940]   Get on.
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:17.940]   Get on.
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:18.940]   Put it in the truck.
[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:19.940]   Ah, yeah.
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:20.940]   You couldn't do that.
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:21.940]   You couldn't answer.
[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:22.940]   I'm defeated.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:23.940]   I'm defeated.
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:26.740]   And it was a precursor to the Wii.
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:29.980]   I remember that it was like I was a vector.
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:33.140]   It was a vector with the like vector issue with tones.
[01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:34.140]   Oh, there's no question.
[01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:35.140]   That was a great game.
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:36.140]   I remember that.
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:37.140]   I like that.
[01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:38.140]   I like that.
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:39.140]   It was like the early 90s.
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:40.140]   I like that.
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:41.140]   It wasn't that long ago.
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:42.140]   I like it.
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:43.140]   Dark castle.
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.580]   You remember dark castle?
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:46.580]   That was it.
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:48.580]   You'd remember it if you heard the sound.
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:49.580]   Okay.
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:53.860]   Anyway, how did I curly?
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.300]   Maybe you wouldn't.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:05:02.580]   The funny thing is it was it was an early black and white Mac game 1987.
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:03.820]   But and there were sequels.
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:06.580]   I think up to the early late 90s.
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:07.580]   Oh, look at that.
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:08.580]   Then they went colored.
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:09.660]   Have you ever seen this game?
[01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:10.660]   You've never played it?
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:11.660]   I thought I'd never played it.
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:12.660]   Go to Wikipedia for dark castle.
[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:13.660]   Wow.
[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:14.820]   And it's got those old patterns.
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:15.820]   I love those.
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:16.820]   Yeah.
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:17.820]   Yeah.
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:18.820]   It was fun.
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:23.380]   We talked about the worst game ever made and it was the first piece of commercial software
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.460]   for the Macintosh.
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:26.180]   A game called Alice.
[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:27.740]   Oh, I liked Alice.
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:28.900]   Oh, it was horrible.
[01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:31.540]   It was from the guys who later did missed.
[01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:33.220]   Wasn't no.
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:34.860]   No, it was the first game.
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:37.580]   It was made by.
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:38.860]   You were you can't remember it.
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:39.860]   It was black and white.
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:40.860]   It was very early.
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:44.740]   It was the game where it was it was the game where it was Alice from Alice in Wonderland
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:45.980]   is on a chessboard.
[01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:46.980]   Yeah.
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:49.380]   So you have to basically play like the eight queens.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:51.940]   Oh, no, that's not the game I'm thinking of.
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:55.940]   But the problem is you have the computational power of a human.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:59.180]   We're asked the Macintosh has a computational power of a desktop computer.
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:02.660]   It was impossible to win because it could make it wasn't like you make a move that it
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:05.980]   makes it's like it's always moving on the chessboard.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:10.660]   And I found filthy language that I never knew I ever learned, you know, playing this game
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.660]   in a crowded like school labs.
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:17.820]   Like Steve caps, Steve caps.
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:18.820]   That's who wrote it.
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:23.020]   It came in this really beautiful, like, yep, beautiful presentation box presentation book.
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:26.020]   I have like three copies of it in shrink wrap because I found it like on clearance.
[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:27.700]   They're just such a beautiful object.
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.820]   It's it's it's like a lot of like diner food.
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:30.820]   It's really great.
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.660]   As long as you don't actually take it internally and use it.
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:36.780]   If you just leave it as it is and enjoy it as a static object, it's beautiful.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:39.380]   It's like it's like the pictures on the Denny's menu.
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.380]   Exactly.
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:41.980]   The food looks really good there.
[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:43.540]   But you don't want to eat it.
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:47.900]   If you want to read the story of Alice, it's on folklore.org and he hurts.
[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.060]   Felt's great site.
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:50.660]   The history of the site.
[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:54.860]   There's a whole the whole story of how Alice happened, how Steve caps came to him with
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:57.580]   the idea and so forth.
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:01.620]   And the packaging is actually a little hate filled heart and wish to inflict his misery
[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:02.740]   upon the rest of the world.
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:05.780]   So he couldn't go door to door and just hit people in the kneecap.
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:07.260]   So he decided this game.
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:10.580]   Did you ever find the hidden Cheshire cat menu?
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:12.580]   Yes, with a resident.
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:13.580]   Oh, resident.
[01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:14.580]   There you go.
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:15.580]   Resident.
[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:16.580]   That's something that should be our.
[01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:17.580]   Resident.
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:18.580]   Help me out of the fools there.
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:20.740]   And because I could not find one final piece of the map and then finally I said screw it
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:24.860]   and went to resident it printed out all these little icons, cut and pasted this thing in
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:27.340]   Mac paint and suddenly had the entire fool's map.
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:28.340]   Resident.
[01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:29.340]   It used to be.
[01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:31.380]   I didn't call the Ashimaru like Captain Kirk.
[01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:32.380]   You cheater.
[01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:33.380]   But there's also that.
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:34.380]   I found a way.
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:36.180]   I should be true.
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:40.140]   Change your icons to that used to be the back in the day that used to be the way to change
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:41.140]   your icons.
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:43.300]   Well, you had to go through resident as well.
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:45.420]   You could go in and there was that with a fat bits.
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:46.420]   Remember the.
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:47.420]   Fat bits.
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:50.860]   Yeah, everybody could be an artist in black and white.
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:51.860]   It's not too hard.
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:56.060]   Steve Jobs didn't play Alice very much, but he was duly impressed by the obvious programming
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:58.260]   skills it took to create it.
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:07:59.540]   Who is this cap sky?
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:00.980]   Why is he working on the Lisa?
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:05.420]   He said as soon as he saw the program mentioning Lisa with a hint of disdain.
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:08.180]   We've got to get him onto the Mac team.
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:09.940]   Alice did go on to do a lot of stuff for the mag.
[01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:15.180]   Did he end up going over to say, where caps end up?
[01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:16.180]   Oh well.
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:19.180]   For the level of hell if I be.
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:22.180]   I'm a fifth level.
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:25.180]   Put them in open glass elevator.
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:26.700]   Let all the demons smack you.
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:28.940]   Was he a general magic with all the other guys?
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:30.180]   I can't remember.
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:32.140]   Let's see.
[01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:33.300]   Let's look it up.
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:35.180]   No, doesn't say he disappeared.
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:37.540]   Oh, he co-founded the you know what?
[01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:38.780]   Close Sandy.
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:41.580]   He co-founded the MSN Explorer project.
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:44.340]   His early work at Microsoft resulted in Internet Explorer.
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:47.500]   Well, that worked out pretty good for him.
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.020]   He was an interface.
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:52.580]   You know, you hit this on the head Andy from 1996 until 2001.
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:55.220]   He was a user interface architect at Microsoft.
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:56.220]   There you go.
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:57.220]   There you go.
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:58.740]   And they've done such a good job.
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:02.860]   He started on the evil path with Alice and boy he's figured he figured that I'm not getting
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:03.860]   out of hell after retin' Alice.
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:05.500]   So I may as well go all the way.
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:10.660]   He better hope that he better hope that CSS developers don't get to decide who goes where
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:11.660]   and all after that.
[01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:15.900]   I have to say though, give him a little credit because he wrote Jam Session and SoundEdit
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:16.900]   and Super Studio Session.
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:18.900]   So he didn't fail at everything.
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:19.900]   He didn't say those again.
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:20.900]   What are they?
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:25.860]   Jam Session SoundEdit, which was a very early Mac editing program, great Mac music editing
[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:26.860]   program.
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:27.860]   Yes.
[01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:30.220]   And Super Studio Session.
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:32.220]   SoundEdit was eventually sold to Macromedia.
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:35.220]   Yeah, that is really ringing a bell.
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:36.220]   I feel like that.
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:39.820]   Well, in fact, as long as we're talking about great Mac applications, Lex not forget Mark
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:41.820]   Cantor.
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:45.700]   And it was a comic book creator, was the first edition of--
[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:47.660]   With artwork by Mike Sines.
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:48.660]   Mike Sines.
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:49.660]   Mike Sines, yeah.
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:51.180]   Yeah, wasn't that amazing?
[01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:52.740]   And Virtual Valerie.
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:53.740]   Virtual Valerie.
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:54.740]   Oh, yes, we could forget.
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:55.740]   When you said that was--
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:56.740]   No, I definitely remember that.
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:59.340]   I definitely remember Virtual Valerie.
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:06.780]   An early attempted adult software, basically in a very limited environment.
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:10.700]   That's one software promotional t-shirt that I can't wear, but I can't throw away.
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:11.700]   Virtual.
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:12.780]   You have a virtual Valerie.
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:16.740]   Every year I make the edits and I hold this up in my hands and I realize that I can't
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:17.740]   grab.
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.380]   I'm just a big stupid male.
[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:20.380]   I'm going to keep this another year.
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:21.380]   No, I don't blame you.
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:23.620]   That'll be worth something someday.
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:27.860]   And as long as you're never married, you're set.
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:29.300]   If I had it, my wife--
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:30.300]   I was looking at the t-shirt.
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:31.300]   Who needs a wife?
[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:32.300]   Who needs a wife?
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.580]   I've got Virtual Valerie.
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:37.300]   Doc Severinson, Lave and Doma, now the NBC Orchestra.
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:41.820]   It's funny, though, because Comic Creator, which was an early animation program and eventually
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:45.220]   that's kind of where Flash came from, really.
[01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:49.860]   Yeah, there was the whole Mac provision, Macra media, Macra, whatever, Macra.
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:50.860]   Macra vision.
[01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:52.860]   I think you got that one.
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:54.860]   That's another one.
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:58.900]   You know, Mac cantors have to go through every single permutation and combination of the
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:00.700]   word Macra, whatever.
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:05.340]   Anyway, we did mention missed and you can't forget missed.
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:10.260]   But before there was missed, wasn't there a hypercard stack that you were going down
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:11.540]   a river and a boat?
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:13.500]   And I thought that's what you were talking about when you were talking about Alice.
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.300]   What was the name of that?
[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:16.300]   It might have been called missed.
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.380]   It might have been the earliest version of missed.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:19.860]   I don't remember that.
[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:22.980]   Has anybody played the new missed game?
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:26.300]   Ooh-hoo-hoo, or whatever it's called.
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:27.300]   No.
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:28.300]   No.
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:29.300]   Okay.
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:31.300]   1993 says missed came out on the list.
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:34.940]   Missed was a big, big, important game, don't you think?
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:36.020]   I remember watching people play that.
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:37.020]   I just remember visually.
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:41.180]   It just seemed so incredible because I played a few of those text adventure games in the
[01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:42.180]   late days.
[01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:44.460]   That was more what I was familiar with.
[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.540]   Nothing better than Zork if you asked me.
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:47.540]   You're gonna be a bit of a maid.
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:50.140]   So, twisty passages all alike.
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:53.460]   My favorite part was whenever you were gonna do something special and you saved, it says,
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:57.100]   "Are we gonna do something dangerous?"
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:59.980]   You would say, "Every time you type save, it would then come back and say, 'Are we gonna
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.700]   do something dangerous?'"
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:02.700]   You can still play that.
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:05.740]   In fact, all the Zork games are available for free.
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:10.740]   You could play them on your Mac in pristine text form if you'd like.
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:12.580]   What other way would there be to do that?
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:13.580]   Right.
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:16.380]   Well, I think that wasn't that there at some point in an attempt to make a graphical version
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:17.380]   of these.
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:19.460]   Yes, and it absolutely sucked.
[01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:20.460]   It sucked in every way.
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:21.460]   Yeah, these are plaar.
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:22.460]   Plain old.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:27.060]   Now, did you ever play the original dungeon or colossal cave?
[01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:28.060]   I did not.
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:29.060]   I don't remember that.
[01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:31.340]   Fossil cave, that was great.
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:32.340]   It ran on...
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:33.340]   We didn't have a PDP 8 model.
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:34.340]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:35.340]   It ran on a PDP.
[01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:36.700]   But I'll tell you where I played it was on Compulant.
[01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.780]   Early days of Compu-serve, you could play it.
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:39.780]   Oh, that's right.
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:41.020]   I do remember that now.
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:43.220]   Yeah, and that Zork was based on it.
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:44.220]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:46.500]   We have this kind of a similar beginning.
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:48.300]   Well I think we should wrap this up with our...
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:49.300]   It's been fun, actually.
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.300]   We redeemed the show, I think, with those memories.
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.980]   In fact, I'm going to cut all the news out, and we'll just do that.
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:56.260]   Can I give you the comments that the Twitter team...
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:58.260]   Let's let the listeners decide whether we redeemed it or not.
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:01.260]   There's already comments about the phone on the minute, which it just became your...
[01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:05.180]   It's just over like the first 25 minutes, and then it goes like, "Suck as much."
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:06.180]   It's still stuck.
[01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:07.180]   It's stuck as much.
[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:09.340]   There's this whole front part you can skip.
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:10.580]   I might just end it out.
[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:11.620]   Why don't I just cut it out?
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:14.700]   If you guys keep doing this, I'm never going to listen again.
[01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:21.100]   See, the trick is, if I cut it out and we allude to it, it then becomes the long lost, missing
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.140]   half hour that everybody wants.
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:24.540]   Yeah, then we can really sit on it.
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:26.380]   We can charge for that, really.
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:27.380]   Listen.
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:30.140]   I tell people, "Oh no, you'll be glad I cut it out.
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:32.220]   It was awful."
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:33.220]   And that doesn't matter.
[01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:34.220]   They're going, "No, no.
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:35.220]   It was really good.
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:37.080]   You just didn't want us to hear your best stuff."
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.080]   Or, I don't know.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.080]   Lashes.
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:40.080]   You're always, you're always...
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:41.080]   Holy boy.
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.080]   I think it took about...
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.340]   It was for a good reason, I believe.
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:48.820]   What was it like three minutes until they had the unedited talk shoe version of our show
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:49.820]   up last time?
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:50.820]   That's right.
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:51.820]   That didn't take long.
[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:52.820]   It was like three minutes before it was up.
[01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:53.820]   Yeah.
[01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:54.820]   And everybody's listening to that with all the pre-fated.
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:55.820]   Can you beat that listeners?
[01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:58.820]   I still just had another outback steakhouse certificate.
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:03.220]   It's walking to a sponsor, Leo.
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:06.060]   Actually, we have a sponsor.
[01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:07.860]   Believe it or not, we have a sponsor.
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:08.860]   Who's our sponsor?
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:09.860]   Oh, God, it's Bugaboo Creek.
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:10.860]   I've just screwed you over.
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:11.860]   I'm so sorry.
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:13.860]   Why don't I think before?
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:14.860]   I'm sorry.
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:15.860]   Bugaboo Creek.
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:16.860]   Bugaboo Creek.
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:17.860]   Bugaboo Creek.
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:18.860]   The food.
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:19.860]   Done right.
[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:20.860]   They'll treat you right.
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:21.860]   Bugaboo Creek.
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:22.860]   Bugaboo Creek.
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:23.860]   No, I can't tell you it is because they didn't pay for this show.
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:24.860]   They'll pay for next show.
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:28.860]   We better get it out of our system this week.
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:34.700]   If we don't have $10,000 by midnight, we will reveal another letter of sponsor responsible
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:35.700]   for the show.
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:38.700]   Don't trade games with us, Mr. Mayor.
[01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:39.700]   Click.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:40.700]   No cops either.
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:43.780]   Turn on the bat signal.
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:47.300]   Let's do our software picks and then get the heck out of here.
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:51.900]   I will start with something that I just discovered on the Ultimate Apple Weblog, but apparently
[01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:54.620]   not new has been around for a while.
[01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:56.340]   It really looks cool.
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:59.820]   It's a wrapper for scripts.
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:04.260]   I do a lot of bash and Perl scripting because a lot of times, command line stuff is a lot
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:06.260]   easier for me to do.
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:08.020]   I like Python.
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:09.020]   Apple scripts so forth.
[01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:13.140]   It's very fast, but sometimes you wish you had kind of an application around it.
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:14.940]   This will bundle it.
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:16.860]   You know about platypus.
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:18.100]   It's very clever.
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:19.100]   Very cool.
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:20.100]   Yeah.
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:22.300]   It turns it basically into an application.
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:26.660]   You can do custom icons.
[01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:29.420]   It makes it very easy for you to distribute.
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.580]   You could do this with that automator too.
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:34.060]   Automator will allow you to execute any application.
[01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:37.940]   Of course, so will Xcode.
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:42.860]   You can also, I think it's great because you can kind of share these little bits of functionality
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:45.100]   with other people and you don't have to build a big.
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:46.580]   I learned about a similar thing.
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:49.900]   Actually, John Gruber told me about this, something called self-service where you can
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:52.980]   go in and make a service out of any shelf script.
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:53.980]   That is cool.
[01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:56.380]   So then it becomes part of your services menu.
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:15:57.380]   Exactly.
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:59.140]   But I think stuff like that is such a great idea.
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:04.100]   Yeah, because there is a lot of power under the hood of OS X. It really is Unix.
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:08.140]   The ability to take a script, a bash script, or a Perl or Python script, again, I have
[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:09.140]   a lot of them.
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:14.860]   You could even does tickle and turn it into a clickable application is really useful.
[01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:15.860]   Good tick.
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:17.460]   Yeah, just for fun.
[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:19.020]   It's free.
[01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:20.980]   It's easy to use and it's very mature.
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:22.620]   This is why I'm kind of embarrassed to bring it up.
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:27.060]   It's been around for some time version 3.4 just came out.
[01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:32.100]   But it's been around since for about three or four years now and a very useful handy thing.
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:33.540]   Actually, it didn't just come out.
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:34.700]   I'm sorry.
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:36.340]   I just learned of it.
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:38.780]   There's a platypus for Firefox too, I believe.
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:39.780]   Isn't there?
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:41.100]   Oh, I don't know that.
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:42.100]   How would that help?
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:45.660]   I'm trying to remember because in my head, and this is what happens when you turn 40,
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:49.940]   is I thought it did something kind of similar in terms of letting you wrap functionality.
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:52.500]   But I will find out while the next person is there.
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:53.500]   All right.
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.780]   And the next person would be Mr. Scott Borne.
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:56.780]   What is your pick?
[01:16:56.780 --> 01:17:01.780]   Well, mate, I'm going to bring it down a little bit now from this geeky stuff to something
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:03.140]   a little more reliable.
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:05.540]   That's the single worst accent I've ever heard.
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:06.540]   I love that movie.
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:07.540]   That was so funny.
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:08.540]   Very nice.
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:11.540]   I'm here just so you guys got some really big.
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:14.700]   You look across like three different continents.
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:16.100]   In one sense.
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:17.940]   And you know why Merlin?
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:18.940]   Why is that?
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:22.900]   Here's the reason why because my pick has to do with many continents.
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:25.860]   In fact, my pick has to do with all continents.
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:26.860]   It is...
[01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:27.860]   That's your incontinence.
[01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:30.820]   Thank you very much.
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:31.820]   It's Earthdesk.
[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:33.740]   Earthdesk is my pick.
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:35.620]   Earthdesk is a very cool screensaver.
[01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:37.220]   I don't know how long it's been around.
[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:39.420]   It could be like Leo's could have been around a while.
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:40.420]   But I use Earthdesk.
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:41.420]   I love Earthdesk.
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:42.420]   And it has been over a while.
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:46.500]   You're able to see the whole world including like the sun where it's supposed to be and
[01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.500]   the light and...
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:50.020]   It replaces your desktop wallpaper.
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:51.020]   Yeah.
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:52.020]   You got city lights.
[01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:55.140]   You got the ability to zoom in.
[01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:57.380]   Satellite maps.
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:00.060]   And they just did something to the gooey that's a little bit different.
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:01.500]   I haven't figured it all out yet.
[01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.420]   But anyway, it's really cool.
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:04.660]   It's called Earthdesk.
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:08.860]   It's a screensaver style desk utility thingy.
[01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:10.340]   But it's not a screensaver.
[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:12.180]   It's a wallpaper, basically.
[01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:14.980]   Well, no, actually it will act as a screensaver.
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:16.980]   It will act as a screensaver.
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:19.820]   It's 1995.
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:24.820]   And I'm not sure who it's from, but you can just Google Earthdesk.
[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:25.820]   And you'll find it.
[01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:26.820]   That's my pick.
[01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:30.100]   And since I was so mercilessly destroyed for my pick last week, I figured I'd pick something
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:31.580]   as safe as a screensaver.
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:33.060]   What was your pick last week?
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:34.060]   You're not going to discuss that.
[01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:35.060]   We want to mock you again.
[01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:36.060]   Come on.
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:37.060]   I don't remember.
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:38.060]   I don't remember that at all.
[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:39.060]   That was the thing.
[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:44.140]   I found the place where I could allegedly try to protect my ID by using a proxy server.
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:50.580]   And basically Andy in particular left me feeling eviscerated as I signed off the air.
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:52.420]   I asked such an innocent question.
[01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:54.220]   He has an acid tongue, you know.
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:55.220]   Yeah, I know.
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:56.220]   So there it is.
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:57.580]   Go ahead and try to mock Earthdesk.
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:58.580]   I dare you.
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:18:59.980]   No, that's actually a great tip.
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:02.140]   I love this planet of ours.
[01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:07.180]   And I will not hear you malign the spirit of the Greenpeace warriors who just want to
[01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:10.260]   leave a better guy for our next generation.
[01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:12.060]   Floating in space.
[01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:13.060]   Damn straight.
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:14.060]   Yeah.
[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:21.580]   That's a big marvel when you see it from up there.
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:25.980]   So while we're talking, I am going to add one more thing, which I've just been playing
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:26.980]   with.
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:27.980]   And I finally got in.
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:32.980]   It's called Method Music Lifehouse-Method.com.
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:37.620]   You get three free, oh, wait a minute.
[01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:45.120]   Oh, I passed the test.
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.600]   Yeah, three free theme songs based on your personalities.
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:56.720]   You have to fill out a form of questionnaire.
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:00.240]   And then it makes music that's just yours.
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:03.380]   So before the show is over, I'm going to go through the form because I don't really want
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:04.640]   to pay attention anymore.
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:07.200]   And I will have a theme song.
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.440]   You guys just talk amongst yourselves.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:09.440]   I will have a theme song.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:10.440]   No, no, one, one, play for you.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:11.440]   See me.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.440]   Feel me.
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.440]   You all sound like Tommy.
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:17.080]   Remember that P. Townsend is deaf.
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:19.880]   Oh, I don't know how that factors in.
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:20.880]   Oh, dear.
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:21.880]   All right.
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:22.880]   Babe, so is Beethoven.
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:23.880]   What do you want?
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:27.520]   Would you like to sit for your portrait now?
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:29.920]   So I'm sitting for my musical portrait.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:30.920]   I don't know what it's doing.
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:33.520]   Maybe it's, I don't know, going through my hard drive, looking for passwords.
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.960]   Do you need Merlin to tell you which buttons to push you?
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.120]   I think I've crashed.
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:40.120]   I've crashed Firefox pretty much every hour now.
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:42.320]   Do you know the story behind Lifehouse?
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:44.200]   No, you do?
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:49.360]   Lifehouse was going to be the record that eventually became, gosh, which was it, I want
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.200]   to say, I want to say-- Quadrifania?
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:52.200]   Who's next?
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.200]   Who's next?
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:54.200]   How do you get this breakdown?
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:55.200]   He tried to write this.
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:56.200]   Oh my god, this is totally insane.
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:00.400]   He was going to write this rock and roll rock opera, right?
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.280]   And-- Let me see if I can-- Okay.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:06.000]   Now it's asking me for my voice.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.400]   So I'm going to-- Well, because, because-- Well, there's a reason, this is related.
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.200]   So there was this whole thing where it was going to like get brain waves from the audience.
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.160]   And then now it's going to be-- That's what this does.
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.960]   That was part of the whole Lifehouse idea.
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:16.960]   It's getting my brain-- You're getting my brain.
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:19.400]   --on the keyboard and close the screen over your left ear.
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:20.400]   No, see, here we go.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:21.400]   Here is what it does.
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:24.760]   "Pourage your voice, you upload an image, you record a sound, you record a rhythm, and
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.560]   then it makes your music for you."
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:27.760]   This is from this from Wikipedia.
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:32.000]   "Pete went wild, working out a complex scenario whereby a personal profile of each concert
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.840]   goer would be worked out from the individual's astrological chart to his hobbies, even physical
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:38.840]   appearance, all the characteristics."
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:39.840]   Oh, no wonder you're going to have to ask.
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:42.440]   Yeah, it would then be fed into a computer at the same moment leading to one musical note
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.440]   culminating in "NASA Nirvana."
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:45.440]   Oh!
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:46.960]   That was totally going to work.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:47.960]   It was totally going to work.
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:48.960]   Oh.
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:49.960]   But then he made him-- Do the sort of growth that--
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:50.960]   There's nothing.
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:51.960]   --the amount of does.
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:52.960]   Wow.
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:53.960]   I'm glad he made it.
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.600]   I was a once-reaction to that idea.
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:57.800]   Wasn't that stricty darn good?
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:58.800]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:00.840]   All right, well, I'm going to put some stuff in here.
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:03.800]   We'll just see what-- So what are you entering right now, Leo?
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:04.800]   What are you telling me?
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:09.800]   Well, it wants some speaking, some of my speech, which I think I have somewhere on here, somewhere
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:12.880]   I must have said something at some point recorded.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.240]   Then it wants an image.
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:19.800]   And I guess you just pick these kind of at random?
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:20.800]   I don't know.
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:24.480]   And then it wants a sound, a rhythm, and then you listen to your music.
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:25.960]   It's like mad libs, kind of.
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:26.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.600]   It's kind of like an audio mad libs.
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:29.600]   Is that wild?
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:37.840]   I always-- I'm going to upload bandwidth for Mac Break Weekly is brought to you by CashFly.
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:41.360]   You sound like you are trying to sell things.
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:44.520]   Hi, I'm Pete Townsend.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.320]   So Scott's pick is Earthdesk.
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:48.320]   Can I agree?
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:49.320]   Now let's see.
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:50.320]   Have you done one, Nandy?
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:51.320]   No, you haven't.
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:52.320]   Go ahead.
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.320]   I am not.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:57.520]   My pick is probably the epitome of the sort of software that I like.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:02.320]   It's sort of like the busy box you put inside an infant's crib that keeps it pleasantly
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.520]   distracted.
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:07.520]   It's from RainerSoftware.com.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:09.080]   It's an application called iBAT.
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:10.440]   iBAT2.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:15.160]   It does nothing but monitor the performance of the battery on your portable Macintosh.
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.240]   It will give you real-time charts.
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.600]   It will give you blinking lights.
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:21.560]   It will give you dials like accelerators and things like that.
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:24.160]   Now it will give you-- it will give you-- exactly.
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:25.160]   It will give you-- exactly.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.160]   It will give you-- I'm monitoring.
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:28.160]   I'm monitoring.
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:31.920]   You've got to-- the more power draws, the more watts, you can actually see it twitching
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:32.920]   and twitching.
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:36.280]   And it will tell you, give you one piece of useful information like, okay, it looks
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.920]   like your battery is holding this much charge.
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:42.680]   It doesn't need to be replaced yet, but you're only getting about 60% of the life you would
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:44.080]   get if it were a new battery.
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:49.280]   But chiefly, it's just that you get to-- many times when you're like such-- like times like
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:52.480]   now when you're recording a podcast and you're zoning out just a little bit, you look at that
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:57.480]   beautiful little bar graph as it spikes up and it access the DVD, then spikes back down
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.840]   again because now it's turning off the Wi-Fi.
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:04.960]   Oh, that actually would be useful if it really were accurate.
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:05.960]   It's pretty good.
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:07.960]   I mean, because that would be good because you would--
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.760]   I have three different power books.
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:15.760]   It pegged the ages of my-- of the basic life performance curves of my batteries pretty
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.240]   well.
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:21.360]   But again, I'm not suggesting that it's something that you could really make a good case that
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:26.040]   it's a tax deductible business expense, but it's cool to look at.
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:29.080]   None of things are cool to look at.
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:30.600]   Not enough things are cool to look at.
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.600]   Not enough things.
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.600]   I like apps.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.600]   I'm sorry I'm distracted.
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:34.600]   I'm sorry I'm distracted.
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.600]   Like, like, statu and, you know, menu meters and stuff like that.
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:37.600]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.320]   Like, menu meters is more useful, really.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:42.120]   I have menu meters on all the time and it's always telling you everything.
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:44.760]   And I always worry that's using up so many cycles that it's really not reliant.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:46.880]   Yeah, you ever run top or like top 10?
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:47.880]   Right.
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:48.880]   Top is always on top.
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:50.880]   Top is always on top.
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:51.880]   Oh, Linux.
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:56.120]   Oh, I tell you.
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:58.520]   Command line apps are fun.
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:00.840]   Okay, so what is that called?
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:01.840]   I-BAT.
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:02.840]   I-BAT.
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:03.840]   And who's that by?
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:04.840]   It's by Rayner Software.
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:05.840]   R-A-Y-N-E-R.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:06.840]   Soft.
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:07.840]   R-A-Y-N-R.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:08.840]   Soft.
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:09.840]   Where.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:12.840]   And now I think we've made enough time for Merlin to come up with his-
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:17.560]   Mine is short and like, it seems like every week I'm trying to give you some new way to
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:21.360]   move your multimedia from one thing to another.
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:26.600]   But in the past I've just quickly have a little quick mini rat hole which is that generally
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:30.040]   I'm a huge fan of TubeSock for getting things off of YouTube.
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:33.200]   Not least because it works with something called TubeSock Loader which makes it very
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:37.440]   easy to just-like there's a thread on Metafilter that makes the tent.
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:40.440]   What noise is that?
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:44.440]   Sorry, I had to record a rhythm for Pete Townsend.
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:45.880]   I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:46.880]   That's distracting me.
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:47.880]   That's body ear, Leo.
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:48.880]   Just let it go.
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.880]   I thought you'd go on hip hop.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:53.880]   Okay, I'm gonna say that.
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:54.880]   That was good.
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:55.880]   You guys-
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:26:02.320]   Not that what you were saying was an interesting role.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:07.400]   Please go right ahead.
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:12.320]   And so usually I'm a big fan of TubeSock because of TubeSock Loader.
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:15.360]   Sorry, I can't interrupt myself.
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.240]   Which is great.
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:21.160]   So you know they do that thing when you post something on the YouTube but it's in multiple
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:23.440]   parts so it'll be within the 10 minute limit.
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:25.840]   That's a great app because you can like queue a bunch of stuff up.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:31.360]   Up till now I had not been aware of any app that would let you yonk things off of the
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:32.960]   Google video.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:36.080]   And now increasingly me, I want to watch stuff on the Apple TV.
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:37.480]   I don't want to mess around.
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:39.000]   I don't want to have to put a computer up.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.560]   Well now there's this thing called Tube TV.
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.560]   And so-
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:44.560]   Tube TV.
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:45.560]   Is it like TubeSock?
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:47.360]   Is it from the TubeSock folks?
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.840]   And this works with both YouTube and Google video.
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:54.280]   And there's a lot of stuff on Google video that is-
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:57.080]   The quality is so sucky though.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:58.080]   It is sucky.
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:01.600]   It better sucky you know that they-
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:04.600]   So what it does is it'll go in and like I didn't have an end of that sentence so I'm
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:05.600]   going to abandon it.
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:06.600]   That's good.
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:07.600]   Better sucky then.
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:08.600]   It's joy.
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:09.600]   Dot dot dot.
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:10.600]   Your lifeboats.
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:11.600]   Tube TV.
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.760]   Oh and this will take it to your Apple TV.
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:14.760]   Oh that's neat.
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:16.240]   Oh I like this.
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:17.240]   This is cool.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:20.640]   Is it evolving like for example this show that I've just discovered from Friends called
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:23.640]   Brass Eye, this amazing show from the UK.
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:25.640]   I've only ever seen it on Google TV.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:29.720]   So you pointed at this and it goes in and it does a little bit of pixie dust fairy magic
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:30.720]   to make it look a little better.
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:33.600]   And sometimes there are better quality versions on Google TV.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.840]   But it probably only gets the one that you get the free preview one.
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:38.680]   But you know what I just love this, these kinds of apps because you just pointed at
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:40.840]   stuff and walk away and it takes care of all it for you.
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:46.000]   So it's at Chim-moosoft CHIM-MOOS-O-O.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.800]   Shy-moosoft maybe.
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:49.920]   You know if you just Google Tube TV it's like the second.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:52.640]   Why don't you go ahead and just Google Tube TV.
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:54.640]   That's how I said it.
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:56.640]   I'm not that bad.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:59.640]   But do you ever use Keepvid?
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:00.640]   Keepvid.
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:01.640]   I don't know.
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:02.640]   Keepvid.com.
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:04.640]   It's totally web based.
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:09.080]   You basically paste in the URL of anything from just about any video site and I'll give
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:10.080]   you a link to a flash video.
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:13.080]   Because we should have one big Uber post about this stuff.
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:16.720]   Because I bring it up a lot because I am really using this stuff.
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:21.640]   But I like the idea of Tube TV because it gets it right to your iPod or your Apple TV.
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:24.960]   Now Visual Hub will do that too for things like if you've got little...
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:25.960]   We've talked about it.
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:26.960]   We've already got it.
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:27.960]   It's every week.
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:28.960]   Yeah exactly.
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.280]   And it does queue stuff up really nicely.
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:31.640]   But I think this is a great...
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:34.920]   To me this is fascinating and this ends up being kind of the last mile.
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:39.240]   I guess in some ways I am about the Apple TV like Scott is about the As yet unreleased
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:40.240]   iPhone.
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:43.640]   I think the Apple TV has a lot of promise to it.
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:45.200]   Getting content into it is the issue.
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:49.880]   I keep looking for new interesting shows on iTunes and they're just starting enough frankly.
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:51.880]   Let me give you a tip if you're not doing it already.
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.880]   Are you using TubeSock right now?
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:54.880]   No.
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:58.600]   One nice thing is like a lot of those apps it's got a little button you can click that will
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:00.360]   integrate it into Safari.
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.240]   So what that does is create a bookmarklet.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:06.520]   So if you're on a YouTube page all you got to do is hit that bookmarklet and it sends
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.080]   it right into TubeSock.
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:09.080]   Okay.
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:10.080]   I do use Visual Hub.
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:14.880]   I mean I'll download stuff and I'll convert it with Visual Hub and that works fine.
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:17.320]   I think this is the last mile for a lot of this stuff.
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:18.320]   It's key.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:23.960]   I mean we're kind of doing a workaround or I guess we're that's the kind word for what
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:24.960]   we're doing.
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:25.960]   But.
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:26.960]   Pack around.
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:27.960]   We call that a Cluge boy.
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:28.960]   A Cluge.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:34.400]   But it's not so difficult that you can't now start getting some of these web videos into
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:35.800]   your Apple TV or your iPod.
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:36.800]   Pretty.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:37.800]   You know what this is dude?
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:38.800]   This is Napster all over again.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:41.680]   I mean this is something where we're doing something that's a little bit novel with it.
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:45.320]   But pretty soon I think you're going to I suspect you're going to see people going
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:49.200]   oh for the love of God yes go watch this copy of the Daily Show on your Apple TV.
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.200]   Please please please.
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:51.200]   Right.
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:52.200]   I hope so.
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:54.160]   I believe the ads in I could deal with that.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:57.960]   Of course the problem is that advertisers know it's very easy to skip the ads in formats
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:58.960]   like that.
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:29:59.960]   They're not.
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:02.400]   Sorry about your broken business model.
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:03.800]   Crying all the way to the Apple TV.
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:04.800]   All right.
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:11.600]   So Pete Townsend is finished composing my personal theme song based on the voice the image the
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:14.280]   sound and the rhythm that I've supplied.
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:15.920]   Would you like to would you all like to hear it?
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:16.920]   I can't wait.
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:22.080]   This is the life house recording that Pete wanted to do.
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.560]   And now he's doing it now that he's out of the way.
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:24.960]   He did you as a collaborator.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:25.960]   Yes.
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:26.960]   Now his dream is complete.
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:27.960]   This is my music.
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:32.160]   This is my music baby.
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:34.760]   Based on my stuff.
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:39.160]   I like it.
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:47.840]   He's podcasting.
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:50.240]   He's he's he's he's he's blubbing.
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:51.240]   He's glittering.
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:52.240]   Oh yeah.
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:53.240]   It's very John Kg, isn't it?
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:54.240]   Well, it's kind of.
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:55.680]   That's kind of like Philip Glass.
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.240]   I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:58.520]   Philip Glass meets my post.
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:01.040]   Yeah, I like it.
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.560]   The Rockford files thing.
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:06.420]   We don't know how long this goes.
[01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:10.500]   Oh, that's probably long enough.
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:13.540]   So basically the message is that we're going to be seeing this as the intro music to a
[01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:15.540]   lot of really, really bad podcast.
[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:16.540]   I think so.
[01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:17.540]   A lot of really lazy people.
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:19.540]   Hey, but Pete Townsend wrote it or something.
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:20.540]   This is going to be like this.
[01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:24.180]   What the San Francisco font was to like Macintosh 1985.
[01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:27.580]   This music generator is going to be the podcasting in 2007.
[01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:28.580]   That ransing.
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:30.980]   Does it give you a MIDI file, Leo?
[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:32.180]   I don't know if it gives me anything.
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:33.180]   It's just playing it.
[01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:37.460]   Because if it gave you a MIDI file, we could rescue those horrible, horrible generic MIDI
[01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:39.420]   sounds that made this MIDI.
[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:41.900]   Oh, yeah, that's a little MIDI.
[01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:45.420]   Captain, we are receiving whale song.
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:48.420]   Oh, all right.
[01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:49.420]   All right.
[01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:50.420]   All right.
[01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:52.740]   And now says, do you enjoy doing this?
[01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:55.140]   Please let us know how you feel about your music.
[01:31:55.140 --> 01:31:57.700]   Can we tell them how we feel about it?
[01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:00.140]   And it should be to go and listen to this next.
[01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:01.140]   I'll go around the room.
[01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:07.140]   Talk about how Pete Townsend's automated journey music has affected our lives.
[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:11.580]   It made me a better person because I love it.
[01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:16.980]   He eats inability to translate the ideas in his head to those around him eventually
[01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:18.700]   led to a nervous breakdown.
[01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:20.300]   It was a disaster.
[01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:24.180]   No one part is actually understood the whole concept of life.
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:28.340]   Well, now I have a six minute MP3 of my own personal tune.
[01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:29.820]   Six minutes.
[01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:31.900]   I've never really been a steakhouse gift card.
[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:33.580]   Whoever can listen to all six minutes.
[01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:34.580]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:35.580]   All six minutes.
[01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:36.580]   Did I say six minutes down?
[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:38.380]   It's 23 minutes, 21 seconds.
[01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:39.380]   Oh my God.
[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:40.700]   It's like a craft work song.
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:42.180]   It just goes without the...
[01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:44.780]   I don't think we get the insurance right here for that long.
[01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:47.860]   Honey, before we get started tonight, why don't you have a glass of wine and I'll play
[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:49.780]   you my 23 minute beams.
[01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:53.980]   Yeah, that won't be a buzz kill.
[01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:55.340]   Try it yourself.
[01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:56.340]   Lifehouse-method.com.
[01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:59.780]   What do you expect from a guy who wrote a song about a blind dance?
[01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:00.780]   A pinball player.
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:01.780]   Hey.
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:05.020]   Leo, did you know that Philip Glass actually wrote a theme song for me?
[01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:06.020]   He did?
[01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:09.220]   Yeah, I don't know if you've ever heard it goes like this.
[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:14.500]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:15.500]   Yeah.
[01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:16.500]   It's good.
[01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:17.500]   Now...
[01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:18.500]   I can't do it in that part.
[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:19.500]   I can't do it in that part.
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:20.500]   Coyana Scottsey.
[01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:21.500]   Must see.
[01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:22.500]   Oh, he's got...
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:23.500]   [Laughter]
[01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:24.500]   Goody.
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:25.500]   You're going to...
[01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:27.860]   [Laughter]
[01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:29.860]   But Power Scottsey was not as good.
[01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:30.860]   This song is not as good.
[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:31.860]   It goes like this.
[01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:32.860]   [Laughter]
[01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:40.300]   He's turned on all cell phones because we want to have something interesting to listen to
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:42.580]   while this movie is in progress.
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:43.580]   All right.
[01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:45.580]   Where did we lose control?
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:46.580]   Oh, dear.
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:51.020]   Maybe just a little bit of a rat hole music theme and we'll wrap this up.
[01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:52.540]   Please listen to good music.
[01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:54.620]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:57.580]   And we apologize for the preceding program.
[01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:58.580]   We'll...
[01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:00.940]   Now return you to control of your life.
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:01.940]   Bye-bye.
[01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:02.940]   [Laughter]
[01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:03.940]   More chips?
[01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:05.940]   Yeah, a couple more.
[01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:09.140]   I want the Ridge kind next time.
[01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:11.740]   Didn't bring enough for everybody.
[01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:13.740]   [Music]
[01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:15.740]   [Music]
[01:34:15.740 --> 01:34:22.740]   [Music]
[01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:25.320]   (upbeat music)
