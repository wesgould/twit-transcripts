[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.720]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly,
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.000]   the show we cover the latest Apple news.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.240]   And there's some news actually on our park.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.240]   But first let me introduce Mr. Alex Lindsey of officehours.global.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.680]   Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.760]   You are, of course at 090.media, if people.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.920]   We watched this morning at 7.30am,
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.440]   the NASA feed of the first five images
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.040]   from the James Webb telescope, which were mind-boggling.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.760]   But during the feed we're going,
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.480]   they should have called Alex.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.240]   (all laughing)
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.560]   They should have called Alex.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.760]   What a mess. It's hard.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.320]   Yeah, it's doing live events,
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.560]   especially live virtual events is really different.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.080]   And that's why we get up every day and talk about it.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.840]   You know, seven days a week is 'cause it's hard to do
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.200]   and it takes a lot of thinking.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.600]   So NASA, 090.media, just a hint.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.440]   (laughing)
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.920]   They have next time.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.960]   They have my number.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.560]   They didn't have like people's microphones weren't on.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.080]   At one point the presenter says,
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.080]   "Somebody else is talking and you can hear a loud and clear
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.480]   saying, I'm hearing other people's voices in my IFP.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.480]   What's going on?"
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.560]   It's like, yes, so are we.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.200]   The hardest part, the hard, in fairness,
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.040]   I don't know what happened in that.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.320]   I didn't see it 'cause I was an office hours.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.680]   But the hardest part with all of those things is clients
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.160]   and that could be, and all the hosts,
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160]   don't think that they should have to show up early
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.760]   to make this up, make sure that this works.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.200]   It is like the number one problem.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.680]   So you set everything down.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.320]   Now what we do to make that different
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.320]   is that we put actors or other people in the crew in there
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.440]   and run the whole thing, pretty almost verbatim
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.040]   before they come in to make sure that all,
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.200]   'cause it's really hard if they don't show.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.400]   - Executives don't want to show, I understand.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.880]   - Presiders should know better.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.880]   But hey, the pictures were great.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.720]   The web worked really well.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.000]   Andy and that goes also here.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.800]   So you were at Boston Public Library this week.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.040]   Nice shot on your Insta.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.480]   - Yes, now that's terrible because it's the other,
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.800]   there was a good change and a bad change
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.320]   that the studio made during the pandemic.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.640]   The good, since the pandemic,
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.200]   the good change was that now I can actually like do
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.000]   like Zoom remotes so I could use my nice microphone
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.680]   and the nice broadband and the nice studio.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.160]   So if I don't want to come in, but I want to come in,
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.840]   that brings in the bad thing, which is,
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.840]   oh, now we're streaming on YouTube,
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.200]   which means that I have like,
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   just like I had to shave before the show,
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.960]   like, damn it, I have to like,
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.480]   I have to look nice for NPR, like, okay.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.680]   - So they're doing video now, which is good.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.520]   We'll get that link before the end of the show.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.960]   - They've always had cameras so that if they want to do,
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.360]   like they have a PBS channel as well.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.240]   So if they want to do TV, but now it's like,
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.520]   oh, by the way, we're live streaming.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.640]   So like, oh, okay, so I guess that now people
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.360]   could actually see that, but I'm saying,
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.760]   yeah, I think that it was in 2009
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.720]   when the EU actually passed this new,
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.480]   like you can actually see me like,
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.480]   I think it was in 2009 when the EU,
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.440]   - That can't be right.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.640]   - So now you know I have a strategically placed computer
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.880]   in front of me that's tilted at exactly the angle
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.040]   that no one can see what I'm doing.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.840]   And I sound smart.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.680]   - There we go.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.040]   - Andy, great to have you now.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.180]   We have a problem, Houston.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.000]   There's this empty seat on the panel
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.880]   because Renee Ritchie, who is, by the way,
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.160]   in the Discord, if you want to wish him luck,
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.760]   club twit members, has passed on.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.280]   No, no, he's moved to a higher plane.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.720]   No, no, wait a minute, that's not right either.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.880]   - We're joking, he's only dead to us.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.120]   (laughing)
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.920]   He is, we still don't know.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.400]   And he says, what did he say?
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.280]   The release hasn't gone out yet.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.080]   But as soon as release goes out,
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.960]   we'll tell you where he is now.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.040]   Of course, he's still at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie,
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.160]   but we thought, well, who could we get
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.760]   with Renee Statcher in the Apple community?
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.720]   He's inside knowledge of what's going on.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.040]   Funny, talented, gray-haired.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.880]   Who could we get?
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.840]   And I'm so thrilled to welcome Jason Snell as a regular.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.680]   - Hello.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.160]   - I've been trying to get you in this show
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.560]   for years, decades.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.960]   Hello, Jason, welcome.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.920]   - It's good to be here.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.200]   It's an honor to succeed Renee.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.720]   I mean, 10 years on a podcast is a pretty big thing to do.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.200]   And I know Renee going way back, we all love Renee.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.760]   It was an honor to be asked to do this.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.840]   - You have a lot of other things that you're doing.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.560]   So I'm honored that you could make,
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.600]   frankly could make some time to be here
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.440]   a couple hours a week.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.000]   So thank you, I really appreciate it.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.840]   - Sure.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.720]   And today I just happened to be in the neighborhood.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.240]   I actually live not that far away from--
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.800]   - 15 minutes, 20.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.800]   - That was about half an hour.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.080]   - Half an hour away, wow.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.120]   - Yeah, quite a commute.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.640]   I work out of my garage.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.720]   So this was, it's like, oh, this is what a commute
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.360]   is like a little bit. - So nice to see you.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.200]   - It's great to be here.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.480]   - You know, Jason's been on our shows
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.360]   since practically the beginning of Twit.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.320]   You have six colors.com.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.000]   In fact, I think when you started with us on Twit,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.920]   you were still at Mac World.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.760]   - Oh yeah, for sure.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.840]   In fact, I remember distinctly being
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.240]   on the first iteration of Mac break.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.400]   - Yeah, the video version.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.240]   - The day the video version.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.080]   - Yeah, with Alex.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.160]   - And the old.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.280]   - Well, and even before that,
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.760]   and it was a regular call for help on tech TV,
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.120]   that's where we met.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.960]   - That's right.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.000]   - I've known you for 20 years.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   - Wow, that is, yeah.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.160]   - Because I was an editor at Mac World,
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.960]   and we were down, that was a long time ago,
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.840]   'cause that we were down on Howard Street,
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.640]   then before we even moved to the second street.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.400]   So that was a long time ago, yeah.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.240]   - That's nice.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.440]   - And of course, we shared a Jerry Day,
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.480]   who I went to kindergarten with,
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.560]   was one of your producers.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.400]   - That's right.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.240]   Back in the day.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.760]   - Jerry now runs the film production
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.400]   for some small town in the--
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.800]   - Up in Twit, County, I think.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.640]   - For Twit, County.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.320]   - Yeah, kind of a slow bit, slow job.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.440]   But you know, when movies need to be made,
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.960]   somebody has to be there to make them.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.840]   - Twit, County is, we both grew up,
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.800]   it's a great way, I didn't know
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   we were gonna be talking about this,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.800]   but it doubles for the old west a lot.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.400]   So a lot of film production up there,
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.760]   if you need to pretend that you're in the old west.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.600]   - Yeah.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.360]   - Well, I'm glad I have a Jerry Day expert on the painting.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.360]   - Yeah, it's good, I know,
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.440]   that was the need to be just a shout out to Jerry.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.440]   He's out there somewhere.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.960]   - It is, so seriously, replacing Renee is tough
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.320]   because he has such great connections and such knowledge,
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.640]   but we couldn't do any better,
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.400]   I don't think ever, I think getting Jason.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.040]   So, of course, you were good friends with Andy
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.320]   and Alex as well.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.200]   - Yeah, I mean, I was like,
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.920]   I often, usually take my afternoon walk
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.040]   like right after the show,
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.200]   and so I just found out about Renee leaving right after the show.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.800]   So I'm taking my hour long walk
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.000]   and unfortunately as usual,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.840]   your thoughts are inside your head,
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.160]   which is a bad, bad thing.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.640]   And I'm thinking, oh, geez, what a surprise,
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.480]   I was stupid at it.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.400]   Thinking about how much I was gonna miss,
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.800]   like for having my nice two hour conversation
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.040]   with my really good friend, like Renee,
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.040]   'cause it's, at least me,
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.840]   just like with all of you guys,
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.200]   I'm energized, it's like, it's very, very pleasant.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.800]   Like, geez, I'm gonna really miss that.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.560]   Then when I find out that Jason
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.600]   is gonna be filling that slot,
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.080]   I mean, Jason and I have been friends for so long,
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.240]   he's probably sticking me saying it,
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.520]   but so long that he's the person who told me
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.560]   how to both face things in HTML.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.360]   That's how long we've known each other.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.400]   - As well. - As well.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.240]   - Bracket.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.080]   - I was a, my first job out of grad school
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.640]   was at Mac user magazine where Andy was a columnist.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.400]   And so I've known Andy since the mid 90s, basically.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.160]   It's a long time now, long time.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.000]   - Wow.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:10.840]   - Wow.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.800]   - He survived, our friendship has survived him
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.840]   being my editor for a very long time.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.520]   So that's, that is being like,
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.520]   that's like the sort of friendships you make in foxholes.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.360]   - So the camera crew has come in
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.560]   to take the official still shots.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.400]   So if you would put your right hand inside your,
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.320]   oh, you're wearing a T-shirt.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.280]   - Yeah.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.680]   I didn't know about the dress.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.880]   - Ah, just teasing, just teasing.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.800]   We did see some amazing images
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.400]   from the James Webb telescope.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.480]   The first five. - Oh my God.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.880]   - Many more will come.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.680]   Rod Pyle joined me this morning at 7.30 AM
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.080]   to take a look at these five.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.200]   Rumor President, what's his name?
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.880]   Oh yeah, Biden.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.480]   Yesterday revealed the first one,
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.200]   but there are five more.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.600]   This is actually an interesting one
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.440]   because the James Webb is not an optical telescope.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.280]   It has sensors in the infrared and other spectra.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:07.280]   And so this is actually a fascinating shot of the spectra.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.360]   And this is the image on the left
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.720]   that President Biden revealed yesterday.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.160]   And that's gonna be very, very important
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.520]   as you look at the spectrum
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.040]   because it tells you something about the composition
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.600]   of the star but also of the exoplanets
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.480]   that they're planning to look at.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.920]   In fact, one of these exoplanets
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.600]   planted at 2,000 degrees centigrade
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.440]   closer than Mercury to its star.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.000]   - It's a hot Jupiter, basically.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.280]   - They come on. - It's water.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.200]   - Yeah, there's water vapor in the atmosphere.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.120]   - But it's really hot.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.200]   - But it's hot water.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.040]   It's really hot. - Yeah, it's really hot.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.800]   - Hot water. - Really hot water.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.680]   - But the incredible thing is like when you see the,
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.760]   you see this really fake looking picture
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.560]   that looks like you're,
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.080]   when you go to like the Museum of Science
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.880]   and the gift shop, you can get one of those sport shirts.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.280]   It has just like lots of little pictures of galaxies in it.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.240]   Like that's how fake this thing looks.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.360]   And then when you think about,
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.120]   all of that is just within the field of view of the sky
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.720]   that is equivalent of a grain of rice
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.000]   who held up at arms level.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.440]   It's like, oh my God, never gonna learn so much.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.280]   - Interesting piece.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.200]   This is the President Biden's image from yesterday.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.760]   These galaxies look smeared.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.920]   That's because of the lensing,
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.960]   of the gravitational field.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.320]   - Of the foreground galaxy cluster.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.160]   - They're being created.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.480]   - They're creating a lens and you can see it.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.560]   You can really see that circular distortion.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.760]   - It's all from Einstein basically predicting that,
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.600]   the curving of light.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.320]   - It also magnifies these galaxies.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.000]   So we actually get a better image of them.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.920]   Thank you to the star in front.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.720]   This is one of the most dramatic images.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.080]   Is this the Hubble version of the image?
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.560]   This is the web version of the image.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.760]   - They have a lot of before and afters,
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.440]   which says, okay, that's why this thing needed this.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.800]   - Yeah, that's actually, I don't know if this is a Hubble image
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.520]   or just another, I think it's another color of the,
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.360]   it is the Hubble.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.240]   Okay, it's not the Hubble.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.560]   - JWST, yeah.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.840]   - This is an amazing image of,
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.800]   and I apologize for those of you listening,
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.520]   but they have posted this of course on the NASA website
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.120]   and there is a James Webb account on Flickr,
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.280]   which is where I'm getting these high res images from,
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.560]   and highly recommend it.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.480]   They're not quite 4K,
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.320]   but they're close to 4K,
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.800]   certainly suitable for your desktop wallpaper.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.240]   John, tell me the name of this, this galaxy.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.440]   - This is a Nebula, is that the Karina Nebula?
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.440]   - Yeah, Karina Nebula.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.320]   - Which is the famous Karina Nebula and the Eagle Nebula.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.560]   This is the famous Hubble shots
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.840]   where you're looking at a stellar nursery essentially,
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.200]   where you've got these clouds of gas
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.720]   and their stars inside them.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.960]   And then with the infrared,
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.880]   you can actually look inside through the dust
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.160]   and see the little baby stars
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.880]   that are sort of like emerging from here.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.720]   - Is that amazing?
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.160]   - And the other thing that was mind blowing about this image,
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.200]   you see these images and you think,
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.680]   oh, that's nice, it's like a little cloud,
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.960]   but my understanding is the height of that cloud,
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.360]   so-called cloud, it's about seven light years.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.200]   - Sure.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.040]   - So these are-- - 'Cause these are stars.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:58.880]   - These are stars.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.920]   - These are thoughts, that's the size of the sun.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.280]   So yeah, it gives you some idea.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.280]   - So that's the distance, you know,
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.280]   essentially twice the distance between Earth
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.120]   and the nearest star outside our sun.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.720]   And that's how big this cloud is.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.000]   - And above the cloud are the newest baby stars.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.960]   In fact, they're pushing the cloud away,
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.840]   which is fascinating.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.120]   - They go out on the main sequence
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.040]   and they start up their solar wind
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.000]   and they blow the gas away. - They blow the gases away.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   This is another one of the famous quintile,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.840]   or actually they're five galaxies here,
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.640]   one, two, three, four, five.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.520]   You may remember from, it's a wonderful life,
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.440]   this is where angels get their wings.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.000]   I'm not kidding, you think I'm kidding, I'm not kidding.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:42.840]   - No, no, no.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.680]   (laughing)
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.280]   - Solid cultural reference.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.280]   - Amazing shots.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.360]   This is also one of my favorites here
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.480]   of another nebula, just dramatic.
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.600]   - Right, and that's a planetary nebula,
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.480]   so that's a star that has ended its life.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.080]   Or in this case, a binary, it turns out
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.120]   they actually in the infrared,
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.160]   they resolve the two stars at the center, which is amazing.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.560]   One of the thing you'll notice in all these shots
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.720]   when you look at them is there are,
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.040]   like in that shot, off to the left,
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.280]   there's an almost edge-on galaxy
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.320]   in the sort of upper left quadrant on the edge, yeah.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.920]   And that is a case where JWST
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:25.560]   is so powerful and can see so far in the infrared
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.600]   that you have this thing that, you know,
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.000]   the Hubble did the deep field where they took the shot
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.160]   of empty space and found all those galaxies.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.000]   The new reality with the JWST is that every shot
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.240]   is gonna have these little background galaxies
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.960]   because it's so finely attuned.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.360]   So even if they're looking nearby,
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.440]   there are also gonna be hundreds of galaxies
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.000]   in the background everywhere you look.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.720]   - And by the way, here's a little thing
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.040]   you probably don't know about the James Webb Space Telescope,
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.400]   but when you click the magnifying glass
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.320]   on the image show this, John,
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.720]   because you might be interested,
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.160]   it says, "Woe there, Tiger, this photo is already
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.640]   "at maximum size."
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.800]   So that's just how good that's how good that telescope.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.200]   - Mary Jane Watson is running the public relations office.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.720]   (both laughing)
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.240]   Anyway, really, really exciting day.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.880]   We'll put it up on our Twitter news feed
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.080]   if you didn't see it, if you can watch our feed,
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:17.080]   which is probably maybe a little less stuttery than the next.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.360]   (both laughing)
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.480]   - I just wanna ask Alex one question.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.240]   Like, what camera would you use
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.080]   that would have been better
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.880]   than the James Webb Telescope for this event?
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.240]   - For the event or for the telescope?
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.320]   - No, for the telescope.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.400]   I'm sure you've got some ideas.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.840]   - Well, I think that there's a new area out
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.960]   that I think could be really good.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.920]   We could put it out there and it would have a big zoom lens
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.000]   and we'd see what we would get.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   But it's really amazing to just see the incredible,
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.920]   incredible resolution.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.440]   And I think that we know that for the next decade,
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.040]   we're gonna be able to see a lot more.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:58.160]   - 50 gigabytes, a little more than 50 gigabytes a day,
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.120]   a maximum bandwidth of 28 megabits.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.280]   So there is a lot of data coming back
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.600]   from that telescope every single day.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.120]   - Yeah, this is why I'm way more excited
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.040]   about spacecraft that we're sending out
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.960]   just to be observatories than I really am
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.080]   about permanent installations on the Moon or on Mars,
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.560]   because this just gives us so much hard science,
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.200]   so much more bang for the buck
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.680]   when we do not have to sustain human life.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.080]   All the expense, all the size,
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.160]   all the kinds of cause it comes with human space travel.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.480]   It's important for us to learn how to live in space
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.400]   because that's such basic science
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.240]   that we don't have much of a grip on.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.920]   But the idea that the Hubble was in such low orbit
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.600]   around the Earth that you could actually send people
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.680]   out to service it.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.840]   This is so far out that part of the engineering
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.800]   was look, we are never ever going to be able
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.320]   to send anything out to fix anything on this thing.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.560]   This has to be absolutely right.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.560]   And oh my goodness, those first images,
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.720]   the thoughts that it inspires,
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.160]   the sense of perspective,
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.720]   and that it inspires just in normal people like you and me,
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.640]   as opposed to the scientists who are actually getting value
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.920]   from this, my goodness, what value for money?
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.080]   All right, so there, and I'm glad to see
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.960]   that Jason Snell's a space nerd.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.160]   One more element.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.000]   Two men.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.800]   Looking at to the show.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.640]   We do it.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.200]   Can he, Jason on the show was a good thing already?
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.040]   I think.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.280]   Wait a minute, do we have a visitor from another planet?
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.040]   Is that Henry or Mizzie?
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.080]   Henry is in the studio.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.560]   My favorite alien, why don't you bring him in
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.840]   just real quickly so we can see.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:41.600]   Henry has those very typical bulgy eyes of all aliens.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.720]   And there he is.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.120]   Yeah, look at Micah's little chihuahua.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.720]   Hello, Henry.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.760]   I've been trying to get Micah to bring the dogs in forever.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:52.840]   This is the first time.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.840]   Yeah, this is, oh wait, I'll just scoot him in.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.200]   Hey, no, no, boy.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.480]   Yeah, this is the first time.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.400]   What planet is he from again?
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.240]   It's a planet love.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.240]   Yes, exactly.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.640]   The love planet.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.480]   Thank you, Micah.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.440]   All right, this feels like a family today.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.280]   It's great.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.200]   It's really fun to have everybody in here.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.840]   I see, I spy when my little I, Jason's running an iPad Pro.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.240]   Is that the 11 or the 12?
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.200]   It's the 12.9.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.600]   And I see on it something a little different.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.080]   You've got winners.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.400]   Are you running the public beta?
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.240]   I am.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.200]   Of iPad and the public beta of iPadOS,
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.640]   which just came out.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.480]   Today's the day.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.640]   Yesterday, I think.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.880]   Would you, so we, you now public beta is a Ventura.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.280]   iPadOS 16, iOS 16.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.520]   I think there might even be a watch in TV about beta.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.520]   I thought too.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.960]   The question's going to be, should people run it or not?
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.000]   You know, I wasn't going to do the dev beta.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.440]   How stable is that?
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.440]   It's OK.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.360]   There are, it's a beta.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.200]   There are bugs.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:00.240]   So if you want to get the new stuff, you've got to try it out.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.240]   It's usable.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.760]   You need to have a reason, right?
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.400]   You need to really have a reason to--
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.200]   Besides, like, I really want it.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.200]   Well, with iPads and iPhones, it's hard to roll back.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.080]   So you're really on a Mac, you can install it on another partition.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.080]   And you're OK with it.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.000]   But on an iPad, you're kind of committing.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.280]   And I'd say if you've got an M1 iPad, stage manager
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.280]   might be worth it.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.720]   It's still a work in progress.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.720]   I'm watching these windows.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.240]   You go back and forth between these windows.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.320]   It's like a computer.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.960]   Yeah, it's almost like it's a computer.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.960]   Isn't that weird?
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.480]   But it's like--
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:31.980]   You do.
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.480]   You can touch.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.160]   But it's still a work in progress.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.440]   Like, literally with the latest beta,
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.480]   they added Command W to close a window,
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.920]   which they did not have before.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.960]   It's like, you get the sense with the iPad stuff
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.120]   that they built this stage manager thing.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.000]   And on the Mac, it works really well
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.880]   because the Mac has this whole history of window management.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.920]   And then you see it on the iPad.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.920]   And you're like, oh, the iPad has literally no windowing
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.400]   infrastructure at all.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.240]   And they're building it on the fly this summer, apparently.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.600]   So Command W came in.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.560]   That's like that would be one of the first things you would think.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.440]   But here we are.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.320]   And no big crashes, no blue screens of death.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.160]   I mean, I've had a crash while I was sitting here.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.320]   But it generally crashes back to the lock screen.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.320]   And then you open it back up.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.520]   It's a screenboard crash, kind of.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.520]   Yeah, it's been OK so far.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.080]   But again, if it's your phone that you need every day
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.560]   to live your life and you want to see those new lock screens,
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.200]   I mean, balance those two things because it's
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.600]   going to be annoying for a few months.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.120]   Tell the truth, though.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.360]   You put it on your phone, too, didn't you?
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.360]   It's not on my regular phones.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.040]   It's in my pocket.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:29.880]   Brave man.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.480]   Not brave man.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:31.960]   Coward.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.160]   Coward.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:34.880]   How about you, Andy?
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.680]   Any public betas in your life?
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:43.360]   I have it on-- I don't have it on my M1 MacBook iPad Pro.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.720]   I have it on my older one.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.240]   And so you don't get stage manager in that, then, do you?
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.560]   Yeah, unfortunately no.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.840]   Unfortunately, I only have one M1 iPad.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:57.480]   And it is, as Jason says, it's a production thing.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.360]   If I'm kind of hosed, if I don't have it, the same thing.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.000]   I do have the--
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.480]   I was 16 on my iPhone because my main phone is an Android.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.800]   So if I can't call an Uber, if I can't do banking on my iPhone,
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.320]   that's not a big deal.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.280]   But yeah, I can't.
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.840]   I've been obviously watching as many other videos of people.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.440]   Now that it's not developer mode and people
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.560]   are allowed to really talk about it and, quote,
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.160]   review it, unquote, I'm seeing not just the demos
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.960]   of stage manager, but you get to see people actually trying
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.640]   to make sense of it as it's in front of them.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.760]   And oh my goodness, I cannot wait for this.
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.320]   This is such a trans--
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.200]   It really is feeling like between the iPhone and the iPad,
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.600]   iOS 16 is going to be the most transformative set of updates
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.640]   we've had in quite a while.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.800]   Alex, will you use any of these betas?
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.960]   I probably won't, to be honest, I'm just too busy there.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.200]   I mean, I think I'll just wait for a little while, maybe
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.360]   until January to test it.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.360]   January.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.280]   I jumped in the fall.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.120]   I jumped in Monterey really fast.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.560]   Like I was like, oh, this is going to be great.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.240]   And the fall was pretty rough for me.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.960]   And so I feel like I was like, ah, there's
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.880]   just a lot of odd things that happened.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.280]   And so I think I'm just going to stick to it,
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.800]   just let all of you take the front line.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.680]   I'm going to sit back and have some coffee.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.840]   So just tell me how it goes.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.360]   I mean, right now I can't even get my AirPods to--
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.120]   my AirPods, they wouldn't connect, so I reset them.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.360]   And now they just constantly tell me
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.240]   that somebody else's AirPods are near my phone.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.400]   Oh, I hate that.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.360]   That's what happens.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.200]   I can't get it to-- so I'm like, if I can't get that to work,
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.840]   I think I'm going to stay out.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.640]   Jason has a long review at sixcolors.com of Ventura.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.040]   Yeah, the public beta for MECO is Ventura.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.440]   You took no time to do that.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:39.840]   You can't.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.440]   You must kind of flip it earlier.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.080]   And I mean, there are other reviews
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.920]   on the web of this public beta that are five times as long.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.920]   But I focused on the two features
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.560]   that I think are the most interesting.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:53.160]   So stage manager and continuity camera, which I think
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.080]   are the-- I mean, I'd say shared photo library stuff
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:56.920]   is also interesting.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.920]   It's not just a MEC feature.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.360]   And it also just came out last week
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.320]   in the last developer beta.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.200]   So I need to spend more time with it.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.240]   But like continuity camera, you're
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.920]   scrolling through my image samples
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.560]   that I took in the worst possible lighting conditions.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.160]   And the bottom line is, yeah, it turns out the iPhone camera,
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.520]   it's really good.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.320]   And also, when you turn on center stage in continuity camera,
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.000]   it goes to that iPhone's ultra wide.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.400]   And you get exactly what you get on center stage
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:27.360]   on any device, which is a cropped ultra wide camera
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.280]   that isn't that great.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.560]   And it's noisy, and it doesn't handle light that well.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.280]   So turn it off.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.240]   But it auto pans.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:36.280]   But if you turn it off, it uses the main camera on the iPhone,
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.360]   which is glorious.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.200]   It's such a good camera.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.000]   So that's the--
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.640]   Also center stage-- and I know Alex has mentioned this many times.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.720]   It centers your head in the middle of the screen.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.720]   It doesn't do it right.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.200]   It's the wrong place.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.080]   There's no professional camera operator
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.520]   who would look at center stage behavior
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.160]   and think that they model proper behavior.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.640]   And because I'm so used to my head being the preferred,
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.840]   every time I use center stage, I'm like trying to get up
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.520]   on top of the--
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.600]   I mean, in fairness--
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.600]   If you're talking about--
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.800]   It pans up, and you can never get there.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.400]   In fairness, it looks really good
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.120]   if you're putting it on a giant screen.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.560]   So at 30 feet wide and x amount of feet high,
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.880]   it actually looks pretty good in that frame,
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.360]   but not in small screens.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.520]   So this morning, when we did--
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.360]   I was at home when we did-- because it was 7.30 freaking
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.080]   in the morning when we did the NASA thing.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.640]   And I used camo with my eye frame, which--
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.080]   It's really been worth--
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:28.600]   Fantastic.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.480]   But it's not free.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.840]   It's a-- you have to pay for it.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.480]   It's like $40 a year or so.
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.160]   But it does work really well, and I love it.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:39.160]   And I've also used Ecam, which does the same thing.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.520]   How does-- are they sure locking camo?
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.400]   It's the typical story where there
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.920]   are things that Apple's never going to implement as features.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.240]   I mean, I hope they do, and I took them to task,
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.560]   and I will again, about this, that there
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.560]   are no webcam settings to speak of in Mac OS,
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.400]   and there really should be.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.120]   Camo lets you do things like crop the image,
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.720]   and choose which part of the image you want.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.280]   So if you need it to be a little bit tighter, you can do that.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.520]   It lets you adjust the white balance, and the focus,
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.160]   and all these things.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.520]   And Apple's like, no, no, no.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.880]   We'll handle all of that, which is great when it works.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.440]   It doesn't work.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.640]   I'm going to be honest.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.360]   It's frustrating.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.440]   And maybe because it's low light,
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.520]   and you have a big window behind you,
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.200]   but these images aren't--
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.680]   I mean, the middle image is pretty good.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.120]   Well, that's the thing is I was trying to do something very
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.520]   bad and see what it would look like.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.960]   And the answer is that the regular iPhone camera managed it.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.560]   This is the MacBook Pro camera, which is god awful.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.880]   Yeah, that's the M2.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.920]   So it's a 720p camera, and it's really poor.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.280]   See how much better the iPhone cameras.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.920]   And then this is a wide angle, so you're using center stage.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.800]   But Camo-- I mean, the other difference-- because Camo
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.120]   is great in that it gives you settings-- the advantage Apple
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.720]   has the home field advantage of being the platform owner--
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.120]   is Camo, you've got to open your iPhone.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.680]   You've got to launch the Camo app.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.680]   You've got to make sure you don't touch in the wrong place
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.760]   and quit the Camo app, and then get it in its right place,
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.920]   and then launch the Camo app on your Mac.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.300]   And just to be clear about how this continuity camera stuff
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.760]   works is if your iPhone is logged into your Apple ID
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.320]   and your iPhone is near your Mac that's logged in with your Apple
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.480]   ID, it shows up as a camera.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.720]   You don't even have to launch the camera?
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.280]   You don't have to wake it up.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.800]   You don't have to launch any apps.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.280]   Oh, that is nice.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.640]   And if you mount it where it's perpendicular
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.760]   to your surface of your desk, where it's on its side,
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.560]   and the sensors in the iPhone sense
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.200]   that you're not holding it in your hand,
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.200]   but it's actually laying somewhere above your display
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.800]   or whatever, it automatically switches your Mac's default camera
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.400]   to it because it realizes that it's been placed in basically
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.680]   webcam mode.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.600]   So there's no interface to that.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.320]   That's nice.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.680]   And that's something that-- only Apple-- I hate to say this this way,
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.640]   but it's a feature that the platform owner really can implement,
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.640]   and it would be very hard for any third party to approach.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.480]   And that's where Apple's got it over Camo.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.960]   But then Camo's got all the FIDLY settings, which are great.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.920]   And that's why I think there'll still be a place for something like Camo.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:58.040]   So did you have to put iOS 16 on your phone to this?
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.840]   Yeah, you've got to have both.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:00.560]   OK.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.600]   Go ahead, Dallas.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.680]   And I think that that's the real push anytime a platform owner does
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.960]   something is to figure out what makes you different.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.000]   So Camo has its own cropping and control.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.160]   There's another app that I use called Shoot,
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.120]   which you can actually do a demonstration over your video
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.480]   just by drawing on it.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.560]   It actually has a framer that we use inside of Office Hours.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.080]   The developer put into Shoot.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.120]   So it frames your head properly.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.680]   You can see it on the phone.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.000]   So there's a lot of things that people
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   can find different ways to make them different, but they have to.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.960]   They can't, at this point, just being a camera for the computer
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.760]   is no longer going to be enough.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.640]   And then you also, Jason, you show the desk view, which
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.840]   is this weird thing.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.160]   And I think you'd have to have--
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.040]   what kind of camera would you have to be using?
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.920]   Is it not the camera on the laptop?
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.600]   It has to be--
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.600]   No, it uses the iPhone camera.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.240]   It uses the iPhone camera.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.080]   This is the feature of the iPhone camera ultra wide.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:00.920]   And the ultra wide capture captures such an enormous span
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.360]   that it can see what's in front of you theoretically.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:04.880]   So like--
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.520]   It's San Diego.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.280]   So we can see my UCSD coaster, which is upside down,
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.600]   but the image is right set up.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.120]   The idea is to share what's on your desk.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.440]   There are a lot of problems with this.
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.720]   On a laptop, what it means is you
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.920]   need to push the laptop so far back
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.560]   that there's space in front of the laptop in which for you
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.960]   to place things, at which point you're reaching way out
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.000]   to an unnatural position to reach your laptop.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.120]   But there are cases where that could be useful.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.080]   And it's implemented, Apple implemented it as an app,
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.080]   because they know that you're probably
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.200]   going to use this with something like Zoom.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.480]   And you're going to want to use it in the context of a--
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.200]   essentially a screen share, except you're
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.000]   sharing physical space in front of your computer.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.040]   But Alex does all the time with his fancy fancy setup.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:43.520]   Sure.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.760]   I've got a camera mounted on my ceiling to do this.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:51.560]   And of course, on iOS today, Mike is always doing that.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.560]   And I think Rosemary is also doing it.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.680]   But I think they have separate cameras pointing it there.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.720]   Yeah, this is literally-- if you're using center stage,
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.800]   and you're using desk view, it's just
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.440]   using crops of the same ultra wide camera
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.400]   and using it in different ways.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.960]   The quality isn't great, but it's not bad.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.640]   It's not bad.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:08.960]   I think the issue is really--
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.960]   It's not bad.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.360]   The issue is really that you--
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.200]   this isn't going to be a thing you do accidentally.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.200]   You're going to have to push your laptop way back
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.920]   in order to make a stage for it.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.000]   Or if you're on a desktop, you're
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.960]   going to need to push your desktop back
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.720]   enough that there's space right in front.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.200]   It's no mistake that Apple demoed this with an iMac
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.280]   instead of with a laptop, because it actually kind of makes
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.440]   more sense in that context because you have a desk
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.760]   in front of the computer.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.800]   And yeah.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.360]   And considering how it must be zooming in quite a bit
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.720]   on the wide angle, that's not bad.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.920]   It looks pretty good when you consider how terribly de distorted
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.600]   and scaled it must be.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.040]   Is your daughter at UCSD?
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.200]   No, I went to UCSD.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:47.720]   You went to UCSD.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.560]   I've got the coaster.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.000]   You can't prove it.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.480]   I bought one.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:50.960]   Now is it--
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.760]   Is that if it's a ploma?
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.720]   They give you a coaster?
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.400]   That seems appropriate.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.520]   I was just there on the campus.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.400]   You go into university--
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.400]   A beer coaster is a coaster.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.520]   There's merch.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.480]   You make your choice.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.480]   Choose your merch.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.880]   I'm just teasing you.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.520]   Just teasing you.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.280]   Where have your kids decided to go, by the way?
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.720]   Both my kids are now ducks.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.400]   They're both going to go--
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:08.920]   The ducks.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.520]   My daughter's already at University of Oregon,
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.160]   and my son is going this ball.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.400]   So more trips, more car trips to Eugene.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.320]   At least you go to one place instead of two.
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.080]   So that's not that.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.240]   That's true, and I know all the places to stay and stuff.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.440]   So that's nice.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.640]   All right.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.120]   How do you get the beta?
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.040]   Do you have to have a developer account to do this?
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:28.320]   Nope.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.400]   Anybody can go?
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.560]   Public is public.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:31.560]   Public is public.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.800]   You sign up, and you download a profile or an installer,
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.560]   and you're off to the races.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.520]   So you go to beta.apple.com.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.920]   You have to have an Apple account,
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.800]   but of course you have one, right?
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.000]   And look at this.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.640]   You can put it on iOS, iPadOS, MacOS, TVOS, watchOS,
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.200]   even HomePod.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.480]   Is there a public beta of HomePod software 16?
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.120]   I guess there is.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.360]   I might put my HomePods on 16.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.520]   Why not?
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.000]   Why should I?
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.920]   What's the benefit, though?
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:03.520]   What's the benefit, though?
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:03.920]   Not clear on that.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.200]   It's not clear.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.080]   But good for Apple.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.920]   They have to do this.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.280]   So you go to beta.apple.com.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.720]   You sign in with your Apple ID.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.600]   Apple knows what devices you have.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.120]   Attached to that ID.
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.160]   Then you go to the various devices.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.080]   You open the settings, and you look for software updates.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.920]   And you'll have to-- on some of these devices,
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.720]   say, get beta updates, like the TVOS.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.960]   You'll have to say get beta updates.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.120]   And then you'll have it.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.920]   On an update on a device like HomePod
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.120]   is usually about compatibility with the iOS.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.080]   Oh, of course.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.040]   That makes sense.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.760]   It's possible it'll stop working unless you update it.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.280]   It's not going to change everything to Louis premium music
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.240]   or anything like that.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.480]   Probably not.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:40.920]   But you never--
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.960]   We couldn't be bad.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.840]   I'm not saying that's a bad thing.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.040]   And you should know also if you rely on continuity features
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:50.720]   like the extended display modes and things like that
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.920]   that require an iPad and a Mac.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.640]   If one of them's on the beta and one of them's
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:58.680]   on the current version, all that stuff can break.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.320]   So you can't--
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.240]   So you're committed.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.960]   If you go with one, go with all.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.680]   Probably.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.240]   As they say, you and I--
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.480]   My universal control setup is broken.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.280]   So it goes one.
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.440]   One goes one.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.680]   That's why it goes with all.
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:11.680]   Sure.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.880]   But that's kind of OK because one of the basic--
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.320]   It's the Q and N on public beta.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.200]   It's Apple on on.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.120]   Apple on on.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.320]   One of the basic features I think of iOS 16
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.480]   is that you have all of these cross device features
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.960]   so that it kind of makes sense to update them all months
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.040]   because otherwise you're not kind of getting--
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.720]   if you're getting all the pain of a beta,
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.960]   you should get all the joy of a beta.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:34.480]   And I think cross platform use is going to be one of the joys.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.080]   Yeah, I think that's one of the big selling points, isn't it?
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.800]   Not just using your phone as a camera,
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.200]   but all sorts of continuity features and handoff
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.520]   features and all that stuff.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.720]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:51.080]   Jason Snell survived his first segment.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.160]   He didn't even break a sweat.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.880]   Gonna take a knee, take a breath.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.840]   Awesome.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.600]   Awesome.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:01.560]   Our show today brought to you by Collide, K-O-L-I-D-E.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:08.200]   Love this idea because I kind of have to wear two hats
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.440]   at the company.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:14.840]   I am an employee and I'm a user, but I also am in management.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.560]   And so it's my interest to keep everybody secure and safe.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.520]   I think a lot of times, certainly in the old days,
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:25.600]   if you had users in your company and IT
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.240]   basically would lock it down, right?
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:31.840]   They'd use MDM, mobile device management, lock it down.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.840]   And some companies that go so far as to put crazy glue
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.800]   in the USB ports and stuff because they didn't trust users.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.000]   But there's a problem with that kind of thinking,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.360]   which is that users know you don't trust them.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.920]   They get frustrated by the limitations.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.880]   They want to use devices like they use their home devices.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.400]   And now they're kind of adversarial.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.400]   They decide, I'm going to do it my way.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.120]   Worst case scenario, they instead of the using the company
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.520]   provided laptop or phone, they start using their own.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.080]   And that's when the nightmare begins.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:11.080]   Collide has a different kind of attitude about all this.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.920]   Collide is an endpoint security system
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.080]   built around honest security.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.360]   I love that phrase, honest security.
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.960]   Their philosophy is employees aren't your biggest security
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.440]   risk.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.360]   They're your allies.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.520]   Don't make adversaries out of them.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.320]   Your relationship with them should
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.800]   be based on transparency and informed consent.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.520]   I can tell you from real experience, that does work.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.880]   I know a lot of you going, no, I can't trust them.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.600]   I can't.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.360]   No, you can.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.360]   And frankly, especially if you've got engineers and developers,
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:44.360]   they want to be able to use their machines
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.600]   as they would use their home machines, which
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.480]   means they end up working on their personal devices.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.520]   And then they bring that personal device in to work.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.960]   And disaster ensues.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.760]   Collide works with your employees via Slack.
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.280]   Now you have to be a Slack house to do this.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.040]   I know many of you are.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.320]   We are.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.400]   What's so cool is it notifies your employees
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:06.720]   of security issues via Slack.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.520]   It educates them on what's going on, why it's important,
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.600]   and then gives them step-by-step instructions
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.600]   on how to fix the problem themselves.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.960]   That offloads your IT department,
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:21.080]   but also enrolls your employees as allies in this fight.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.120]   It starts, frankly, when you start with Collide,
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.160]   by them putting the Collide agent on their device.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.400]   It explains, it walks, it gives them a message and Slack,
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.000]   saying, hey, we're just starting this.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.120]   We're going to use Collide.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:31.840]   Help us install it.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.360]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.000]   It's so smart.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.440]   For IT and security teams, Collide
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.480]   provides the right level of visibility from--
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.480]   it's, by the way, Mac, Windows, and Linux.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:46.040]   It addresses high-risk issues that actually can't be solved
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.240]   through brute force or automation.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.320]   Go to the Collide website.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.880]   You can actually see the messages Collide will send via Slack.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.040]   And you can see how, I think, what a brilliant way--
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.560]   it's honest security.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.720]   What's more, it protects your employees' privacy.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.640]   And we know how much people care about privacy these days.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.120]   With Collide, your end users can see exactly why
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.640]   and how every piece of data is being collected.
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:15.040]   There is, literally, in Collide, a user privacy center.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.120]   Plus, their source code is open.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.680]   It's, yeah, it's open source so they
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.520]   can see the open source code base.
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.320]   They can know exactly what's going on,
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.120]   especially for engineers and developers.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.920]   This becomes very, very important.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.400]   And we know, we want end users to pick up the Slack,
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.600]   as it were.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.000]   You can meet your security goals.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.040]   You can, without compromising your values.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:36.880]   It's open.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.600]   It's honest.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.360]   And frankly, it's not top-down.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.120]   It's not top-down.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.760]   It makes an ally of your users.
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:50.400]   Visit collide.com/macbreak and get started.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:55.000]   Free trial for you, k-o-l-i-d-e.com/macbreak.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:55.920]   They'll also hook you up.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.200]   If you follow that address, they'll
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.640]   hook you up with a goodie bag just
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.600]   for activating that free trial.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.720]   I have my collide stickers on my laptop,
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:09.360]   makalad t-shirt that's k-o-l-i-d-e.com/macbreak.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.840]   I am so happy to have these guys on our air
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.520]   because I think this is the right way to do it.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.960]   And if you're a Slack, a shop, you should absolutely give it
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:19.440]   a try.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.000]   k-o-l-i-d-e.com, collide.com.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.720]   And make sure you do the slash-macbreak
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.280]   so you get the goodies.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.360]   But you also let them know you saw it here.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.160]   We like that.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.160]   That's good for us.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.920]   [CHUCKLES]
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.280]   OK.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.720]   Moving right along.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:40.160]   That was the big story, of course, the public betas.
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.040]   Big article in the information this week.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.400]   And I know information is pay walled.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.120]   A lot of you-- I pay just so I can read these stories.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.040]   They have very good inside sources.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:52.960]   Wayne Ma interviewed, I guess, has a lot of sources.
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.920]   Wrote a very interesting piece, Inside Apple's eight-year
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.600]   struggle to build a self-driving car.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.440]   Just to give you an idea of where we're going here,
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:08.560]   sub-head meaningless demos, false hopes, and map handicaps.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.960]   Interviews with 20 people who have worked on Apple's self-driving
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.920]   car project shed new light on its troubled effort
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.760]   to build a car that can drive itself almost anywhere
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.960]   in the world.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:26.080]   Now, according to Trip Mickle in his book, which I know you read,
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:26.800]   you didn't read it?
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.360]   No, I didn't read it.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.280]   Oh, I'll give you my copy.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:29.680]   OK.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.360]   It's worth reading.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.840]   It's stories we all know.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.880]   But some of the stuff from inside we didn't know--
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:40.920]   for instance, according to Mickle's book, after Steve,
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.440]   the whole idea of the car project did not come from the top
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.960]   down, it would come from Tim Cook.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.400]   But came from employees who said,
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.000]   we are mad that we're not involved in this car business,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.720]   and we're going to leave for Tesla
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.760]   because we want to work on self-driving cars.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:58.000]   And Tim Cook was basically blackmailed into doing this.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.960]   Once you know that, a lot of this makes more sense.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.560]   You know, and it also makes me really
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:11.200]   wonder how serious management is about making this a business.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.160]   What, Andy?
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.480]   It's really shocking the way that this story
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.560]   has evolved since the first leak from Wall Street Journal
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.360]   years ago.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.840]   Because if you'll remember, one of the things
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.560]   that got all of us so excited about this
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:27.080]   was that whatever the pitch deck for this project was,
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:30.080]   when they showed it to people inside the auto industry who
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.400]   were top level people, top level executives,
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.120]   with huge careers at the best makers,
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:40.280]   they were getting these people to quit GM, quit BMW,
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.080]   and go work on this project at Apple.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.600]   It really did sound like something that was a priority,
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.160]   that they had a focus in mind.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.960]   And now here we are in 2021 and 2022,
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.720]   where almost every two months we keep hearing about
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.360]   a critical member of the team has left
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.880]   and was snapped up by a competitor.
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:01.960]   You don't let people leave if they're close to something
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.920]   that you're really, really invested in.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.480]   So I think this is a really good insight into,
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.560]   is this one of Apple's other bets?
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.920]   If Apple listed projects the way that Google does,
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.200]   that this is something that we're just sort of
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.560]   working out, we have enough resources,
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.320]   we can see if this is a thing.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.600]   It's kind of a really, it doesn't look like,
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:19.440]   it's kind of a blue shot.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.280]   It's kind of a blue shot.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:23.040]   And you know, X project, Cornet kind of instead of it.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.320]   The thing is, is that what they're trying to do,
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.520]   what everybody's trying to do is really hard.
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.920]   You know, it's hard to do it because the roads are a mess
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.400]   and there's people on them and there's things
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.360]   that they'll go across and there's construction.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.200]   And so everybody is, I mean, different people
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.520]   are at different level of where they're at,
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.040]   based on what they started with
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.200]   and what the requirements they've decided are okay.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.080]   But I think Apple's is very high,
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.240]   and what their expectations are.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.400]   And I think that it is a,
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.560]   it's a very, very difficult thing,
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.640]   which is what you take on as a big company,
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.080]   if you've got the cash to do it,
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.680]   because the chances of getting a lot of competition,
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:01.600]   if you take on the ARVR market, the car market,
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.400]   some of these are very hard to unwrap.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.520]   And if you get there,
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:07.000]   there won't be a lot of people around you to compete.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.560]   - The biggest takeaway from the story is that,
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.920]   that software problems have been the biggest factor
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.880]   in the programs struggles.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.440]   They mentioned, when you're talking about departures,
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.840]   Andy, they mentioned the departure of Ian Goodfellow,
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.000]   who is a very renowned machine learning scientist
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.280]   and a big get for the car project.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.600]   He had been leading, according to Wayne Ma,
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:28.640]   writing and the information,
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.680]   an effort to infuse deep learning
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.640]   into Apple's self-driving software.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:36.280]   The self-driving software did well on highways,
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.520]   but failed miserably,
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.160]   was running up on curbs and stuff
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.760]   on the city streets of Sunnyville.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.640]   Goodfellow's key role within Titan
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.120]   and the team's use of his,
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.440]   of his, underscore his,
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.040]   machine learning models to improve software
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.880]   hasn't been previously reported.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:56.760]   And Ma is saying that his departure actually leaves a big hole.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.040]   I mean, there are a lot of people,
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.320]   it's been a revolving door,
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.040]   a lot of people have left,
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:04.320]   but you figure Apple can, you know,
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.040]   get people to replace those people.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.400]   But there's some like Ian Goodfellow,
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.040]   who are such, at such a high level,
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.880]   there aren't a lot of people like him.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:15.200]   - Tesla, obviously, because Elon Musk is obsessed with it,
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.720]   Tesla has been trying this a very long time,
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.280]   and Google's been trying this a very long time.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.600]   And I think what we have to admit is that
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.680]   this is a very, very, very hard problem,
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.440]   the self-driving car part.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:32.600]   And it may not be solved for a while, if ever.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.600]   And I know that there are people out there who are like,
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.720]   no, no, full self-driving, it's just a year away.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:40.440]   And Heidi Elon Musk, who has probably who said that,
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.960]   but it is like fusion, it's always a few years away,
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.240]   and it's not here.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.960]   And that doesn't have to be a failure, right?
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.600]   Because there are lots of safety modes and ways
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.480]   to protect drivers that aren't full self-driving,
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:57.080]   that take the electric car of the future forward
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.760]   without it being, like there are these rumors
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.720]   that Apple's goal was to make a full self-driving car
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.120]   without controls, right?
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.520]   And the moment I heard that I thought that car will never ship,
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.160]   because it will, or at least not,
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.240]   never meaning like not in the next decade,
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.000]   because to get a car that can't be controlled by people
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.200]   or not easily, and is just gonna rely on full self-driving,
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.120]   like there are places where self-driving on highways
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.280]   could be workable now or soon,
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:22.320]   and then lots of places where it isn't.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.480]   I have to wonder after WWDC last month,
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.560]   if what Apple's really doing here is
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.320]   workshopping a whole bunch of car tech
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.520]   and figuring out what works, 'cause when you saw that--
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:33.720]   - You're talking about that car play demo, right?
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.920]   - Yeah, when you see that next generation car play,
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.920]   some parts of that probably have to come
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.600]   from a real-time operating system,
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.400]   and it does make you wonder if Apple's ultimate play here
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.240]   may end up just being that they built
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.080]   a real-time operating system for Project Titan,
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.440]   and now they're going to work with car makers
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.320]   to do an Android automotive kind of move,
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.400]   and safety features and other features
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.160]   might be a part of that, but maybe it ends up being
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.880]   that that's the place where Apple can play,
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.760]   and I don't think that that means Titan
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.360]   is necessarily a failure.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:07.320]   I feel like they had to figure out what they could contribute,
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:10.280]   but it may not be that they can contribute a whole Apple car.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.520]   - That's not a bad business to be a licensing
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.920]   and operating system to cars.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:18.440]   Ma says in the article that Apple has raised the question
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.640]   of whether Apple's making a major business mistake
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.960]   by betting on nothing less than full autonomy.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.400]   If that's really, I mean, I don't know if that's the case,
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.200]   but if they're saying no, no, it has to be fully autonomous.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.160]   As you said, that could be, who knows?
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.400]   - That's dumb.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.720]   If they're looking for full autonomy,
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.760]   or if they're looking to make an actual car product
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.200]   that they actually sell to consumers,
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.600]   that's very, very concerning,
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.440]   because there's a lot of heat
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.960]   between advanced driver assist systems.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.160]   Those are amazing.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.320]   They're a real product.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:50.320]   They work, the contribution they make to safety is amazing.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:51.840]   Just the ability to simply say,
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:52.880]   "When you're getting on to,
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.040]   "when you're about to leave a local street,
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.920]   "and you're about to take an exit for a highway on ramp,"
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:59.000]   you say, "Help me get on to the highway."
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.880]   That is a problem that these systems
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.320]   can absolutely do.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.200]   The idea of even on the surface street,
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:09.040]   break from, you have permission to initiate emergency breaking,
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:09.960]   if it's necessary.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.680]   That is also something that these systems do very, very well.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:14.080]   All the stuff that works,
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:17.240]   all the stuff that the Department of Transportation
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.600]   is really, really endorsing it,
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.760]   something we're gonna support you with legislation,
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.200]   we're gonna support you with standards,
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.440]   all that sort of stuff, that's software,
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:27.560]   that's not an operating system level stuff.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.680]   And there are already players in this game
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.720]   that have been doing this for two or three generations.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.680]   They know how to integrate all the software into a car,
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.160]   which is one of them, it's almost like a space shuttle,
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:38.840]   because there's so many different systems
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.400]   that all have to be integrated together,
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.360]   not only that, but each system has to be validated
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.880]   so that they're safe so that they actually work.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.760]   Imagine how difficult it is just to simply have,
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.800]   you have a steering wheel that is drive by wire,
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.440]   and that's just a standard technology,
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.960]   that we are going to control the throttle via a wire,
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.680]   we're gonna control the steering via a wire,
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:58.840]   all the different certifications and safety tests
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:45:59.760]   that have to be done,
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.080]   just to communicate over a wire to like,
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.240]   here is how we're turning,
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.080]   and here's how the wheels could go.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.720]   Imagine how much more difficult it's going to be
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.440]   for someone who is not like Tesla,
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.920]   who is not playing fast and loose with regulations,
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.600]   to actually put that stuff on the street.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.400]   Gotta be crazy to make this stuff work.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.320]   The other thing Ma says is that there's a lack of,
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:22.520]   without a Steve Jobs to power it through,
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.920]   there's kind of a lack of leadership,
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.920]   he says, "Tim Cook isn't, you know, he's kind of hands off."
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:31.360]   And plus, he says, "Some Apple executives are not rooting
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.720]   "for Project Titan."
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:36.720]   Notably, Air Force One, Craig Federighi,
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:40.320]   has been particularly skeptical of the program
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.560]   over the years, according to two people
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:45.400]   who have heard him speak privately about it.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.960]   And with another parts of Apple,
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:50.040]   Titan has become the subject of ridicule,
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.760]   because of its chronic leadership turnover,
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.920]   and changes in strategy that have previously
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.800]   prompted layoffs, some managers have proactively warned
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:01.040]   employees to stay away from the project,
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.720]   according to multiple former Apple employees.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.560]   Now you've got Kevin Lynch in there now,
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.960]   who is a high level executive leading it.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.240]   - Right, and you do, I mean, I think this speaks
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.920]   to the lack of leadership, that you need somebody
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.640]   who really is a true believer and an owner of it,
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.360]   who is going to build a team that really believes
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.640]   in the product, and that's a problem
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.520]   when you don't know what the product is.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.480]   Kevin Lynch, I believe, got the Apple Watch
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.320]   across the finish line, but I do wonder, you know,
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.720]   again, what is the finish line, and is it,
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.760]   let's take the tech we've built here
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.600]   and see what of it is turnable into a product,
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:37.440]   and is that new car play and better partnerships
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.760]   with car makers?
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.920]   I will say, the one thing I admire
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:45.920]   about the full self-driving or bust mentality
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:49.000]   is there's an argument to be made that
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.960]   if you could crack that, you are gonna be
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:56.640]   really successful, and that if you're Apple,
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.520]   maybe that's the only way that you should ever even
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.000]   consider being part of the car industry,
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   is if you can revolutionize it.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.200]   But you're setting this like failure state, essentially,
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:09.440]   which is we're shooting for the impossible, well guess what?
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.880]   It's impossible, or probably almost impossible,
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:14.760]   and then you leave, I think that's what's led them to now,
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.480]   which is they're in a situation where they're taking stock
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:20.240]   and saying, okay, we spent 10 years working on this stuff,
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:21.200]   what do we got?
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:27.400]   There, according to Ma, were four kings running the project,
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:31.720]   Steve Zadeski, Benjamin Lyon, John Wright,
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:36.720]   and DJ Novotny, who all reported to Dan Ricchio
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:40.480]   before Ricchio handed off to Kevin Lynch.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.680]   Ricchio, although technically in charge,
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:44.960]   according to this article, remained hands off,
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:49.160]   the de facto leader Zadeski, an Apple Vice President
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.560]   who had started his career as a mechanical engineer at Ford,
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.360]   so he was a car guy, but he left earlier this year.
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:49:00.360]   So this doesn't bode well for any project at any company.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:05.680]   - You gotta give a team a target.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:08.560]   Like Apple designed the iPhone and the iPad
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.520]   because they were designing an iPad
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:12.360]   that they decided that in the meantime,
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.680]   let's design an iPhone, not because,
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:17.600]   we're really interested in this multi-touch technology.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:18.600]   What would an operating system,
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.040]   I wonder if what an operating system
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.920]   based on multi-touch would be like,
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.600]   okay, that's something that you could research
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:24.960]   for 10 to 20 years.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.080]   Once you start to, that's the difference between
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.760]   research, science, and engineering.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.520]   Engineering is all about, great, let's make a device
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:34.360]   that is exactly this big, that can cost no more than this,
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:37.080]   so that's gonna have battery requirements
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:38.920]   of exactly these limitations,
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.040]   and let's try to release it in the next two years.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.960]   That's how you actually ship something.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.080]   - And I think that, I think that one thing that Apple
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.880]   has on its favor and to its detriment
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.560]   is that it doesn't need the car.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:49.760]   It's making a lot of money.
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.640]   - So, there's not a, we're gonna go under
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:53.600]   if we don't figure this out,
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.800]   and there's also, they can keep on experimenting
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.240]   and pushing for the big thing,
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.200]   because they can afford to keep dumping money into it.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.640]   - Yeah, the kind of the
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:06.360]   shocking revelation of this article
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:10.360]   is that the car almost ran over a jogger.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.640]   In the first quarter of the year,
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:16.240]   one of Apple's test vehicles driving around 15 miles an hour,
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.600]   almost hit it jogger was crossing the street
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.800]   at an unmarked crosswalk.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.480]   Apple's self-driving software, by the way,
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.640]   Tesla's had some more problems, I should point out.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.760]   - And Waymo. - Yeah.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:29.080]   First, I identified the jogger as a stationary object
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:32.640]   before recategorizing it as a stationary person,
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.600]   and then finally as a moving pedestrian,
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.640]   now that was all within a second,
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:40.800]   but rather than stop the car just steered around him,
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.800]   that this scared the backup driver,
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.880]   there was a human inside who slammed on the brakes,
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:48.960]   the car stopped within a few feet of the pedestrian.
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:51.480]   Apple later determined the car would have almost certainly
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:55.400]   hit the jogger if the backup driver hadn't acted.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.600]   At which point, Apple grounded its fleet
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:01.000]   to investigate the jogger incident.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.200]   It did resume driving within a few days
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.320]   after fixing the identification problem
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.680]   and adding that crosswalk to its map space.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.080]   But that just shows you how, I mean, that's onesie-toozy,
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:14.200]   how many crosswalks are there in the country, in the world?
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:17.000]   That's scary when that happens.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   - Andy made a really good point about Apple's strength
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.600]   being in producing real products
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.200]   and not doing this kind of,
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:25.400]   I said earlier that Andy and I went back to the 90s.
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.760]   90s, Apple was really weird,
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.680]   and one of the things they did
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:31.840]   is a lot of pie in the sky, R&D, tech demo
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.440]   without a purpose and without a product,
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:34.760]   and when Steve Jobs came back,
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.960]   he basically said, "We can't afford to do that.
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.440]   "We need to make real products,"
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.400]   and they've been successful doing that.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:43.200]   I think what you're seeing with Project Titan
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.560]   and Wemo and a bunch of other things
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:48.400]   that are other bets like what Google does
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.840]   is you've got companies with so much money
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:53.640]   that they're willing to just play the lottery
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:56.040]   because they'll say, "Look, what if we can invent
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:57.040]   "the self-driving car?
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:59.800]   "We will win, and if we don't,
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:00.640]   "what do we lose?
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.480]   "Some money?
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.320]   "We got lots of that.
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.160]   "It's fine."
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.000]   - Especially if the employees are saying,
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:05.840]   "We've got to do this.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:06.680]   "We've got to do this."
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:08.000]   - So is Project Titan a money pit
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.600]   that's not a real product and may not amount to anything?
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:12.840]   Yeah, kind of as intended.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:14.120]   - Yeah, so what?
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:15.720]   Although it does have an M designation,
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:18.000]   which apparently means,
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.480]   they think not a top blue sky.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:20.960]   They think there might be a product out there.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:21.880]   - Sure, sure.
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:23.920]   - Johnny Ive has weighed in on the design,
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.600]   just last bit from this article, I won't let--
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:26.440]   - Go ahead.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.640]   - Working on the physical car design continues,
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.760]   according to Wayne Mon, the information.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:33.720]   Johnny, who now works for Apple on a contract basis,
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:36.680]   has told the Titan team, "This is so Johnny,"
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:40.080]   lean into the weirdness of the vehicle's design,
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:42.560]   and don't try to hide the sensors
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.400]   that set a person with direct knowledge of the discussion.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.480]   The current design features four seats
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.560]   that face inward, a living room,
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:50.200]   so passengers can talk to one another
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.160]   and a curve ceiling similar to the roof
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.280]   of a Volkswagen Beetle.
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:56.920]   So it's a little orb with a living room inside,
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.480]   no steering wheel probably, right?
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.440]   No brake pedal.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:00.360]   - Nope.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.680]   - Designers are experimenting with a trunk compartment
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:05.840]   that rises, giving owners easier access
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:09.240]   to the storage space and then automatically lowers.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:11.440]   Apple designers have discussed large screens
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:14.120]   that rise from behind the seats and lower when they aren't in use.
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:15.800]   They've also discussed allowing passengers
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.360]   to lie flat and sleep in the vehicle.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:22.360]   Those safety considerations could get in the way.
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:25.760]   Apple hopes this is actually what's most interesting to me.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.160]   They are trying to get exemptions from NHTSA,
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:30.360]   the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:33.680]   to remove the steering wheel and brakes from the car,
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:36.600]   and they actually hired NHTSA's chief counsel
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:39.320]   to help negotiate this.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.280]   Good luck.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:42.160]   And employees are now discussing how to disguise
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:44.000]   a new version of the self-driving test vehicle
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.560]   that most more closely resembles the final version
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:48.080]   of the car Apple wants to produce
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:50.080]   and could hit the road as early as next year.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.320]   So they still doing it.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.160]   - It still work.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:54.040]   - It is an interesting aspect.
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:56.960]   The part of the, believe me,
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.120]   part of the research into this is simply into sociology,
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.280]   where should you have a self-driving car
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:05.360]   be identifiable to other drivers as a self-driving car,
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:08.520]   meaning that look, this vehicle may not operate,
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.280]   if you've trained yourself for 20 years
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.240]   on predicting the unpredictability
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.920]   of how human beings drive cars, this is not that thing.
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:19.520]   Or on the other hand, should you make it as normal as possible?
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:23.040]   Because we're already seeing that if someone in test markets
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:26.000]   where self-driving vehicles are already on the road,
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.600]   if other drivers know that this is a robotic vehicle,
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.960]   that they are gonna be more of a jerk to this car
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.400]   because they figure out that they can,
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.480]   that maybe the software's a little bit more conservative.
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:36.480]   Also they know that they're not gonna be sued
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:38.840]   by a human driver, all these sort of things.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:41.560]   So there's just so much research that has to go into this.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:44.160]   And maybe that, this is why these are always
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.720]   interesting research projects.
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.600]   And they will always be really valuable
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:50.680]   to a company like Apple because researchers,
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:53.040]   a company like Apple needs researchers.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.720]   And sometimes they really just want to work the problem
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:58.320]   as opposed to, yeah, we know that we hired you off
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:01.080]   of this really, really incredible AI project
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:02.480]   that you got working on at Stanford.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.640]   We really just want you to improve the accuracy
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:07.320]   of search results in Apple photos.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:10.440]   Like, no, that's not why I left academia.
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:11.440]   All right, I wanna take a little break.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:14.120]   And then I wanna talk about lockdown mode
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:17.400]   'cause this is one of the features of iOS 16.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.560]   Getting a lot of attention is kind of interesting.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:23.160]   Apple would just put out a press release saying,
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:25.560]   actually a week ago, Apple expands industry leading
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:28.920]   commitment to protect users from highly targeted
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:31.000]   mercenary spyware.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.280]   Wow, if you are potentially being targeted
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:38.000]   by mercenary spyware, we've got an answer for you.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.320]   It's so nice to have Jason Snell with his six colors.com,
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:43.920]   right? - That's it.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:46.120]   - And any comparable podcast?
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:47.840]   And you got, how many podcasts total?
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:48.760]   - I can't count that high.
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:50.200]   - Yeah, I didn't think so.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.840]   - 10 fingers and toes, that's it.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:52.680]   What are you gonna do?
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.520]   - It's a lot.
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:54.360]   - There's a lot.
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:56.040]   - Where's the best place to go to find out
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.760]   what podcasts you're doing?
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:00.400]   - I post a lot of them at six colors.com,
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.840]   but you can also go to the incomparable.com
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:05.520]   and relay.fm, that's mostly where I am.
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:06.360]   - Yeah.
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.760]   - I need to update my current podcast.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.120]   - You know what I'm gonna do just for you?
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.760]   We have on the Twitch site. - Oh, that's a deal.
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:15.440]   - We have, and just for you, we have a page, a bio page.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:17.680]   And I am gonna make sure that that bio page lists
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:20.120]   every gosh darn podcast. - All right, I'll do it.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:25.120]   - In your quiver, if that's where you keep your podcast.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:28.560]   - I mean, I could list them here,
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.520]   but there's not enough time.
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:30.800]   - Not enough time.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:33.200]   - Jason, can you set up an API so that makes sure
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.800]   that that page is simply ping your server to ask
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.520]   what is the current list, what current names?
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:38.360]   I think.
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:40.360]   - It'll be a JSON API.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:42.040]   (grunting)
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:42.880]   - Ah, get it!
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:43.720]   - Did they name it after you?
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:44.560]   - It was very funny.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.400]   - No, I think it was.
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:46.240]   Thank you, Alex.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:49.560]   Best response to a joke ever is that's very fun.
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:50.400]   - That's amusing.
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:51.240]   - That is very funny.
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.080]   - Highly amusing.
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:52.920]   It's a very spot.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:54.080]   - You gotta get the gravelly spot.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:54.920]   - Yes.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:59.800]   - And I cannot go also here, GBH in Boston.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:01.080]   - I noticed they've dropped the W
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:03.280]   in much of their communications.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.280]   - Yeah, I don't know why.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:07.800]   Officially, officially the media organization, I think,
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:10.320]   is GBA, even though, of course, the FCC thinks
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:11.160]   of it as WGBH.
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.000]   - Does that stand for me?
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.480]   - No, I'm balancing.
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:16.120]   Yes, a great big, how can show?
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:19.240]   - No, in the Boston area, there's this huge,
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:20.440]   we don't have a mountain in the Boston area,
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:22.560]   we have this big hill called Blue Hill,
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.240]   and they used to put the transmission towers
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.360]   for all the radio stuff.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:28.200]   So this is for W, great Blue Hills.
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:29.280]   - Oh, that's--
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:32.360]   - See, you learn something on this show, don't you?
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:36.520]   Something completely useless, but you've learned something,
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:37.840]   and that's what really--
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:40.240]   That really is my power position in this field
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.080]   for the corporate people.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.720]   - They've dropped the W, W, no more.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:47.680]   In fact, when I used to work back Easton Radio,
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:52.680]   it was the bane of every radio DJ's existence to say W.
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:53.640]   - W.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:57.040]   - All the time, that's one letter, three syllables,
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.200]   makes no sense.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:01.880]   Also, Alex Lindsay, oh nine, oh dot media
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:04.720]   and office hours dot global.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:09.120]   Will you do a deconstruction of the NASA stream
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:10.560]   with Telestrator and all that?
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:11.400]   - I'll take a look at it.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:13.400]   I haven't seen it 'cause we were on air,
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:14.320]   and then I've been in meetings--
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:15.800]   - It was kind of a wreck.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:18.000]   - I'll take a look at it, yeah, it was a crash.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.040]   But since office hours today was about focus on audio,
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:21.880]   I think you might--
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:23.520]   - Yeah, exactly, we'll take a look at it.
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.160]   - You might want to take a look.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:27.520]   Why is he pointing at me?
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.760]   - He's excited about you.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.760]   - Okay, me, he's so nice.
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:33.960]   - Office hours needs you.
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:37.200]   Our show today brought to you by our crowd.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:39.800]   This is a crowd I want to be a part of
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:43.320]   as rising interest rates inflation and global complexity
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.920]   throw the stock market into turmoil.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.920]   A lot of investors, the savvy ones are turning to,
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:51.200]   or at least looking for alternative ways
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.400]   to grow their money.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:57.080]   And if you have put away the proper amount
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:59:00.160]   of savings for emergencies, for retirement and all that stuff,
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:04.520]   I think it is necessary to kind of broaden your scope.
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:08.200]   Our crowd makes it easy for you to diversify your investments
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:11.680]   into a variety of expertly vetted, high growth,
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:15.840]   private companies across stages, geographies,
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:18.200]   and even industries, biotech, cyber security,
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.640]   renewable energy.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.000]   These are the kinds of investments
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.440]   that really used to be reserved
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:25.360]   to the elite institutional investors.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:26.720]   No one even would know about them
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:29.080]   because they haven't yet gone public.
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:32.600]   So no, but they're private, they're small,
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:36.440]   but of course that's where the greatest growth potential lies.
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:39.440]   Every month our crowd vets hundreds of startups
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:43.040]   across the globe and then brings them to their members,
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:47.200]   a select few identified for outsized growth potential.
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:48.920]   Of course you don't have to invest in any of these.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:50.960]   In fact, it's free to join our crowd,
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.200]   but it's a great way to find out
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:53.920]   about these investments ahead of time.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:55.520]   Our crowd backs these investments,
[00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:57.360]   they commit their own capital,
[00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.360]   they're not just throwing stuff at you, they're in,
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.000]   and they leverage their relationships
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.440]   with multinationals and global investment leaders
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:07.280]   to help drive their portfolio company's growth.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.560]   They're in fact venture capitalists.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:13.880]   So they're in, they even have not only some portfolio companies
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:14.880]   that you can invest in,
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.840]   but they have some funds you can invest in as well.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:20.240]   Now, of course there's a catch, here's the catch.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.760]   You have to be an accredited investor,
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:24.720]   and that's gonna vary depending on what country you're in.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:28.000]   In the US it has either our income requirements and so forth,
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.720]   but if you are an accredited investor,
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.840]   you can discover investment opportunities well
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.600]   beyond the stock market.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.320]   Get in on the stuff that only the big shots
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.040]   have been able to get into up to now.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.200]   Single company deals you can get in as little as $10,000.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:44.240]   The funds started $50,000,
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.440]   but a minimum of 10,000 is required to invest,
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.680]   and again you have to be an accredited investor.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:51.400]   Those terms may vary depending on where you invest,
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:56.040]   so what you need to do is go to ourcrowd.com/macbreak.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.440]   First thing they'll ask you is what country you're investing from,
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.120]   and then they'll tell you what the requirements are.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.440]   If you meet those requirements,
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.480]   it's free to join the fastest growing
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:07.760]   venture capital investment community in the world.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.680]   Just to find out what's happening
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:10.680]   is fascinating,
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:14.960]   ourcrowd.com/macbreak.
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.480]   A great way to get in these private market investments
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.760]   before everybody else does.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.360]   And that's the best time, right?
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:27.360]   Ourcrowd.com/macbreak.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:31.080]   Thank you, ourcrowd, for your support.
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.280]   So it's interesting.
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.440]   This is Apple's lockdown.
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.560]   Is this Apple's response to Pegasus,
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.120]   the NSO Group's zero-click software
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.680]   that was used by nation states to target dissidents,
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.840]   journalists, bad guys?
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.680]   - That's it. - Yeah.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.520]   - It feels like it.
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:49.160]   - Yeah, they got tired of the perception
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:53.240]   that the iPhone was insecure fundamentally
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:57.080]   because of these very specific tactics taken
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.800]   mostly by state actors who are paying NSO Group.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.640]   And so they decided they would just create a mode
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.360]   that turns off a bunch of stuff in iOS
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.080]   in order to reduce the attack surfaces.
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.520]   So your phone will be kind of crappy,
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.960]   but this stuff won't work anymore.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.240]   Because that's the challenge, right?
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.000]   It's like, I don't want to break everybody's iPhone.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.480]   Most people are not going to be,
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.120]   like this lockdown feature feels like very much,
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.680]   you know if you are in the target audience for this group.
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:28.680]   You are a journalist, or a dissident.
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.360]   - Or a politician. - Or a politician.
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:33.560]   You are somebody who probably a state actor
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:37.560]   would pay lots of money to get onto your phone.
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.760]   And that's the point here.
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.680]   I think it's also a funny move that Apple basically said,
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:44.040]   "We'll donate all the proceeds of any lawsuits
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:47.160]   we have against NSO to the foundation
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.280]   that's going to research more security."
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:52.360]   - A $10 million cybersecurity grant.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:55.040]   Not to mention a $2 million bug bounty
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.480]   for anybody who can break lockdown.
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.640]   Google did this a couple of years ago.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.880]   They did the Advanced Protection Program.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.800]   You'd have to have two Titan Keys.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.440]   And it was really, it was in response to the break-in
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:12.400]   of the Democratic National Committee's email accounts.
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.080]   So Google really said this is for politicians,
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.800]   public figures who might be targeted.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.760]   This goes a lot farther,
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.760]   or it's maybe not goes a lot farther,
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:23.920]   but it is different.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.000]   Apple already has two factor.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.560]   - As Jason said, it basically closes off attack services.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.680]   It's the difference between having a normal house
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:34.120]   and saying, "Okay, these windows led in light
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.680]   and they're pretty, but they're a place
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.240]   where burglars get in, so we're going to board them up.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.240]   We're going to take off the doorbell.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.600]   We're going to all these things that make it less convenient.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.680]   Things like, "No, I'm a doorbell.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:45.520]   I love it."
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.560]   - No, just this is exactly the sort of things
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.960]   we're talking about where things like,
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.640]   it's not going to accept any messages
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.560]   from anybody that you haven't interacted with before,
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.760]   because there are no open message exploits
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:01.600]   where just sending a malformed message to iMessage
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:04.200]   will cause an infection.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:08.280]   Things like active scripts on, active code
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.800]   on the browser are turned off.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:15.440]   If a phone is locked, plugging it into a data cable
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.800]   will do nothing.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.520]   And what's really, it's kind of great.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.360]   Google has a small phone.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:22.200]   - Google has a small phone.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.120]   - Well, it's still charged, but the data is shut off.
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:27.480]   No accessories can be used, but you could charge it.
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.520]   So that would be worth turning on
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:32.640]   before you charge at the airport or at a bar.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.640]   Just turn on lockdown mode.
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:37.040]   - And I think the pushback will probably come
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.080]   from the intelligence communities,
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.640]   because while I had something that--
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:40.800]   - They don't like that so much, do they?
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.040]   - Small companies, small countries were able to buy it
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.360]   from NSO, but we should assume that the larger countries
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.360]   already had it.
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:49.720]   - But the NSA, for instance, they're not going to step up
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.280]   and say, "Hey, please don't turn on lockdown,
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:52.600]   but we can't spy on you."
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.680]   - Well, and the problem is it would show what they were doing.
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.040]   And so I think that would be very difficult,
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:01.920]   but we just have to watch the pushback will be,
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.080]   what about terrorists and what about drug dealers
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.320]   and what about, that's going to be the thing.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.720]   - Oh yeah, Apple, you're giving them a tool
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:08.720]   consider the children.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.080]   - Yeah, so that politics is a huge part of the story.
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.680]   And I think one of the reasons Apple has made
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:15.040]   such a big deal out of the NSO group
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:18.160]   is because it's framing the story as being,
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.400]   there's this shady profit-making company
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:26.400]   that is acting as a mercenary selling to shady countries
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:29.040]   and shady quasi-government groups,
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.280]   the way to break into the phones
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:34.800]   of heroic dissidents and journalists, right?
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.800]   That is a way better way to do this.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.400]   - I think that's the opening paragraph, actually.
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:42.680]   - Then to say, also, this is going to stop the--
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.520]   - FBI, with the same port, it's in.
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:45.760]   - Yeah, exactly, right.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.720]   So part of this is the framing of it,
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:50.560]   that Apple wants to frame it in this very particular way.
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:53.800]   And honestly, it doesn't kind of make it hard
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.840]   if you're an American government official,
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:59.920]   let's say, to say, well, actually we're against this.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:00.760]   So--
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:05.760]   - I'm going to disagree because Apple still has the loophole
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.720]   that law enforcement loves,
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.680]   which is you can serve a search warrant to Apple
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:12.200]   for iCloud data. - Of course.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.280]   - And everything backed up to--
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.600]   And this does not turn that off.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.280]   - It doesn't turn off iCloud backups, that's hilarious.
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.120]   - Everything that's backed up to iCloud
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.880]   is available to law enforcement
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.600]   and Apple is always going to keep that.
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.640]   I don't think, in fact, actually,
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.480]   you've, Alex, said that Apple will some,
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.000]   at some point, turn that off.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.120]   I think they leave that on
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:29.920]   'cause that's their safety valve, right?
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:30.760]   - You can turn it off.
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:31.600]   - You can turn it off.
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.400]   - That's the point is these features
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:36.000]   are features that you otherwise couldn't control.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.400]   As an example of the San Bernardino shooter,
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.280]   Apple's first step into the FBI is,
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:42.520]   well, just bring the phone back to his house,
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.920]   it'll back up to iCloud, we'll give you everything.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:46.720]   And then they said, oh, the FBI blew it
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.800]   'cause they didn't do that.
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:50.240]   They tried to unlock the phone first.
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.720]   - And again, they're not blind.
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.720]   You know, like, there's a lot of things
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:54.720]   that they still know about your phone.
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.560]   They know where your phone is.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:56.400]   They know who you talk to,
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.600]   who you're standing next to,
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.400]   who are you, you know, if you have two phones,
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.000]   they know both of those phones probably belong to you.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.400]   And so, so there's a lot of things--
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.240]   - And they will handle that over
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.920]   if given a lot of the subpoena, yes.
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.840]   - They don't need Apple for that.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.440]   - Oh, they don't need to be right.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.360]   - So the cell companies will tell them all those things.
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:13.840]   And so I think that they,
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:15.200]   it's not like they're going blind,
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:20.280]   but I think, I still think that this is part of the kind of,
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:22.480]   at an angle, the way the intelligence community
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.320]   is trying to push this is,
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.240]   I think there's a lot of push for breaking up the Apple store.
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:26.720]   And, you know, opening that up
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.840]   because, you know, if it keeps on closing down like this,
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:31.000]   it gets really, really hard for them to get into.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.880]   And they really want other, you know,
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.760]   less closed down systems available.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.600]   So I think there's a whisper from industry,
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.960]   but there's also a whisper from intelligence
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:43.480]   into our Congress people's ear of like,
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.200]   hey, we really need to crack this up
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.680]   so it can't be as tied down.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.840]   - So here's what happens with messages,
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:53.840]   message attachment types other than images are blocked.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.840]   So you, and by the way, that's one of the ways NSO Group
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.520]   gets in is with the text message.
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:01.840]   This actually almost admits that Apple has problems
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:05.640]   with its meta data rendering tool,
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.720]   which is, by the way, Microsoft has the same problems
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:08.800]   everybody does.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:12.120]   That's kind of a notoriously difficult thing to secure.
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.560]   - Right, it's literally your device is saying,
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:16.800]   "I accept arbitrary data."
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.640]   - Just send it to me and I'll interpret it.
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.040]   - It's easier said than done.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.640]   - Some features, and this is another good one,
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.280]   like link previews are disabled,
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:26.160]   so you won't see a preview popping up.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:29.560]   That to me is not so onerous, I'd turn that on.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.040]   When it comes to web browsing,
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.720]   they're following in the footsteps of Google.
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:36.600]   Google did a study about six months ago
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:38.880]   that discovered that most of the flaws in browsers
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:42.400]   came from just-in-time JavaScript compilation.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:47.240]   JIT, so JITs are disabled unless the user excludes
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:48.840]   a trusted site from lockdown mode.
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:52.520]   So I don't know how much that's gonna break the internet.
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:56.560]   Google does offer, or has talked about turning off JITs
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.640]   in Chrome, which also, by the way,
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:01.760]   weirdly speeds up the browsing considerably.
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:04.800]   So I'm not sure if this is a feature
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.400]   that it might be something you would do wanna turn on.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:10.600]   I suspect it is, we've talked about this on security now.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:14.280]   As for Apple services, incoming invitations and service
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:17.080]   requests, including FaceTime calls, are blocked,
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:21.040]   but only if you have not previously
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.360]   sent a request to the initiator.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.640]   So if somebody you know, somebody you've talked to before,
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:29.040]   not blocked, but strangers, stranger danger,
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.800]   we're gonna block 'em.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.760]   Again, I think everybody should turn this on so far.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.560]   Wired connections, as you mentioned, Jason,
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.120]   with a computer accessory are blocked
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.880]   when the iPhone is locked, so that's important
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:45.880]   because people charge, they plug in their phone to systems
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:48.680]   that they just don't know about.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.560]   - And again, that's a good thing.
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.760]   - That's a good thing.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.120]   - Also significantly, that's the tools
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:55.800]   that law enforcement uses when they-
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:59.080]   - Well, they say exactly when they just grab your phone
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:09:59.920]   while you're-
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:00.920]   - That's what this is.
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.400]   - Can I quickly search your car permission?
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:06.720]   - This is anti-celebrite, that's what that is.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:07.560]   - So if you're phone-
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.400]   - If you're empty any way to get in.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.360]   I mean, this is like a one fail swoop to attempt to,
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.080]   first they're saying there's a big bonus
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.200]   if you figure out how to get in,
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:17.640]   but this is a big attempt to close off all the doors
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.080]   that were opened.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.600]   - It also turns off profiles.
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.880]   That's the only one that I actually use profiles
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:27.560]   'cause I use NextDNS and I put a profile on my iPhone
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.880]   that allows it to become the DNS provider.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:33.920]   Configuration profiles cannot be installed.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.280]   And I mean, that's a big fat hole
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:40.600]   if you as a bad guy get a profile install on the phone.
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.760]   The device cannot enroll into MDM
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.600]   while lockdown mode is turned on.
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.920]   MDM, which we were just talking about with a collide ad.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.760]   And I know they're one of your sponsors too.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:54.600]   MDM is how IT sometimes will lock down devices,
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.660]   but it's also, remember, one of the parental,
[01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:02.440]   you know, lockdown apps got busted
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.480]   'cause they were using MDM inappropriately.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.480]   It's designed for enterprise.
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:08.440]   They were using it to control what kids could do on this.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.280]   - There's a lot of rules of like,
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.520]   you can't do that on an iPhone
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:11.960]   that are actually have a little footnote
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:15.480]   that says, except if it's in an organization
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.040]   and then you turn on MDM and you can distribute apps.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:21.200]   And so you can create sort of like a piracy ring
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.200]   where you distribute apps.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.360]   There's so many different things you can do
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:25.160]   because it's like, it's literally a place
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.000]   where Apple's locked it down for regular users
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.400]   and then said for corporate users, oh no, it's okay.
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.320]   You can do this.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.440]   And then that gets exploited.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.560]   And you end up with these scenarios
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.440]   where people are installing profiles
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.960]   that they don't know what they do
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.360]   in order to get this app that they wanna use
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.360]   or get this feature they wanna use.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:43.200]   And it's interesting though that it says
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.440]   profiles can't be installed,
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:48.040]   which I find that fascinating 'cause I think it may suggest
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:50.800]   that you can have a profile on your phone.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.760]   But when you turn on lockdown mode,
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.000]   it's not going to install new profiles.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.960]   So I could have my next DNS profile,
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.680]   but it would lock, oh, that's interesting.
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.200]   Might be, 'cause they made it easy.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.160]   Again, it's one of those things
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.000]   where Apple's made it easier to install a profile,
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.840]   which is great as a user 'cause you're like, oh,
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.600]   it just, you tap download and it says, okay,
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:12.640]   it's over in your settings, but that also makes it dangerous
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.520]   'cause it's so easy.
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.920]   So lockdown mode would turn that off.
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:18.040]   Would you turn on lockdown mode, Jason?
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:18.880]   I wouldn't.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.040]   I might.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:20.880]   I might.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.080]   You have it, you could.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.440]   I could, but--
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.440]   By the way, it's not just iPhone, it's iPad and Mac.
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.000]   And Mac, it just makes your,
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.600]   it's just gonna make it inconvenient though.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.240]   You don't wanna do any of these things.
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:34.520]   I would rather not lose all those features
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.000]   if I could avoid it, but if I felt,
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.440]   but I'll tell you, if a man in a suit came to my door
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:43.480]   and said there's a country that is on the other side
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:45.320]   of the planet that is mad at you,
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:47.160]   lockdown, lockdown, lockdown, lockdown, lockdown.
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.000]   I would turn on lockdown immediately.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.240]   Andy, would you use it?
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:52.000]   I would turn it on and then as soon as it become
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.200]   it comes in, you'd be gonna turn it right off again.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.040]   Yeah, me too.
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:54.880]   That's what I'll do.
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:58.080]   But the great thing about it is that,
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.720]   I mean, for, there have been a lot of people
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.240]   who are in that sort of situation where,
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:03.080]   hey, your name has appeared on a list of people
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.560]   who have been targeted, whose devices have been targeted
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.440]   by NSO Spyware.
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.040]   And then, oh my God, what do I do?
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.920]   Like, don't know, but just let me let you know.
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.960]   Now the answer is turn on this.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:17.240]   Whereas the old device used to be,
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.080]   maybe stop using your phone entirely
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:21.880]   or buy a special super hardened phone
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:26.880]   that is absolutely just like a flip phone from 1999
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.560]   or turn this thing on, it will give you enough protection
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:33.640]   that you could at least continue to use apps like Signal
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:38.040]   and still contact the dissidents that you're writing about
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.840]   that people want to kill you for writing about.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:43.120]   Would you turn it on, Alex?
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.440]   There are times when I've done jobs where
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.280]   I would definitely turn it on
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:47.800]   because I was probably at risk.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.720]   When you go in the White House,
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.840]   do they take your phone and put it in a bag?
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.280]   Nope, not in the White House.
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:55.360]   There's other government--
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.880]   - Other places. - Take your watch.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.760]   - I know the Pentagon, they often do.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.880]   - But they, not in the White House,
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.360]   the White House mostly is if you want to plug
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:05.320]   into the network, they'll like, I always tell everyone,
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.440]   when you plug that ethernet in,
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.720]   just know that a lot of things are gonna look at your computer.
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.920]   So the, so anyway--
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.800]   - Well, that makes sense, I would hope so.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:15.160]   - Yeah, yeah, no, no, absolutely.
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:19.520]   So, but I don't see, again, there are times
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:23.080]   when I was doing things that I, you know, that--
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.880]   - For how Alex gets when he's trying to
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.200]   circum low-cute, but--
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.960]   - So, but, but I, but there are times when I would not,
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.720]   I would have turned it on, yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:31.720]   - I asked Amy Webb this
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:33.080]   'cause she does a lot of work with the Pentagon.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.320]   She says, yeah, when you go to skiff,
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.360]   you give him your phone.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.880]   She says it always makes me nervous
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.520]   because who knows what's going on with that phone
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.360]   while it's in the bag?
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:44.560]   - Well, I would even say if you do a lot of work
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.720]   with the Pentagon, you may want to turn your feet--
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:47.960]   - Turn it on, lock it out.
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.000]   - Right, yes.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]   - Well, and a lot of times, just if you know you're going
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.360]   into a building that's gonna take your phone,
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:53.360]   you still bring it with you.
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:54.200]   - Yeah, right.
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:55.920]   - Like, it's just a lot safer to do that.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.000]   - Does this sell iPhones?
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.880]   Is this enough so that people who are looking for a sec--
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.360]   There were, you know, there's like the black phone.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.360]   There are these phones and every time somebody crumb
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.960]   comes up with one of these super secure phones,
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.520]   the security, you know, community goes, yeah, right.
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:11.480]   Except for that thing, one, you know,
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.800]   or you could use this or none of this stuff
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:14.920]   is really secure.
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:18.080]   Maybe this is gonna make a market for the iPhone.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:21.880]   - I remember talking to Phil Zimmerman, I think it was,
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.800]   who created PGP.
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:26.080]   He said, "I would never take an Android phone
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.960]   "to black at, for instance, or dead."
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:32.400]   - And I think that it is serving a relatively small group
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.560]   of people, like in the grand scheme
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.880]   of how many iPhones Apple does,
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.440]   I don't think it's gonna really affect,
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.680]   maybe there'll be enough paranoid people
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:39.400]   that will buy another half a million phones,
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.840]   but it's really serving like five or 10,000 people
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:44.480]   that are really targets of state actors.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.560]   Maybe a little bit more now that Russia and China
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:47.640]   are doing what they're doing.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:51.920]   But it's not, you know, the phone is pretty secure on its own.
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:52.920]   So this is like--
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:56.680]   - Maybe the next president won't get a highly modified
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:59.960]   Windows CE phone or a blackberry,
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.360]   but get an iPhone and lock down.
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.080]   - So why Apple does this?
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:04.240]   'Cause Alex is right, you know,
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.760]   the potential market here is incredibly small.
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:09.680]   Why does Apple do something like this?
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:13.200]   And the answer is 'cause it's bad publicity for Apple
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:16.480]   to have a story about a dissident in a far off country
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:19.640]   who is kidnapped and thrown in jail or executed
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.000]   by a oppressive regime because they got hacked
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.280]   using their iPhone, right?
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:27.480]   It's like that is a story Apple doesn't want to exist.
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:30.560]   And so it's, that's really what's going on here.
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:32.480]   I do think yes, of course, less cynically,
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:34.840]   Apple doesn't want their products.
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.520]   They hate that the NSO group is hacking their products.
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:40.360]   They hate it and they don't want any company,
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.080]   any government to do that.
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.000]   But the other part of it is that they don't want
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000]   the perception that the Apple platforms are unsafe
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.440]   because privacy and security are one of their selling points.
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:51.720]   And that's really-- - They're doing everything
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:54.160]   they can to block zero-click exploits
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:56.400]   like the Pegasus exploit.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:00.000]   But you can't really put a press release about that.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.040]   That's just your ongoing security research.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.040]   So this is nice 'cause it's a nice press release
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:08.360]   that you can put out. - I do think that
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:11.640]   the primary driver is simply that the
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:16.840]   Google and Apple, they both take an enormous amount of pride
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.600]   in security.
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.600]   That this is something that has to be done just on principle,
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.040]   just to keep the technology moving forward.
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.480]   And this is part of the responsibility
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:27.200]   as the people who are creating the technology
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.560]   that other people use.
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.720]   And I really believe that the match that lit the fuse
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:34.320]   was a team inside of Apple saying, look,
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:37.000]   we've been looking at ways to lock out all this sort of stuff.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.600]   A good intermediary step would be what if we just give people
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:42.680]   a mo that they could use and then it rolled off from there.
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:45.960]   I don't think it was necessarily a response to bad PR,
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:48.960]   although that certainly was part of it.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.520]   I do think this is mostly a principle response.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:54.960]   Look, the question that a lot of us should be asking
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:58.920]   technology companies is, you didn't even try to do
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.400]   the very least that you could do.
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:02.280]   We can't expect you to solve the entire problem,
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:04.680]   but why didn't you do at least the least that you could do?
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.040]   This is better than the least that they could do.
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:07.920]   And I'm glad that Apple did it.
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.840]   - Yeah, it's beneficial in so many different ways
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:13.800]   because it lets them take pride in their product
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.920]   being more secure.
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:17.240]   It means that they're not going to have stories out there
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.600]   about people's iPhones betraying them.
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:24.600]   It allows them to attack the, and put out a reward, right,
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:27.960]   for people who can try to break this thing.
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:30.920]   Like it's a winner on all fronts,
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:32.440]   except for what Alex mentioned earlier,
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.120]   which is it's a winner on all fronts
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:37.080]   unless the narrative gets changed to be,
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.800]   Apple is helping bad guys with this.
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:43.880]   Show of hands, anybody order a MacBook Air M2 last Friday?
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:45.960]   You did it, what color?
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.080]   - Midnight. - Midnight.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.280]   It's the only color.
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:50.000]   Alex, Andy?
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:50.920]   - Nope, not yet.
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:53.320]   - As tempted as I was by the range of colors
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:56.080]   about gray, darker gray, and an even darker version of gray.
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.440]   (laughing)
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:58.360]   - Yeah, silver.
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:01.360]   - Silver, gray, gray, gray, and gray.
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:05.800]   - Gray, silver, slightly off yellowy silver
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:08.080]   and dark gray.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.720]   - But midnight blue is going to be nice.
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:10.560]   - Yeah, it is. - But bring it in.
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.380]   - And it's blue.
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:12.220]   - That one you have to come in when you get it.
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:15.320]   - Sure, absolutely. - What is your ship date?
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:16.680]   - Early August, early August.
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.160]   It seems like they built,
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:19.400]   because they're having supply chain issues,
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.720]   it looks like they built a lot of the base models.
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:23.680]   So if you ordered the pure base model,
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:25.600]   you might have gotten them this week.
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:26.600]   - But Friday, yeah.
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.440]   - But then it flipped because I,
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.800]   so I got up at 5 a.m. on Friday,
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:31.960]   'cause I'm an idiot.
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:36.160]   And immediately ordered the top of the line.
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:37.640]   You know, max it out, two terabytes,
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:41.920]   24 gigabytes, 10 core GPU or whatever.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.860]   And it said August 9th.
[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:48.440]   And which of course is not this Friday.
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:49.760]   Some people will get it Friday.
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:51.480]   But now if you order the base model,
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:55.840]   it's later and it's August 9th for the build to order.
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.680]   - Well, that's because they've run out of the base model.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:58.520]   - They've run out of the base model.
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:19:59.720]   - They built an advance, right?
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:00.680]   - They have a lot of them.
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:01.920]   - Yeah, but it sounds like immediately
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:03.360]   if you ordered anything but the build to order,
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:05.400]   you were already gonna be late July or early August.
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.320]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.280]   - This is a, I mean--
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:08.920]   - By the way, did not push the buy button.
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:10.160]   I'm just, I played with it.
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:11.240]   - Yeah, I mean, it's fun.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.840]   It's fun to put things in your cart,
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:13.680]   put in the bag.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:15.360]   - See, it's still in the bag.
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:18.080]   - Yeah, it's still in the bag there.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:22.160]   Just waiting, waiting for me to come along and check out.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.320]   But I ain't gonna do it.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.920]   Also chose midnight blue, you might know.
[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.880]   - Yeah, it's the best.
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:30.760]   - Just in case you're curious, max it out, 2,500 bucks.
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:34.720]   I'm for an air, wow.
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:35.720]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:36.920]   - I'm thinking though--
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.000]   - Two terabytes.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:38.840]   - After, okay.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:39.680]   - You're working with me.
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:40.600]   - We talked about this last week, Renee,
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:44.160]   I think you bumped it after seeing the overheating problems
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:46.560]   with the MacBook Pro 13 M2.
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:49.040]   I kinda wanna wait till some people get the M2
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.400]   MacBook Air and find out.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.960]   Like Jason, find out what he thinks.
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.800]   - Yeah, I mean, that is the question is,
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.480]   there's no cooling in this at all.
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:58.200]   Although it was engineered, you know,
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.240]   this is a new enclosure, so they built it knowing
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:01.680]   what chip was gonna go in it.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:04.920]   And so they must know what the thermal profile is here.
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:07.400]   I think the truth is that if you're gonna press it,
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:08.920]   like that story last week,
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:10.560]   if you're gonna press it to that level,
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:12.440]   you probably shouldn't be buying a MacBook Air.
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:13.520]   - Or a MacBook Pro.
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:15.240]   - Or that 13 inch MacBook Pro,
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:16.800]   which should probably not be called a Pro.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.800]   - Wait for a studio or something.
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:18.800]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:24.000]   Yeah, as tempted as I am,
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.720]   it makes sense this chip would be hotter.
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:28.120]   It's got more transistors, it's bigger.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:32.400]   It's about 20% faster, so maybe 20% hotter.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.200]   So it makes sense.
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:37.360]   But again, the Pro did not have a redesigned chassis.
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:41.440]   So it's a hotter chip with the same cooling capabilities
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:44.680]   as the M1, presumably the MacBook Air
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:46.800]   being fully redesigned.
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:47.800]   - Also, let's be clear.
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:48.960]   I mean, the only way that that,
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.120]   I know Renee talked about this,
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:51.440]   but the only way that that overheating
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.440]   that throttling, not only did the throttling,
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.240]   it was still faster than the M1,
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:57.000]   but you have to max out the CPU
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.640]   and then max out the GPUs with a video render.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:03.640]   - Almost nobody will ever be in that situation.
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.480]   (laughing)
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:08.000]   And yeah, all of my M1 experiences have been,
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.040]   "Can I export 4K video and do a bunch of other things?"
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:13.720]   And it gets a little warm and that's about it.
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:16.480]   So I would anticipate it'll be kind of like that for the air.
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:20.040]   But you're right, you know, that's why we have product reviewers
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:22.000]   is to try this stuff out and say.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:26.240]   - Geekbench, some Geekbench benchmarks have started
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:30.400]   to emerge for the Mac 14, comma two.
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:34.520]   - Yeah, there's a number.
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:36.440]   - It's, I don't know what it means.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:38.640]   - It's the lesson we've learned.
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.120]   I mean, Andy knows this too.
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.080]   It's the lesson we've learned about the Apple Silicon
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:44.160]   is that the chip is the chip is the chip is the chip.
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.000]   They could put it in a different enclosure.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.320]   It's the chip.
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:49.160]   - 3.5, yeah. - M1 is an M1.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.760]   - Yeah, yeah. - An M2 is an M2.
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:52.160]   An M1 Pro is an M1 Pro.
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.680]   Like they don't really vary.
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:57.640]   All those M1s are exactly the same computer
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:58.480]   in a different wrapper.
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:01.480]   And I would be shocked if the M2s aren't the same.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.320]   - Yeah.
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.280]   - Yeah, that's a, we're gonna have to,
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.480]   I'm still, we're just entering the range
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:09.040]   in which Apple is gonna be expected to
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:11.480]   and can differentiate one model from the other.
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:14.640]   I mean, I am along with everybody else is wondering,
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:15.880]   okay, if this is what you can,
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:19.080]   if this is the capacity you can get inside a MacBook Air,
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.360]   largely because the thermals are so much better
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.760]   in this new generation of chips,
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.560]   was gonna define a MacBook Pro now.
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.400]   Is it going to be connectivity?
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:27.840]   Is it going to be size?
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:28.680]   Is it gonna be screen?
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:29.920]   Is it gonna be battery?
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.280]   Because honestly, it's hard to,
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:34.000]   if you really wanna dump a lot of money
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.400]   into a supremely powerful device
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.000]   that can do nearly everything you would want
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.160]   a mobile computer to do,
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.680]   MacBook Air is really there for at least 80%
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:44.520]   of the people out there.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.040]   So I'm hoping there's a revolution coming
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:46.880]   for the MacBook Pro.
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:47.720]   - Yeah.
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:51.200]   I mean, this is fun.
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.760]   According to these Geekbench results,
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:55.240]   the M2 MacBook Air outperforms the base model
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:58.720]   Mac Pro Tower, which costs $5,000 more.
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:03.040]   Yeah, that's got the Xeon W in it,
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:06.400]   but that's three years old, four years old.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:09.720]   - And let's not forget too, the classic story here is,
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:12.760]   nobody, almost nobody is upgrading from the M1 to the M2.
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:13.600]   - Right.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:14.440]   - They're going from Intel.
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:17.920]   They're gonna get the enormous leap in performance
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:21.200]   and battery life that you go from Intel to M1,
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:24.080]   and then a 15% bonus above that
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:26.160]   for the M2.
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:28.800]   So that's the true story here, right?
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.360]   More than anything else is that
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:33.520]   these are people coming from late generation Intel laptops.
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:36.480]   My wife is using a 2018 MacBook Air Intel,
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:41.040]   and it's a, you know, I used it the other day,
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.200]   and it's incredibly slow and it's miserable to use.
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:46.840]   So I'm really looking forward to getting her
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:48.360]   on Apple Silicon II,
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:49.640]   'cause it's gonna be a huge leap for her,
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:51.320]   even if she just goes to the M1,
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.800]   and then she goes to the M2,
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:54.560]   another 10% on top of that.
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:57.680]   - How could you let your wife still be on Intel?
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:59.560]   - I was waiting for this new MacBook Air to come out.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:00.960]   - Oh, okay then.
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:02.280]   So she's getting the midnight blue.
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:04.520]   - No, she's gonna get my M1 MacBook Air,
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:05.520]   and I'm gonna take the Intel.
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.600]   - No, I do the same thing to my wife.
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:07.920]   - Yeah, she's gonna get a little hand-me-down.
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:09.360]   - And that's when I say, oh, you know,
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.440]   the M1 is the M1 is the M1.
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:11.280]   - They're still selling it.
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.120]   - Yeah, yeah, they're all the same.
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:12.960]   - They're all good.
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:13.800]   - They're all good.
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:14.640]   - It's all silicon.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.720]   - You know what, they're not selling.
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:17.800]   The touch bar, it's vintage.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:21.520]   Now the first touch bar, MacBook Pro, it's vintage.
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.280]   - Does that have like wide lapels?
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:26.560]   - Yeah, acid washed MacBooks now.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:27.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:29.520]   - The first MacBook Pro with the touch bar
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:31.320]   has now been added to the vintage product list.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:34.680]   It also has a butterfly keyboard, so.
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:35.520]   - It's good stuff.
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.760]   - It's not never too soon to deprecate.
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:41.240]   I'm glad they're getting rid of the touch bar.
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:44.120]   That's the reason, other reason I invite M2 MacBook Pro 13
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.720]   'cause I don't want the touch bar.
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:47.440]   - I mean, do we know that for a fact?
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:48.760]   - Of course they're getting rid of the touch bar.
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:49.600]   - Of course they are.
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.720]   - I like kind of saying, well, you know,
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:53.160]   they haven't said they're getting rid of the touch bar.
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:54.800]   They still sell a touch bar.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.920]   They're making a computer with a touch bar today.
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:57.760]   - They made a brand new one.
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.600]   - In 2022?
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:00.520]   - Brand new one with a touch bar.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:03.880]   - They never, the code worded apple is never well.
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:05.480]   That didn't work out, so we're replacing it.
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:09.720]   It's like, we've made the MacBook Pro that everybody loves
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:11.880]   and we've made it so people love it even more.
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:12.720]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:15.720]   With function keys and not the touch bar.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:18.240]   The butterfly keyboard that everybody loves,
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.320]   we're in our third iteration of making people
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:21.240]   love it even more.
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.080]   - Okay.
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:25.480]   So Alex just had to take off, sorry about that,
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:29.600]   but thank God I've got Jason and Andy here.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.760]   I think they can pick up the slack.
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:33.680]   Is the queen okay?
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:34.520]   What news before?
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:37.000]   - I'm worried that Alex has gone into lockdown.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.320]   - I think the Pentagon called and--
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.880]   - Has London Bridge fallen?
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:43.600]   - Yes.
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:45.800]   London Bridge has fallen.
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.240]   Okay, so--
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:49.480]   (laughing)
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:53.160]   Anyway--
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:54.000]   - We were all thinking.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.120]   - Yeah, so you know.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:02.400]   Tony, sorry, Emmy Awards out and Apple has,
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:06.000]   I have to say I did not like the first round of Apple TV
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.920]   plus shows was not impressed by the morning show.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:14.240]   Even Ted Lasso was good, but not great.
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:15.880]   - Wow, you have no heart.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:16.720]   - No heart.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:17.560]   - I have no heart.
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:18.400]   - I have no heart.
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:19.240]   - I have the black heart.
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:20.080]   - That Lasso was great.
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:21.480]   - Oh, it wasn't great.
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:25.840]   But I have liked a lot, some of the new Apple TV plus stuff
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:27.520]   like Slow Horses.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:28.360]   - Very good.
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:29.200]   - Very, very good.
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.040]   They've done some--
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:30.880]   - Severance.
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.000]   - Severance, amazing.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.800]   So I feel like Apple, and this, you know what,
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:35.920]   what a surprise.
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:39.080]   They were brand new at this, took them a little while.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.080]   They started to gain some traction.
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:44.280]   The Hollywood Critics Association Awards,
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:46.760]   oh, I thought these were the Emmys.
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:48.400]   The most nominated streaming,
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.960]   who is this like the foreign press awards?
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:54.280]   Is this another Golden Globe kind of a thing?
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:57.280]   The Hollywood Critics Association
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:59.880]   gave Apple 53 nominations,
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:02.400]   the most nominated streaming service.
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:05.920]   Severance and Ted Lasso best drama, best comedy,
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.840]   12 nominations each.
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:10.280]   So obviously, I am just a Grinch,
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:13.080]   and Ted Lasso is in fact great.
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:15.720]   16 acclaimed programs, including,
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:17.680]   I'm reading from the press release, can you tell?
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:20.560]   Including major category recognitions for Acapulco,
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:23.560]   the after party, carpool, karaoke, the series,
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:26.480]   Central Park, Dickinson, the last days of "Tollamy Gray",
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:29.080]   the morning show, Pachinko, prehistoric planet,
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.840]   the problem with John Stewart, Shmingadoon,
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:34.360]   which unaccadably has been renewed.
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:35.640]   Did you watch Shmingadoon?
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:36.560]   - It was pretty funny, actually.
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:37.400]   - Okay, okay.
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:40.400]   - The parody of musicals. - It's a musical.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.720]   - Yeah, it was, the first episode was fun.
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:45.600]   - Yeah. - Wasn't gonna watch more than that.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:46.440]   - It goes on and that, it goes on and that.
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.080]   It's a very long, Saturday Night Live sketch, yeah.
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:50.040]   - Exactly, exactly. - What a funny one.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:51.880]   - I got the point. - You did get it.
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.200]   - I got the point. - They're in a musical league.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:54.880]   - They're in a musical league. - That's the, yeah.
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:57.880]   - Slow horses, we crashed, which by the way,
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:00.480]   another fantastic mini series.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.520]   - The Emmys did come out today, by the way.
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.520]   - So I'm reading the wrong list.
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:05.400]   - Yeah, so the Emmys came out,
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:07.760]   Ted Lasso got a nomination for Best Comedy,
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.280]   "Severns for Best Drama."
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:11.040]   So they did. - They kinda duplicated.
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:14.840]   - They did repeat in the top categories there.
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:16.200]   - Yeah, I apologize.
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:17.720]   I don't know how, I guess I was reading
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:19.680]   an Apple press release, there's my error.
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:21.160]   - Yeah, that's the answer.
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:24.800]   We should also recognize that the Hollywood,
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:27.320]   the Hollywood Critics Association,
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:29.200]   I think they have separate categories
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:31.520]   for network cable and streaming.
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:33.520]   - Oh, so they would do well in streaming.
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:34.720]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:37.560]   - I'm, yeah, see, best streaming documentary,
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:39.360]   best streaming reality show. - Yeah, yeah, okay.
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:40.280]   - Best, so.
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:42.720]   - So in the actual real awards,
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:44.600]   (laughing)
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:46.160]   the awards that you will put in the background
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:48.840]   when you're doing a video chat with somebody.
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:49.680]   - Precisely.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:51.680]   - The one you're gonna put on your mantle,
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:53.920]   succession big time, and I'm glad,
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:56.880]   'cause that is the best TV show that was ever made,
[01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:57.800]   the most nominations.
[01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:59.400]   - Yeah, "Severns" is in that drama category,
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:01.000]   that's a tough category, and Ted Lasso
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.680]   in the comedy category. - Yeah.
[01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:03.840]   - Also a tough category.
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:04.680]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:07.400]   - One last year for "Best Comedy,"
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:09.920]   it will face off against only murders in the building,
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.220]   the Steve Martin Martin shorts,
[01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:13.400]   Lina Gomez, vehicle,
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:16.200]   only murders in the building, 17.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:17.680]   Again, not a,
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:20.240]   I hope Steve's not listening, but not a great show.
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:23.600]   - Wow, the Grinch strikes again.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.160]   - I have a nice standard. - What did you say?
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:26.880]   - When you had your heart removed,
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:28.600]   do they fill it with like packing,
[01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:30.720]   or is it just a void that's with you all the time?
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:32.480]   - Netflix, three nominations.
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:37.040]   - But the best comedy on that list is "Hacks" on HBO Max.
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:38.200]   - I enjoyed "Hacks" - Fantastic.
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.760]   - Again, not a great show.
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.840]   - Oh man, you're just killing me.
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:42.680]   You're killing me.
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:43.960]   - I love Gene Smart.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:46.480]   - You're killing. - And it's great to see.
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:47.840]   - So what's the best comedy then?
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:49.040]   What's the best on that list?
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:49.880]   What's the best show on that list?
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:50.720]   - I mean, look at the list.
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:52.360]   I didn't see the list, so let me see.
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:53.360]   It ain't the white load, is it?
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:54.560]   - Berry. - Is that on the list?
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.000]   - Berry, no, Berry.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000]   Did you see the last episode of Berry?
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:58.960]   Kind of depressing.
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:30:59.960]   What else?
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:00.800]   Oh yes, we got it.
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:01.680]   - Curb your enthusiasm?
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:02.880]   - Season 90,000?
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:04.640]   - Yeah.
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:05.720]   - That's a long running--
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:07.040]   - What we do in the shadows is great.
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.360]   - Okay, what we do in the shadows.
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:09.360]   Love that show. - That would be up there
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:10.920]   for me. - That's a great show.
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:13.920]   - All right.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:16.040]   - But Apple getting awards.
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:16.880]   They love it. - They're in there.
[01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:17.720]   - You know they love it.
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:20.760]   - They're in the game. - They're in the game.
[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:22.960]   - That's it. - And that's all that really matters.
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:26.480]   Squid game, they're speaking of games.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:27.720]   Got a nomination.
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:29.880]   Stranger things, Ozark.
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:34.760]   All right, so those are the real awards.
[01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:37.640]   But Apple, how many did they get?
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:39.440]   A handful.
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:42.680]   - It's hard to find. - Yeah.
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:46.040]   - But yeah, it's also weird because I,
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:47.400]   I like most of America,
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:50.400]   seems to have gone away from broadcast television.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.640]   The only time I see it is when I'm picking out things
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:55.120]   to record for next week for my Plex DVR
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:57.480]   and sitcoms, they just don't exist
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:58.600]   on network television anymore.
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:02.280]   And their last, and dramas are now just down to
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:04.640]   whoever was on a nighttime drama 12 years ago
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.160]   playing a cop or a firefighter.
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:11.160]   So really is, this is the Kings Ransom for streaming platforms
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:12.720]   because this is where comedy is being made.
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:14.960]   This is where real drama is being made.
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:18.160]   - I am happy to see Ria Sehorn nominated
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:21.040]   for her fantastic role in Better Call Saul.
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:24.120]   - What a surprise. - Kim is.
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:27.360]   - She was, she's been ignored for many seasons,
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:31.680]   Kim Wexler, very, very good, finally getting her nomination.
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:32.640]   - I think, yeah.
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:35.600]   - Can I do a plug for the Apple TV show
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:37.360]   that we haven't mentioned and never gets mentioned
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:40.800]   and never gets put in awards is For All Mankind,
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:43.760]   which I think is actually spectacularly good
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:44.760]   and keeps getting better.
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:45.680]   - And keeps getting better.
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:46.640]   I think that's important.
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:48.200]   - I think season three is like, it's,
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:52.280]   it manages to be a family drama and also a space action
[01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:54.520]   drama at the same time.
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:56.640]   And it's real good people, if you haven't watched
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:59.720]   For All Mankind, you've got two full seasons
[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:02.280]   and half of season three already out there.
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:04.960]   And it's just, it's really good.
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:05.960]   - It's really good.
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:09.160]   - Alternative reality space program.
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.880]   - Yeah, the Russians got their first, which is right.
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:12.800]   - Yeah, and so everybody keeps their foot on the gas
[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.080]   in terms of space stuff.
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:14.920]   - Including China.
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:17.680]   - So it's not far, far, far, not so far future
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:19.920]   that it doesn't feel like it's connected to our reality
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.440]   'cause most, and 'cause most of the design is based on,
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:26.600]   well, what if the space shuttle EVE is EVA suit
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:29.480]   but if the same design and the same designers were being
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:32.000]   trying to build something else in the 1990s and 1980s.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.400]   - Yeah, it's the one that's set in the '70s,
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.360]   season two in the '80s and season three in the '90s.
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:36.600]   - I like that. - But they're going to Mars
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:37.600]   and 90s. - It's no space force,
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:38.600]   but it's okay.
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:39.600]   - Yeah.
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.600]   - Famous, famously, you don't even know what's real.
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:42.600]   - I don't even know.
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:44.160]   - I don't even know.
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:46.560]   (laughing)
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:51.840]   - Can I just warn you, Leo, if you thought that like Renee
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:53.840]   and I could really start disrupting the show,
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:56.440]   talking about like comics and pop culture,
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:00.000]   imagine Jason and I, that relationship plus another 15 years
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.280]   and this is the amount of trouble you're in,
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:02.320]   especially when Alex leaves.
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:05.520]   - Well, I already verified that Jason is not the comic book
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:08.480]   nerd that Renee is, so we're going to--
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:09.320]   - Fabulous on five.
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:10.920]   - But what we're going to--
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:13.520]   - Now lose the comic books we're going to gain in TV.
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:14.600]   - Now when the movie-- - In TV.
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:16.320]   - Yeah, well, I do know comic book stuff,
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:19.240]   but not like Renee, not even close, not even close.
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:21.440]   It's not-- - Well, maybe you could bone up.
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:23.000]   - All right, I'll get Renee to teach me.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.200]   - Okay, I really think the drops are going to be coming back
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:26.280]   in a big way in the reboot.
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.120]   - I really think so.
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:30.360]   - You know, you wear green and I wear purple.
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:31.720]   That's the drawsy way.
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:32.720]   We fight to the death.
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:35.200]   - My pastelier day.
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.600]   Nice to have you on the show.
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:40.600]   (laughing)
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:41.800]   - What else, what else?
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:42.640]   - What is happening?
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:43.480]   - What else is happening?
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:44.760]   What is happening to me?
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:49.600]   Midnight moves to mid-August,
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:52.640]   Space Grey models still the fastest option available
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:54.480]   if you want to get your MacBook Air.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.120]   - It's because Space Grey is the most boring
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:57.760]   of colors we've already established.
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:00.040]   - Yes, that's for boring people.
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:02.560]   Midnight is obviously the only option.
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:05.880]   - It's a good substrate for stickers.
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.280]   As a P2 dish in which we can grow a farm of stickers,
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:09.120]   it's great.
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:14.400]   - I am a little baffled and I'm definitely disappointed
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:16.560]   by those color selections on the MacBook Air.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:18.520]   I know you can't get your heart set on rumors.
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:20.520]   There were rumors that they were going to do the iMac colors
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:21.360]   on the MacBook Air.
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:23.040]   I would have loved to have seen that,
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:25.880]   but it's such a weird smattering of colors, right?
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:28.600]   'Cause it's silver in Space Grey, it's the old standards.
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:33.480]   And then they bring in the Starlight and the Midnight,
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:35.320]   but it's like, yes, as Andy said earlier,
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.400]   it's kind of different shades of gray.
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:40.760]   And I am a little surprised that they didn't choose
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:43.240]   one kind of popping color.
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:46.400]   'Cause the one color that is there for real is Midnight,
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:49.840]   but unless you're literally, 'cause at WWDC,
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:52.440]   I got to hold one, unless you're literally holding it
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:55.240]   so that the reflection bounces off the metal
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:58.520]   into your eyeballs, it just is black.
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:01.360]   Only when you can bounce it with just the right light,
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:02.800]   does it look blue at all?
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.760]   I just, I wish they had done something a little brighter,
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:06.520]   but maybe next time, maybe the supply chain.
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:07.600]   - It's subtle blue.
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.680]   - Let's blame the supply chain for it.
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:13.720]   - Also, getting a color right is amazingly hard.
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:17.480]   It's not just like picking a color out of a color palette
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:19.080]   offered by the manufacturer.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:21.360]   Getting it so that that can be formulated
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.960]   and reproduced exactly point, point, point, point, point
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.200]   as you're making.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:27.520]   That's, I mean, Apple does have the resources
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:29.040]   and I'm with you, Jason.
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:31.960]   One of the most exciting things about rumors
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:33.920]   about the MacBook Air was gonna be,
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:36.000]   if you want a purple one, just like you'll let them act.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.120]   If you want a purple one, get a purple one.
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.240]   You want a candy red one, get a candy red one.
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:41.040]   So I'm really hoping that they, at least,
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:42.400]   as the, when they're trying to,
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:44.440]   when they're not, they're in the middle of the cycle,
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:46.160]   they're not ready to update the hardware yet,
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:48.600]   but they're ready to get people who were on the fence
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:50.760]   to actually remember that they want to buy a MacBook Air.
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:51.600]   - Right.
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.600]   - Just like with the phone. - Now there's a red one.
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:54.440]   - Exactly.
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:56.880]   There's a whole commercial, but I hope they expand the palette.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:00.200]   - To be fair to Apple, the iMac and the MacBook Air
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:02.080]   are different, the iMac sits in a room,
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:03.960]   so you choose the color and you put it in a room
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:05.280]   and it is there.
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:07.120]   Whereas a laptop you're taken from place to place.
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:11.440]   So I can see an argument that maybe one,
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:14.000]   you have to get that color to work and wherever you take it
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.880]   and maybe it stands out in places the ways
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:17.000]   and ways you don't want.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.360]   And also you take your laptop in maybe professional context,
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:22.080]   maybe you don't want to stand out.
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:25.920]   It has been a very long time since Apple made a colorful laptop.
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:29.320]   They made that original iBook and they basically after that
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:31.280]   said no, we're gonna go to boring.
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:33.120]   And maybe there is an argument to be made
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:37.240]   that people don't, as much as people love the colorful iMac
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:39.040]   and might like it in their home,
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:41.080]   when it's their laptop that they're toting from place
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:42.760]   to place, maybe they don't want a bright blue laptop.
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:44.120]   - Here's my theory.
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:46.040]   People do like bright blue, but they also like bright red,
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:48.920]   they also like bright green and you're splitting those sales
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:51.840]   up into many skews and Apple does not like multiple skews.
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:53.120]   - Except the iMac.
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:54.800]   I mean, that's my counter argument is that they have
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:57.320]   seven colors as well as our six colors of iMac
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:59.120]   and then silver.
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:00.600]   - Silver is not a color.
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:03.640]   - I would buy a product with a red M2 MacBook Air today.
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:06.400]   If they had a product red, I would absolutely buy it.
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:08.000]   But also to be fair, it's not as though
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:08.960]   in the window side of things,
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.400]   we have a lot of adventure there either.
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:12.720]   So we just hope for more from Apple.
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:14.720]   - I do wonder if there's some laptop buying psychology
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:18.200]   that's fundamentally, I say I like bright colors,
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:20.560]   but when I put it in my bag and I'm going to a job interview,
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:23.200]   I actually don't want my bright purple laptop
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:26.000]   'cause everybody's gonna go, "Oh, what's with the purple laptop?"
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.360]   - Well, and also what is the percentage of laptop sales
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:30.720]   that are business versus personal?
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:32.720]   And it may be that, I'm sure a business
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:34.000]   isn't gonna want a color.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.080]   - They're not gonna make you buy a color.
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:37.680]   They'll make you do space gray,
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:38.920]   but I think there is the question of like,
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:40.640]   if nobody wants to buy a color
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:42.280]   because they just wanna be more conservative
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:43.120]   when they're out in the world.
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:44.840]   - There's a bunch of, somewhere.
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:46.800]   In Africa, there's a bunch of children
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:48.760]   with purple MacBooks.
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:52.080]   - Maybe, just by a shell if you want bizarre colors.
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:53.640]   - Yeah, that's what I do, right?
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:55.040]   Or get a skin or whatever.
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.840]   By the way, we counted, actually nine to five Mac counted,
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:01.160]   Apple TV plus 52 nominations.
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:03.840]   That's a lot, they had 34 nominations last year.
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:06.480]   So the Emmy committee obviously agrees,
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:09.160]   Apple is kind of on a roll.
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:11.800]   The morning show did not get nominated, thank you.
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:12.920]   Thank you, the worst show ever.
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:14.280]   - The actors did, actors did.
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:15.840]   - The actors did, but not from the strong.
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:17.240]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:20.760]   - By the way, apparently, I didn't know this,
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:22.120]   there's a commercials category,
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:25.560]   and Apple got nominated for two commercials,
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:28.560]   their iPhone 13 Pro Detectives one.
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:29.720]   That's a great commercial.
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:30.560]   - All right, with the focus.
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:33.640]   - For the rack, rack zoom focus on the detective.
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:35.800]   What if I were the leading character?
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:37.200]   What if I did the murder?
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:38.120]   That was a great one.
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:39.640]   - Why am I blurred?
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:40.480]   - Yeah.
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:41.320]   - Well, 'cause you're just a background character.
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:42.800]   - That is one of the best commercials of the year,
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:43.680]   absolutely.
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:47.240]   And then I don't remember this, everyone, but John Hamm.
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:49.560]   - Oh yeah, that's the one where John Hamm is watching TV
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:51.880]   and seeing promos for Apple TV and is very upset.
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:52.720]   - He's not in it.
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:53.560]   - He's not in any of them.
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:56.400]   (laughing)
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:58.920]   - Little self-referential severance got a lot
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:01.960]   of nominations, which is great as did Ted Lasso.
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:05.120]   Didn't see a lot of nominations for Foundation.
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:06.320]   In fact, as far as I could tell,
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:08.040]   the only nomination for Foundation
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:11.160]   was for outstanding main title design.
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:12.600]   - They have special effects.
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:14.760]   - Oh, they get special effects too, but that's about it.
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:15.920]   - Yeah.
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:18.920]   - Foundation, not one of Apple's best.
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:21.880]   Finally, before we get to our picks,
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:23.920]   did they tell you that we do picks of the week every week?
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:24.760]   - I already knew.
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:25.600]   - You knew that?
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:26.440]   - Okay.
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:27.280]   - I've done on before.
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:28.120]   I know it works.
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:28.960]   - Just teasing.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:29.800]   - What up?
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:30.640]   - What up pro.
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:31.480]   (clapping)
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:32.320]   - I should have made this my pick of the week.
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:33.280]   If you play Oregon Trail on Apple,
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:34.600]   arcade, and who doesn't,
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:40.760]   you will like knowing that the new Oregon Trail Apple Watch app
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:43.440]   will track your steps for in-game progress.
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:46.640]   So they'll actually tell you how close to Oregon you are
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:49.120]   if you wanted to visit your ducks.
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:50.360]   You could walk there.
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:54.360]   I think it's kind of a great idea.
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:55.440]   Include steps.
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:56.280]   - Health app.
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:57.680]   - The health app can also tell you
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:40:59.120]   how close you are to having dysentery.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:00.120]   (laughing)
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:02.720]   - You have died of dysentery.
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:07.480]   So let me play this trailer for the Oregon Trail.
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:08.680]   Here you are walking.
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:10.480]   No oxen, no problem.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:12.200]   (laughing)
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:15.320]   Transform your daily walks into,
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:16.160]   and we'll share pushes.
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:19.200]   It runs into a westward journey.
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:21.200]   So you can find out how close you are to
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:25.480]   2,000 miles all the way across the country.
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:26.680]   I think that's great.
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:28.720]   You've arrived at Fort Kearney.
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:30.560]   - I love that idea.
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:33.960]   - This was like an Apple basic app.
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:35.720]   Like in 1978, like,
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:36.800]   - Right, on your Apple too.
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:37.640]   - Yeah.
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:39.160]   - Who would have guessed that it's still around
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:40.440]   like 40 years later.
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:41.440]   - That's a nice and cool. - It's a nice and cool
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:42.280]   heritage man.
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:43.880]   - Yeah, it's really awesome.
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:44.720]   It actually makes,
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:46.880]   I am too old to have played Oregon Trail
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:47.720]   in grade school.
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:48.560]   You played.
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:50.640]   - I think I just missed it.
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:52.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:53.920]   Our kids probably did.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:57.520]   But in fact, I remember when Abby went to kindergarten,
[01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:59.000]   there were still some Apple twos.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:41:59.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:00.680]   - In the classroom.
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:02.640]   - They lasted a lot longer than you might think.
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:05.080]   - So she probably played Oregon Trail.
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:05.960]   All right, we're gonna take a break
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:07.600]   and then come back with your picks of the week.
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:09.120]   Again, Alex had to take off.
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:12.280]   Sorry, unexpectedly, the president called
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:13.280]   and you know how that is.
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:15.200]   When the phone goes off, you've got to run.
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:17.120]   - The bat phone was engaged.
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:20.120]   (imitates
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:20.960]   the sound of the phone)
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:21.760]   The reason why you're seeing yourself
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:23.800]   and not your grandkids is you got the selfie camera.
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:25.320]   Look for the button that,
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:26.800]   sir, give me the phone, sir.
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:27.640]   Hang on.
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:28.480]   (laughing)
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:29.320]   I think you're right.
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:30.160]   Oh my God.
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:32.400]   You're muted.
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:38.240]   This episode of Mac Break Weekly brought to you by
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:40.200]   Express VPN.
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:43.080]   Okay, sure, you can use lockdown mode.
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:45.240]   But you know, as you go online
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:48.600]   and do those Google searches or visit those websites,
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:52.880]   even in lockdown mode, they know exactly who you are.
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:57.720]   And your phone carrier knows exactly where you're going.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:01.080]   Going, in fact, Verizon has even admitted to it.
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:04.960]   They say, "It's so we can better understand your interests."
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:07.120]   We want to know what you buy at the grocery store
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:09.960]   so we can better understand your interests.
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:11.960]   Really, all they do really is sell those interests
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:15.560]   to advertisers, stuff like the sites you visited,
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:17.200]   things you've been up to online.
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:21.760]   You may be a lot more privacy than that.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.560]   Maybe you want to use Express VPN.
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:25.600]   It's the only VPN I use.
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:27.200]   Partly because I could put it everywhere.
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:31.920]   Smart TVs, phones, computers, even on some routers.
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:34.520]   And Express VPN is so fast if you put it on the router
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:35.680]   to protect your whole household.
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:37.120]   Nobody's going to complain.
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:40.160]   You can watch HD video because they invest in the network.
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:41.840]   And I look for that in a VPN provider.
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.520]   There's some things I really look for.
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:46.200]   One is they do not log.
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:48.240]   And this is a very important one.
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:51.800]   Because after all, if you're trying to avoid being spied on
[01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:53.760]   and then your VPN provider spies on you,
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:57.160]   you haven't done anything to improve your privacy.
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:59.320]   Not only does Express VPN not log,
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:01.200]   they go to extra lengths not to log.
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:02.400]   In fact, there was a great article
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:05.280]   in a bleeping computer a couple of months ago
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:08.160]   about how Express VPN protects your privacy.
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.520]   They created something called trusted server
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:13.120]   and open source VPN server.
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:15.320]   It runs in RAM.
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:17.040]   It's sandbox cannot write to disk
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:19.360]   so they couldn't log if they wanted to.
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:22.880]   Furthermore, they run a specially constructed
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:27.200]   Debian installation that automatically refreshes itself
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:29.880]   every day, wipes the home drive.
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:33.240]   So there are zero logs of what you've been doing online.
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:36.440]   So not only do you not have to worry about your ISP spying on you,
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:39.000]   you don't have to worry about a government agency.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.600]   And in some countries, they don't knock.
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.760]   They just come and they take the servers.
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:45.440]   There's nothing on it.
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:48.400]   Express VPN protects your privacy,
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:50.920]   allows you to watch videos all over the world
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:53.480]   without geographic restriction.
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:54.880]   And they invest in their network
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:56.240]   in a couple of ways that are so important.
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:58.520]   I mentioned bandwidth, that's really important.
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:00.680]   But they also rotate their IP addresses.
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:01.600]   That's super important.
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:04.360]   If you want to eliminate geographic restrictions,
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:07.160]   because people don't know, Google doesn't know, no one knows,
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:10.280]   that, oh, I know that's an Express VPN IP address.
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:11.400]   No, they don't.
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:14.400]   They're constantly updating their IP addresses.
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:16.440]   And whether you're an iPhone, Android, tablet user,
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:19.520]   whatever Express VPN works on all of your devices.
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:22.840]   And somebody asked me this and I'm glad to let you know,
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:26.440]   one subscription can be used on five devices at the same time.
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:31.440]   So no problem, get the whole family using Express VPN.
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:36.720]   Express VPN is the only way to protect yourself online.
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:38.560]   The only VPN I use and recommend.
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:40.560]   When your phone carrier tracks you,
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:42.600]   that's a gross invasion of privacy.
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:44.600]   You can keep letting them cash in on you,
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:48.640]   or you can visit expressvpn.com/macbreak
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:50.000]   to get the same VPN I use.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.360]   Take back your online privacy today.
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:54.360]   If you use our link, you'll get three months free
[01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:55.720]   with a one year package.
[01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:58.640]   That's the best deal, a little bit less than seven bucks a month.
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:00.440]   I think that's a really fair price to pay.
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:03.280]   You want to pay for a VPN,
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:05.560]   because you want to be the customer, not the product, right?
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:10.560]   Expressvpn.com/macbreak.
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:16.840]   They are committed to your privacy and security Express VPN.com/macbreak.
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:19.840]   We thank them so much for their support.
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:24.200]   Of Mac break weekly, and of course, if you want to support us,
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:26.000]   very important use those addresses
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.120]   that the advertisers give you so that they know you saw it here.
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:35.040]   Ooh, I got a pick of the week.
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:39.560]   Prime day, air tags, four pack, 85 bucks.
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:42.040]   Yeah, not really.
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:43.520]   Oh. (laughs)
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:44.520]   You can stock all kinds of people.
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:45.440]   Such a deal.
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:47.000]   Such a deal.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.520]   I bought four when they came out.
[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:51.520]   25 bucks each, 100 bucks for four.
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:53.440]   I keep one of my bag when I travel.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:55.280]   Don't lose it.
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:56.160]   Yeah, in case you lose one.
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:59.160]   I kept one to Lisa, I kept two.
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:00.840]   I gave one to Lisa and then one to Michael,
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:01.680]   and they put it in there.
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:05.080]   I think they put it in their bags, which is good.
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:07.520]   I wish it was small, thin enough to put my wallet.
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:10.840]   But that's life.
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:13.520]   Andy, your pick of the week this week.
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:15.480]   Just one quick peek back on what you just said.
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:16.920]   I mean, it is quote prime,
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:18.600]   weak, unquote that a lot of other companies
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:19.480]   are getting in the back of.
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:21.640]   I don't like to promote rampant consumerism
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:23.280]   just because of marketing.
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:26.200]   But I do have that kind of bookmark my mind
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:27.920]   because for the past three months,
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:30.800]   every time I was looking at a phone charger,
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:32.000]   I was about to put my laptop back,
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.200]   say, "Yeah, I kind of want to replace it
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:35.360]   "with a GAN charger," or the times where it's like,
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:39.000]   "Oh geez, I really need a 512 gig memory stick,"
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.400]   or USB stick.
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:42.480]   That's when you wait because anchor usually has
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:43.880]   like a store wide sort of sale,
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:45.440]   sand disc, well, like a store wide sale.
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:48.360]   So that's what I kind of like to recommend
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:49.600]   for that kind of stuff.
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:50.880]   But my actual pick of the week,
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:53.240]   we were talking about James Webb Telescope,
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:55.640]   which is a good time as an enemy to remind people
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:57.680]   how the great work that Phil Plait,
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:00.400]   the astronomer does in astronomy communication
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:03.400]   and talking about every scientific advance,
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:04.440]   everything that's interesting,
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:05.880]   everything that's relatable,
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:06.720]   it's so funny.
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:07.560]   It's an unrelatable,
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:10.320]   we should mention this because I was gonna email Phil
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:12.760]   to get him on our coverage this morning.
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:14.840]   Then I realized that NASA had plenty of astronomers
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:18.520]   to talk about it, but Phil is the bad astronomer.
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:20.120]   He's the best astronomer.
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:20.960]   I love him.
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:23.640]   Yeah, he's, I'm sure he regrets,
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:26.280]   I've known him for like 15 years too.
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:28.920]   Yeah, 'cause he, you remember he started off
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:32.240]   as a blog of just like looking at astronomy
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:34.040]   in movies and TV shows and say,
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:36.720]   "Well, that's bad, bad depictions of astronomy,"
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:38.680]   but now he's like known as the bad astronomer,
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:40.720]   but it does mean that if he's the best astronomer--
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:42.560]   He is, he's amazing.
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:43.400]   They're funny.
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:45.760]   No, he's, I mean, he is, he is great.
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:47.800]   Again, there are people who are scientists
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:49.720]   who share their enthusiasm
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:52.480]   and they're like, they're people who don't have
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:56.480]   a lot of experience who can talk to you at your own level.
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:58.920]   Phil is one of those few scientists that he's got all,
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:01.440]   he knows, he can understand all the papers.
[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:03.600]   He understands not just the pretty pictures
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:06.440]   of these pictures, but also here's what it means,
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:07.440]   here's what it opens up,
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:09.120]   here's what you're actually looking at.
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:11.240]   So just Google bad astronomy, it will,
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:13.360]   we'll show you a blog on the Sci-Fi channel,
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:16.400]   it will show you an Instagram, it will show you a Twitter.
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:19.600]   Also, he has adorable, he has adorable horses
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:20.640]   and a little ghost on his phone.
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:21.640]   Yeah.
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:22.560]   (laughs)
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:23.600]   Well, you both know Phil.
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:25.920]   Oh yeah, I mean, I only emailed him a couple of times,
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:27.600]   but I've been a fan for more than a decade.
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:28.920]   Huge, he's great.
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:31.160]   And he does have a blog post on Sci-Fi.com
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:36.160]   on the first images from the James Webb Space Telescope.
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:38.560]   It's really, really exciting.
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:43.160]   And his enthusiasm, of course, is completely communicable.
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:48.320]   I have just been informed, this is your 20th appearance.
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:49.440]   A Mac break weekly.
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:50.280]   Oh, who knew?
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:51.840]   I thought you were the new guy.
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:54.120]   Well, I made a lot of appearances back in the day,
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:57.560]   and then I started getting used on Twitch a lot.
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:59.760]   We love you so much, we put you on the big boy show.
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:03.200]   And it was also easier to get up here on the weekend,
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:05.120]   I think maybe was part of it too.
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:07.080]   But yeah, 20 times on Mac break weekly, who knew?
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:08.080]   I just, I didn't.
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:10.400]   Jason, I am so thrilled to have you.
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:13.520]   I wanted to get you on this show forever and ever and ever.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:14.960]   Well, I'm happy to oblige.
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:17.560]   There aren't many people who would fill Renee Richie's shoes,
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:20.280]   so we're so thrilled to have you on a regular basis.
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:22.200]   Jason will be in studio whenever he can,
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:26.240]   but often on Zoom, just like everybody else, that's fine.
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:28.800]   I mean, don't you love being surrounded by TVs?
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:30.040]   I don't mind it at all.
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:32.080]   I really don't want to have anybody around me.
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:32.920]   All right, well, I'm out of here.
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:33.760]   I'd like to be alone.
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:36.640]   Now, what's your before you do that, your pick of the week?
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:39.960]   Well, since I'm new here, I get to replay some of my favorites
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:42.360]   and tell people about them who may not know about them.
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:46.040]   In this case, it is an app called Swift Bar, which is free.
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:48.520]   There's another app that's very much like a called X-Bar.
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:51.440]   These are apps that live in your menu bar.
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:52.440]   That's what they do.
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:54.280]   And what do they show?
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:56.600]   Anything you want.
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:58.640]   That's why it's such a scant web page.
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:00.400]   No, you've got to click to go through the bar.
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:00.960]   It's a good--
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:02.240]   It's like a GitHub page.
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:04.720]   You've got a great review at sixcolors.com.
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:05.600]   That's probably where you should go.
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:07.320]   You can see it there, and there's a screenshot down there.
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:09.920]   The idea here is you can take anything that runs a script.
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:10.880]   It can be an Apple script.
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:11.760]   It could be a Shell script.
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:12.680]   It could be a Java script.
[01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:13.840]   It could be a Pearl script.
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:14.920]   It could be a Python script.
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:17.040]   It doesn't matter.
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:20.360]   What Swift Bar does is it runs the script.
[01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:23.520]   You put the-- how often you want it to run in the file name,
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:26.600]   and it puts the results in the menu bar.
[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:29.000]   And you can have as many of these plugins as you want.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.960]   So it can do something like be a Shell script that
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:35.120]   does an Apple script request to the music app
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:37.360]   to query it about what song is playing
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:41.120]   and what the show art is or the album art.
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:43.520]   So if you really want a giant menu bar--
[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:44.840]   Yeah, I don't.
[01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:47.000]   But I do use the temperature.
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.480]   So I've got a weather station at home.
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:49.160]   I love that.
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:52.560]   And I am querying my weather station every five minutes or so,
[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:54.960]   and it puts the current temperature in my backyard in there.
[01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:58.200]   But literally, if you are a nerd and have the ability
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:00.960]   to do scripting of any kind, as long as you
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:03.440]   can get that script to output text,
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:06.640]   and Swift Bar has a very specific format of what
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:09.880]   goes in the menu bar and what goes in the menu item
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:11.240]   when you click on it.
[01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:13.840]   It's got a plugin system so you can download plugins
[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:15.040]   that other people have written.
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:16.280]   You can make your own.
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:17.960]   And then they just hang out in the menu bar.
[01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:20.600]   So yeah, I've got one that shows the air quality
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:22.200]   and one that shows the temperature.
[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:23.760]   And if you click on it, I actually
[01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:25.880]   have one that shows me the forecast.
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:29.000]   I'm actually querying Apple's weather kit API, their web API
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.720]   that they just opened up and generating a little chart
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:36.000]   and displaying that when you click on the menu bar item.
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.760]   So basically, if you ever wanted to have some ambient data
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:43.800]   on your Mac menu bar and you are capable of running
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:46.520]   and writing a script in some language,
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:49.160]   you can use Swift Bar to put it in your menu bar.
[01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:49.720]   And I love it.
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:52.560]   This is one of my favorite things is just little basic ambient
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:54.680]   data hanging out in my Mac menu bar.
[01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:56.400]   And it looks like there's some plugins as well.
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:57.200]   There's lots of them.
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:59.920]   Swift Bar and X Bar both have a whole bunch of community
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:01.240]   generated plugins.
[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:03.520]   I think this started as an app called Bit Bar, which sort
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:06.400]   of morphed into X Bar and Swift Bar was a replacement for Bit
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:07.040]   Bar.
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:09.240]   So the guy who wrote it was wanting to track
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:10.480]   like Bitcoin prices.
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:12.800]   But the fact is he very quickly realized
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:14.480]   it could literally do anything.
[01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:17.560]   And it's got support for SF symbols, Apple's symbol library.
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:20.800]   So you can very easily just have your script write out
[01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:22.240]   the name of an SF symbol.
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:24.200]   And it puts the symbol in your menu bar.
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:27.360]   So you can make them look pretty great pretty quickly.
[01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:28.680]   And there's other terminology.
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:31.760]   If you want color or you want it to be a hyperlink so that when
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:33.800]   you pull down on the menu and select something,
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:34.680]   where does it take you?
[01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:36.520]   And the script can generate all of that.
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:39.800]   Swift Bar dot app.
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:43.160]   The only thing I hate about the new MacBooks is the notch,
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:46.040]   which takes a big chunk out of my menu bar.
[01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:50.120]   I actually have to use Bar Tender so that I can use my menu bar
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:53.280]   because I'll add stuff and it just disappears under the notch.
[01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:55.000]   So I presume this works with Bar Tender.
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.200]   It does works great with Bar Tender.
[01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:57.120]   Perfect.
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:57.600]   You can do.
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:53:59.560]   In fact, I use Bar Tender with it.
[01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:02.600]   So some of my ambient things are always visible and others
[01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:06.560]   are only visible when I mouse up to see them, which works great.
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:08.920]   But it's like the best part is that it's so simple.
[01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:09.600]   It's dead simple.
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:12.320]   In the end, the output is just some text in a format
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:14.840]   that Swift Bar specifies.
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:17.440]   And what that means is whatever you're comfortable with,
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:20.080]   I had one that fired off an Apple script.
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:22.440]   It could be-- it doesn't have to be one.
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:24.040]   So many of these tools that we get,
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:26.000]   so many different macro languages and third party apps,
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.280]   they're like, you have to use JavaScript,
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:31.240]   or you have to use whatever we determine.
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:32.440]   And Swift Bar doesn't care.
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:33.600]   It really doesn't care.
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.840]   As long as you can execute it, it'll work.
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:37.440]   Yeah.
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:40.320]   What do you code your Swift Bar plugins in?
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:42.320]   These days, I'm mostly using Python.
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:45.960]   I taught myself Python last year, and I really like it.
[01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:47.920]   Now I'm realizing that there are a lot of apps that
[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:50.280]   want JavaScript, and I'm terrible at JavaScript.
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:51.760]   Oh, don't learn JavaScript.
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:55.080]   By no enough to be dangerous, but Python is what I prefer
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:55.560]   these days.
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:56.360]   It used to be Apple script.
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:56.800]   I started.
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:54:58.040]   It was all like Apple scripts.
[01:54:58.040 --> 01:54:58.760]   Oh, I was saying.
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:54:58.920]   Yeah.
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:02.160]   But now it's mostly Python.
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:02.840]   Jason.
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:03.640]   Snow.
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:06.360]   We got a guy here in the seat.
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:07.360]   I'm really happy.
[01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:08.920]   It's really great to have you, Jason.
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:09.480]   It's great to be here.
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:12.000]   Sixcolors.com.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.200]   He will put his podcasts there, or Relay.fm.
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:16.720]   We'll work on that API.
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:18.520]   Incompable.com.
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:21.840]   And we will-- of course, Jason's always
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:24.000]   had a page on the Twitter people page,
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.160]   but we'll make sure that we add all the podcasts there.
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:26.520]   Oh, so many.
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:27.960]   They're not already there.
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:28.440]   Yeah.
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:29.800]   I'll just plug a different one every week.
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:31.720]   And in about six months, we'll get to the end of the year.
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:33.120]   Maybe.
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:34.520]   If I haven't started new ones by then.
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:37.360]   GBH, the three letters you need to know,
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:40.960]   if you want to hear a not go, win.
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:44.280]   Next Friday at 12.50, usual time PM,
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:47.800]   as I'm going to be back at the Boston Public Library studios.
[01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:48.720]   And there's a coffee shop.
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:49.560]   They got sandwiches.
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:51.480]   You have to pay for the coffee and the sandwiches and cookies.
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:52.480]   But sit down.
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:53.120]   Have a great time.
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:55.080]   Enjoy the Boston Public Library.
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:58.160]   Check out also the-- they also keep the live streams both
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:02.480]   on wgbasinews.org, but also on their YouTube channel.
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:08.360]   Last week on July 8th, had a great conversation
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:12.880]   with WGBH's arts editor about AI that generates art.
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:14.840]   That was like--
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:17.200]   but no, no, let's not go to the mayor.
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:19.000]   I know we have to interview him, but let's keep talking.
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.600]   This was a great conversation.
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:23.000]   So yeah, we have a lot of fun there.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.200]   Awesome.
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:25.160]   Thank you for being here.
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:30.240]   Somebody says every week, ask Andy about his blog.
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:34.200]   I can-- I have a-- I now have a target date.
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:37.000]   It is now actually up and working.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.080]   And now we're doing that as Jason might be able to appreciate.
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:41.920]   Now it's like, oh, but I want people who
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:43.560]   want to give me money to give me money.
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:45.320]   How do I wire that up?
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:47.880]   And I'm getting put it, but it's that the solution has been
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:48.520]   selected.
[01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:50.240]   Now someone is helping me out with that.
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:51.840]   And we're roaring a bar open up.
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:56.680]   I was hoping to have it up and running in time for WWDC,
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:57:00.200]   but also telling myself that it has to be ready to go.
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:02.720]   I don't want to be one of those things where, oh, don't try
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:03.400]   to do this yet.
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:04.160]   Oh, sorry.
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:05.680]   You shouldn't have clicked on that.
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:07.920]   But yeah, I want to make one announcement.
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:10.360]   And then you will see all the content I've
[01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:11.840]   been making for it for a long time.
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:14.680]   It was just in the debate about it.
[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:16.120]   Your view and Jason, of course, are
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:20.200]   going to be on the beta list once I can show it to people who
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:25.720]   could say, yeah, that term is not really relevant anymore.
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:29.640]   Now that Coball is no longer the predominant scripting
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:30.140]   language.
[01:57:30.140 --> 01:57:32.680]   You might want to take that out that master.
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:37.800]   But I H N, I have no idea how to spell an echo, but you do
[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:38.160]   now.
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:44.760]   I H N A T K O dot com steadily slouching toward Bethlehem.
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:47.920]   Is that the title or just a place holder?
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:48.560]   Just a place holder.
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:52.120]   No, no, but the fun thing is that the place holder that I
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:54.680]   had would turn out to be the real name because like, oh, that's
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:55.360]   kind of snappy.
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:55.600]   Great.
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:56.160]   Let's see.
[01:57:56.160 --> 01:58:02.440]   SSTB, I thank you, Jason, for not only being on the show today,
[01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:04.880]   but you participated in our Discord, which is wonderful.
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:06.400]   Thank you.
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:09.520]   A lot of back and forth in the Discord.
[01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:12.240]   Now the Discord is one of the ways you can chat with us.
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:16.680]   We have an IRC as well, IRC dot TV, which Jason was--
[01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:18.040]   did you get in there?
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:18.760]   Yeah, I did.
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:20.400]   Because he was looking for an iPad app.
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:20.920]   What did you end up in?
[01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:21.560]   I ended up--
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:23.760]   Well, I already had been using Kolokwee back in the day.
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:24.960]   Yeah, like Kolokwee.
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:26.400]   Yeah.
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:28.320]   You can also use the website IRC dot
[01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:31.280]   twit dot TV and that works fine as well.
[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:32.680]   If you'd like to be in the Discord,
[01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:35.880]   and I'd like to invite you to do that, very simple.
[01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:37.480]   You just have to join Club Twit.
[01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:39.320]   Now, it does cost you money, $7 a month.
[01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:40.360]   But what do you get for that?
[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:41.120]   A lot.
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:43.680]   Add free versions of all of our shows,
[01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:47.000]   access to the Discord, which is not just a place to chat
[01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.400]   about the shows during the shows, but really,
[01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:53.520]   conversations about everything from coding to camping
[01:58:53.520 --> 01:59:00.520]   to travel to sport to hardware, IoT, sci-fi.
[01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:02.320]   Stacey's Book Club is in there.
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:04.360]   We have the Untitled Linux Show in there.
[01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:07.560]   And we use it to launch new shows.
[01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:10.480]   This week in Space launched in our Club Twit Discord.
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:12.480]   We've got another one coming up with one
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:15.280]   of our favorite hosts.
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:17.320]   And you also get the Twit Plus feed, which
[01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:19.280]   has material that wasn't in these shows.
[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:22.440]   But what would have been on the cutting room floor,
[01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:24.480]   but is now part of the Twit Plus feed.
[01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:27.520]   All of that at twit.tv/clubtwit.
[01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:30.320]   There's monthly, there's annual, there's corporate memberships.
[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:32.240]   And it's pretty important to us at this point.
[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:36.720]   It really-- we've really helped us develop new programming.
[01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:39.400]   We have a pretty lofty goal for new programming.
[01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:40.200]   We'd like to do it.
[01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:42.400]   But of course, when something shows brand new,
[01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:44.960]   there's no advertising for it.
[01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:48.600]   So you and your support in the club really make that possible.
[01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:49.560]   Thank you.
[01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:51.000]   Thank you very much.
[01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.080]   Actually, I think Alex is our next event.
[01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:56.680]   Yeah, Thursday, 9 AM.
[01:59:56.680 --> 01:59:59.520]   Ask me anything with Mr. Lindsey.
[01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:01.960]   And then July 28, the members fireside chat.
[02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:05.120]   And prove it as the community manager in the Club Twit.
[02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:06.560]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:07.760]   Thank you in advance.
[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:09.240]   I will not be here next week.
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:13.600]   Micah Sargent is going to host Jason and Ian Alex,
[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:17.440]   because we're doing our Twit Cruise next week.
[02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:20.960]   I was been saying 103, but I think there's 120 people.
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:21.920]   It's a big group.
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:23.120]   You used to do the Geek Cruises.
[02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:23.600]   Absolutely.
[02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:24.120]   Those are fun.
[02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:25.160]   Those were a lot of fun.
[02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:27.320]   Had some good-- yeah, good times with Andy on the boat.
[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:28.200]   And he's done those too.
[02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:29.280]   On the Macmania, yeah.
[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:31.280]   So maybe we're bringing back Geek Cruises
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:32.960]   in some form or fashion.
[02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:33.560]   Nice.
[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:34.800]   The Twit Cruises.
[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:37.720]   We're going up to Alaska, Paul Therat and his wife, Lisa
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:41.080]   and I. The Alaska Cruise leaves Saturday.
[02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:43.160]   We'll be going up to Seattle on Thursday,
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:45.280]   and then taking off on Saturday.
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:48.400]   So I'm going to miss the whole weekend and the next weekend.
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:49.800]   I'll be back on the 24th.
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:52.160]   So I'm only going to miss one Mac break weekly.
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:53.640]   Thanks in advance, Micah, for doing that.
[02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:55.800]   You'll be able to watch Tuesday-- in fact, every Tuesday,
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:01:01.240]   11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern, 1800 UTC, the live stream, audio
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:05.240]   or video-- is it twit.tv/live?
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:08.760]   If you're watching live, as I said, chat at irc.twit.tv
[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:10.760]   or in the club Twit Discord.
[02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:12.560]   Yes, we're going to get a new hero image there.
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:16.520]   We have to use the Magic Eraser in a race--
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:18.280]   Renee Ritchie.
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:19.240]   That's what we could do.
[02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:20.080]   I think we could do it.
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:21.360]   We have a win.
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:25.000]   The three thing is, with iOS 16, we can just drag Jason off
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.480]   of one picture and just put him right on top.
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:28.960]   Have the Jason outline.
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:33.800]   There is also at that website, there
[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:36.920]   are copies of the show with the ads in, of course,
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:40.360]   but they're free at twit.tv/mbw.
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:44.080]   There's also a YouTube channel dedicated to Mac break weekly.
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:45.960]   And the easiest way to get the show,
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:49.360]   like any podcast, subscribe in your favorite podcast player.
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:51.720]   Do me a favor if you do subscribe.
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:52.840]   Leave a five star review.
[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:57.160]   Let the world know about Mac break weekly now
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:01.640]   in its 17th year of macking and breaking.
[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:02.960]   That's it for us.
[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:06.040]   Now get back to work because break time is over.
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:08.600]   Bye bye.
[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:10.960]   Is that an iPhone in your hand?
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:11.640]   Wait a second.
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:14.440]   Is that an Apple watch on your wrist?
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:17.520]   And do I see an iPad sitting there on the table?
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:20.880]   Oh my goodness, you are the perfect person
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:24.760]   to be watching iOS today, the show where Rosemary Orchard
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:26.960]   and I, Mike, Sergeant talk all things.
