[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   We couldn't do to it without it.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly, the show where we cover Macintosh,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Apple, Pods of all kinds, anything beginning with an "I".
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   I'm Leo LaPorte and joining me right now are Andy Enochko from the Chicago Sun Times
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   and the CelestialWasteofBandwidth.com.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   And whoever else I am, I'm pairing in my ears today.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   I don't know whether it's something that you're streaming right now
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   or whether an open tab has decided to basically...
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   It miraculously disappear?
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Yeah, it did.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And it was me.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   I was so confused.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I was closing all my windows trying to figure out what that was going on.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Exactly.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   It was so apologize.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   There's a great Firefox plugin that they could charge $100 for and I would pay it.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   It's the one that makes sure that YouTube videos do not automatically start playing.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   When saved tabs or whenever it gets restored, it's like, oh, good God.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Every time I restart, it's...
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   There actually is one.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   And every time I complain because you hear a lot of stray sound on the show
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   because I'm always opening Firefox and tabs are opening and, you know,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   and it is called, I think, No Flash.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   But it stops the flash from playing automatically.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   You have to actively click it and I really should always have it turned on.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I apologize for not.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Because I always have tabs open, playing crap.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   That's okay, Leo.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   That was almost symbolic of all the chatter going around.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   It's all this democracy flies back and forth.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Oh, it is.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   It existed our election day.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Oh, isn't it?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Those are the voices of America you're hearing.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And silence them.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Any other day.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   But today, we can silence them pretty easily, but not today.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Today there are laws against that.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Oh, it's very, very exciting.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And I know that some people are looking forward to the result with grim determination,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   others with joy, but it is an amazing thing that we do every four years.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And I know there are also those who are cynical who think it doesn't matter.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I assure you it does.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And if you haven't voted, get out there and vote.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   All three of us have voted.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Well, it's it can also be very entertaining.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Voting is fun.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   It is.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   It is in San Francisco.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Did you see some of that?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   You're not in San Francisco.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   You didn't see some of the ballots.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   No.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Are you voting to legalize prostitution in San Francisco?
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Yeah, decriminalize it, non-legalize it.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   It's not going to be legal.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   What does it mean?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   It just means that they won't enforce any of the laws.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   So it's kind of like we're not saying it's okay.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Wow.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   But we're not going to do anything about it.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   So it's not like it's not exactly like you're going to have chicken ranches all over the
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   place, but but we're not going to really do anything about it.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I'm watching that one with interest.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   And then but the so you have you have that.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And then there's actually an opportunity to name a sewage plant after a recent president.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   That's on the ballot on the ballot.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   It was like I thought that was a joke.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And then I opened up my ballot guide and that was like, oh my gosh,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   this is on the ballot.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Frankly, I love San Francisco.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I lived there for years, but it has earned its reputation.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   We had one.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   If we had some ballot for marijuana, that would like really do it.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   That would do it.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Finish the thing.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I don't know how they left that out.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   That's Alex Lindsey, by the way, of the pixel core pixel core.tv who is leaving San Francisco
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   in a week.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   But I got to vote.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I got to vote on the on the ballots here.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   You know, and now I know I'm leaving it the wrong time, dude.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   If they will never mind.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   All right.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   We're both happily married men.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   We're family men, which is everybody knows is the worst kind of all.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.240]   So let's talk Mac.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.720]   I was a little perturbed last night.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.720]   I went not perturbed.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.760]   Actually, I got my I got my hopes up.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.960]   I went to the Apple store and it was closed.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.920]   It was closed all night.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.520]   I thought maybe the new IMAX there were rumors, but then it opens and all they were doing
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.520]   is Christmas decorating.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.880]   But now it's very festive.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.600]   It's kind of silly that they have to.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.600]   Are there other ways?
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.880]   Is Amazon closed when it's going to put up holiday decorations?
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.880]   I don't think so.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.040]   There's a thing called staging, you know, where you put it somewhere else and then you move
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.040]   it over.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.760]   You know, you don't have to code it live.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.760]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.240]   I understand they also put a drop of vanilla oil on every light bulb.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.240]   It does.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.640]   It smells good in the store.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.320]   I wonder if it was more like just infrastructure, as opposed to that festive one red ribbon
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.960]   on the back, because about a week ago, I was checking out something on the store myself
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.360]   and saw that it was down for a second.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.960]   But I've sort of conditioned myself to not expect that to be a sign of anything until
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.280]   I know that something's coming out.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.280]   But it was down a long time.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.920]   I checked multiple times.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.680]   It was down like 12 hours.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.680]   So maybe it was infrastructure.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.760]   I don't think it takes 12 hours to put a red ribbon on this side.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.760]   I don't.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.760]   All right.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.960]   I mean, so as far as we can tell, they haven't added anything.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.480]   We should start clicking things randomly.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.080]   Maybe the front page is not like a secret advent carat counter.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.840]   Where if you click on the terms of service, a door opens and you see Steve Wozniak roll
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.760]   out on his side way, go back in again.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.840]   He is Santa.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.160]   He actually is Santa.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.160]   So actually did not Apple announced that they were not that don't get your panties in
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.760]   an uproar or there's nothing nude coming out till next year.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.760]   That's what they tell us.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.760]   Yep.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.760]   What's the story?
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.760]   Who said that?
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.760]   It was an announcement.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.120]   Well, there was a lot of, and I think that I think Apple probably did this because obviously
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.880]   it'll affect their holiday sales.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.280]   Everyone keeps on waiting for some ex big thing.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.280]   So I think that the, you know, there was a lot of rumors that there was going to be
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.280]   new hardware coming out.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.320]   And I think they kind of wanted to put that to rest so that they could get people back
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.480]   to what they should be doing, of course, is buying Apple products.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.640]   Stop looking forward.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.640]   Yes.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.560]   It's as good as it gets.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.720]   If you're going to buy something for Christmas, buy it now.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.320]   It's not a cafe press store either.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.160]   It's not like they're going to be continually coming up with the new stuff each and every
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.160]   week is the wind strikes.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.760]   If they don't, everything has to be planned out so far in advance that they're not going
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.920]   to, they're not going to give themselves a six week buying window.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.920]   Right.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.920]   Right.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.920]   I mean, it is, yeah, you're right.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.680]   It's a big deal to get something news.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.040]   Our holiday lineup is set.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.040]   Apple spokesman Bill Evans told Macworld magazine.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.560]   So there you don't expect those new iMacs and so forth.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.920]   You're just going to have to wait until, well, next year.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.920]   Unless they think December 26th means the holidays are over and now we can announce it.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.800]   And do they mean the end of the fiscal year or the end of the calendar?
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.760]   They just ended their fiscal year, didn't they?
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.120]   The Georgian calendar or the Roman calendar?
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.120]   The Julian calendar.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.120]   All right.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.200]   Well, so good.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:33.720]   So we've got, we now know at the Mac and an iPod and iPhone product lines are for the rest
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.600]   of the year, no more uncertainty here.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.320]   Just about how we're going to pay for it.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.800]   There is some, maybe some uncertainty there.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.080]   Let's see.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.080]   What else?
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.680]   This is kind of a slow news week.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.680]   Okay.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.680]   No news there.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.680]   Let's see quickly.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.000]   It gives us opportunities to make things up.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.760]   What do you feel about that three ounce MacBook Air?
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.760]   I wish.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.920]   The Mac MacBook Helium.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.040]   Hey, you know, I somebody, Brian, I, one of our listeners, Brian, Bob Marito was in
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.080]   studio with his 13 inch MacBook, the new MacBook.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.920]   And now I'm comparing it to the new MacBook Pro.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:15.160]   And I, you know, I'm starting to think that the MacBook is really the kind of sweet spot
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.160]   on the line.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.680]   I mean, that is just the right size.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.320]   It felt so good.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.320]   It didn't feel cheesy plasticy.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.000]   It felt really solid and nice.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.280]   If it had firewire, I would say that's the MacBook.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.080]   That's the MacBook to get.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.280]   It's screen size is also an issue.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.280]   Is this for you?
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.280]   The 13 is too small.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.280]   Yeah, I wouldn't.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.280]   I wouldn't.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.280]   For me, it was too small.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.440]   And for my wife, it was too small.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.440]   She looked at the MacBook.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.480]   So this is before the upgrade, but it's the same screen size.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.160]   And the reason that she went to the MacBook Pro was specifically because she does a lot
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:54.080]   of Excel spreadsheets and she just needed to, she saw herself scrolling a lot.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.040]   I think it's, I think it's right for what it is.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.520]   For me, my main, my main computer has been a MacBook for the past year and a half, two
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.680]   years.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.920]   And I've only now just switched to the MacBook Pro only for the next couple of weeks because
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.920]   I've got one on loan.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.080]   And it actually now seems like a nice big huge screen to me.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.760]   I'm not, I realize that I'm a tech sort of guy.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.760]   So I'm not the sort of guy who needs to be sliding left to right.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.320]   I don't do lots of video editing.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.960]   So I don't really care about the firewire.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.160]   I don't really care about the, about the widescreen.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.240]   I do think that the MacBook is the best default sort of notebook.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.440]   So you can possibly have.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.440]   It's just beautiful.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.440]   I was really impressed.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.280]   And I'm finally getting used to the lack of a button on the trackpad.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.960]   Yeah, that doesn't bother me so much.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.640]   Kevin Rose complained and I agreed with him that sometimes when you use the button, it
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.640]   doesn't seem to click.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.360]   I mean, it clicks, but it doesn't seem to do anything.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.760]   Have you noticed that?
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.760]   Not really.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.840]   Well, for me, I feel stupid because it's just a simple, that, that part of your eight
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.440]   brain that does something one way for all of your life, it takes a long time to reprogram
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.440]   that muscle memory.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:04.200]   The fact that I did not feel underneath my thumb a separate entity for pushing and clicking
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.360]   meant that no kidding for an embarrassing number of days.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.200]   I was trying to drag things around the desktop with one finger held down on the trackpad.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.400]   And that really doesn't work very well.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.640]   It took me a while to realize that, well, what if we just simply pretend that there's
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.440]   a second button at the very, very bottom of that thing and then just realize that, yeah,
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.840]   you can actually use it exactly the same way you're using the old style trackpad.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.960]   But it's interesting how far, how much work it is to just reprogram yourself to make
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.960]   that switch.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.760]   Maybe, maybe you're not.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.160]   I didn't have my first battery pull this morning though.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.160]   I did.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.160]   What happened?
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.960]   I installed Adobe Creative Suite 4 yesterday.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.960]   I left it alone.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.480]   I mean, they hoarse around with it for a little bit last night.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.200]   Just left on the coffee table, came back this morning and it made, I tried to wake it up
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.520]   and it kept making after about two seconds pause after key press the sort of sound that
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:01.440]   made me think there might be a small and slightly helpless bird outside my window.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:07.240]   Oh, you know, the sort of silent, silent sounds that I was at the computer.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.240]   Was that something outside?
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.080]   Because it, you know, I've had not would not come back to life had a pull that pull the
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.840]   battery, give it some time to itself to collect to collect itself, collect its thoughts.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.080]   And it came back up again.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.240]   But I don't know whether that was just all the installations I did last night or whether
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.160]   this is just version 1.0.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.160]   I does.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:31.680]   I'm writing my review for this week and kind of embarrasses me as a fan of Apple products
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.600]   that I almost, I have to include that one line in any new notebook that says Apple does
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.320]   really cool, really different things.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.400]   They totally reinvent the way they assemble things, which means that they don't know how
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.680]   to assemble these things 100% perfectly until they've made 100,000 of them.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.600]   So wait a couple months before you buy this.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.720]   Yeah, we always have to say this.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.880]   So that squeak was mechanical.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:58.080]   It sounded as though something was trying its darned us to do something but then discharging
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.080]   and giving up.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.080]   It doesn't sound good.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.040]   It didn't, it didn't sound like an electronic thing.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:06.840]   It sounded like something either a capacitor was discharging into a weak joint or something
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.960]   was oscillating or it wasn't scary.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.720]   But like I said, I really did have to listen closely and I don't think I identified it
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   perfectly.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.040]   It was one of those things where if I had just outlayed two grand on this thing, I'd be going
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.680]   back to the Apple store and saying I want a good explanation for why I pressed the button
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.760]   on this and didn't restart right away.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.640]   The battery was about 100%.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.200]   Both by indicator and by recharger LEDs.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.400]   So that's a mystery to me.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.280]   Well, my hard drive died on my first MacBook Pro and I brought, but I got to me it's swamp,
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.640]   but still, yeah, maybe I agree with you.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:47.600]   I think boy, the first generation MacBook had huge problems for the first few, whatever
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.840]   it is, 100,000 units.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.360]   I think you're absolutely right that you've got to let them work the kinks out in the
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.360]   manufacturing.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.400]   And it's never a problem with the design.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.280]   It's not that they have to, or rather, excuse me, it's not a case where they design these
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.440]   things in a faulty way.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.720]   It's just that this is a brand new process and it just takes repetition before they figure
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.880]   out, you know what, we need to put a spacer there or you know what, instead of doing
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.160]   this in three operations, we need to install this in two operations or four operations.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.800]   Yeah, by the way, a little tip of the hat to my friend, Rick Yeager, who runs the Mac
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.040]   Merck website, Mac Merck.com.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.360]   He's, he sells merchandise on there as many of us do t-shirts, that kind of thing.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.400]   He now has an official bag of hurt.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.080]   It is a shopping bag.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.520]   It says bag of hurt on it, of course.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:35.200]   A little, a little tip of the hat to Steve Jobs, who called Blu Ray a bag of hurt.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.200]   I like that.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.840]   I'm carrying my bag of bags.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.280]   I almost carry those on the inside, Leo.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.280]   We hide them well.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.280]   Oh, Andy, you're going to make me cry.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.080]   Oh, just get me a Blu Ray player.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.080]   I'll be happy.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:51.280]   It may be a slow Christmas for Apple, according to Mac World in the wake of global pessimism.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:14:01.640]   Apple may be cutting its iPhone 3G production by, they say, an analyst says 40%.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.400]   But who's saying this and what evidence is he providing?
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:12.200]   Craig Berger, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets and Investment Bank, he says that the firm,
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:19.000]   let's see, I don't know if he's calling suppliers or if he's just making it up at a whole cloth.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.080]   I think these guys just make this stuff up.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.080]   That's all I have to say.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.080]   I'm like us.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.680]   I mean, you know, the thing is, is the, but they, but they, but they, you know, everyone
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.080]   starts buying and selling based on that.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.280]   Well, maybe they do that with us too.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.280]   I don't know.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.280]   I'll watch.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.280]   Sure, they don't.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.280]   Exactly.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.280]   When they're fools, they'll listen to me.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.960]   I mean, this is the same, this is the same guys who, I mean, not maybe not this guy, but
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:43.200]   some, you're another analyst that says Apple should buy, do this huge buyback of all their
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.200]   stocks.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.160]   Yeah, they should, you know, to increase value or whatever.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.360]   But the thing is, is that, yeah, we should give up our ability to react to a bad economy
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.880]   at the beginning of that by selling off our nest egg rate idea.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.880]   Right.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.880]   Right.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.880]   You just love watching us go.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.880]   You idiots.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.480]   This is why accountants aren't allowed to run company.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.480]   Stop.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.280]   This guy's calling it a production analysis, but what he, I'm not seeing, I guess if I
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:12.920]   bought the report, I could find out is, is if he's basing this on, you know, research
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.120]   or he's pulling it out of his nether regions.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.480]   But anyway, I think, you know what, it's probably a safe bet to say that many consumer
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:25.480]   electronics companies are cutting production in anticipation of a fall off in sales.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:31.080]   And we are seeing fall, you know, significant fall off in sales in many retail venues.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:37.880]   So yeah, and fortune, fortune's blog has an analysis of this that basically says that
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:43.440]   Craig Burger probably has his head someplace outside, outside of the, of the retail sector.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:50.240]   It says, it says, it says here that this is, it's reporting that in February 2008, he
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.320]   got, he made a, he made a similar explanation of a prediction of downturns with anticipated
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:02.280]   50% decline to a 60% decline between quarter one and quarter two.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:06.440]   I think that it's not so much an expose a burger as much as just underscoring the fact
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.200]   that analysts looks at the information that he or she has available in front of them within
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:16.760]   his or her specific area of expertise and then makes the best guess that he or she can.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:22.000]   I mean, I don't, I, it's certainly prudent to anticipate that people can have less spending
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   money.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   And so I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   I think that's a very important thing to say.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   I kept hoping it would get better.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   It didn't get better.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Worse, the applications, more of them came out.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Some really good ones, but nothing so compelling
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   that I was willing to give up the apps I really love
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   on my iPhone.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Isn't that the way Google always starts, though?
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   It's like, "Oh, I expect great things of Android."
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   It's always really, really rough around the edges.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Everything like, "I gave up on the first iPhone, too,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   because it didn't have sufficient applications
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   or there were no third-party applications.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   I had to get to my curves."
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   I'm pretty tough on this stuff.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   The phone is a big, important part of my functionality.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Things like Omni Focus on the iPhone, the radio applications,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   which I love.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   I was listening as I walked in.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Usually, I listen to audiobooks, but as I walked in,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   well, of course, I'm listening to election news
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   and I had on these radio applications like the Nolivers radio tuner.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   I'm able to listen to radio all over the world.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   I'm walking in.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   It's fantastic.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   These are things I just missed too much on that Google phone.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   But you're a fan of the iPhone now, which goes to show that sometimes
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   it just takes a little bit of maturity, not on your part,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   but on the phone's part.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   And on my part.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   I can't think of another product where I was so conflicted
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   when I wrote the review where I'm seeing in front of me a device
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   that I certainly wouldn't want to buy for myself
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   that has, I think, limited utility right now,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   but seeing so much potential for it a year from now,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   if the developer community really throws its shoulder behind it
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   and gets inspired by what they can do with the Google phone.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   And then, of course, given the limitations that Apple's putting on iPhone developers,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   we still don't know how much blowback there's going to be from that.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   There's still a honeymoon effect where people are making money,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   people are really enjoying writing apps for this,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   but they're going to start to really bump their head on the things
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   that they're not being allowed to do.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Yeah, no, I completely agree with you.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   And all I'm saying is for today, for right now,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   just as the iPhone first generation, because of the lack of third-party apps,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   wasn't good enough for me, the Google phone has been retired until not sold,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   not given away, but just retired.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   It's not going to carry it around until such time as those apps do start emerging.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Because I got a lot of promise.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   I do have to fix the battery life, though.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   I can't have a phone that dies by now.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   That's weird.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   I didn't have that kind of a problem with it.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   Oh, you didn't? Okay, maybe I don't have a good one, then I might --
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   that might be worth the repair.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Or, I mean, just like with a 3G, the first few days I had the iPhone 3G,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   I was dying at two o'clock, three o'clock.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   I used it all the time.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Yeah, because I had to realize that, you know what,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   maybe it's not important that I track every single moment of my moments
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   of movements via GPS every second of the day while blocking it at 3G speeds.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   I think the problem with a G1 is that it runs stuff in the background.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   This is the one thing Apple said it wasn't going to do on the iPhone.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   And so I looked and I got a bunch of stuff,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   including things that used GPS running in the background.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   You install -- there's some of these applications that you install them.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   They will continue to run all the time.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   And that's what's happening.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Yeah, so much of these things are just subtle points.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   One of the smartest moves Apple made was when they designed its location services
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   to sort of build in a way that the OS could negotiate with the application,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   saying, "Okay, you're asking me where the phone is right now.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Let's be clear.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Do you really want me to power up the GPS to give you location by 10 feet
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   or is close enough close enough?"
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   And the application said, "Well, as long as you're in the right zip code,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   cool, then I'm going to have to power up the battery."
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Thank you for working together.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   We're helping our user long live Apple.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   So you haven't had any trouble with a physical click on the trackpad not registering.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Like you just click and it doesn't do anything?
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Not yet.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   I was having a big, bad breaking in period, but I assume that most of it
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   was just my inability to switch to something brand new.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   I have not had a problem with a click, not registering.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Watch it carefully, because I didn't pay any attention to it,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   so I saw Kevin Rose's tweet about it.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   And at first I said, "No, no."
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   And then I said, "Oh, wait a minute."
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   And Apple is now saying we're looking into it.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   So apparently there are some people who are having this issue,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   according to a blog post by an Apple fan.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   He sent an email to Steve Jobs.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   This is, by the way, the new trick.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Sjobs@apple.com, and Apple seems to respond to these emails.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Apple called him back saying we're looking into the complaints,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   but there's no immediate resolution.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   My initial thought was, even though I have the right click feature turned off,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   you know, you can have the right side of the button be a right click
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   and the left side be a left click.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   I have that turned off, but I think it's when I stray,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   when my thumb strays away from the left side of the trackpad,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   I think that it's not, that's when a click is not responding.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   I'm still very, very, very concerned about how long this mechanical clickpad
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   is going to actually last.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   I mean, I'm sure it's the same thing on your MacBook as it is on mine,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   that it's by six or seven months that trackpad has been polished to a year finish.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   It's just my thumb sliding around on it.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   I don't know what happens when it's a slide and mechanical pushing on it.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Right. Well, we will see.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   I worry always about those buttons, and they always seem to survive.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Of course, I can't not buy a new Mac every year.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   [laughter]
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   That's not what would be silly.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   That's part of the problem.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   You don't want to lose that great tax break.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Yeah. Yeah, right.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   I have to admit, I was all gung-ho to buy one,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   and then there's been enough anomalies that I felt like,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   I felt like I might give it a little bit of time.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   I'm with Andy on this.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   I think you don't want to buy one of the first hundred thousand of any new machine.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   I think he's absolutely right.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   I agree.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Big kind of froufer-a about Opera Mini being turned down in the App Store.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   In fact, I put on our delicious links, and you can see it, folks,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   if you go to delicious.com/tag/mbwid as you'll see.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   The stories that we're about to talk about.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   There's a list.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   I love this list of all the applications, apples,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   booted that we know of.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   One of them was Opera Mini.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   There's some debate now over why it was included.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Reports said that Apple blocked Opera because, well,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   the same reasons blocked other companies that provide products for the iPhone applications,
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   for the iPhone that duplicate apples on applications, it competes with Safari.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   But it turns out, according to the Director of Corporate Communications at Opera,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   he said, "Well, no, we actually never submitted Opera Mini to the App Store."
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   So all of that.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Now, it may be that they contact as Opera's a big company.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   It might well have said, "Let's talk to Apple before we submit."
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   And Apple might have said, "Don't do it."
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   So there is some question.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Opera CEO was paraphrased in the New York Times blog post saying Apple won't let the company release it.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   So it may be that, who knows, there's more than meets the eye here.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   I personally don't care about Opera Mini.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   I love Safari.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   I don't think there's a need for another browser on the iPhone.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   And one of the things I don't like about Opera Mini is that it proxies all your web requests
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   so that they can squeeze out graphics and so forth and make it faster.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   And by doing so, they have to break SSL.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Opera Mini, and they'll say this.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   If you read carefully the terms of service, your connection to your bank or your online shopping
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   is secure only to Opera.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   And they're certificate.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   And at that point, Opera can see what you're doing.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   So I'm not a fan of Opera Mini anyway.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Yeah, also they really have to make a case for what they're going to be doing.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Why don't we eat it?
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Because that's a far phone, right?
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   I mean, if they had a built-in Flash player, that would make things interesting.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   For a lot of us.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   Now there's some rumors about amount of RAM we can get into these.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   I thought we were limited to four gigs.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   But according to the ultimate Apple web blog, six gigs.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Actually, tidbits is that Gitch deserves credit.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   Adam Anks, great.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Must read Apple newsletter.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   There are two DDR3 slots in the new MacBook.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   They come with one or two gigs from the factory.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   According to tidbits, you can put in a four gig SIM with a two gig SIM.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   If they're the same type in speed, six gigs of RAM, but a little word of warning, besides the cost of this,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   you won't get the optimum speed because you don't have matched RAM in there.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And like many computers, matching the RAM sticks improves the speed.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   It's a dual channel architecture.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   So now, the next step would be, of course, well, what about two four gig sticks?
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   tidbit says it doesn't work.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   But theorizes maybe Snow Leopard will fix it.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Maybe it's not a hardware issue.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   They've actually put sticks in there and tried it.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   I'm always a little bit worried about this sort of thing.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   There are a lot of things, like I hack a lot of hardware, and there are a lot of things you can make it work,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   but you wonder if the engineer who put this together realized that there's a difference between --
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   their features are referred to as bar bet features.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   If you want to win a bar bet, yes, you can get this working.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   But you don't want to run this for more than a couple of weeks because that's when --
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   that's when you start getting your story together for what you're going to tell the guy at the genius bar.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Right.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   It just stopped working.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   I don't know what happened.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   I'm pretty upset about this.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   I just want to know what you're going to do to fix this for me, because just stop working.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   I don't even take it out of the box, as a matter of fact.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Just a little like came on the side of the box saying, "I'm not working.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Take me out to the store."
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   And my uncle, who's a cop, who's a cop and a lawyer said, "You need to fix this for you."
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Well, and considering that a four gig stick of DDR3 RAM runs around five, six hundred bucks,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   it's probably not an experiment, you know, just anybody will want to do.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Well, and I think that it's not like Apple limited it because they wanted to hold you back.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Well, but I'm sure you of all people would love to get more than four gigs.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   No, I'd love to put eight gigs of RAM in my laptop after Snow Leopard, because I don't think --
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   right now, I don't think we're really -- most of these applications are really addressing that much RAM.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Right.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   So, have you installed CS4?
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   I do.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Yeah, I installed it a long time ago.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Ah, finally, he can speak.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   I presume you may now talk of these matters.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Yeah, so, yeah, CS4 is fantastic.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   And you've only had it for a night, but --
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   I basically -- my first benchmark test was a benchmark of my ignorance on Premiere and After Effects,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   and wow, was I getting high numbers on that.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   So, I'm very impressed with the --
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   It comes with Premiere for the Mac?
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Premiere is --
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Yeah, it's back on the Mac.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Wow.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Well, and I think that one of the things that we're really seeing -- I mean, this is the first --
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   CS4, I think, is really the first version where you are seeing the real integration between
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Mac -- you know, Macromedia and Adobe.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   I mean, they've been playing with going back and forth, but I think that there's just a lot that you can do as far as
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   building out -- a lot of stuff that we've been seeing in Final Cut Pro, to be honest,
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   where you can -- there's a lot of integration between Premiere and After Effects, for instance,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   you can be working on an edit and you can send it over to After Effects, do a lot more work,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   send it back -- and not even send it back, you just save it.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   You know, and a lot of that stuff is just going back and forth very, very seamlessly.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Of course, the stuff that I'm excited about is -- and this is a little bit more geeky,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   but you can bring real 3D models into After Effects now, which is new in CS4,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   which I think is going to make a big difference over time.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   It's a little slow at the moment, but it is, I think, over time as Adobe kind of gets their head around that,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   I think being able to bring in whole objects both in Photoshop and After Effects is pretty exciting.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Wow.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   It's really exciting.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Even as a big dummy, I'm very, very excited about just being able to use these trained monkey features
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   where it's -- now, it seems as though you can really integrate 3D into Photoshop projects
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   without really understanding how the whole architecture works.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   You can use, like, a -- you can use Clip 3D art almost as easily as you can use regular Clip Art.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Well, I think that's the -- that -- you're touching on what's going to be, I think, an incredibly huge industry
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   as we move forward.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   As Photoshop gets good at this, as After Effects gets good at this,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   we're going to be able to -- you know, right now, the problem is,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   a lot of the 3D models out there aren't good enough for print.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   You know, they're not -- they haven't been built to that high level of tolerance because they've been mostly
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   for little animations or little educational things.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   But as companies start to really build photoreal 3D objects that are ready to be rendered
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   from any area, you can imagine anybody you want to throw a phone into an ad or a phone into one of your examples
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   or a car or whatever, imagine being able to sit there.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   And instead of just finding a piece of stock art where it was shot at this angle,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   you can rotate it around, you can change the lighting, you can match it to what you want
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   for your piece of material -- your marketing material and then hit -- you know, hit render.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   And you're going to end up with this gorgeous image, but it can be adjusted because a lot of times
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   when you're using clip art, when you don't have the money to go shoot it yourself,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   you literally build the ad around the stock art.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Right.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Because that's the only thing you have to happen.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   You know, that's the picture you have.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   You know, and I think this is going to be a huge boom for how these ads are designed
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   and also a great boom for 3D artists who, you know, there's a whole market now to build the stock.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   Can I make a shameful confession?
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Yes.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   We are looking now because we're going to start -- we want to start doing video editing.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   And one of the real bottlenecks, as you know, Alex, is encoding, transcoding, right?
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Saving these files out.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Colleen, my tech expert here, has been doing some experimentation with GPU-based encoding,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   and there are some ways to do that.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Premiere on the Windows side supports it with the -- if you put in a video quadrocard in there,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   and we're getting incredibly fast rendering, much, much faster rendering than we were getting.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   And so I may be moving our editing from Final Cut on Mac to Premiere on Windows.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   You know, I think that it's -- there are reasons -- you always have to look at the reasons
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   that you're going to move from one thing to the other.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   You know, we're --
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   That's a good reason if Premiere is a decent editor.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   And it's a decent editor, right?
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   It's a decent editor.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   I mean, you can definitely do the kind of editing that you're doing.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Yeah, it's simple editing.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   And I like the fact that after effects and the workflow and everything's going to work there.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   Absolutely.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   And I think that they've really come a long way.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   You know, Adobe has come a long way.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   And I think that really they're challenging Apple to vastly improve what their, you know,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   what Final Cut Pro is offering, you know, because I think that a lot of these, you know,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   these integration pieces, you know, are really starting to push up against what Apple has.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   I mean, one of the big things with CS4 that a lot of people aren't talking about
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   because it takes them a little while to get -- took me a little while to get my head around it
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   is one of the things that you can do in Premiere now.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   And it actually is flowing through a lot of the system Premiere after effects.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   And you can have it -- it'll listen and it'll convert the speech to not a transcription,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   but rough text.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   So the technology is actually built in so that it can actually analyze the audio
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   and something that you're working on and build rough text.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   And what that means is that you can actually search to magic.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Oh, so for logging video as you import it, for instance.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   Well, that's step one.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   So step one is that if you want to log video, if you're trying to figure out where, you know,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   you shot 15 hours of image, 15 hours of video.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   And you're like, oh, where did I, you know, when did they -- when were they talking about, you know,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   whatever it is, they can -- you can type in that and a lot of times it'll --
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   I'll tell you.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   It'll jump right.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   You can jump right to that point.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Hugely valuable for us.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   We record big chunks of video giant chunks of video.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   Right.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   And so if you want to find out when was I talking about -- when were we talking about the CS4?
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   You know, you could type in CS4 and you would get that.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   Now, what's more important about that, I think, down the road, though, is -- I mean, it makes
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   a huge -- I mean, this is a huge time saver for especially --
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   especially documentary creators.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   I think it may be one of those things that turns a lot of people towards it if they're -- as they're working.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   But another thing that is huge is that it can -- it can stay in that pipe.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   So one of the announcements that didn't make a lot of sense until we saw CS4 was that Adobe
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   has been working with Google and in Yahoo to make sure that -- that Flash is searchable.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   You know, so now when you combine -- when you combine the -- this, you know, speech-to-text
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   conversion or analyzation to -- to being searchable, what you're talking about is the possibility.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   And I think it's going to take a little time for us to see it.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   But the possibility of searchable video on the web, which is, as we all know, kind of the holy grail,
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   you know, for a lot of us because you want people to know what you were talking about.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   And then search it the same way we would search a web page.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   And with what Adobe is working on right now, that's going to be possible.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   And it's one of the most exciting things that they've added to CS.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   But that's Mac or PC. That doesn't matter.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Oh, no, it's Mac or PC. It works on both sides.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   But I'm just saying that the big thing is that it being able to be searchable on the web is going to be a big, big deal.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   So, and the other -- do you think there's a benefit because it's 64-bit on Windows and 32-bit on the Macintosh side?
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Is there a difference there, do you think?
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of people that are -- I mean, there's going to be some speed differences on the PC for some of the stuff that's there.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   Speed is important to us. We don't have a lot of staff. We don't have a lot of hardware. We don't have a lot of time.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Yeah, I don't know if that would be enough for me to work on a PC.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   You know, I mean, to do visual -- because the problem that we have is that there's a lot of little things on the Mac that make it easier to work on the Mac,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   because the way the infrastructure works. On a PC, you kind of have to write everything from scratch to touch anything when it comes to media.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   On a Mac, when you're writing code, you just tell a core video, "Okay, you got a stream coming in. I want that stream."
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   That's not our problem, of course. That's your special issue.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   But the point is that there's lots of little apps that do lots of cool things on the Mac that --
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   and people can write them very quickly. If I can see a video stream in one application on a Mac, I know that everybody can see that video stream,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   because they're all using core video to do it. It's much more stable for us to work on a Mac when it comes to video production.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   But now, what's great is that CS4 allows us to actually use it for the areas that are the most useful.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   As I said, a vast majority of our work is done in Final Cut.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   We won't switch until you come in and bless it.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   But I have to say, we're going to go out and get CS4 for Windows, not for Mac.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   And we're going to get a quadro card, because I think that there's no GPU acceleration available as far as I know yet for encoding on the Mac.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   And I be tempted to -- if I found out that it was encoding really fast, I might just use that portion of the workflow as well.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Right. But I mean, here's my feeling. Edit it on the Final Cut and then move it over.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Oh, that's so cool.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   I mean, come on. Let's just do it. If Premier were substandard, maybe, but then that's my question.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   But it's pretty good.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Our complaint that Adobe's heard over and over and over again is that our big complaint is that what we really like about Final Cut --
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   and this is more specific to us -- is for a lot of the packages, we have these XML files that we can go through and make adjustments to it without ever opening the application.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   And there's things that we can do in Motion by changing lower thirds, changing all kinds of other things that we're able to do actually with an external editor rather than actually opening Motion again and typing anything in or opening Final Cut to type anything in.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   So, I think that a lot of stuff can be automated in a way that, you know, because we have an XML file format instead of a binary file format.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   So, what Adobe, a lot of times, saves out, you know, as their core file formats are closed.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Now, a lot of that there, I think, is being opened up. But right now, that has been the reason that we got into Final Cut as a workflow.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   And specifically because we could write scripts that would go in and change stuff without actually opening the applications.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   Right. Other features of -- let's talk about Photoshop CS4. Big improvements there.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   Oh, yeah. I mean, the one that -- no, I can't remember what it's called. Right now, it's the smart scaling. Andy, have you played with this?
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Oh, yeah. Andy was talking about it.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   It's like the -- yeah. I mean, if there's -- I think this is really your show, Alex, because you're the guy who actually uses this stuff, I suppose, who just messes around with it.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   But what I love so much about the entire suite -- excuse me -- about Photoshop is that point-for-point feature-for-feature.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   They're showing off features that have been in there for a few different iterations, but were so deeply buried inside menus that now they're easy for people like me to find this right off of a menu structure.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Like, like -- like, like, ways of using color -- the smart color paint brushes, the history paint brushes, that would be like, well, here's an interesting four-step process for getting this sort of an effect.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   Now it's just, oh, well, just use this wizard or just use this one menu command, and that'll just do you in one stroke.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   Yeah, it's the --
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Like, I mean, just --
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   The content-aware scaling just doesn't even -- you just can't -- you keep on looking at it.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   You can't figure out what is going on.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   I mean, it's just -- you have a bunch of objects in the foreground.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   You stretch the object.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   You scale the object.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   Stretch it in a way that works for the background objects, and it goes, oh, I'm just going to fix it.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   I'm just going to make sure we don't mess up the front objects for you.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   You know, and it's just this --
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   It doesn't just intelligently figuring out that, you know what, the snow in the mountains of the background, not really important.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   The dudes with the snowboards in the foreground, those do need to be preserved.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   So we're just going to move those along, and if we do -- and if the application does screw it up, it's very, very easy to just swipe your paint brush once or twice and tell it --
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   You know, it's like swatting an errant cow on the back with a little stick that's left the hertz like, oh, you actually want that left ear.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Okay, no problem.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   Oddly enough, it's not so much increasing sophistication of Photoshop, so much as bringing features from Photoshop elements into, like, the main thing.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   I was editing a couple quick video -- excuse me -- a couple quick pictures from Halloween on the brand new Windows edition of Photoshop elements, which we'll see, like, in Mac in a month or two.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   And the ability to simply say, please separate the foreground figures from the background figures, please selectively recolor the background to a different color.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Please swap this head from this head from a different picture.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   Things that are -- it's like I was saying a few minutes ago, things that are certainly possible to do in Photoshop, but either multiple steps or you need to know what layering tools work and where to get them.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   It's just simply a swap -- a swap heads command, and you're off and running.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   Yeah, this has been -- I think that the last two, I think, actually, the last two upgrades from Photoshop and CS4 in general have -- there's been a lot of dry upgrades from Photoshop.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   I was -- I tended to be in the habit of upgrading every other, just to kind of stay up.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   And then sometimes I'd fall -- I've fallen two versions behind at times doing production because it was just like, oh, there's nothing really that I'm going to use.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   And the last two updates have been, you know, powerhouses, in my opinion.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   I mean, I really think this is a -- from, you know, it's a -- for $199, if you are using CS, CS2, CS3, I think it's an easy decision, you know, for CS4, I think.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   And a lot of the cool stuff that I'm using is in the extended version, I have to say, you know, the 3D, you know, some of the -- some of those tools, but it's really some fantastic upgrades as I'd highly, you know, highly suggested.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   I guess I'll have to bite the bullet.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   And I guess I'm going to bite the bullet on the video production version of it for Windows.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   And then I'm going to get a Mac version.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   Oh, my God.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Yeah, you're going to have to get a Mac.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   But the good news is that the Mac version and the Windows version look the same.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   It was a huge -- like, it was a serious case of what were they thinking, you know, to drop -- you know, premiere just basically hand it apple.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   You know, dropping premiere kind of handed apple, the market, you know, in a lot of ways.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   And it just was not -- that was not a good move on Adobe.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   And I think it was very smart for them to bring back premiere and get all that stuff so that we had parity between the two.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   Well, it's certainly a big product announcement.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   And so is it now official? Andy, is that why you installed it last night?
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Or is it still not available?
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   Yep, it just arrived yesterday.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   String crap, nothing special about it.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   So it's definitely going to -- it's definitely going to bring the channel at the very least.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Cool.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   I was going to talk about applications that were killed.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   The iPhone application graveyard -- I forgot to mention this -- is it "board.zo.bor.ed.zio.org."
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   And so NetShare, we all know about that, that was the Null River tethering data application that would --
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   if you were lucky enough to download, I hope you have a copy and keep it safe and secure forever.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   Something called Box Office, because of trademark conflict.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   These are programs that were on the store and pulled.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   I am rich.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   That's my favorite one.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   I am rich.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   The $1,000 application that added a jewel and not much more to your iPhone.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   Slasher.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   It shows a picture of a knife.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   If you shake the device, it plays a scream.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   That's it.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   I guess we can save money on that murder drill.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   Let's not skip over that one, though, because there was -- I was actually asking questions of Apple back when they announced what would cause a certain application to be refused.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   And there was a very, very narrow list of non-editorial, shall we say, reasons.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   Meaning, there would be technical reasons or be technical reasons of the things that compromised security.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   Things that compromised --
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   Not a judgment call in terms of what the content was.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   No porn, but that was the only thing that they said specifically that we would censor based on content.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   And I was asked -- it was one of those questions that it seemed fuzzy enough that sometimes when I'm in a briefing, I will ask the same question three times and just change one minute.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   Sometimes it just changed one noun, because I want to make sure I understand it.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   They're saying you will not kill a program just because you personally don't like it.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   More because it has fart jokes.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   Like, yeah, I finger, which was never approved.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   And then -- well, maybe -- the author is Joseph W. Wanker.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   So maybe it was that that they found objectionable.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   Maybe they didn't like the name.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   That's the scary bit.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   That's what gets me kind of concerned about that Apple's leaving the door open for the Google phone or other competitors.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   For murderous content?
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   Well, just the idea that what business is it of Apple to say that's --
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   No, it's not.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   Why don't they ban the beer application?
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   You saw what's going on the beer, because Coors made a free one.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   Right.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   And the I-beer guys are suing them for like $17 million.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   But why is an Apple saying, well, you know, that encourages underage drinking there?
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   I don't think that's the thing.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   My son loves the beer app.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   He's 14.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   It's just a frothy ginger ale son.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   They could do what they did with a video game tapper, where it suddenly became a Mountain Dew dispenser instead of a beer dispenser.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   They're 18?
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   It's Mountain Dew.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   Podcast, of course, we know about mail wrangler.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   We know about freedom time.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   The application shows a pair of clocks counting down to the end of George Bush's presidency.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   Apple rejected the app.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   The developer appealed to Steve Jobs by email.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   Jobs responded, I think this -- it will be offensive to roughly half our customers.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   What's the point?
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   That's editorial, dude.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   That's editorial.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   I mean, hmm.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   A sharker, a sham as a shaker.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   A tetris clone similar to Tris.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   Look at all the -- I'm just asking -- look at all the books that are now in the App Store.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   Given that they're deleting these applications, I think will offend certain people, certain months their customers.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   You know, West for them to stop them from saying, you know what?
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   We're not going to -- we're not going to allow you to sell this book on the Apple Store because we don't think that the themes are --
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   that are appropriate for our audience.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   I have Stans on there, which is a book reading program, and I downloaded Fannie Hill.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   What are you going to do about that, Mr. Jobs?
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   They want me to read Lolita on the iPhone, or is they going to stop from doing it?
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   You can do about that.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   Have you seen the new -- what is it called?
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   Classics is really pretty -- unfortunately, the library is really limited, but it's by Philip Ryu, the guy who does --
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   is really good at making beautiful iPhone apps.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   This Classics is just gorgeous.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   And what they've done -- there's only a dozen books, but what they've done is they've made them beautiful.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   So if the "Alice in Wonderland" has the "Tennial Illustrations," the page turn is gorgeous, so you're really getting a kind of a much nicer book experience.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   The only real drawback is that it's only the 12 books.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   They say they'll add more.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   It's all that I'm free.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   I'm very glad to see that. I'd much rather spend 99 cents or even two bucks for public domain book that hasn't been treated like free trash.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   That gives you the same experience that you would give a valuable piece of property.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   It's really -- in every respect, it's a gorgeous program.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   I think they've done a nice job with it.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   Paid 99 cents for it, too.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   There you go.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   It took two and a half years and the classic guy has been -- the author has a marriage, but now we're paying 99 cents for it.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   Where is it for a buck?
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   Not a penny more.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   Not a penny more.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Let's see here.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   Other stories.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   I had a whole bunch of them, and I got distracted.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   Do you ever have that problem?
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   Distraction?
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   Action.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   I was checking my Twitter sweet.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   A lot of election day apps.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   That's what I was talking about apps.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   There's a good article on the Ultimate Apple Web Blogger with a half dozen good election programs.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   I put one on there so I could just monitor the polls as the election goes by.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   It's kind of fun.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   There was one item in the Mac Brick Weekly Ideas role that I just had to buy.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   It's Wikipedia on the -- this is my -- this is my particular week.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   Save it.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   If it's your pick of the week, save it.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   It's not like to say.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   It's not -- it's not -- it's not -- it's not -- if it's not -- if it's not, you're big,
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   you can do it.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   As I don't want -- it might be someone else's pick.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   I just realized that I was about to say something silly.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   Oh, who added that?
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   You got to look at who added it.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   Okay.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   Now I know it's going on, and everybody else at home, just keep listening and you'll find
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   out.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   You'll learn.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   So interesting.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.800]   So if I remember stuck for pick of the week, all I have to do is see who else has already
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.800]   tipped their hand.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:40.800]   Excellent.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:41.800]   I stopped doing that.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.800]   I said, I'm not going to put it in the bookmarks anymore.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:51.800]   It is a -- I will tease it by saying this is a really cool thing.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.800]   Whoever's going -- whoever might be talking about this later.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.800]   All right.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:56.800]   It's not high.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:59.800]   Has anybody tried the new Netflix watch instantly?
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:03.400]   It's now available on the Mac, although I guess it's not for everybody because I can't
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.400]   do it online.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.800]   It still says -- we don't support your computer.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:08.800]   Same thing.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.360]   I was all excited and I went up and then there was nothing.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.000]   Somebody on Twitter -- I can't remember if it's -- maybe it's a Rina Slitsky.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.200]   Said, it looked good.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:20.280]   Has anyone used the Roku?
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.280]   Is it the Roku?
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.280]   The Roku Netflix player?
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:23.280]   No.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.280]   I asked for one.
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:25.280]   They said, we've already sent one to your company.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.280]   You can't have another one.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:31.360]   Yeah, that's interesting because you -- I also contacted them and they said, yes, well,
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.880]   someone right out and they never did.
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:34.880]   So there you go.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.320]   Guess you won't get any coverage on Macbreak weekly.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.320]   So there.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:39.320]   So there.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.320]   Live with that.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:41.320]   Live with that.
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:44.200]   Because the rumor -- one of the rumors is that the -- I mean, not rumors, but what people
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:49.400]   have been saying, if you have a faster connection, because I have just a DSL at home and I'm looking
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:53.520]   forward to going to Petaluma and seeing -- there's, I guess, a 20-megabit per second or something
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.520]   like that connection.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.520]   Yes.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.480]   The Comcast is very fast here.
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:02.440]   And so I'm looking forward to seeing how good some of these online video things are when
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.840]   I have a real -- some real speed.
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:05.840]   Me too.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:12.240]   I'm on a DSL line at home and I decided to try this, you know, this tempting Comcast offer.
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.720]   Isn't that -- isn't it interesting?
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:18.480]   I mean, that's what's going to really change people from Wi-Fi to copper, among other things.
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:19.480]   Yes.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:24.440]   I wound up -- when I put sling boxes upstairs, you know, fortunately I'm a bachelor, I live
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.440]   alone.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:30.560]   I can just run CAT6 down the carpet, down the hallway, down the floor from the -- from the
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:33.720]   router downstairs to the offices upstairs.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:37.320]   And the difference between having copper running through the house versus Wi-Fi is just night
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.320]   and day.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:44.520]   Well, what I think is funny is that I'm not getting Comcast's bundle because it doesn't
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:47.000]   include the 20-megabit per second solution.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.560]   No, I get that in my business class.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.160]   Are you able to get it in your home?
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.760]   Yeah, we can get it in the home.
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:56.680]   But just not as a bundle.
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:00.800]   The bundle is only six-megabit per second and I know that I'm, you know, I was just
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.120]   like -- and I don't really want cable anyway.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:06.600]   So I was -- you know, I told my wife I'm not paying extra.
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:07.600]   Only paying for the --
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:10.920]   You would think it'd be the other way around that in order to encourage you --
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:11.920]   You think --
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.200]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:16.920]   Yeah, you think that they would say, "Oh, you can't buy 20-megabits by itself.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:21.320]   You have to buy cable because otherwise you're just going to watch everything on boxy."
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.320]   Yo.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:26.320]   And we'll never see you again, which is exactly what I planned to do by the way.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.320]   Exactly.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.760]   You know, I wanted to watch the Simpsons, the latest Simpsons.
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:33.160]   I wanted to watch the latest office and it didn't come to iTunes right away.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:34.160]   So what did I do?
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:39.120]   I went out and watched it on Hulu using boxy on my hacked Apple TV and it was fine.
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:44.700]   And now I'm thinking, "Why am I buying the office on iTunes when I can get it for free
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:48.580]   with like -- it's got ads in it, but not very many ads in it and I can watch it day and
[00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:49.580]   day."
[00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:50.580]   They kind of --
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:51.580]   Yeah, mine --
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:52.580]   They kind of fixed this.
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:59.200]   Yeah, I mean, well, my -- complain -- I don't mind buying them as long as I get them an
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.200]   ABC and I don't have to --
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.200]   Well, it is better quality than the streaming version.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.200]   Right.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:08.200]   The Hulu one is -- it doesn't really -- it doesn't bother me as much, but the ABC one
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:12.640]   makes me insane because you have to hit play every ad.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.640]   Oh, no, that's terrible.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:15.640]   Yeah, you're just like --
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:16.640]   So you can't skip?
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.640]   I don't know.
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:19.880]   You can't skip Hulu either.
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.320]   It's just that Hulu plays right through it.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.400]   It plays the 32nd ad and then it moves on.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:29.160]   And ABC, you know, in their -- I don't know -- depths of wisdom decided not to do that.
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.560]   And literally, I won't watch anything on ABC.com anymore.
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:32.560]   I mean, I just --
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:33.560]   Okay, I'm done with that one.
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:40.640]   I think these companies would like go into somebody's home and actually watch this and
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:47.560]   see what they're doing and then say, "Oh, wow, wait a minute.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:48.560]   Okay, wait a minute.
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:51.440]   Now, somebody in my chat in our chat, thank you.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:57.160]   Brian Pearson in our chat has explained how we can get Netflix watch instantly on our
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:58.720]   Macs.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:01.400]   So you go to Netflix.com/SilverlightOptin.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:04.200]   Oh, I forgot the silver light.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:10.840]   No, I already have silver light on here, but you have to opt in to Silverlight.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:12.960]   So now I just did that.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:16.160]   It's just a say -- it just says, "Yes, join beta.
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:22.080]   Now I'm going to watch Talking Heads stop making sense live on my Netflix."
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.160]   Wow, so that was easy.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.160]   Error code.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.560]   There's a problem with this movie.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:27.720]   Oh, nuts.
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:31.160]   So Netflix.com/SilverlightOptin.
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:32.360]   All one word.
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:33.360]   Thank you, Brian.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:34.960]   You're the man.
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:35.960]   Yeah, Silverlight.
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:39.960]   Okay, this is -- boy, this is worth doing the show just for this.
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.240]   You have to install some stuff.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.240]   You have to install Silverlight probably, right?
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:49.880]   But I mean, it just -- the good thing about the Netflix on demand is that it's not just
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:53.840]   a case of browsing and then picking out -- browsing and then finding a handful of movies that
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:54.840]   are available.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.920]   Like 80 or 90 movies in my queue.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:00.920]   And the first time that I tried to use the instant service, I found that it's -- oh,
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:04.360]   by the way, you know, about a dozen and a half of these movies in your queue are actually
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:07.000]   available online right now if you want to start watching them now.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   Right.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   Isn't that cool?
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   Well, it just crashed Firefox.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.760]   I'm going to keep trying.
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.960]   I'm not giving up.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.120]   Never given.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:17.480]   That was just a ploy to get you to crash Firefox.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.560]   Now that you're offline, the case of the kingdom are open.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:24.320]   Well, and we have that fast 20 megabit here.
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:26.920]   So I'm thinking it should look pretty good.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:30.920]   First thing it did is it said testing your connection.
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:38.200]   So obviously they send different qualities depending on what you've got.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:39.200]   Let's try again.
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:42.240]   I've got to watch this.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:47.440]   Guys we'll be back in a moment while I watch Mel Gibson's Apokolipto on that --
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:50.280]   Until then, that will do a dramatic reading for my Kindle.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.280]   That's it.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.640]   I'm just going to change things a little bit.
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:55.480]   I think if you can do that, it looks good.
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:56:01.400]   Well, everyone's doing marketing research on behalf of all these media companies.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:05.520]   That all you've got to do is find out what illegal software that you want to quash.
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:15.440]   And if someone's making 40 bucks giving users the ability to download on iPod, fast forward
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:18.960]   scrub, that sort of stuff, that's sort of a good indication that you should add those
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.760]   features to your playback system.
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:21.760]   Right.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:25.360]   If you do a system that's so good that no one wants to spend $40 to add more features
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:28.200]   to it, then you're on the right track.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.320]   It looks pretty good.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:33.200]   I have to say, I mean, it's not bad.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:38.400]   I haven't gone fullscreen on it, but the text on the titles, I don't notice -- that's
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:41.800]   the first thing I look at is how alias jaggy it is.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.600]   And it's pretty good.
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:48.800]   It makes me think that Apple's starting to miss the boat by not having a TV-oriented
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:51.200]   system that's better than Apple TV.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:56.360]   By not having the Mac Mini as sort of their nudge nudge wink wink, this is the system
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:01.560]   you want to buy in order to bring every form of streaming media onto your TV.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:02.560]   Frame rate's not great.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.320]   It's clearly not 30 frames a second.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:09.960]   But again, neither when we watched the boxy in the office, it wasn't.
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:12.480]   Like Jennifer said, something wrong with a camera?
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:15.080]   I said, no, we're streaming this on the internet.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.720]   She said, oh.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:17.720]   And then watched the rest of it.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:20.720]   There's something that I've noticed actually watching.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:25.360]   You just downloaded a movie on iTunes called Mongo.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:27.000]   Yeah, Mongo.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.200]   It's about Genghis Khan, which is actually a pretty good movie.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:32.280]   No, it's not Blazing Saddles Mongo.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.280]   What?
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:34.280]   The movie?
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:35.280]   Mongo Santa Maria?
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.280]   Yes.
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.280]   The movie you've been waiting for.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.280]   Mongo.
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.280]   Okay.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:41.280]   Mongo.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.280]   And it is --
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.440]   Mel Gibson's going to sue me, wait a minute.
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:46.240]   I'm going to stop this movie.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.840]   I can't protest.
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:51.280]   I'm casting Apocalypto on the -- so far it's only been foliage.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.960]   I don't think it can get mad for the foliage.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:53.960]   Sorry.
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:54.960]   You -- Mongol, you're watching.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:58.120]   But one of the things that I noticed watching it -- I've noticed it with a couple other shows
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:00.920]   and I thought it was just the TV shows, but then I was watching a film.
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:01.920]   And it's interesting.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:05.320]   One of the things you'll note, I'm about to ruin everybody's -- I don't think I have
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.320]   Mongols on my list.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:08.320]   If it is, folks, stop listening.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.320]   No, no, no.
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:10.320]   I -- yeah, exactly.
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.320]   You're in there lunch?
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.320]   No, no, no.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:15.480]   I'm about to ruin their viewing experience.
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:19.960]   One of the things that compression does is it makes -- it kind of takes all the things
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:23.120]   that are really close together and it matches them together.
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:27.040]   And I started -- it just feels like TV when you watch it, when it's too compressed.
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:29.040]   So it's --
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.040]   It's not so for movies.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.120]   It just doesn't have that -- it doesn't have any kind of texture to it, you know?
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.880]   And you suddenly just feel like you're watching a television show.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:38.160]   And I didn't notice it as much until I was watching that.
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:40.320]   And then, of course, soon as I saw it, I was like --
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:42.040]   So it wouldn't be for everything.
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:47.040]   But for stuff that's low -- you don't demand high quality, that'd be fine.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:50.920]   Well, yeah, if you're watching like -- I mean, like some of the stuff on -- it popped up
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:54.320]   when I did this Netflix thing, you know, watching Frontline, for instance.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:55.800]   I'd love to watch Frontline on Netflix.
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:56.800]   Yes.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:58.560]   Yeah, I don't really need to put that in my queue.
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:58:59.560]   Right.
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.000]   Yeah, you don't want to waste a whole movie on that.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   And I buy those.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.720]   I mean, I buy Frontline, you know, I mean, to watch it on my iPhone when I'm standing,
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:05.720]   you know, whatever.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:07.880]   I mean, it's a great, you know, it's one of the best things PBS does.
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:10.000]   How do they make money, though, on streaming it?
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.800]   I mean, I guess Netflix must --
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.800]   Pam.
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:13.800]   Pam.
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:14.800]   And it's part of your subscription.
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:17.800]   And this is what Netflix sees as the future.
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:19.300]   Well, it's good.
[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:23.120]   You take an existing subscription market and you move it to people paying 20 bucks a month
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:25.640]   to download anything they want.
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:26.800]   They're doing it on Tivo.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.120]   They're doing it on that Roku player.
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:31.040]   I mean, you're going to -- this is where Netflix is headed.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:32.600]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:33.760]   And it looks great on the Mac.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.400]   So thank you, Brian.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:38.720]   That was your Mac tip of the week.
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:42.400]   Silverlight -- Silverlight's Microsoft's Flash, basically.
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:44.880]   So you need to get that to Silverlight player.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:47.360]   And it's Silverlight opt-in, all one word.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:48.360]   Netflix.com/SilverlightOptin.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:52.600]   Obviously, you have to be a Netflix customer to use it.
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:57.760]   But what I thought was they had to invite you or you had to somehow get some magic cookie.
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.000]   But no cookie necessary.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   Yay.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.760]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:06.160]   Come back with your picks of the week.
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.440]   Alex will start.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.440]   He wants to be safe.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:14.640]   So there'll be no poaching allowed.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:18.760]   Before we do, though, I want to mention my good friends at YouKnowwhereaudible.com.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.320]   We love Audible.
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.040]   Audible.com/MacBreak is the place to go to get your audiobooks.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:28.360]   I listen to audiobooks all the time.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:33.320]   As I said, you know, I normally listen when I walk in and I listen to the news today.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:37.800]   But I can tell you tomorrow I'll be listening to history, election stories.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.280]   You know, Audible's a place to learn, to enjoy, to relax.
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.120]   I listen to science fiction, some great stuff.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:50.720]   When I'm in the mood, I like to listen to history books.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:51.880]   You have a new book yet, Andy?
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.240]   Or should I pick a book today?
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:01:01.760]   I have a new book that I haven't started yet because I'm not a shilfer for Audible.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:05.320]   I actually pay for a subscription and I've already used that by my credit.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.000]   By the way, I am a shilfer Audible.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   I also pay for a subscription.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.560]   So, I don't get a free subscription.
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.560]   I'm happy to pay for my Audible.
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:14.640]   Exactly.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:19.160]   And I know that I'm close to that day of the month that I'm going to get my monthly
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.640]   credits installed in there.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.640]   Yes, I know.
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:26.000]   And so it's almost like UPS package tracking to keep refreshing the pay, saying how many
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   credits do I have to?
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   Yes!
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.120]   I can get live from New York and then censored history of Saturday Night Live finally.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.800]   That is excellent, by the way.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:37.760]   History of Saturday Night Live that I had been sort of waiting for a long time was published
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.760]   in paperware.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.920]   Is this Tom Shales' book?
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:41.920]   Exactly.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:42.920]   Five years ago.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:43.920]   Excellent.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:48.160]   And it's the best one because there have been a bunch of Saturday Night Live books that have
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:52.280]   been very, very outsider and not very well informed.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:58.280]   There have been ones that have been done with a full approval of NBC, which means a legacy
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.280]   and a dream.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:03.520]   You bring political, you know, once you show the underside.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:08.320]   This was a very well researched, very well reported book with quotes from most of the
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:12.280]   major players who were there as this show was being put together.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:16.200]   It covers many, many years of the show's development.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.760]   It is a little bit too...
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:21.880]   It was one of those things where I was in Barnes and Noble and I sat down with the
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.920]   comfy chair and read three or four chapters enough to realize that, "Okay, I'm gonna have
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:25.920]   to buy this at some point."
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.720]   And then I just never got around to buying it.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.600]   Now it's in my audible cue.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.560]   But it's really good, really interesting reading.
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:36.000]   If you like Saturday Night Live, you'll find reasons to not like it.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.120]   If you don't like it, you will find reasons to respect it.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:43.920]   And so it's always gonna be full of stories that you didn't hear before.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.400]   So I'm really looking forward to it.
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.400]   I loved it.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.240]   I have read this and it is just a fantastic book.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.560]   A little sad that it's abridged.
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.720]   That's the publisher's decision, not audible.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.800]   But it's abridged down to eight hours and 42 minutes.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:56.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:00.440]   I think often with nonfiction, abridgment actually helps.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:01.440]   Yeah.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.080]   I've listened to abridged fiction.
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:07.000]   But abridging the nonfiction frequently just makes it a little bit more to the point and
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   concise.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.600]   And believe me, there's still plenty of gossip and juice in this thing.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.600]   It is fantastic.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.600]   I really loved it.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.600]   I agree with you.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:18.360]   Live from New York, an uncensored history of Saturday Night Live by Tom Shales.
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.360]   The Great Crit.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.920]   Is he watching a post to television critic?
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:22.400]   I can't remember New York Times.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:27.120]   He writes for one of our great journals.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.040]   He's really one of the best TV writers.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.640]   In fact, I would say he's the best TV writer out there.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.640]   He's with the Washington Post.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:34.640]   There are two great ones.
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.680]   I can't remember the guy who did the great history of the late Night Wars.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.520]   Oh, that was good too.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.000]   Made it.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   That's another great book.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.360]   I keep meaning to search to see if it's available and audible because it really isn't an interesting
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.360]   thing.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:53.040]   At least a third of the books that I get off of Audible are books that I read like five
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.480]   or 10 years ago.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.480]   And I know they're good.
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.840]   So I know they're worth either one of my credit.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.840]   Yeah.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:02.280]   My monthly credits are worth my actually buying for my commutes.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.280]   So.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.000]   No, I completely, I know what you mean.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.880]   In a way, it's like having an old friend and having, but you've already read it.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:13.000]   So listening to it is just a really, it's almost you can really relish it.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.800]   That's what I love about Audible.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:17.440]   Audible books are really my favorite way.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:23.040]   In fact, more and more, I'm eschewing the paper version and saying, is there an Audible version?
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.440]   I'll read it then.
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:27.440]   All.com/macbreak.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.440]   Join today.
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:32.040]   You'll be using words like S2 in your speech any day now.
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:37.720]   I started eschewing reading the paper versions like 10 years before Audible existed.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:38.720]   I know.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.720]   I know.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.720]   What do you read?
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.720]   You read the online versions.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:42.960]   Well, I just don't read.
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.720]   You know, I mean, I read magazines.
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.720]   I'm too 80.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:47.720]   You are.
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:48.720]   You're a big Mac.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.840]   I know when we, I've flown with you and that's the first thing you do is you stock up at the
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.840]   bookstore man.
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:55.640]   And not just any old thing, heavy duty stuff.
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:05:00.200]   Yeah, I, I, I, I, if I'm going to spend time reading, I want it to be.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.200]   All right.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.200]   One of my favorite old bumper stickers, eschew obfuscation.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.640]   All tautologies are tautologies.
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:11.200]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:15.560]   The most erudite commercials on the air.
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:19.040]   Let us get to our picks of the day in Alex Lindsey, just so you don't get preempted by
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.160]   the guy in the hat.
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.760]   What is your pick today?
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:27.560]   I am picking the, yeah, Nick, I remember it.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.560]   It's the Wikipedia.
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:29.560]   It was all right.
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:30.560]   Did you pick me?
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.280]   Wickey, Wickey, Wickey, Wickey.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.000]   It's the Wikipedia online.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.040]   It's the online version of the Wikipedia, or not, the offline of Wikipedia.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.760]   So this is a crazy big download.
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.640]   Is it an iPhone?
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.840]   Yeah, this is an iPhone app.
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:50.120]   So, because I have iPhone apps that are online, but you're saying this downloads Wikipedia?
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.120]   It downloads.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.120]   Two million...
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.120]   Two million...
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.120]   The whole thing.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.120]   The whole thing.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:59.080]   It's just, you know, I wanted on my iPhone.
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:05.120]   So, well, the thing is, is that I spend, you know, I spend enough time on a plane that
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:12.000]   it is very annoying for me to not be able to, you know, search out media.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   Well, I'm...
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   Sounds more...
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   No, no, no.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   Well, like, I work on articles.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.480]   So I'll be sitting there typing articles and I'll be...
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:18.480]   I'll be...
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.480]   I'll be...
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:20.800]   I'll write a lot of articles when I'm sitting on a plane.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.120]   And that's the time I write them.
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:26.080]   In fact, I schedule my article deadlines around my plane trips.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.080]   And so...
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:31.320]   So the thing is, is that I get up there and I want...
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.320]   I can't remember what that means or what I'm gonna...
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:37.480]   You know, what the detail is of that and I want to search Wikipedia and it's not there.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.960]   It's not there because I'm in the air.
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:39.960]   I'm in the air.
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:40.960]   Oh, man.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.280]   And so it makes me very sad inside.
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:49.600]   And so anyway, so what you can do now is you can download all of Wikipedia.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:56.080]   And as it stands at the moment and then you're able to, you know, search it.
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.080]   Now it's not...
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.520]   What's interesting about it is it's not super fast.
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:03.440]   It's not necessarily faster than the online version, really.
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:07.320]   If you have a Wi-Fi connection, you're gonna be able to search through Wikipedia probably
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.320]   faster with the...
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.080]   You know, just go into the web or whatever, but...
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.800]   Or with an online helper.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:15.280]   But it is awesome when you're not connected and you want to know what the difference is
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:22.000]   between geosynchronous orbit and geostationary orbit, you know, it's great to have it, you
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   know, on your iPhone.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   All right.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   In the plane.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   And how big is it?
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.640]   Two gigs.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:31.440]   So you really want a 16 gig iPhone before you get this.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.440]   Does anyone have anything else?
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.400]   Who buys the 8 gig iPhone?
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.400]   Somebody must.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.400]   They sell them.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.400]   They sell them.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.400]   There's somebody out there with a big iPhone.
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.400]   Just not forget those people.
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.200]   All four of them.
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:46.480]   Our mom, dad, I can have one of you in my address book.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.240]   You decide between each other, which one it's gonna be.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.480]   Or just move back in together.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:52.480]   Your choice.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.480]   I don't care.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:55.920]   Well, if you want to know who invented Twinkies, just ask me.
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:56.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:57.920]   I got it all.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:01.200]   Well, the one thing I do, I have noticed is that I was willing to put this on my iPhone
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:05.440]   specifically because I've realized I've gotten much more comfortable now with taking movies
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.440]   on and off my iPhone.
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.200]   You know, just as I need them.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:11.480]   For a long time, I was like keeping like, you know, three or four movies on there and
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:14.920]   then my entire radio, you know, my entire music collection or whatever, not my entire
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:18.960]   music collection, but a kind of a workable version of it.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:22.600]   And now I've gotten much more like, oh, I really only want to watch.
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.960]   You know, I only need one or two movies on at a time and I can have a bunch of songs.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:27.240]   And you know, it's fine.
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:32.360]   So I've been realizing that a lot of the time I have six gigs or five, well, five to
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.080]   seven gigs open.
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:38.920]   So I figured I better fill it up and you know, this is one of the best ways to do it.
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:43.920]   All right, Andrew, actually, yeah, I'll let you go and then I'll go.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:47.480]   Andrew Enochos, pick of the week, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:50.240]   But yes, seconding Alex's.
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:53.320]   Don't you love those products where you read it?
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:57.320]   You read that paragraph two or three times saying, well, clearly doesn't download the
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:58.320]   entire week of speed.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:01.080]   I miss I miss reading someone.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.080]   Great.
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.880]   What a great utility to select an individual article and download it.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.720]   That'd be really, really hate it.
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:11.560]   It's like, oh, you want to you're not content with what you have.
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.240]   You want the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:17.120]   You want the power to settle any bar vet no matter where you are anywhere in the world.
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:20.480]   Well, what is in a way, it's the promise of a neuro man.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:23.440]   So that was one of the things I loved about neuromancer was that on his little laptop
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:24.840]   is beat up laptop.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:28.280]   He could access everything like all information at your fingertips.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:32.240]   So now I'm free to leave this planet having taken all of your information with me.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.240]   Yes.
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.240]   My job is exactly.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:38.960]   Aliens are going to be downloading this thing like that.
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:39.960]   We thought you were unique.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.680]   It turns out we have everything we need right here.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:42.680]   Thank you.
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.720]   So tell me again the name so that we don't because there are many Wikipedia applications.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.760]   Oh, and that's what that's the part that I forgot.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:49.760]   Hold on.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.360]   Is it wicked tap?
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:52.360]   Have it Andy.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:55.640]   I close the window and I have it here somewhere.
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:58.400]   Most of millions of stuff that I open.
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:01.800]   Patrick collision collision.ie.
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:06.680]   It is called Wikipedia on the iPhone apparently.
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.440]   No wonder you forgot the name.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:12.160]   Yeah, that's why I was like it was like it's like Wikipedia.
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:13.560]   There's a ton of them.
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:17.440]   I mean, literally there's probably a half dozen or more.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:20.320]   But you can find it at it's collision.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:23.760]   It's clicky.ie/wickipedia-iPhone.
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:24.760]   OK.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.400]   Yeah, it's not.
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:30.040]   I would have named it something like Wikipedia at home.
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:32.120]   Like total Wikipedia.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.240]   The listing on the iTunes store.
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:39.200]   On the iTunes store, it's from Steam Heavy Industries and it's called Encyclopedia.
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:41.640]   I'd say you really won't find it.
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:45.240]   So this Patrick collision is a master of marketing.
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.240]   Bob Fiscation.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.240]   OK.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.960]   It's in its eight bucks.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:52.960]   And worth everything.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:56.320]   This is where we demonstrate to the world that we just can't be happy.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:01.200]   All the information collected everywhere in the world about every eight bucks.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.200]   Bob.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.880]   I already bought my copy of this week's people.
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:05.880]   That's four bucks.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:06.880]   Come on.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:07.880]   Be reasonable.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:08.880]   Hey, Bob.
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:17.040]   Now, it is a little misleading because when you read the iTunes app store description of
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.880]   it, it says it's .1 megabytes.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:23.400]   Obviously, that's a typo.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:27.320]   It is all of Wikipedia, which I'm surprised to find is two gigs.
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:28.320]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.320]   I was surprised that says two.
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:31.520]   But it found a mistake and the application is that small.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:35.280]   It's the first thing it does is connect to Wikipedia and data for whatever the constant
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.760]   state of the cloud is.
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:37.760]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:38.760]   But yeah, I should have.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:39.760]   It's a key to it today automatically.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.440]   You know, I haven't tried that.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:45.560]   I think that there's a way to dump it and download it again.
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:48.040]   But I'm not sure I haven't tried that.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:52.240]   Can't believe all of it is in there.
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:54.000]   That is stunning.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.120]   I hate the fact that every time ever since my very first power book, I have a documents
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:02.400]   folder and every time I move to a brand new one, I just copy the documents folder onto
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.400]   the new one.
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:08.280]   So my documents folder contains pretty much everything I've written since age 21.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:14.400]   And I never do get info on that folder because it depresses me that I go to Best Buy, buy
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.400]   the key chain for a little floppy.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:19.200]   It'll fit everything I've ever written.
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:20.200]   Yeah.
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.520]   So I'm not sure what the text is like.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:22.520]   Just remember that.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.920]   Now, this doesn't have images I would bet, right?
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.240]   No, also it's kind of ugly.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:29.800]   I mean, it's almost like Web 1.0 interface.
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.880]   You get everything in one scrolling listing.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.880]   But it is hot linked.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:35.680]   So you can browse the references.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:36.680]   Right.
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:40.160]   If you wanted to see the references, if you wanted to go back to the original Wikipedia
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.520]   page to look at the pictures and stuff like that, I don't believe it.
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.160]   I don't believe it downloads pictures.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.320]   I like this reviewer.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.320]   Good idea.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.320]   Way overpriced.
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:48.320]   Exactly.
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:51.440]   How much is the Britannica?
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:52.600]   I bought a world book.
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:53.600]   It's like Lapidius.
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.440]   Some years ago for my kids.
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:59.400]   I just say, you know, if you believe that knowledge is power, this is a how it's a
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:00.400]   love it.
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:01.400]   It's a how it's a.
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.400]   Yes, sir.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.320]   But if you think knowledge is expensive, try the cost of ignorance someday.
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:09.520]   A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.760]   Believe you with these images of wheat.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.760]   Thank you.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.000]   This is your brain.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.920]   This is your brain on wheat.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:22.560]   Now, Mr. Andi Inaco will will regale us with his pick of the week.
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:28.440]   This is actually kind of a callback to something I mentioned a couple of weeks ago about that.
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:29.800]   Like a lot of people I use.
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:30.800]   I'm naughty.
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:35.360]   I use the iTunes store to shop for music, but I don't buy music from the iTunes store.
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:40.320]   And before I click into Firefox and see if that same tune is available via the Amazon
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:45.080]   MP3 store because very, very bad boy, Andy.
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:50.920]   People seems to be struggling along without the extra 11 cents or that.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:53.600]   I'm just I'm looking out for the user.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:59.000]   I'm fostering competition, preventing Apple from being able to ignore its users by well,
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   well, thank you.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.400]   No, actually, I want the higher bit rate.
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:04.040]   I want the MP3 format and I want the extra level of expense.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:07.480]   Again, I call you mention the fact that I'm a journalist and a rapidly collapsing print
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:08.480]   market.
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:09.480]   11 cents.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:13.320]   That's one quarter of a ramen noodle and that's usually what I will have with one
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:16.320]   thing.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:21.240]   But it's a manual sort of operation we just tap tab on over.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:28.160]   I tried to write an Apple script to do it, but unfortunately the iTunes doesn't expose
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:33.800]   enough information about what you're actually looking at in the in the in the iTunes store
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:34.880]   to really make that easy.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:38.880]   You have to do it using user interface scripting and it just wasn't up to the challenge.
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:41.000]   But some guy was definitely up to the challenge.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:47.480]   She created Advantages MP3, which is an Apple script, but don't worry that it's an Apple
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.480]   script.
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:49.480]   You just download a package.
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:50.680]   It will launch it.
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:55.080]   It will install the Apple script into the scripts menu of iTunes.
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:15:00.000]   And then whenever you are looking at something in the iTunes store that's music, just select
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.120]   get MP3 from Amazon.
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:07.640]   And what it will do is it will simply check to see right now.
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:12.880]   I'm looking for a Chris and Chenowith songs.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:18.920]   I'm clicking on Define Gravity and I'm clicking on the MP3 thing and it percolates for about
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:21.520]   a second.
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:24.160]   I see the spinning beach ball cursor.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.800]   So it's and now I'm looking at the Amazon store.
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.760]   I'm looking at the correct.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:30.840]   Say the link again.
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:33.120]   It is Advent now.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.240]   Unfortunately, you have to learn how to spell Advantages.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:39.040]   Adventages MP3 all one word dot com.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.840]   Hey, let me guess.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:46.200]   A D V A N T A G E O U S. Correct.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.920]   M P three.
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:51.440]   No, no, no dot no, no slash no nothing.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.440]   They don't have the technology.
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:53.440]   Adventages MP3.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.640]   Advantages number three dot com.
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.640]   All one word.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.640]   It worked.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.640]   Yes.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.640]   Yeah.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:01.640]   Oh, this is this is incredible.
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:03.040]   Apple must hate these guys.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:05.920]   It could be a little it could be a little bit slicker.
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:09.160]   It's not one of these really slick professional applications.
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:13.160]   It's sort of like the script that you would have written if you knew Apple script and spent
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:15.120]   about an afternoon on it.
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.360]   But then when it works and it saves a couple of steps.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.280]   So it probably isn't that complicated a script.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:21.280]   And you'll be sticking it to the man.
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.280]   Yeah, baby.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.280]   Take that.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.840]   Mr. S jobs at apple dot com.
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:26.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:29.080]   Get a little freestyle here.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:30.080]   Okay.
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:31.840]   I mean, can't be exciting.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:35.240]   Well, I hope Scott borns not listening because if he is, he'll be spinning in his polling
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:38.960]   booth as I as I tell you my pick of the week.
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.520]   It's from Microsoft.
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:43.920]   It's live mesh for Mac.
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:46.320]   Oh, yes.
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:50.840]   Now those of you who who pay attention to windows in any way and I know that's absolutely
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:56.200]   none of you will know that Apple or Apple Microsoft had a big con fab last week called
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:01.800]   the professional developers conference, which they announced the long awaited replacement
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:08.920]   for Apple or Vista, which is called windows and Windows seven to be exact, even though
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:14.720]   in fact it's probably windows 6.1 by any reckoning.
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.880]   But another thing they announced was their cloud computing initiative.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:23.800]   And of course, a big part of this has been Microsoft live and live mesh.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:27.120]   Live mesh has been until now restricted to windows machines.
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:30.440]   They are now offering it in beta for Mac and Tashi.
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:38.120]   Get five gigs of storage, automatic synchronization, multiple computers, handheld devices.
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:45.480]   In many ways, this is kind of like dot Mac or mobile me, except that it's windows and
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:48.720]   it's or Microsoft and it's free for the five gigs.
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:51.840]   So you get less storage, but still five gigs is five gigs.
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.760]   I installed it, worked flawlessly.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.160]   It backs up automatically.
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:59.200]   I said, I want you to back up my documents folder and there now it's now online.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:02.320]   I can go get it just in the same way as I presume it's web dev.
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:08.320]   I could go get it in the same way that I could get my documents from the iDISK.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.000]   I can access it from other devices.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.080]   It's brand new.
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:17.560]   So I mean, you know, it's clearly, you know, probably going to have some bugs, although
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.080]   it seems pretty reliable.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:22.080]   And if you do work with windows machines, I think it'll be a boon for you.
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:24.280]   I mean, yes, mobile me works on windows.
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:25.960]   There's a mobile me connector and so forth.
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:28.920]   But this is kind of the windows native way to do it.
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:29.920]   And it's pretty.
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:34.600]   You know, when you add a device, it gives you a little kind of circle and so forth.
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:39.320]   Now to get it, you go to mesh.com.
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:43.360]   And now I'm not sure if everybody can get it or not.
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:46.680]   I understand it's kind of a stage roll out of the beta, but I was able to get it right
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:47.680]   away.
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:49.720]   There may be a limited number of people can use it.
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:53.920]   I've already backed up transparently without thinking 2.9 gigs.
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:54.920]   I did it yesterday.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:58.040]   I just did it in the background without my worrying about it.
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:00.160]   I think in some ways this is going to be very impressive.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:06.120]   At least if you want to know what Microsoft's up to as we all should living in this world,
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.960]   this is one way to try it for yourself on your Mac.
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:13.840]   I'm very gratified that Microsoft is not going to leave Apple out of what they're doing with
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:14.840]   their cloud computing.
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:18.680]   I think it'd be foolish for them to do so because cloud computing really is independent of the
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:21.000]   operating system ultimately.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.040]   And so this is their way of saying, yep, we don't care if you're using windows.
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.760]   You can use mesh.
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:29.640]   Get mesh.com for your free beta of live mesh.
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.720]   We're back.
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:35.560]   See that wasn't so bad, wasn't it?
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:36.560]   I don't know.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:41.320]   I recommended a Windows product last week and I represent my sub product this week.
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:42.320]   It's true.
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:45.320]   They're going to find out where the checks are coming from soon.
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:46.320]   Yeah, you should.
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.320]   Oh, it takes me on the XJ.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.320]   What was that out loud?
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.960]   And I'm shifting to Premiere for Windows.
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.360]   Oh, man.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.600]   What's going on?
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:20:02.200]   No, I just, you know, you and I, Andy, across the aisle, we shake hands across the aisle
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.200]   many times.
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:04.720]   We're uniators, not dividers.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:05.720]   That's right.
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:06.720]   To our colleagues on the right.
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:07.720]   That was a snap slogan.
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:10.920]   We thought that someone actually should try to execute that one of these days.
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:11.920]   Yes.
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:15.880]   Well, you know, I just, in my own defense, you know, all of our machines here now, I have
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:18.160]   both Mac and Windows on them.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.160]   Really?
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.160]   Why?
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:23.040]   Because we, there are 3D applications and other, you know, science applications that we've
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.960]   been using that require it.
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:28.440]   And it just, we just decided that it was just easier to put it on an ivory machine rather
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:31.640]   than trying to figure out which machines had PCs and which ones didn't and so on.
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:34.480]   And so, and there are, as I said, there are things that we want to test, things that
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:35.920]   we want to use.
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.320]   And there's no reason not to at this point.
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:42.800]   I think a prudent computer user doesn't say things like, Oh, I would never use XYZ.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:43.800]   Right.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.840]   You use whatever tools to hand.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:46.840]   Yeah.
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:47.840]   Yep.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:48.840]   Absolutely.
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.840]   It's the best tools that are available.
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:52.520]   But I think that it's, that's more of an argument to buy Mac than ever.
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:54.400]   Because it does both exactly.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.400]   Exactly.
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.400]   Exactly.
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:00.880]   No, I think in many ways, if you look at what Microsoft's doing with this Azure Azure, which
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:07.960]   is almost as bad a name as Bonjour, they're really growing across platform.
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:14.360]   They don't, they don't, they see a world as Google does and many others that the operating
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:15.680]   system is secondary.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:18.400]   If you've got a browser, that's all you need.
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.000]   And you could be using a net book running Linux.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000]   You could be using a Mac.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000]   You could be using a Windows machine.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.320]   It doesn't really matter.
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:25.880]   It's got, I have to say, it's kind of neat.
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:27.520]   And five gigs free is pretty good.
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:30.040]   It's not a bad thing.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:35.000]   You could get your entire works on their Andy several times over and the Wikipedia and
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.240]   the Wikipedia sufficient material to hold all the knowledge of mankind and Andy and
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:41.240]   Akko's writings.
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:44.560]   That's how we'll bring Microsoft down.
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:49.280]   Everybody upload the entire Wikipedia to Microsoft servers.
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.520]   Two copies.
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:54.280]   Great fun today always is with you guys.
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.160]   I know you voted and I have voted.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.720]   I vote with my absentee ballot.
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:00.840]   So I voted a couple of weeks ago and there's no better feeling than knowing that you're
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:03.840]   doing your civic duty and maybe changing the world.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:07.560]   If you are, if you are having a little fun, it's fun.
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:08.640]   Vote for prostitution.
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.240]   It's okay.
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.960]   If you are, no, no, I'm just joking.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:13.960]   Please.
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:14.960]   I vote for prostitution.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.280]   The only way that's significant with my consumer dollars, Leo.
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:19.280]   Thank you, John.
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.280]   I mean, Andy.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:22.280]   What did you do last Thursday?
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:25.480]   Portraits cause Leo.
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:27.080]   Is that the invisible hand in the market?
[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:28.080]   I didn't know.
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.080]   This is amazing.
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.080]   Last enough.
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.680]   Enough.
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:36.120]   We would have stopped here before we cause vomiting.
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:37.280]   That is it for this show.
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:39.000]   Do vote if you haven't voted.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.400]   We will see you next week on Mac break weekly.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:43.680]   Thanks so much for joining us.
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.360]   Another Mac break is broke.
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.360]   Thank you.
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.360]   Thank you.
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:49.360]   Thank you.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.360]   Thank you.
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:51.360]   Thank you.
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:52.360]   Thank you.
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:53.360]   Thank you.
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:54.360]   Thank you.
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:55.360]   Thank you.
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:56.360]   Thank you.
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:57.360]   Thank you.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.360]   Thank you.
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:22:59.360]   Thank you.
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.360]   Thank you.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:01.360]   Thank you.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.360]   Thank you.
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.360]   Thank you.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.360]   Thank you.
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:05.360]   Thank you.
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:06.360]   Thank you.
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:07.360]   Thank you.
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:08.360]   Thank you.
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:09.360]   Thank you.
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:10.360]   Thank you.
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:11.360]   Thank you.
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.360]   We'll see you next week.
