[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120]   It's time for Mac break weekly.
[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.440]   And he's here, Renee, Alex, lots to talk about why the government should not be allowed
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.800]   to regulate Apple or maybe why it should be.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.440]   We have a little debate on that.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:22.520]   The long lost Larry David promo that Apple made for WWDC in 2014 and never ever aired.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.080]   We'll play a little bit of that for you.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.200]   And the right to repair President Biden's weighing in.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.560]   It's all coming up next.

[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.000]   The show we cover the latest Apple news, of which there is precious little, but
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.120]   fortunately, we've got a bunch of good talkers on the show.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.360]   Alex Lindsay is here from office hours of office hours, fame and 090.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.160]   Media. Hello, Alex.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.160]   Hi, how's it going?
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.040]   It's going great.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.960]   How was your fourth?
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.520]   It was good.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.120]   I was in North Carolina in Cape Hatteras.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.680]   That's right.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.280]   We missed you because you couldn't get the band with.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.880]   I couldn't get the connection working out.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.920]   I did the research and it looked like it was going to have enough bandwidth.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.360]   And then I didn't.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.480]   And then I thought my phone would work.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.080]   And then it didn't.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.240]   And then I was fine.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.960]   We're going to give this one up.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.960]   Enjoy the family.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:18.880]   I know you're famous in Pennsylvania legend for the fireworks, the amateur fireworks
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.560]   displays out the cornfield.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.600]   Did you do that this year?
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.640]   No, we didn't do any of it.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.880]   I I think I saw some from my deck, you know, from my house.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.440]   You can see I can see quite a few fireworks displays from my house.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.000]   And so I kind of kept it to that.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.200]   We had gotten in pretty late on the night before.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.120]   So we just kind of hung out.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.240]   We had a little champagne and that was pretty much it.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.080]   And you avoided the incoming hurricane.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.080]   So good for you.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.040]   Yes.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.480]   Yes.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.320]   All of us, I think we picked the right week to go.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.800]   It was perfectly sunny, just a little rainy on the last day.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.720]   And outside of that, it was near perfect Cape Hatteras is quite a it's quite a place
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.040]   because you there's nobody on the beach, you know, in the morning.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.440]   So I was out shooting with my black magic camera and my iPhone to take HDR tests.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.840]   And that's what I do, you know, my version of vacation is slightly different than most.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.360]   That's why.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.200]   That's why more sample files or Volen Wilbur Wright chose Kitty Hawk on the outer
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.040]   banks for their plane flights because they had nice, soft dunes, but no people.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.640]   Yes.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.760]   And it's still there's still there.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.560]   Just some people.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.840]   There's not lots of people.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.840]   So when you go out in the morning, most of the highest population in Cape Hatteras
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.520]   in Avon, where we stay is crabs.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.280]   So if you stay quiet for a while, crabs start coming out and they start fighting
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.760]   with each other and having a lot of fun.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.760]   Lovely.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.760]   And that goes also here.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.480]   Did you have a fun New England fourth?
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.880]   Mostly as New Englanders, we spent the time crouched low behind stone walls and trees
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.480]   and our farms just in case Hessian mercenaries got any funny ideas again, keeping those
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.200]   muskets, muskets loaded in the powder dry.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.120]   Good man.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.120]   It's worked for the past two hundred three some odd years.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:13.120]   I mean, 50, 50, 56 degrees overnight, not joking after like two after two or three days
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.840]   of like 90 degree weather and we're back up to 90 degree weather.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.160]   We so we so we we got a whole bunch of of of duck and donuts and some hot coffees
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.400]   and tried not to think about that.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.520]   Hessian mercenaries at this point are far, far down on the list of things that will wipe us out.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.360]   Oh, well, part of our family lore is that one of my ancestors was a Hessian mercenary.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.320]   Oh, and then of course, many others fought on the other side.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.600]   So, you know, we have it.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.680]   Is there still like a veteran's pension?
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.840]   Are you guys like so?
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.120]   No.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.280]   For the Hessian army now.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.880]   In that case, not back.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.040]   A session.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:58.040]   And here he is all the way from Montreal where Canada Day was postponed due to rain.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.000]   Renee Richie YouTube.com/Renee Richie.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.200]   Happy Canada Day.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.760]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.160]   I'm only familiar with Hessian mercenaries from sleepy hollow where Christopher Walken was
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.640]   stranded without a head on a horse.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.560]   These things happen.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.600]   And it was crazy like that.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.560]   So I'll just, yeah.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.680]   That's my American history.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.560]   I don't know why this came down in family lore, but apparently the Hessian mercenary
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.200]   ancestor of mine was able to leap ditches quite impressively.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.920]   Don't it's the strangest bit of it was a leap.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.120]   He was a leap.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.720]   They hired him for his long legs, I guess.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:51.480]   Apple hired Larry David for his comedic skills, but perhaps not the best choice for.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.400]   Lee today, are we?
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.320]   What?
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.680]   Yeah, this is our lead story.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.200]   Right into it.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.440]   Why not?
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.160]   Larry, this is for WWDC in 2014, but Apple never ran it.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.000]   Well, watch it.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.640]   And you'll, you'll see the for obvious reasons why.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.880]   Your apps have to get through a lot to make it under the app store, namely our head of
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.560]   app approval.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.640]   By the way, if you don't watch Larry David, who was who created Seinfeld's
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.680]   Curb Your Enthusiasm, some of this will not make any sense, but this is the curbing
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.040]   music.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.200]   Basically George Costanza, right?
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.360]   That's he's the Costanza.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.240]   George was based on him, but he's great pains to say that he did not, that, you know, it
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.920]   was later modified.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.040]   Costanza with the with the confidence that comes from money.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.560]   So here he is playing the head of app approval at Apple.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.560]   There he is.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.600]   Little crumpy tower.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.080]   Oh, it's the old Apple campus.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.480]   I remember that well.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.480]   Hey, app guy.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.560]   You're the app guy, right?
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.920]   Hey, I submitted an app to you a while.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.240]   I know the note, the snack truck labeled snack and toss.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.600]   Is that real or?
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.240]   I've never said snack and toss.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.640]   I don't know.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.560]   No, I don't know.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.920]   Maybe they did it just for the film.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.160]   I didn't hear anything back.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.440]   So I wanted to put font choice.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.120]   Hangman SD and feedback and he thought at all.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.640]   I'm happy to.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.720]   I hate that game.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.640]   It gives me the will.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.640]   That's a morbid game.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.600]   More than hanging somebody.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.640]   I'd rather be electrocuted.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.520]   My mom liked it.
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.120]   Mind it.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.160]   Oh boy.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.440]   Oh boy.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.760]   This is not what you want to.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.160]   Paul, like it.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.640]   This is okay.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.120]   And it's it's when you can't have it.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.560]   Wait a minute.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:29.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.640]   One, two.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.360]   Who is that?
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.720]   I'm I believe that's just an actor.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.200]   Oh, I'm an Apple guy.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.080]   However, the CEO of Snapchat is being a appearance.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.680]   Do you work here?
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.320]   Yeah, I've been working for eight years.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.520]   Was it?
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.080]   Was it a tag?
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.320]   That's the thing I left in the home.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.600]   Oh, well, I know.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.080]   I could be wrong.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.720]   It's no, no, no, no, that's.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.880]   But you're trying to coast on my security wake?
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.560]   It doesn't matter.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.880]   The situation were reversed.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.640]   I do this for you.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.720]   It's a big shot or was reversed.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.280]   I don't know if it's were or was.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.480]   It's funnier if it's a were.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.520]   My point is if the situation were reversed, I do it for you.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.040]   That's hot.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.400]   But you know what?
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.720]   You can't reverse situations.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.920]   Situations only Superman can reverse the situation
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.840]   by spinning around the world.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.680]   They can go the other way.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.160]   I have to say, I love where I am.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.160]   And even if you don't have an ID and you couldn't prove it.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.960]   So you couldn't even prove your Superman.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.040]   It's the rules.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.200]   You just follow the wrong.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:20.680]   Yes.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:20.880]   Yes.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.840]   You have like Germany.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.640]   Exactly.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.400]   And they'll work that well.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.680]   Well, they were very well organized.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.680]   They were no security breaches.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.680]   But I have to.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.680]   I don't visit, please.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.400]   No, okay.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.600]   This is it specifically.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.480]   Well, that's your goal through security without an ID.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.680]   I'll approve it.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.400]   See, again, this is the kind of humor that works fine on HBO.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.640]   Maybe maybe as a company sponsor.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.920]   And sanctioned thing at the at a developers conference.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.240]   Later on, there's a it does it.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.720]   It does answer a lot of questions as to why the app review process
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.200]   tends to be so finicky.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.120]   That's that was a good that was a good stroke.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.200]   However, there there's like a joke about an app that he that he's
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.080]   discussing that is quite sexist.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.320]   There's a JB smooth smooth comes on who's one of the coasters, co-stars.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.360]   And let me play the JB smooth stuff because I just love JB.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.800]   Well, look, we got a lot of time to fill.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.320]   I'm just saying.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:19.880]   We're OK.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.880]   That's fine.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.040]   Here comes JB smooth.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.560]   It's a trillion dollar idea.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.000]   OK, get out of here.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.920]   I got to get back to work.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.920]   All right, Larry.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.920]   You have to use Snapchat.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:36.920]   He's a big sandwich as he does.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.120]   That's basically got father.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.920]   Oh, you know what it is.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.760]   Spicy Godfather.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.760]   So damn good.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.240]   You didn't get me one.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.080]   I hit you on snapping chat.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.160]   Now we're heard back from you.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.240]   That's not my fault.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.040]   OK, what's the got deleted?
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.520]   This is why Snapchat didn't get approved.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.120]   Yeah, you know what?
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.080]   This is something they did for developers who would have might
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.080]   have totally appreciated it.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.560]   They probably they don't want the public to see it because of, well, obvious issues.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:04.760]   Well, yeah.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.840]   Well, again, there are a couple of jokes that are again within the context of a Larry
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.320]   David comedy fine.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:17.040]   Yeah, but you don't want you don't want lines like if you're black, you can't have a snack.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.400]   That was that's a plot point that comes up.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.600]   About, you know, if you if you're white, you can't have a bite.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.040]   And again, other things is it's it's I'm glad that it's now a very much a moving
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:27.520]   target.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.600]   The the link that I posted early this morning was taken down shortly after I posted it
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.760]   on Twitter, but it's not it but it's on YouTube.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.560]   It's on other places.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.520]   Actually, in minutes, it goes on and on and on.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:44.320]   It was a it was on Vimeo for like two years before nine to five decided to like do a
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.160]   little post about it.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.880]   Now it's getting out people are looking for it.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.680]   He gets mad at the developer of a game called Upset Pigeons because he says it's
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.360]   a book of angry birds.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.360]   Evan Spiegel, the Snapchat founder, as you pointed out, is in there.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.680]   Awesome.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.520]   Awesome.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:06.080]   But yeah, it's a little sensitive subject right now for for Apple.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.840]   But these things, it's hard to keep his face when he watches it and says, who thought
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.520]   this was a good idea?
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.440]   Who thought this was a good idea?
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.080]   2014 power bar.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.640]   Scaring.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.880]   He must have approved it.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.440]   Yes.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:16.960]   No.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.560]   Didn't air.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.800]   It was 2014.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.280]   He approved and disapproved at the same time.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.280]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.120]   You hire Larry David.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.400]   I doubt you give him a script.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.720]   I know you don't give a script.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.200]   So, you know, you say, okay, well, let's see what he does.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.120]   And then you go, yeah, well, then we're not going to use that.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.120]   He's a writer.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.440]   So he's like, yeah, he's like, this is his show.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.440]   You're asking you.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.480]   It probably went through the whole production.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.240]   They just hired him, like, wouldn't that be funny?
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.600]   And then they hired him and then they watched it and we're like, I also, I'm going
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.400]   to guess he didn't give most script approval.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.120]   No, they had to mean to get Evan Spiegel to get all those people there.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.320]   I don't think he has Evan Spiegel's number to call.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.680]   Well, that helps me some sort of logistical support and I'll staff to coordinate it
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.440]   and PR and.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.880]   Oh, well, but but but it's not like when you when you've got like
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.360]   Seinfeld money as Larry David does, when you when you also have on the back of it,
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.280]   the success on HBO with his own series, like you can ask for things like, that's
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:12.760]   fine.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.920]   But the the deal is that you pay me.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.040]   I do my thing.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.120]   Then you can either choose just then at that point, you see that's right.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.560]   And you either choose to run it or not.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.920]   So this is probably not where there was a PR person with a clipboard saying that
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.320]   to do it.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:30.760]   Larry, I'm wondering if we can have that sandwich be vegetarian sandwich because
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.000]   so many Nazi references.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.400]   And I'm guessing I'm guessing that that's part of the problem with Apple TV plus.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.600]   I mean, you know, there's a reason you have a big hit with Kirby or enthusiasm
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.320]   and 11 seasons or 12 seasons.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.080]   He may, you know, we don't know the story.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.960]   I wonder if he actually pitched to exactly and said, look, look, this, I'd like to do
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.800]   this.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.920]   Here's, here's the completed story.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.640]   App savvy.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.760]   Is he savvy about how the works?
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.000]   Is he or did that require?
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.600]   There's precedent.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.760]   The the original crew from the UK office did like a version of the office for, I
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.000]   think it was Microsoft.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.680]   Oh, I didn't know that was that was also like, I think was for the sales force or
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.120]   for some other group, but it's out there and it is super funny.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.840]   It is like it is again, Ricky Gervais and the tall guy, I can never remember his name.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.720]   Is it Simon Felder Bill Gates funny?
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.720]   That was funny for a different reason, I believe.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.880]   Anyway, there's a better.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.440]   Thank you.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.720]   Larry David, better or worse than the fart app guy who was actually running
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.560]   app review at the time.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.480]   OK, you're right.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:44.760]   Is Apple actually this opens up an interesting kind of philosophical discussion.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.360]   Is Apple appeasing developers over the app store?
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.960]   It's interesting to see people like Marco Armand furious at Apple and then others
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.680]   saying we're so grateful to Apple.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.800]   There isn't a unified feeling among app developers that Apple's either doing it
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.200]   exactly right or exactly wrong.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.240]   Is there, Renee, what is your sense of that?
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.720]   It varies.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.080]   I think a lot of people and it's very over time too.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.000]   Like I went back and looked at a lot of the early sentiment when the app store was
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.760]   announced and people couldn't believe the kind of deal that they were getting.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.880]   A lot of people couldn't believe the kind of deal they were getting because the
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.560]   previous deal was so much worse, but over time, over a decade, a lot of things have
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.000]   changed, a lot of things have matured.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.600]   The market has matured and maybe Apple hasn't matured as much as they would like
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.360]   along with it.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.440]   So I think the environment now is very different and you still have some people
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.800]   who feel like they can easily make an app built on all of Apple's frameworks.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.320]   A lot of the stuff that Apple provides and make a really good business and others
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.120]   who see the popification of apps, almost like the popification of music and news
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.360]   and everything else and the value completely gone going from scarcity to
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.440]   abundance and that it's really, really hard.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:51.080]   Like getting a music single now to get a hit app and they probably resent that
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.440]   apps became a mainstream thing with.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:53.920]   They have.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:59.920]   Yeah, but I just I I just know some developers and I don't know all the
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.480]   developers, but I know some folks that are never thought that they'd be making
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:08.120]   apps and are now getting making like $50,000 a month, doing it.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.440]   And they're like, this is pretty good.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:14.120]   You know, and and they, you know, there's a lot of folks that that have benefited
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:14.480]   from this.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.880]   I mean, I think that we just have to keep on.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.280]   I mean, nothing is ever perfect.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.800]   Like we have this thing like, is everyone happy with Apple?
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.000]   No one's ever going to be happy.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.680]   And not everyone's going to be happy with Apple.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:29.840]   I think that the thing we saw in the congressional fiasco was the 30% of
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.360]   developers are unhappy with Apple.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.440]   That's actually, I thought pretty good.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.800]   I mean, if only 30% are upset about something because it's just like, they're
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.840]   not going to make everybody happy.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.760]   You know, like, you know, and it's and I think that I and again, as someone
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:47.120]   who's developed for on the Apple platform, you know, over I, you know, over
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.440]   the last 20 years on and off and I'll be putting something else on soon, the,
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.760]   you know, I just don't know if people have perspective on how hard it used to
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.320]   be to do this.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:03.600]   You know, yeah, but there's there's there's an area that we can talk about
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.080]   that comes out to are they happy with the tools that they're given?
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.960]   Are they happy with the fee structure?
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.520]   Are they happy with the rate at which Apple is releasing new features?
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.320]   Should they be releasing new features through the app store instead of
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.560]   always through annual debate?
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.040]   But there's also the simpler damn things.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.560]   Would that come down to like, why is it that when you have developers who
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:29.600]   are like first round, first round elected pick Hall of Fame developers who've been
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:35.840]   if you were to name 12 different Mac apps that are that are uniquely Mac, you
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.040]   would find these names on their on that list.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.760]   And even today, I'm not going to quote a name because I'm not sure that this
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.840]   person wanted to be put onto a podcast.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:48.240]   But say just saying that, oh, app review is just this absolute worst, most
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.200]   horrible thing we ever have to do.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.160]   And I know that this person is having a bad day.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.520]   It requires an incredible amount of emotional labor to deal with spurious app
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.680]   review rejections.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.720]   I'm quoting here.
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.800]   It's and this is again, this is not this is just this morning.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.840]   This is like two hours ago.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.280]   This is the sort of stuff that gets developers just all pretty salty and
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.400]   frosty against Apple.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:13.600]   It should they should be better at app review right now than they were like
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.480]   three years after they launched the app store, they should have fixed these
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:17.960]   problems.
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.160]   If they're not fixing it, then they've got a problem that they just don't care
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:21.720]   that much about.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:27.400]   And I'm curious what the specifics are because I posted an app for something
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.680]   I was working on last fall.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.000]   And it took eight days.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.680]   And it was, you know, there was a couple of things got kicked back and then it
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.200]   was fixed and then it was through.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.640]   You know, and it was available.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.760]   You know, and I just, and so the thing is when people say it, I'm kind of
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:41.920]   care.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.040]   I'm always curious, like, what was it that had it now?
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.040]   Well, we wrote it very, very carefully with a, you know, highly
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.600]   organized team to put it together.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.760]   And it was extremely clean code and a relatively straightforward thing to do.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.040]   But it, but it was like, I, I'm curious because it was so easy.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.880]   I was, I was, I was warning the folks who were working with it.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.760]   It was like, this could take, this could take a month.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.840]   You know, like, I don't know how long this is going to take.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.440]   And it's kind of sailed through the, the, the, the historical problems that I always
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.920]   have when I'm talking to these people.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.840]   And mostly I'm talking to like a couple of dozen, three dozen people like
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.440]   call friends who I've known for like 10 or 20 years who've been developing for,
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.440]   for Mac and the iPhone.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:29.640]   When the, when it comes down to you told us, I actually have an email from you
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:33.520]   from two weeks ago saying that if you, that if I change my app this way,
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.040]   it'll sail through it without a problem.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.360]   That was the, that was the problem that you were having.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.160]   And now you're telling me that's being denied specifically because of this change
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.280]   that you yourself just told me to make this at this.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.920]   And it's at some point when you hear, you keep hearing these stories, I'm so glad
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.840]   I'm not a, I'm not a developer because it's just what else can I do for a living
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.840]   that doesn't involve.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.880]   The, it's, it's almost as though, you know, they, they're, they're playing with
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.160]   developers for sport.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.320]   And when you have 30% of the developers who are saying that they've got problems
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.360]   with the way that Apple handles the app store, not all of them are being feel
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.400]   as though they're being, you know, let around on a chain like that.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:14.520]   But nonetheless, that's like, if a third of your workforce said that Alex, I
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.960]   don't think you're, I don't think you're a good boss.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.760]   I don't think it's good.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.920]   It's good working for you.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.680]   I don't think we'd start talking about the problems with the developers.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.800]   I think we start talking about the problems with Alex.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.720]   It was interesting to me is that, one thing that was interesting to me is I
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.920]   wanted to make, I always, I hate looking at anything in like a spherical imaginary
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:38.040]   cube. So I asked a bunch of other companies to see how this problem scales.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.840]   And I want to divide it into two things.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.120]   One, there's just the jackass stuff, which, you know, like when they'll say,
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.520]   we're not going to, we're going to reject this widget app because we don't
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.960]   want anyone else to make a widget app like it.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.040]   And that will clearly send a message so they don't have to actually go on record
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.560]   saying anything.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.440]   And I think that's garbage.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.840]   You know, never treat anybody that way.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.280]   But then like you talk to YouTube about dealing with YouTube content at scale,
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.280]   which is even bigger than the app store.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.720]   And there have been cases over the last week where people had their whole
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:05.560]   account shut down their entire livelihoods completely incorrectly and they got a
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.600]   human review and it was still upheld and they had to appeal it.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.840]   And eventually it got overturned because it was just on the face wrong.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.080]   And you look at the app store numbers and you look at the YouTube numbers and
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:19.920]   they're catching, you know, 20 million bad things every day scams and spams and
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.040]   all these things, but they're still screwing up and they'll tell you,
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.160]   anyone involved in this will tell you they don't know how to get it better.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.160]   The more they ragged it down, the more garbage gets through and the more they
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.240]   racked it up, the more false positives they have.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.440]   And there's probably a better system.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.480]   Like you look at it, you say instinctively, just look at the top 100 apps,
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.800]   just fix the top 100 apps, fix the YouTube trending page, like do any of those,
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.360]   you know, simple things, but they're operating with billions of dollars and
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.520]   millions of people and they haven't been able to solve it.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.520]   Well, I'm not sure I think it's a good point, but my
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.960]   my channel, go ahead, Pixelcore, my channel, Pixelcore was out for four months.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.960]   And I know people to call like, like, you know, on YouTube and they just couldn't
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.720]   figure out why, you know, like, like, and then they couldn't fix it.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.760]   You know, so this is not an isolated case in software.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.720]   Not at all in common.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.280]   You know, go ahead, Andy.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.080]   The, the only point that I would make that that it is a problem everywhere at
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.080]   scale.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:19.480]   This doesn't mean that Apple does have a responsibility to try to attack this
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.680]   problem better than they're doing.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.680]   But the bigger thing is that the difference between YouTube and the app
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.160]   store is that you submit an app to the app store.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.680]   It doesn't go directly onto the app store.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.280]   It simply has to go through a review process before it even has a chance to
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.080]   define its legs.
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.160]   With YouTube, the policy is that look, it goes up.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.320]   If it violates a policy, then we take it down or someone inflicts a copyright
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.320]   strike, we take it down.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.000]   If someone makes a complaint, we take it down.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:48.520]   It's not, it's, it's not as though people are being prevented from
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.640]   from uploading their first videos.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.640]   It's at the, the, the, the rails are greased towards making sure that you
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:59.200]   can put your content up there until something gets in the way after you've
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.080]   posted it that says that it should be taken down.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.320]   And that's not necessary.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:09.360]   That's not for reasons of it may be possibly because of certain reasons of
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:09.880]   scale.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.720]   But a lot of it is simply because they have a legal obligation to make sure
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:19.520]   that to, to protect themselves with Section 230, to make sure that when there
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.960]   is a complaint, when there is something that is improper, when there is
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.520]   something illegal, that that content gets taken down in a speedy manner.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.440]   And the reason, I think the reason why that a lot of YouTube creators are
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:35.240]   victimized, I do use the word victimized by, by, by Google's copyright strike
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:40.160]   policy and the taking down channels is because the, in this case, the, the
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.000]   natural flow of water is towards, if there is a, if a piece of video is
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.920]   problematic, that video comes down.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:51.080]   Cause that's the way that when they're, when you're dealing with, with the 500,000
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:55.640]   videos coming in at, at, at, at, at a, at a, at a, what is it on a one hour basis
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.600]   or a one day basis.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.080]   That's the only way to keep ahead of it.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.920]   That's the only way to make sure that you're not going to be shut down on the
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:06.240]   basis of not, not keeping up to what you agree to when you agree to these terms.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.840]   Like they'll content ID you before you go up.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.800]   Like they, like you have to pass through the check system now first.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.600]   And if you don't pass a check system, you have to change something or you can't
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.400]   go live, but mostly the accounts are being terminated now because they're
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.680]   false flagged for spam.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.680]   There's a ton of spam where people are using false usernames and YouTube gets
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.040]   confused and thinks you're the spam or even though it's people emulating you.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.200]   Being like, there, there's no part of the internet that we can have nice things
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.680]   on anymore, including you.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.840]   And I think that the thing is, is that yeah, it's harder for the, the reason
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.600]   that Apple makes it harder for the developers is because it's easier for the user.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.600]   So the user has a lot less to worry about when they download things and they
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.320]   start to use it.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:44.120]   And Apple has always, has been flat out that they prioritize the user over the
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:44.720]   developers.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.160]   Like I don't think Apple has any, has it, has ever said anything else because
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.120]   that is the lifeblood of the, of the platform.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:55.680]   It's why people buy so much stuff on the app stores because when you buy it,
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.520]   you know that it's not going to do a lot of things that happen on the Android,
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.480]   on, on the play store.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.880]   You know, and so the thing is, is that yeah, developers are having a hard time
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:07.120]   getting it through on, in some cases, again, I haven't experienced that on the
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.600]   stuff that I put up, but, but I hear that it does happen.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:15.920]   But the, but on the other side of that as a user, you know, I've gotten to the
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.520]   point where I will barely download it.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:23.120]   And if it's not a well known company, I will barely download anything off the
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.720]   internet to install on my computer.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.800]   Like I just don't trust it.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.320]   That's smart.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.080]   You know, and so.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.000]   I mean, yeah, it has to be.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.920]   Background checking before you do that.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.680]   But the problem with that is that without that, you can be as a very small
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.960]   developer, an individual developer putting something up on the app store and you
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.080]   have to go through all these hoops and you have to do all those things.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.840]   But you get that, that implicit trust that Apple has looked at it.
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.520]   Are they perfect?
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.880]   No, but the user will give you a chance.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.840]   I will play with, I will download something on my phone much faster than I'll ever
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:57.400]   do anything on my computer because I, there's the computer from my perspective
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.480]   is the Wild Wild West.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.280]   And the, and you know, so it has to be a well known company or I'm not going to
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:07.440]   buy their product anymore on the computer on a well protected, highly
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:12.320]   closed, you know, you know, gated community of the app store.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:12.920]   I look at something.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.560]   Oh, that looks cool.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.160]   And I download it.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.360]   Like I'll play with that for a little bit, you know, and I, because I, because I, I
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.960]   think that the, I believe as the user, that there's a very limited number of bad
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.880]   things that can happen.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.240]   Nothing that nothing bad can happen, but very few bad things can happen compared
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.440]   to what I would download on my computer.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.640]   And I think that that's what Apple's protecting.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.160]   And I think that we underestimate how valuable that is when we start talking
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.480]   about wanting to mess with the app store.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.800]   Even websites, I go to websites on my iPhone.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.160]   I'd never go to my Mac.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.160]   Absolutely.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.560]   And I want to, and as a user, the reason I'm so upset about this
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:51.560]   congressional stuff is that it's the only thing in my life that I think actually
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.760]   works very well.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.080]   You know, like is the way that the integration from the user's perspective,
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.680]   maybe not from the developer's perspective, but from the user's perspective,
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.280]   almost everything, it doesn't work perfectly.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.720]   My AirPods can never figure out what device they're supposed to be talking to.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.600]   But the, but I know that's because on a special case, I have lots of devices
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:14.200]   that they're near them, but the, the for the most part, it just works.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:20.480]   It really does just work for as a user and nothing else in my life seems to just
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.160]   work like in the technology world.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.480]   And so I'm very protective about that because I feel like for a bunch of
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.960]   stupid academic ideas, Congress may actually take that away from us.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.040]   You know, and that's going to be, you know, that they have in their little heads,
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:38.120]   you know, people who don't use email and, you know, are being advised by, you
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.120]   know, Android users who are tired of being left out.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.440]   Okay.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:46.200]   Well, but the, the question that we're, we are confronting more and more often
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.560]   over the past few years is that great, it works for you, but does it work for
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.160]   everybody?
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:55.200]   And is there a level playing field so that everybody has the same opportunity
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.720]   to have the same wonderful experience that you're having?
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:05.480]   And I don't think I don't like, I think regulation is, I'm saying is everybody
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.120]   having, having a really, really great experience here.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.360]   And not everybody is.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:14.000]   And what my big mind, when you say everyone, what do you, what do you mean by
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:14.400]   everyone?
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.280]   Like everyone in the world?
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.600]   I mean, because we're talking about 7 billion people, you know, two, five
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.240]   billion that are kind of left out of the way.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.880]   But Alex, if developers are having a bad experience, that ultimately hurts
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.520]   consumers because apps that you would like to see or you don't even know you
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.960]   want aren't going to appear in the app.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.120]   Developers have to be happy too.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.960]   They can't, it can't just be an user.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.920]   What, what I'm getting at is that it is absolutely 100% appropriate for Apple
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:45.280]   and other companies to say, do not have to simply as a PR thing, say, no, no, no,
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:51.320]   it's a good thing for consumers that we pre-install our fee based music, music
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.680]   subscriptions service.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:58.000]   And we pre-install our, saw our fee based music, movie streaming service and our
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.920]   fee based movie, the data storage service all built in.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.840]   And we don't allow, allow Spotify and other competitors to have that kind of
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.360]   advantage.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.600]   No, no, no, it's all for the users.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:14.400]   That's fine if Apple wants to say that in a PR statement, but I think it's 100%
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:19.400]   appropriate for lawmakers and investigators and antitrust people to say,
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.720]   go ahead and prove it.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:26.800]   Give us the paperwork, make the case in a court of law that this is not giving you,
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:32.160]   you're not helping to, to submarine other, other options by making sure that your
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.440]   stuff gets preloaded on every single phone just to, just to name one example.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:41.320]   And that this is not something that makes it harder for other, for other platforms
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.880]   to get their toe in the door on, on an iPhone.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.840]   This is not, I'm not saying, I'm not saying necessarily that the, that Apple
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.680]   should be forbidden from pre-installing Apple music on every iPhone, but I'm saying
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.840]   they have to, we're not going to take their word for it anymore.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.920]   They have to demonstrate, they have to prove it.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:00.600]   I think if they, I think that they should have to prove it in a court of law and not
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.240]   in Congress, that's the key.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.480]   You know, like that, they should take it to a court of, a court of law and have it
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.200]   adjudicated all the way to the Supreme Court and see how it turns out.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.000]   You know, but they are you, but having, are you okay with having to see,
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.440]   having to budget the power?
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.280]   Are you okay with the justice of the proper and having that power?
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.440]   As long as it, as long as it didn't problem with just the Congress.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.960]   No, because Congress is not run by people who understand technology.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.160]   Like we just have to understand they're not our friends and they're not, they're
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.320]   not, they didn't win a competency battle.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.840]   They didn't win an intelligence score.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.600]   They want a popularity contest.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.800]   And that's who's making a decision about what, what we're going to use and whether
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.600]   we as Apple users are going to have the environment.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.920]   It sounds like you have an argument with the way America runs.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.880]   And I'm going to have to call you, call you.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.960]   No, no, because that's what we do in this society.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:48.800]   We vote in representatives based on what we want them to do.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.680]   And we have to give them that power, Alex.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.240]   And you may not like it, but sorry.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.240]   That's the way it works.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.040]   I think we as users need to just apply pressure.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.440]   That I'm not saying that it should be any other way.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.520]   We just have to know that the people who are making these laws don't know what
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.040]   they're doing, that we need to make.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.040]   I would disagree with you on that.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:08.440]   And I think that we give them that power because society needs to regulate this
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.560]   stuff and somebody has to do it.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.960]   And you can say, well, I don't like the guys who are doing it.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.160]   And you have absolutely go out and campaign for people who do know what they're
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.560]   doing, but that's the way it works here.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:23.960]   No, no, I'm saying that the people who are as Apple users, we have a choice right
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:27.440]   now. And that is to pick out the six or eight people who created, you know,
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.520]   who publish these laws and make sure that they're phone rings.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.120]   That's that we have a we have an absolute citizen.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.040]   And that's your duty as a citizen.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.840]   If these laws get through, it means that we as the users didn't do our job.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.720]   But it's a little bit of a combat to say, well,
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.120]   we can't we can't let the government get involved in this because they don't know
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.040]   what the hell they're doing.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:49.520]   That basically says we should let big tech decide what to do period end of story.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.600]   And I don't think that that's an acceptable solution either.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.800]   Well, I know right.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.080]   And I just think that you involved if you're if you're a user and you and you
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.920]   want to have the environment that you have right now and you don't want to put it
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.360]   at risk, what you should be doing is calling those congressmen.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.080]   Yes.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.040]   Yes.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:05.800]   All the time.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.160]   Yes.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:11.840]   But I but I really dislike the the narrative that government sucks because they're
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:12.360]   stupid.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.440]   And so we shouldn't have any government because that's a false.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.040]   I didn't say that.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:19.680]   I said you said you said you shouldn't let Congress regulate this because they
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.880]   don't understand technology.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.800]   They don't.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:26.760]   But you should you do have like I didn't say I didn't say it should be in a
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.240]   government.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.440]   I didn't say I just want to be implying that I don't be saying Congress doesn't
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.320]   understand technology.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.720]   So they should not regulate it.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.800]   That's absolutely their duty and right.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.760]   And if you don't like it, you should elect somebody else.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.320]   But that's the way it works.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.160]   I'm not saying that there shouldn't be a government though or implying that there
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:41.920]   shouldn't be a government.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.440]   I think that that would be a horrible idea.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:49.280]   I think what all I'm saying is is that they should be very careful about sticking
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.080]   their nose into something they don't understand.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:55.440]   That's the thing that and generally if the government, if it's a sure thing,
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.880]   the government will probably screw it up half the time.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.200]   If it's an it's an unknown, they'll screw it up almost all the time.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.240]   You know, and so the thing is, it's fine.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.720]   And we just need to, I'm not saying the government should not make any laws or it
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.880]   shouldn't exist or anything crazy like that.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:14.680]   I'm just saying when they start, when you look at how deep these are, these, these
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:19.280]   laws and how nebulous they are, where they give the government enormous amounts of
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:31.880]   power and they're creating a new bureau and they're creating, you know, they're, it's, it is, these are extremely, these aren't like little, like Apple can't do one thing or, or these, it is, these are incredibly deep laws that we're talking about.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.040]   This is, these are not little scalpels.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:37.640]   These are huge blades that they're talking about adding to it that give them almost
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:43.600]   unfettered right to do a whole lot of things that, that could damage our experience as an, as Apple users.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:48.320]   If it was a little law, it wouldn't be the big deal, but it's giving it, it's so nebulous.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.280]   The laws are so poorly written and so open ended that it basically lets the
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.880]   government do anything that they want to do in these areas.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.920]   And so the thing is, is that if it was more, if it was a better written law, more
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.120]   specific, I think that it would be fine.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.240]   You know, I think there's a lot of things.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.560]   I mean, telling Apple they can't put their apps on.
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:14.440]   I don't, I don't think that that's going to, you know, because people just put them on, you know, but, but I don't think, but, but I think that starting to do things like sideloading absolutely will affect our, our security.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.520]   And, you know, and create this huge mess for a user.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:23.880]   I'll just say that I've, I've been talking to a whole bunch of people who have, who have
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:31.160]   experience in not the people who don't work on government, but people who analyze laws and what, and basically
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.960]   what they say a government can and cannot do.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:42.280]   And they've been explaining to me about these five laws that are being, they're still being rewritten and still being argued and debated through Congress right now, not something that's been put up to vote yet.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:52.080]   And they, what they've been telling me does not put me in agreement with your conclusion of what these laws mostly encompass.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:58.040]   I think that mostly what they're doing is they're putting the FTC and the Justice Department with
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:14.960]   power to do more than simply settle cases, which is something that they desperately need because they don't, right now they don't have the power to do Jack with a, if they, if they, they've, they've, Facebook has had the ability to bust two major settlements with the FTC.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:27.480]   And knowing that, look, if we bust these agreements, all we got to do is keep this thing in litigation and get to the point where, where the government is crawling on their knees to settle this and we'll write them a check and then we're done.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.320]   We're beyond this.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:42.600]   We need one of the, this is why one of these laws that I'm looking at with giving the FTC the power to actually do stuff, saying, look, if you hear a rule, whatever these rules are, we're not going to tell it, talk about the nature of these rules at this point.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:50.360]   We're just saying that we're going to have the ability to absolutely sink our t sinks, actually draw blood on these companies.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:56.000]   If you decide to be on the level that that that Facebook has decided to be.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.400]   I don't think that's a bad thing.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.480]   They're not representative government.
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:03.640]   That's, that's handing the FTC a bureaucracy, the ability to do, to do damage.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.080]   All right.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.160]   Well, that's, that's their, that's their job.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.120]   We can't do this.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.840]   Our regulatory agency.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:13.200]   Someone, someone has to have the stick that can beat right now.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.280]   We've got all, I will wind this up.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:15.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.000]   No, no, I will.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   I'm going to say it behind you.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.720]   I will, I will, I will, I will.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:19.720]   I will.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:20.080]   I will.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   I will.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   I will.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   I will.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   I will.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   I will.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   I will.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   I will.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.080]   I will.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:21.080]   I will.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.080]   I will just, I will.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.360]   All I'm, all I'm saying is that right now.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:30.760]   Google controls the access point to the internet for so much of the world right now.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:36.160]   It's by, by, by having created a brilliant search, a search tool that works great and
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.080]   they keep improving it.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.920]   Facebook, there are many countries for which Facebook is the internet.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:47.200]   And right now, the, the idea that we don't have some bizarre radical right
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:52.840]   wing or left ring zealot running Google who says that, no, no, no, any time someone
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:57.280]   asks for information on this political issue, we're only going to give them information
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.560]   that is, that, that supports our side of things.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.320]   Or we're going to do it in such a subtle way that people never figure out what we're
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.320]   doing it.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.040]   We're relying on their good graces right now for that.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.720]   And at this scale, that's no longer good enough.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:13.320]   So I'm just saying I'm very, very open to the idea of giving regulators more ability
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:17.360]   to make sure they're put a little bit of the fear of God and them if necessary, saying
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.760]   that no, you will not settle this in eight years time by giving us a check for 12, 12
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.760]   million dollars.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.800]   And except we're not looking for, for a press release, speaking issue, saying, Hey, look
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.800]   how, how we brought Facebook to its knees.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:34.560]   We are going to make you get rid of your CEO because he's been lying to us time and time
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.560]   again.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:39.600]   We're going to make you divert, divest yourself of this part of your business, which you've
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:44.960]   told us twice, over the course of six years that you are going to change the way you operate
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.840]   these businesses and not done anything about it.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.200]   That's, that's what I'm going for.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:53.760]   But I do, I don't have blind faith in the government, but I do believe that without regulatory agencies,
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:37:00.120]   they are, they do think they are like unions in the sense that individually citizens have
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:03.200]   no power to fight against a two trillion dollar company.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:09.240]   If the, if people who are ordinary citizens can activate their government to say, we are,
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:14.280]   we don't want this to, we don't want these companies to have this power over us on this
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:18.280]   specific issue, then we do have some power against these companies and they can't just
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.720]   simply do whatever they want.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:20.720]   So that's, that's my point.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.720]   They can't, if they pay enough money.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.720]   Hold on a second.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.560]   Like, like the way I just want to say what the question is.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.400]   How like you get a very strong bias against this?
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.400]   I understand.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.400]   Cable companies.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.000]   So work to improve it, but we have bad internet.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   I understand.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   Because they, because they pay.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.840]   I agree, Alex, but the problem is what, what you end up doing is you get people to just
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.960]   give up on government.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:45.520]   And so the answer is not to give up on government, but to get better people in the office lobby.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:50.320]   Well, you know, I would say more directly to, to find you to get the context for these
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.720]   congressmen and make and get them the information.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.720]   I agree with you.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.720]   I agree with you.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.720]   I agree with you.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.720]   Get the information.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.560]   That's how we, that's how we, that's how we process those.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.160]   Yeah, those bills.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.160]   And we did stop them.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.160]   And that's the point.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.160]   This is a process.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.800]   Those bills have to go through, you know, a lot of committee work.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.800]   Courts will get involved.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.680]   It's a very elaborate system.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:16.000]   And I think for the most part, it works, but it's the only way we as a society have to
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.840]   express what we want from these big tech companies.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.520]   The alternative is to let them run rampant.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.400]   And I don't think that's the solution either.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.600]   So we got to make it work, and we got to make it work better.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:29.520]   But I don't, I really worry when you start arguing that way that what happens is people
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.520]   just give up on government.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.920]   And I don't think that's the right answer.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.040]   Well, I don't think they should give up on government, but I think that they should
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:38.720]   know that, that beyond voting, we have the power to stop it by just simply picking up
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.720]   the phone.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.720]   And that's all I was saying.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.320]   Don't, but, well, you change your tune a little bit because what you said is, you can't trust
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.280]   these guys to do anything about it.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.240]   So we shouldn't let them know what you should do is inform them.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.240]   They're not going to respond.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.040]   They're not going to respond by you arguing.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.400]   They're not going to respond by you arguing the points because they don't really understand
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.400]   the points.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.720]   We also respond to as X number of calls are coming in against.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:00.720]   I agree with you.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:02.720]   That's involved.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.720]   They're very low risk.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.680]   The risk of what you're saying is that people will get uninvolved.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.680]   Get involved.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.680]   That's the right answer.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:14.240]   Margaret Vastiger, by the way, it's not just going to be the US and the EU is also saying,
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:19.840]   while I think privacy and security is paramount in importance to everyone, it's not a shield
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:20.840]   against competition.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.440]   And she's pointing out that Apple might be using this.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:31.160]   Well, sideloading is bad for privacy and security as a way of defending an anti-competitive
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.160]   stance.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.440]   So you're going to have to face this as well.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.920]   I mean, it's not just in the US, it's in the EU as well.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:40.600]   I will say that's something that I'm very concerned about that.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:44.880]   I believe that Apple is picking and choosing certain issues as smokescreens for things
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.920]   that they can't really defend.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:51.040]   Like why are they so violently opposing right to repair?
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.600]   They're not talking about stuff like that.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:57.120]   They're not talking about, oh, well, it's ridiculous to have to force us to sideload
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.720]   apps because it creates a security problem.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:00.720]   Yes, it would.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:04.840]   Weakness, the weak and the security of the Apple, excuse me, of the iPhone.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.760]   And I do agree that I don't think that sideloading is something that Apple should be forced
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.760]   to do.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:10.760]   But OK, great.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:15.960]   But Apple, we've got this other bushel basket full of other issues that are kind of that
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.440]   are potentially anti-consumer that you don't want us to talk about.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:24.600]   You want us to reject this entire concept based on the fact that part of the part of
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:28.040]   the one or two of these issues are things that we agree with you on.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.360]   We don't agree with you on everything.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.360]   Don't assume that.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:34.800]   And be open to talking about all these other issues that are part of that whole panel.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:40.440]   And I think it's fair to expect Apple to act in their own self-interest, of course, as
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.240]   all corporations do.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:48.040]   And so somebody has to say, look, that might be in what you think is in your self-interest,
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.040]   but we the users are not as happy.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.560]   Well, the users, it's in most of our interest.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.920]   What it's really not in is in the developers who want to get in.
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.520]   I get that it's not in their interest.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.520]   But as the user--
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.520]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.520]   I think about it.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.280]   Let's not use Epic, but let's use Microsoft's XCloud.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:06.200]   Microsoft has decided not to fight this battle.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.560]   But Apple will not let them put XCloud in as an app.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.600]   So they have to use Safari as a browser.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.600]   So you can use XCloud.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.760]   And it's a sub-optimal solution.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:18.720]   As a user, I would like to be able to play my Xbox games on my iPad.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:23.360]   But because it has to be done in the browser, which Apple kind of poorly supports, it's
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.800]   not a very good experience.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.520]   Who's that in the benefit far off?
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.080]   As a user, I guess I just don't care.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.880]   I would never play it on that.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.880]   I guess that's you.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.880]   That's something I was telling most.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:35.880]   Things are working great.
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.880]   Things are working great for you.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:37.880]   I do too.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.880]   That doesn't mean for everybody.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:43.280]   That's one of the things where I think Apple is going to have to change their mind based
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.800]   on overwhelming pressure from everybody who does care about it, which is an effect of
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.800]   it.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.880]   And you can say, oh, look, it's just Apple versus Microsoft.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.880]   But it's not.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.880]   And users have a dog in this hunt as well.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.880]   Apple can be dumb.
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:54.880]   I mean, they're not a monoculture.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:55.880]   And there's a lot of people there.
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.520]   And they have the same kind of arguments internally that we have on this show every week.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.520]   And, I mean, I think that's a lot of people who are going to play.
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.520]   And I think that's a lot of people who are going to play.
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:08.520]   And I think that's a lot of people who are going to play.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.520]   And I think that's a lot of people who are going to play.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:13.520]   And I think that's a lot of people who are going to play.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.520]   And I think that's a lot of people who are going to play.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.520]   And I think that's a lot of people who are going to play.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.520]   And I think that's a lot of people who are going to play.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.520]   And I think that's a lot of people who are going to play.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:22.520]   And I think that's a lot of people who are going to play.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:23.520]   And I think that's a lot of people who are going to play.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.520]   And I think that's a lot of people who are going to play.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:28.520]   And Kevin Tofel wrote an article about it in GigaOM, Eddy Q got the article Reddit, went
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:32.520]   and bought it, Sam's on Galaxy tab, and then convinced him, convinced Steve and Tim they
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.520]   had to make this.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.520]   Good.
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.520]   So that's not worse.
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:40.520]   And I think Apple capitulating the pressure from the consumer totally makes sense.
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:45.520]   I think that it arbitrarily being, you know, changing the entire business model from a
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:49.520]   government perspective is the thing that puts us at danger of having something that, for
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:54.120]   me, is a core part of what I do, a core part of my day, probably most of my days on some
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.440]   kind of Apple piece of hardware.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:00.120]   And I admit that I just don't want it to be messed with, you know, because I understand
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.520]   these that it'll be my life will be in there.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:04.200]   But consumers don't always act in their own interest.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:08.120]   And the really Apple set it up quite cleverly.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.520]   You know, Apple will always say, well, you could just switch to Android and Windows,
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.520]   you know, see you.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:16.120]   But they've set it up quite cleverly to keep people locked into the ecosystem.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.400]   Which was Microsoft's thing.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.400]   They're still Apple.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.400]   Don't come after us.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.400]   They're still Apple.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.400]   Who wins the money in some stock.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.400]   They're still.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.400]   By the way, good news.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.600]   It's like Apple might make a new iPad mini.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.920]   I've been seeing rumors that that's not dead, right?
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:29.920]   An iPad Air Mini.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.920]   An iPad Air Mini, iPad Mini Air.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.280]   I don't know which way you are.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.920]   A smaller version of the iPad Air.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.760]   This is Mark Gurman again.
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.760]   And he's very well connected.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.200]   So let's hope that's the case.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:45.400]   I'm going to give Apple some props because they did do something interesting in China.
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.600]   This is from the financial times.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:54.960]   An Apple created the switch to turn off IDFA.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:00.840]   Advertisers in China decided to create an alternative back channel that would allow them
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:05.680]   to track iPhones for advertising called CAID.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:11.920]   Baidu Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance were involved in this.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.880]   The Financial Times reported its existence.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:20.480]   Marketing technology experts said the project marked a grave risk to Apple's global privacy
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.960]   rules and its $50 billion business in China.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:30.840]   Apple took a hard line stance on this blocking updates to several apps that caught enlisting
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.720]   CAID and their software updates.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:39.120]   And after that reaction, according to the Financial Times, the Chinese alternative to
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.360]   IDFA lost support and the whole project failed the game traction.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.360]   What did Eastwood stare?
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:44.360]   Can you imagine?
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.360]   They stirred him down.
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.360]   Tim Cook's there.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.480]   And they stood up to Facebook too.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.000]   There's some things that they're willing to really go to the line on with some of the
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.800]   biggest internet companies in the world and privacy seems to be there.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.960]   It's a little tougher with China because you're not only taking on an intercom, you're taking
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.480]   on a government.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:04.360]   And CAID was state backed.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:09.160]   But apparently the Chinese, and this is what happened, I would guess happened, as the Chinese
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:13.960]   government said, well, we're not going to fight this battle quite yet.
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:21.040]   And they could wind up tripping into a mud hole sometime in the future because you really
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:25.120]   never know where policy is going to go in China.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:31.440]   Right now there's a big, big sweep that is on the surface, very, very pro-consumer,
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:41.320]   like the bright sharing app that used to be actually owned by Uber, has been shut down
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.640]   but their app has been taken off of the app stores.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:49.080]   They can still operate but they can't sign up new users until the Chinese internet regulatory
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:55.440]   agency and the company have come to an agreement about the regulatory agency told this company
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:01.680]   that we've reviewed your data privacy policies and we don't think they're sufficient.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.520]   You're not protecting information well enough.
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.920]   So on the, and of course the company has come back saying thank you for bringing this to
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:09.920]   our attention.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.880]   I'm going forward to working with you to get this app up and running and we will continue
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:15.720]   to serve our existing customers.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:20.800]   But part of it is of course because of security but also they also consider it a problem of
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:26.680]   state security where if information can leak out of these apps, personal information,
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:33.200]   names, addresses, modes of travel habits, this is information that a foreign agency or a
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.400]   foreign entity can get a hold of as well.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:42.280]   So they're very, very much interested in making sure that it's like you can't spy on your
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:43.280]   users.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.520]   Only we can spy on your users.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.520]   Hey, knock it off.
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.520]   Tighten up.
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.440]   Well, they might mind if it's a problem.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:55.360]   And this might also be a case of some group using privacy as a shield for what they really
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:01.640]   want because there's some speculation this came after DD had an IPO in the United States
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:05.760]   and that what and in fact other actions from the Chinese regulatory bodies kind of maybe
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:09.360]   confirm this that really what they're mostly concerned about is let's not have Chinese
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.440]   companies on the New York stock exchange.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:17.560]   So I like your sentiment Andy but it's not exactly clear what the Chinese government is
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:18.560]   up to.
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.560]   True.
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:22.640]   They've gone after more companies than that but yeah, you're right.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.280]   I'm not an old China hand.
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.200]   I'm not an expert.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:31.800]   I talked, I have a list of people that are now very, very, very sick of like talking
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:37.760]   because hey, what about this thing about the right ship and we're having a cookout.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:38.760]   You mentioned right.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.400]   You mentioned right to repair an apple.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.560]   I think you're right Andy.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:46.080]   Apple's unreasonable opponent opposition to that.
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:49.600]   In fact, extreme lobbying against it in state by state.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:55.760]   The president is directing the FTC to draft this came out today from Bloomberg.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:48:00.440]   New rules that aimed at stopping manufacturers from limiting consumers ability to repair
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:03.360]   products at independent shops are on their own.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:09.560]   This is a leak but that would be really good news if an executive order comes out that
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:13.440]   says, you know, we really want to support the right to repair and we urge the FTC to
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.440]   get involved in this.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.440]   European Commission also do that.
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.440]   They're just incredibly controlling.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:22.880]   The whole psychology of understanding this is Apple just wants to completely control
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:28.400]   all of this and allow only the sorts of repairs that they can fussily maintain with zero chance
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.720]   of litigation against them.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.240]   They have these ideas.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:36.720]   You can laugh at them too but this is like giant Apple sort of since the days of Steve
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.640]   Jobs stealing the Macintosh ideas that people are going to get.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.640]   He didn't want anybody going in the Mac.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.440]   No, I don't even know if it's lawsuits.
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:47.440]   I think it's also they just don't want people to have a bad experience in blame Apple.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.440]   They don't want they don't want any liability or culpability at all.
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:54.120]   A lot of this is shielding but a lot of it also is the is a thing is like like for me
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:57.200]   again, it's one of those things where you either have to let me do it or you have to
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:01.760]   do all of it at cost like with abundant availability and right now they can't do either.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:05.320]   Yeah, I am sympathetic to Apple's point of view.
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:09.080]   Maybe less so to John Deere's point of view about this but I'm somewhat sympathetic but
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:12.640]   at the same time, I also believe you bought it.
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.800]   You get to break it if you want.
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:18.200]   There are also a lot of trade secrets and a lot of the parts they get are slightly like
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.680]   people will say, why don't they just make the part like a lot of those parts are like
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.280]   we don't want it the way that Dell has it.
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:25.760]   Please change these two things and that way it's only ours and then they don't have enough
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.360]   chips even for themselves and we have sortages for devices every year because there's lack
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:32.360]   of supply and they just they won't have enough for supply chain.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.840]   And the answer that's going to be stop using you know like to start using commodity parts
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:37.760]   and then they're going to throw up in their head a little bit.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:43.760]   Well, but part but part of is just if they were just to release information to qualified
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.480]   people, that would be enough.
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:48.320]   Again, I'm amazed every time I go onto YouTube.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:55.080]   Now the algorithm is very, very good at finding like a Mac book and an iPhone and iPad fix
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:50:01.800]   it channels saying, well, now that we've removed this proprietary IC, I'm going to use this
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.880]   solder mask that I got off of.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:08.960]   I got off of Grunozware to reball this chip that I salvaged off of another machine that
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:12.040]   had had a broken burst battery.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:15.760]   If they can source their own parts that kind of that will negate that.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:20.280]   I'm just I think that we should all be a little bit upset that Apple just wants to shut the
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:24.400]   door in this completely as opposed to figuring out a way that is reasonable for everybody.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.000]   I'll give you a good example.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.720]   This is my Pixel 4 XL, a couple of years old battery swelled and popped the back off
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:32.880]   of it.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:36.480]   And after a number of people said you really shouldn't continue to charge it.
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.640]   No, it might be in the flames.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:42.160]   I went to I fix it, I ordered a replacement battery.
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:47.480]   They had excellent video or actually I guess it was a step by step and all the tools came
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.480]   with it.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:53.920]   I was a little nervous, $40 I think and replaced it and it's working perfectly.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:56.760]   So I like that I could do that.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:59.800]   I mean, of course, most people would probably want to go to repair shop and do it.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.760]   But for me, it was a fun little thing to do.
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:03.760]   It worked great.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.800]   This swelling has gone down.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:08.400]   I'm happy to report.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.400]   And you can soup.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.400]   Did it work?
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:12.400]   That's the right to.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.240]   That's where I appear is all about.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:19.000]   There's a lot of places without Apple stores and without any Apple repair centers and people
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.560]   literally have no recourse.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:22.720]   They have to use mail and you don't write about your phone.
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:23.720]   No.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:28.600]   So the fact that I fix it had the part, they had the tools and the explanation of how to
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.240]   do it, that's all we're asking.
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:34.600]   And Apple's really tight with those parts and those manuals.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.400]   They've really and now they've loosened up a little bit.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.400]   They can open it up again.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:40.880]   They'll shut everything down and they'll go, "Okay, we'll license these centers, but
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:41.880]   only these centers."
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.400]   And on March, not in April, but that's, again, it's not available.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:47.200]   I mean, look, this is a perfect, I would love it if they had screws.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.280]   This was glued together.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:53.640]   So I had to fix it, sends you a little bolster that you heat up in the microwave that warms
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:55.800]   the thing up so it melts the glue.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.720]   You can pry it off and all that stuff.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:03.280]   But it, you know, I'm not that offended by the use of adhesives and stuff like that.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:08.480]   Because there is an argument to be made that users do not want a phone that is half an
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:14.320]   inch thick, that could be taken apart with easy to access hex bolts.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.320]   They want something that's slim, that's lightweight.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.560]   And what the adhesives make it waterproof.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:25.880]   But what Apple doesn't seem to want to argue is that we will, if you give us the information
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:28.800]   that we need, we will figure out how to open it up.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.760]   We'll take care of that.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:32.520]   We will figure out how to seal it back up again.
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:33.880]   And if we break it well, we open it.
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.360]   We will say, ah, dagnab it.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:37.640]   Oh, well, that's on me.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:42.560]   It's just frustrating when it would be frustrating if Apple decided, by the way, we, for no,
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:47.320]   for no reason whatsoever for, for the, for the, for the, to improve our product for our
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:51.960]   users, we decided to coat the entire logic board after it's assembled with, with epoxy
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:56.360]   threaded with the cordite so that the entire thing, well, it's often explosive charge
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:01.680]   of its exposed to exposed to light, like, oh, well, thank you very much.
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.680]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:04.920]   Do not mess with explosive bolts on iPhone.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:05.920]   Yes.
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:06.920]   Okay.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:07.920]   Thank you very much.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:08.920]   Let's take a little break.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:13.560]   Andy Anaco, Renee Richie, Alex Lindsey, we're talking and we're talking.
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.040]   We're talking about Apple.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:19.280]   I said today brought to you by hover.
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.080]   I own a lot of domain names.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:23.440]   I really, I have a, I have a problem.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:28.840]   I admit it, but it makes it so easy to go to hover.com and register a domain name.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:33.400]   And there's so many great reasons to own your own domains.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:36.600]   If you're a blogger, you know, I have Leo dot FM for my blog.
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.720]   I also have Leo support.com for my blog.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:45.520]   If you're, if you're a photographer and artist to have a portfolio, I, my, my photos are
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.640]   at Leo dot camera, which I got at hover.
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.080]   I think that's awesome.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.360]   Building an online store.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:55.960]   Just, you know, maybe a more memorable link to your LinkedIn page.
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.560]   Hover's got the best domain names and email addresses just for you.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:04.400]   I have Leo dot Ist for our German audience.
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:09.040]   Email at your domain name, of course, is one of the best things everybody absolutely
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:11.600]   should do, especially if you're a business.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:17.760]   It's just not cool to redirect to Hotmail or Yahoo or, you know, mybusiness@gmail.com
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.520]   just doesn't protect, project the right image.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:25.600]   You can still use Gmail or Yahoo or Hotmail if you want, but, but have it be a domain name
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.440]   that reflects to that or even better.
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.520]   Let Hover do the, the, the mail.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.520]   They do a great job.
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:33.680]   It's so easy to set up.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:37.480]   You can, you can add as many mailboxes to your domain as you need.
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:41.280]   And when your domain renews, your mailboxes renew too.
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.480]   Very affordable.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:46.360]   The most popular mailbox, basically it's a no brainer for business owners.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:49.480]   Have that business name and let Hover handle the mail too.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.600]   So you get the privacy that way too.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.440]   And you get access from anywhere.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:57.520]   Of course, you continue to use the email app you're already comfortable with.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:59.120]   Hover has web mail as well.
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.880]   So a lot of people prefer that.
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:06.360]   And as I said, you know, I, I reflect my hover domain names to various email services.
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.680]   You can do that too.
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:11.160]   It's just the best way to get set up.
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.880]   And they don't try to upsell you on stuff you don't need.
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:18.000]   They have very, very good pro level DNS tools for domain and email management.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   They're intuitive.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.080]   They're easy to use.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.240]   I'm in there all the time.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.800]   They're private and secure.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:28.040]   You know, a lot of companies will upsell you on who is privacy.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:31.440]   Hover just throws it right in with a domain purchase because they know you want to stay
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:32.440]   private.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:33.680]   Great way to reduce spam.
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:37.120]   Protect yourself from unwanted solicitations.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:42.920]   Hover connect makes it very easy to wire up the service you want to use, whether it's
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:45.720]   WordPress or Squarespace or Shopify.
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.720]   Host your website.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:50.880]   It helps you start using those domain names just a couple of clicks.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:51.880]   So it's really nice.
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:55.480]   It makes it very easy for somebody who is not a domain name guru, but they also have
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:59.360]   great tools for people who are and who know how to use DNS.
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:03.800]   That hover, the main point is you're a customer and not a source of data.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:08.640]   Take back control of your data with reliable tracker free email.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:11.720]   Hover is trusted by hundreds of thousands of customers who use their domain names and
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:13.960]   email and turn their ideas into reality.
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:17.440]   And you should check out Hover on a regular basis because they always have sales.
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:23.200]   I noted they've got a big sale in the dot A-R-T, the dot art extension right now.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.520]   Whether you're a developer, a photographer, a small business hover has something for you
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:29.880]   to expand your projects and get the visibility you want.
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.760]   Hover dot com slash twit.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:35.960]   Remember that because you'll get 10% off your first purchase of any domain extension
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.160]   for the entire first year.
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:45.240]   Hover h-o-v-e-r dot com slash twit 10% off your domain extension for a full year.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:47.120]   I think Hover for their support.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.400]   The most recent domain I registered was my name backwards.
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:53.640]   Somebody in the chat room said, do you have OA-electrapal dot com?
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.240]   I said, oh, no, I don't.
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:56.920]   I don't know what I'm going to do with it.
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:57.920]   But maybe I--
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:58.920]   >> It's arrow Leo.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:56:59.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:02.560]   >> I can make a backwards website or something.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:04.560]   Leo with an L for the long--
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:07.440]   >> I love Hover anyway.
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:10.520]   Thank you Hover for letting me-- host all my domain names there.
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:11.520]   I really appreciate it.
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:14.240]   Thank you for your support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:19.920]   You, Mac Break Weekly fans, can support us by going to Hover dot com slash twit.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:22.720]   That is all.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:23.720]   >> Apple--
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:26.920]   >> I think we give Mark Zuckerberg on that power glider with a flag enough to Leo.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:30.320]   I feel like that was a pivotal moment in our culture this year.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:31.760]   And I can never unsee it.
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:32.760]   >> Wait a minute.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:33.760]   Tell me where that is.
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:34.760]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:35.760]   Oh, God.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.760]   >> Oh, my God.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.760]   You haven't seen it yet?
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:38.760]   Mark Zuckerberg posted a picture on--
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:39.760]   >> I don't know what--
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.760]   >> --of the video on Fourth of July where he's on a rant.
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:42.760]   >> How did this make sense?
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:46.000]   >> It was called a hyper glider surfboard with the American flag.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   >> How did--
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.800]   >> No zinc, no suntan lotion this year.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:51.600]   >> How did this make sense?
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:54.360]   >> I'm searching for this like crazy.
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:55.360]   >> Mark Zuckerberg--
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:58.040]   >> It was all over Twitter yesterday, I think.
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.680]   It was yesterday that before it was--
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:01.760]   >> See, there are reasons it's good to be on Twitter.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:02.760]   Not many.
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:06.800]   >> 24 seconds later, the number of memes based on this video out number the post of this
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:07.800]   video by at least 10 to 1.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:08.800]   >> Or it's good to be off Twitter.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:09.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:10.800]   >> Either way.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:15.400]   >> A rut over Mark Zuckerberg's flag toting July 4th video.
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:17.600]   Here is-- can I get it to play?
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:19.680]   No, I can't.
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.200]   Let's see, let's see if we can see it.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:22.800]   I haven't heard it is.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.000]   Oh, my God.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:32.600]   What is he-- he's-- he's-- he's wakesurfing with the American flag and playing John Denver
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:33.600]   music.
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:34.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:37.440]   >> I'm going to pause that so that we don't get that taken down.
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:39.240]   He may own it, but we don't.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:40.720]   He probably does own it.
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:41.720]   >> Oh, look.
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:42.720]   >> Maybe--
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.160]   >> Maybe Denver can copy strike him.
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:48.920]   >> You know, he's a patriot.
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:50.280]   I guess he's not being towed.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.280]   That's an electric surfboard, huh?
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.280]   >> Yeah, okay.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:59:00.240]   >> So it's got a vein so that at a certain-- a vein is so that at a certain point it
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:04.400]   will actually hover a couple of feet above the surface of the water.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.960]   So I have to say this really--
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:06.960]   >> I have to say this really--
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:07.960]   >> Last year's picture of him--
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:08.960]   >> Yes.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.680]   >> --with way too much.
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:15.880]   Now we know how he keeps his pearly complexion way too much sunscreen on the same, by the
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.880]   way.
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.880]   >> Well, he was dressed up as an Urukhai for Lord of the Rings day.
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:19.880]   You can't blame him.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.720]   >> It's really terrifying.
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:22.720]   >> Okay.
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:23.720]   Okay.
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:30.200]   I don't-- you know, this is two things I don't actually pay attention to.
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:32.400]   Twitter and Mark Zuckerberg, so-- but I'm glad--
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.400]   >> Oh, we're sorry, Lee.
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:39.040]   >> Actually, he posted that on Instagram, but they apparently went crazy on the Twitter
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.040]   talking about it.
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:47.760]   I bet that once you reach a certain echelon at Apple's executive ladder, they give you
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:52.480]   that like week-long training course about, okay, don't do stuff like this.
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:57.120]   And also, if you're going to post photos of yourself, make sure you're not writing like
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:05.000]   an $8,000 tech bro recreational device, because that only rubs nettles into the wound.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.640]   Just tweet about how nice this new iPhone is.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:15.560]   >> For a billionaire, nothing like that is like a-- nothing like that is just like,
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.640]   oh, someone just shot that with their video.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.280]   Like, that took people and things and process.
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.680]   And that was like a couple days of planning.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.680]   And you know, like, it was to do that.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.680]   >> Oh, you think so?
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:26.680]   You think Mark didn't just like-- >> Oh, yeah.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.680]   >> --bessie on the windmill.
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.480]   >> --and say, hey, hey, shoot.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.200]   Let's do this, shoot me, and we'll post it.
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.200]   I don't think.
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.200]   >> Lovey.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.200]   >> Lovey.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.200]   >> I'm a flag.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.200]   >> Lovey.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.600]   >> I would-- I would-- I wouldn't be terribly shocked if it really was just somebody
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:43.360]   in the support boat, because this is like a--
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.360]   >> This is a support ski.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:48.280]   >> You got to go-- no, you got to-- you got to do this off of a boat, because you're
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.120]   not going to make it all the way across the bay that way.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.120]   >> There's the alternate already a track.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.120]   >> But nobody-- nobody's behind us.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:56.040]   >> No one's-- no one decided I'm going to lose-- I am willing to lose my job at Facebook
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.760]   over saying, dude, no.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.760]   >> The alternate on the track.
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:07.800]   >> Or maybe-- or maybe you just realized, okay, look, Elon Musk is about to go up into
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.320]   space on his own spacecraft.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:12.000]   >> Jeff Bezos is about to go up into space on his own spacecraft.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   >> I must be feeling left behind.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:20.640]   >> I got to show-- I got to show that I have my own high-tech enviable space age aqua boom
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.640]   device.
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:25.360]   >> Somebody, though, made a good point.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:28.080]   That flag, that's got a lot of resistance.
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.920]   Him holding that.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.240]   And you know, he's doing pretty well.
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:32.240]   That guy's strong.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.240]   That's not an easy thing to do.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.240]   >> We're going to try that.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.240]   >> Well, that's true.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.240]   And Andrew could do it.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.240]   >> Data could do it.
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.240]   >> Data could do it.
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.880]   >> Yeah, I mean, and who's operating the hoverboard?
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:43.880]   Somebody's got to be holding the--
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.880]   >> There's a submarine over there.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.880]   Alex, not how this is all done.
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.720]   >> There's an October.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.760]   There's a prop underneath that fin.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:55.080]   >> Yeah, but normally you'd be holding the remote control for that.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.080]   So you're right.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.480]   Maybe Alex, maybe you are right.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.480]   >> Good point.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.480]   >> Somebody else is driving.
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.480]   >> Or the whole thing is rendered.
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.480]   >> It's a-- it does look a little--
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.680]   >> It's a lot of work to do that kind of thing.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:09.800]   Like, as I'm going to shoot a lot of those kinds of things with people like that, it's
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:10.800]   a lot of work.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.800]   >> It's also sunset.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.600]   You know, now that I'm looking at it a little more closely, I think maybe you're right.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.600]   >> Now that, you know, and now that I'm thinking about it, Alex wasn't here last week as we
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:24.080]   get some sort of a patriotic fourth of July thing that's playing with his family.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.080]   >> I think he's gathering with his family.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:30.360]   >> Getting to get a full call saying, "I'm going to wire 1.2 million into your account.
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:35.080]   I need-- I need to-- I need you to map my face onto an actually fit person who's-- who
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.080]   can actually operate this hoverboard."
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:42.520]   So ScooterX is saying it's not electric, it's a foilboard, but what is moving it?
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.520]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.520]   >> For some Mark's will.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.960]   >> His content moderation.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.440]   >> There's no tow rope.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:51.360]   So something-- there's an engine in there somewhere, right?
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.360]   >> Or is this--
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.360]   >> I'm always the news feed.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:57.840]   >> For the reasons that people are going to be able to guess, I'm familiar with this
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:02.280]   because it was part of a stage on the amazing race Australia last season.
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.280]   >> Oh, good.
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:07.840]   >> At least the ones that they were-- they had to learn how to use an electric motor
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.480]   like underneath at the end of that wing that's going into the water.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:14.960]   >> ScooterX is insisting there's no engine, but I don't understand what would be propelling
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.160]   it forward if there weren't an engine.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.360]   He's not using the American flag as a sale, is he?
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.360]   [ Laughter ]
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.360]   >> There's got to be an engine.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:27.720]   >> The dreams of-- the dreams of pivot to video, media companies that died to--
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.120]   >> Alex, could you do some research into this?
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.600]   Maybe this is-- I'll look into it.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:35.120]   >> Could you tell if you-- if this were green screen, would you know?
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:36.120]   >> It's not green screen.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.120]   >> Okay.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.120]   >> That would be too hard.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.120]   >> It's absolutely-- he's absolutely in the water.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.120]   >> He's on the water.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.120]   >> And he's absolutely shooting that.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.120]   It absolutely happened.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.840]   I just think that it absolutely happened with a lot of planning.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.840]   >> Yeah.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:47.840]   >> He's got extreme skills.
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.600]   I mean, I have to say, I couldn't do this.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.600]   That's impressive.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.200]   A lot of balance.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.840]   He's holding that flag.
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:57.800]   >> But are you sure-- if they were doing this-- if they were planned, you're sure that they
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:02.800]   wouldn't have had a follow light or a reflector, you're sure that the light would have been
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.800]   better?
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:06.960]   I'm sure they have to make it look like it's too well lit.
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:09.360]   >> That's pretty-- it's got a look like they're just doing it.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.800]   But yeah, it's-- you know, you have the white off of the boat, that kind of thing.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:14.800]   You know what this is on the other side.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:15.800]   Let's say it a little bit of--
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:19.280]   >> You can see the destroyer that's protecting him on the opposite side of the camera.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.280]   >> Yeah.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:22.320]   >> That's a destroyer.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:24.320]   >> So I'm still--
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.320]   >> Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.400]   >> You can do it also with a parachute.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:32.720]   But I guess if you timed it right, you got fast enough and you let go of the parachute.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:36.960]   I don't know why I'm persisting on this, but--
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:37.960]   >> I don't know how those things work.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:41.080]   I'm not really a water-- I'm not like a water ocean person.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.560]   >> It's got a little-- it's got a little foil underneath, which is what raises you up
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:45.560]   in the air.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.560]   >> Right.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.840]   >> And I guess if you get going, you can just--
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:48.840]   >> Get going.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:51.800]   >> I think you have to bob up and down to get it to go.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:52.800]   And you'll see him up and he wants to go.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.800]   >> Oh, he's bobbing.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:54.800]   >> Right.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.000]   >> So I think that that's what kind of-- and I don't-- again, I don't want to--
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   >> He's going way too fast not to have something launched him.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   Come on.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   >> As usual, when--
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.160]   >> As usual, when he's rendered, if you can go that fast by bobbing up and down.
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.160]   >> It's Valheim.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.160]   That's what it is.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.160]   >> Hilton Valheim.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:12.920]   >> By the way, that's what I spent my fourth of July doing, so pretending to be--
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:14.480]   >> Kelso Priusloporte.
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:17.960]   >> Viking relationship.
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.520]   All right.
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.400]   Should we get back to Apple?
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.840]   >> It's not that there's any big stories we're missing.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:26.840]   >> Apple-- >> Apple--
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:27.840]   >> So much less interesting.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:28.840]   >> Apple-- >> I know.
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:33.800]   >> Apple accessory makers reportedly hit by shortages of Apple Watch charging pucks.
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:37.960]   Oh, no.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.360]   >> Hoard, hoard, hoard.
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.480]   >> Hoard the charging pucks.
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:49.320]   This comes from Mark German's new power on newsletter that he's doing in Bloomberg that
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.320]   some have pointed out.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.240]   He doesn't-- it's a little looser.
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.280]   He doesn't have to say the same--
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.400]   >> It's the basketball metaphor that's impressive.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:59.600]   He manages to fit all the news into a complete basketball metaphor.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.600]   >> Really?
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.600]   >> Wow.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.600]   >> Yeah, starters, the bench.
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.600]   >> The starters.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.600]   >> The entire thing is-- >> Oh, my God.
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.080]   >> -- was his basketball fan base.
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:08.000]   >> He's just flexing at this point.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   >> Yes.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.400]   >> Impressive.
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:13.480]   You know, there is a lot in this piece.
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:14.680]   Holy cow.
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:19.680]   So the starters, Apple has operated on the principal that ambitious technologies yearn
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.880]   for a place in Silicon Valley where they could put their mark in the next eye product.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:31.880]   This is the battle over whether people should have to work at the Apple campus.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.120]   You don't have-- you can live wherever you want.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:38.040]   Cost of operations is extremely high.
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:42.960]   There have been certainly moves by the employees to not have to go into work.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:48.120]   Johnny Sharuji, one of the strongest proponents of a shift out of Cupertino, his group opened
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:53.760]   up offices in Florida, Massachusetts, Texas, Israel, and parts of Asia since expanded
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:59.640]   to Germany, Oregon, and San Diego at EQ also pushing for decentralization.
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:03.440]   He's got LA offices in a location in Nashville, but that's because of the music industry,
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:04.440]   right?
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.520]   >> But I think that like some of the-- >> It's awesome.
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:07.520]   LA.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.520]   >> Yeah.
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:11.880]   And there's-- I think that like, for instance, if I'm correct, the office team, you know,
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:14.040]   the team that does numbers and pages and--
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.040]   >> I think they're in Pittsburgh.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.040]   >> Oh.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.040]   >> I think it's nice.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.040]   >> Yeah, sorry.
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.040]   >> Yeah, I think it's Vancouver.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:24.440]   >> Apple spending $2 billion on campuses in Austin and North Carolina, hiring engineers--
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.360]   >> There's a ton of AI in voice where Andy is.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.360]   >> Yeah.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.600]   I mean, this is a big company.
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:30.600]   It's global, right?
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:35.600]   They've got offices in Austin, Ireland, and Singapore.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:42.440]   Hybrid offices and remote work arrangements are being piloted globally, something that--
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:46.920]   because in September, Apple's staff comes back, but they will only be required to be
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:49.240]   in office Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.200]   I don't get that at all.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.040]   >> Well, you don't get an extra long weekend.
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.040]   >> Oh, yeah.
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.040]   >> It's like teachers.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:57.360]   You can't give them a day on the weekend because they'll just take a long weekend.
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:00.760]   >> Yeah, so if you made it Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, you'd never hear from Thursday
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:01.760]   through Sunday.
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:02.760]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:03.760]   >> You don't treat people like criminals.
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:04.760]   They won't behave like criminals.
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:05.760]   They have a whole long-established tradition.
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:06.760]   >> OK.
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:11.040]   >> OK, so I think that Real Housewives is on Thursday night, so people are probably going
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:14.000]   to be like staying up late at the parties anyway.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:20.120]   I think that the actual-- the hybrid is actually going to make it worse because then they have
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:29.720]   all of this time to sit in traffic and be in a shared space half of the week and then
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.560]   they're working at home the other half of the week.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:36.120]   And I think it actually makes it worse because the open office plan is a disaster.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.120]   >> I agree.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.120]   >> Disaster.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.120]   >> I agree.
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:42.400]   >> And people hated it every one of these companies.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:45.760]   And they put up with it because they love the rest of the company.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:46.760]   They love their job.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:47.840]   They love all these other things.
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.320]   They just put up with the open office plan.
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:52.600]   But every time you get a phone call, you have to stand up and walk out.
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:56.560]   And every time there's just this constant disruption of people walking by and talking
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.240]   to you, which they say is a good thing.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.240]   It's not.
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:02.720]   And so the employees hate it.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:06.560]   So now that they've been at home and the ones that had enough space to burrow in and
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.280]   take over a room, they don't want to go back.
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.160]   You know, like they don't want to go back to what they were doing before.
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:15.240]   They just sit through an hour and a half of traffic each way so that you can be in an
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:17.000]   open office experience.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.040]   So I think that that's the problem that all these companies have.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:24.440]   Now, Apple's, I think Apple has some valid needs for people to come in for certain things
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:25.640]   when they're working on hardware.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.440]   And there's some of the security stuff and everything else that you don't necessarily
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:31.320]   want people to take stuff home.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:35.240]   But I think that for a lot of the employees, I don't think they necessarily need to do
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.760]   their work at the office.
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:45.800]   And the other companies that Apple competes for for resources are getting pretty lenient.
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.040]   So about what you have to do.
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:50.000]   And a lot of people are moving out.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   And they don't want to.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.720]   And so I think that that's the problem that Apple's going to keep on competing for that
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:55.160]   talent and that talent.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.160]   They don't want to come back.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.400]   Most people I've talked to about it, they're working a lot of these different companies
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:01.440]   have said if they had to come back to the office, they wouldn't quit.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.680]   They just would start applying.
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.000]   Like, you know, if they found another job, they'd be, you don't want people in it.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.360]   I think that's what mindset.
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.360]   That's what people are worried about.
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:11.160]   Other jobs in the company too, because some jobs are remote.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:15.080]   Some of them traditionally map to something like a variety of places.
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:18.360]   Well, those aruges, stuff is locked down as hardware.
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:19.360]   That's hard.
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.360]   It's hard to work on hardware.
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.360]   Hard to get in the hardware.
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.600]   Like the maps team has been international for like, or remote for a long time and other
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.320]   teams are much more flexible.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.080]   So you're going to start picking and choosing.
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:30.800]   And the danger is that you'll lose some of the best people from some of the most important
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:35.440]   teams like the framework teams and the stuff that Apple really wants to keep on campus.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:39.720]   I mean, you look at what people make in the set.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:40.720]   Go ahead.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:46.120]   Well, once it's easy to push around employees are still in their early 20s, mid 20s.
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:48.960]   Once they have families, once they're putting down roots, once they're starting to think
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:55.120]   about their future in terms of their family unit and their kids, as opposed to lifelong
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:59.600]   employment to a famous company, that's when they become very dangerous and very mobile.
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:00.600]   Yeah.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:04.520]   And the big thing is for a lot of people who have been here for a while, they either
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:08.120]   already have or they have the ability to sell their house.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:14.360]   And with the cash leftover of a half filled mortgage, they can go buy something somewhere
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.320]   else that's much larger than what they were looking at.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.320]   Right.
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:22.640]   You look at the employee, how much these folks are getting paid and then the squalor that
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:26.440]   they often live in compared to what they're getting paid, you know, that even if they
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:32.560]   take up 15 or 20 percent, the 15 or 20 percent pay cut to go somewhere else is still going
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:35.280]   to be really good for a lot of these employees.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:40.400]   And so, and that whole idea that you're going to get paid less out of area is only for a
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.880]   certain level of employee.
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:47.480]   There's definitely, as you get to the upper ranks of most of these companies, they can't
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:49.560]   really negotiate with those employees.
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:54.160]   You know, they need to, that employee could move wherever they wanted to move and the company
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:57.520]   would have to keep on paying them the same amount, you know, because they're worth too
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:58.520]   much to the company.
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:04.840]   For problems with Wi-Fi SSIDs, Apple really has got to fix this bug.
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:10.320]   You remember the very weird, long string percent S percent N percent SSS SSS percent
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.320]   P.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.320]   Who thinks of it?
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.160]   I don't understand how you get to understand like what to type in to make that happen.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:16.840]   It must have been kind of almost accidental.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:17.840]   You don't know.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:18.840]   Comp signers.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:23.520]   After looking into it, I realized that the problem is that that percent P at the end
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:26.400]   says basically that's a poke command.
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:30.320]   It says poke whatever proceeds this into an area of memory.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:32.480]   That's always a dangerous thing.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:40.520]   The fact that that somehow is unprocessed before Apple, you know, whatever, they send
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:47.480]   that to something and whatever that thing is, whether it's the text display field on
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:52.000]   the Wi-Fi or whatever, doesn't sanitize it and it actually works.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.520]   So Carl Shau is a reverse engineer at secret.club has tried another one.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:00.600]   And again, it's percent S and percent P. I think that the problem.
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:06.920]   I don't even want to tell you this one because at least Shau says you don't have to join
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:07.920]   this network.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:13.600]   You just have to walk by it, this Wi-Fi ID, and it will disable Wi-Fi.
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.600]   He said he had to try a lot of things.
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:20.080]   He's reset network settings, forced restart of the iPhone.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.320]   None of that worked eventually.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.200]   He had to get in and edit a P list.
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:26.200]   He had to do a lot of things.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:34.600]   A number of people on Twitter saying, yeah, do not use this name for a Wi-Fi access point.
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:38.600]   Every iPhone walking by it will get reset.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:45.080]   Yeah, this is the worst kind of security problem or the kind of bug where it's bad enough
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:49.280]   when you have, okay, well, somebody who has knowledge of the inner workings of the iPhone
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:54.080]   who has access to your phone for a certain amount of time can possibly inject a blah,
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:55.960]   blah, blah, execute code.
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:00.520]   When you get people who are like just random knucklehead who just saw something in a forum
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:05.640]   saying, oh, you mean that if I just take this wife, the hotspot in my office and change
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.960]   the name to this, I can screw up everybody who's in my dorm?
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:10.480]   All right, that's awesome.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:14.080]   That's why I'm not revealing the S ID.
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:17.440]   Although I'm sure people will find it.
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.160]   I certainly hope this gets fixed.
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:23.120]   The fact that it didn't get fixed after the last one tells me that whatever the bug is,
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:26.000]   Apple hasn't tracked it down yet.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.680]   Something is trying to render that string.
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:28.680]   Last word, last word, last word.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.440]   Yeah, that's terrible.
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:31.440]   That is not good.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:37.760]   I think a lot of times these are programs, they're shortcuts when people are working on
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.760]   networks.
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:44.400]   They just put these into that they can do something or do it.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:47.840]   They have commands in here so that they can get things done quickly.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:52.000]   It's how an engineer just kind of, we have a lot of things in our like in Mecan and my
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.440]   Q and A system that you can just type in strings and it'll do something for you so that I
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:59.560]   can see what this looks like or what that looks like and allows you to work quickly.
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:02.760]   Then of course, you think you got it all rid of it all.
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:03.760]   Sometimes you didn't.
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:09.720]   I think this is actually not that because it's basically not sanitizing your inputs.
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:15.200]   You should never assume that a string being handed to you is something that you could
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:19.520]   just process and the fact that the S, the percent P and the percent S are in there,
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.320]   that's all that's in this new one.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:28.440]   The percent P is the problem and it's a failing in C++ and I suspect objective C is a result,
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:33.160]   which is it's in the format string.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:39.040]   But instead of just having it print out in a nice way, it lets you take what proceeded
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.320]   and put it in memory.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:44.560]   That is not a good feature to have in any language.
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:49.280]   I don't think that they intentionally leave that in because they might want to poke a
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:51.200]   memory thing in an SSID.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:54.080]   I think that that's just not sanitizing the inputs.
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:56.840]   It's not a good thing at all.
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:00.560]   I definitely don't think it's a good thing.
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:03.120]   It's not the kind of thing I think you would leave in.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.920]   You'd leave it on purpose, absolutely not.
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:08.160]   Or even put in for debugging.
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.680]   I understand why not agree with you.
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:10.720]   Sometimes these are.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:14.440]   This one is just this inputs are not being sanitized by something that's displaying that
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:20.200]   string and as a result it's putting junk in memory where it doesn't belong.
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:27.200]   This is the, if you do percent P it's a pointer to an implementation defined format pointer
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.680]   to void.
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:29.760]   Not good.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.280]   Not good.
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:35.440]   You'd be able to stick anything into memory at a random point is not good.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:39.800]   The one who's going to set their SSID to divide by zero and just end the world.
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:41.640]   It's kind of like that.
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:44.760]   Apparently he really had a hard time getting his Wi-Fi back.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:48.200]   This is nasty.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:49.200]   Nasty thing.
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:50.200]   Be careful.
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.920]   Arbitrary shell code execution.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:55.520]   Here you would like this Alex.
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:00.760]   It's a AI that publicly shames politicians.
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:04.680]   I thought this one, so the funny thing about this is that I thought I was a little absurd.
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:06.960]   It's kind of like you don't have no idea what they're doing.
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.240]   They could be like researching looking for something.
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:10.240]   They could be looking up something.
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:11.240]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:12.240]   Yeah.
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:14.000]   You know, I don't like again I'm not against all politicians.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.960]   I just when they get into areas they don't understand.
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.960]   I think that and they decide they want to do something really big.
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.240]   I go, oh, that's a bad idea.
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:21.000]   This was actually an art project.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:27.320]   Belgian artist monitored YouTube videos of Flemish government meetings.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:31.680]   They're figuring out who's looking at their phone and then face recognition to identify
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:35.080]   the politicians and then publishing statistics.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:40.680]   The genius of this is if you wanted to get politicians to vote against or create all kinds
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:45.040]   of rules about how you can't use video for surveillance, this is the way you do that.
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.760]   I think that's the real point to be honest with you.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:50.720]   I think that's the point is to scare them into that, you know, understand.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.400]   It's kind of like the end of enemy of the state.
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:57.560]   You know, when the politician sees the camera that he was just using on, you know, they
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:01.840]   use it against him, I think they're just using the AI against them so that they get like
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:05.080]   this is, this could be used by anybody on anything.
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.640]   You know, not just bad people.
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:14.840]   This is a if you want to follow it, it's now a Twitter account at Flemish Skroller.
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:18.320]   I think it'd be better if the AI recognize they're playing Candy Crush and could just
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.360]   you know, for shame for that because you're right.
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.600]   He might be looking up a law or something.
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.400]   So are they covering their, are they now?
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.400]   They look like both of them.
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.400]   He's covering his face.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:27.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.960]   It looks like they're now like, they're definitely aware of this now.
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.400]   All of a sudden, like it's not me.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:32.600]   It's not me doing this.
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:33.600]   Yeah.
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:34.600]   Yeah.
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:35.600]   No, I'm.
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:36.600]   No, don't.
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.960]   If you've ever sat in a lot of those sessions, there's a good reason not to pay attention the
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:40.960]   whole time.
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:41.960]   It's like watching the grass grow.
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:43.440]   This is why I'm not in government.
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:45.600]   It is the most boring thing ever.
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.600]   Some people are like it.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:52.200]   You know what the thing is, is that all I'm saying is, is there's a lot of time to multitask
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:53.840]   that you don't lose anything.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:57.320]   So if they're, if they're people are paying their politicians so much money, you want them
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:01.520]   to multitask because they're not covering very much information, you know, in, you know,
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:06.720]   in front of them and they're handling probably many things that probably they should be handling.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:08.120]   You know, and show of hands.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:12.160]   I mean, the reason I don't watch much Netflix with subtitles is because I can't be on the
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.400]   phone at the same time as I'm watching.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:19.360]   You know, I very few shows get all of my attention.
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:20.360]   I've got my laptop.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:24.120]   I've got my phone, Lisa's playing her game.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:27.120]   I just find the fact that I'm upset that I have to give up my, I'm going to have to
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:30.760]   someday give up my mask because show me how on off when I'm yawning.
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.880]   Oh, that's a good one.
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.120]   Let me tie it here.
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.880]   Sometimes you just need oxygen.
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:36.880]   That's all.
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:37.880]   It's not exactly.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:38.880]   It's not.
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:42.840]   But, but again, like if we think about how we interact, I don't know how everybody interacts
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:46.520]   at conferences, but if I go to a conference, I always sit in the back with my laptop.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.520]   Yep.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.520]   I pop it open and I'm listening.
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.520]   I'm listening to what they're saying.
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:53.240]   But I'm also answering a bunch of emails and, you know, noodling with some design thing
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:54.440]   and, you know, that type of thing.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:56.920]   Hey, we'll have more news in just a second.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:59.040]   But first a word from our sponsor.
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.200]   I'll show you today brought to you by Molecule.
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:04.560]   Actually, the air in this room is brought to you by Molecule.
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:11.080]   You know that indoor air is according to the EPA is up to five times worse than outdoor
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.240]   air.
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:17.920]   It's nice if you can open a window do, but if you can't get a Molecule, it is more than
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:20.360]   just an air purifier.
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:24.800]   It is not just an innovation on the existing filtered technologies.
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:30.440]   It's a scientific breakthrough in air purification that's called PICO photoelectric chemical
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.080]   oxidation.
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:35.480]   So in my molecule, we have a number of different molecules in the house.
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:38.560]   We have the molecule air in the molecule air.
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:42.720]   There's a filter stage at the bottom that looks, you know, just like a HEPA filter.
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:47.880]   We change that pretty regularly because it picks up all the animal hair and dust and
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:48.960]   stuff like that.
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:52.880]   But above it in that cylinder, there is a really interesting device.
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:56.600]   We don't have to change that, but every few, maybe twice a year, three times a year.
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:02.800]   What it does is it traps very tiny particles, not just the allergens, but pollutants like
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:05.920]   bacteria and mold and yes, even viruses.
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:08.000]   And then it doesn't just hold them.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.400]   It destroys them.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:13.000]   There's now a number of molecules for every size room.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.160]   There's the original Molecule air, which I have.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.520]   That's for rooms up to 600 feet.
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:21.440]   They now have a Molecule air Mini, which is designed for smaller rooms.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:25.800]   There's also the Mini Plus with a particle sensor and auto protect mode that adjusts the
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:28.080]   fan speed based on the sensor.
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:33.000]   And then if you're in a medical office or you just want to have really clean air, the
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.920]   Molecule Air Pro RX.
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:42.280]   This is a FDA approved 510 K Class 2 medical device destroys bacteria and viruses in the
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:43.800]   air.
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:46.120]   So now there's a Molecule for almost everybody.
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:50.520]   We have Molecule at home in the bedroom.
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:52.200]   Our kids bedroom has one.
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:55.840]   We have the big Molecule in the studio here.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:01.920]   We kind of beefed up our Molecules due to COVID, but I'm keeping them because we get smoke
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.120]   from fires and stuff.
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:05.520]   It's really, really nice to have a Molecule.
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:09.160]   You just feel like you're breathing clean air.
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:13.480]   For a limited time, you can save up to $120 on Molecule air purifiers.
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:18.760]   Molecule spelled with a K-M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E dot com.
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:19.760]   Molecule dot com.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:22.960]   I want to point out, and you should read this.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:29.200]   It's in the research section of the website, that some air purifiers actually introduce
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:33.880]   more volatile organic compounds, chiefly ozone, into the air as they work.
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:35.920]   The Molecule does not.
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:39.640]   To me, that's very, very important.
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:45.560]   One of the papers is a very good test they did at the Lawrence Labs.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:51.640]   DOE approved, actually owned, I think, DOE lab up here in Berkeley.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:55.440]   Read the research so you know, but I think you're going to want a Molecule.
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:57.520]   M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E dot com.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:02.040]   Our promo code is MacBreak120, up to $120 off air purifiers.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:06.000]   And you also get free shipping, and of course, a 30-day home trial on your order.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:12.880]   MacBreak120, the offer code at Molecule dot com.
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:16.760]   Really a fan of the Molecule air purifiers.
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:18.920]   Highly recommend them.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:21.000]   You're still on the betas, Renee.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.720]   Anybody else using iOS 15 or moderate?
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:29.760]   So this note from iMore, be careful if you're using Oliver Haslam writing.
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:36.520]   If you're using the new notes, they may not be backward compatible with notes on other
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:39.920]   devices, the older versions of notes.
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:47.040]   Notes that can be opened by iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5, and MacOS 11.3.
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.040]   Is that right?
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:52.800]   And later, but anything older than that, you're not going to be able to open those notes anymore.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:56.280]   I actually put iPad, I did.
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.280]   I put the public beta.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.280]   You did it.
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:23:59.280]   You done did it?
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.280]   Yeah.
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:01.280]   Love it.
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.280]   I love the multitasking.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:03.280]   And the notes is great.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:06.920]   The fact that it's attached to a Safari page, so you could take a note, put it on the Safari
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:09.680]   page, and when you go back to that page, that note will be there.
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:10.680]   Brilliant.
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:12.680]   And you get them from anywhere.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:15.480]   Like on the home page, you can pull up those notes or everywhere you want them to be.
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:17.520]   It's like a, it really is a system wide note feature.
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.480]   It's like another layer on reality, a mini pocket note universe.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:21.480]   It's amazing.
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:24.480]   And I only do this because you said probably it was going to be okay.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:25.480]   It's been very stable.
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:28.800]   I haven't had too many issues at all.
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.240]   Everything seems to work.
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.480]   So yeah, I like iPadOS.
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:35.760]   And now, Monterey is in public beta.
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:39.280]   You can, you can install that as well.
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:40.280]   How about that?
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:41.680]   Do you recommend, just recommend?
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.320]   What's your opinion on that?
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:46.880]   You know, it really depends on what your workflow is and how critical, like anything
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.000]   mission critical stay away.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.400]   I have it on a secondary computer because if I can't use Final Cut Pro, my main
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:52.400]   computer, that's it for me.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.240]   You know, my logo on vacation or something, I'm done.
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:57.520]   So I usually wait, like, I don't know if I wait Alex length of time.
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:01.960]   I usually wait like six months before I even put the release version on my production machine.
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:04.040]   So I like, just be really tired.
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:07.080]   But if you have an extra machine, an old machine, it's a lot of fun.
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:11.360]   And if you have an M1 Mac, especially because they have the neural engine on there, they're
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:15.640]   getting just a ton of iOS features for quote unquote free this year, which has always been
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:20.040]   a sore spot on the Mac and was taken, took years to get like, I message parody on the
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:21.040]   Mac.
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:22.240]   And I'm having day in date.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:26.120]   So it's a lot of fun to just get all those new features everywhere.
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:30.280]   And I usually have a computer that I put the beta on and then I have one or two other computers
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:32.760]   that I put the whatever the current one is there.
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:35.320]   It's just that my production computers are usually an hour a year behind.
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:37.960]   Oh yeah, they should be.
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:40.080]   I am tempted because of universal control.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:42.640]   I would really love to be able to drag a file from my menu.
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:43.640]   It's not in the betas yet.
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:44.640]   But it's not in there.
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:45.640]   So don't rush.
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:46.640]   Okay.
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:49.920]   That's what that's why I think I think that you should.
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:54.200]   It's better if you wait for if there's a feature that really, really tick or tickled
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:58.560]   drive, re-saring the keynote, wait for that feature to actually be implemented and for
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:03.200]   word to come out that it actually is a kind of working on, least on a holistic level that
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:07.920]   before you before you update unless as as Ray says, you happen to have a spare Mac, you
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:12.880]   happen to have a spare iPhone because it's not it's usually at this point, but Apple has
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:18.920]   been very, very good by by the time they shift something from developer beta to a public
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:19.920]   beta.
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:21.200]   They understand what the word public means.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:25.000]   So it's usually pretty stable and pretty useful, but all that has to happen is though
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.240]   you're one email client that you depend on or you're one VPN that you depend on not working
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:33.280]   and suddenly you just bought yourself a big bag of hurt.
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:35.280]   You're going to roll it back.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:39.800]   The thing that blows my mind is live text like the it's hard to describe to you because
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:43.880]   I think they just think of it in different terms, but it's running on the neural processing
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.920]   engine, the Apple neural engine.
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:48.800]   And that means like it doesn't bog down your CPU or your GPU at all.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:52.240]   You're not losing cycles of rendering just because it's chewing through the stuff, but
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:57.400]   literally any words in any image, whether they're in your library in like the finder
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:03.240]   on the web in real time, it's making them selectable, copy, pasteable, clickable.
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:07.520]   And I'm getting confused now that I'm inside my photo album and I'm selecting text and
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:11.960]   I think I'm in Safari and I don't realize that I'm in the photo album.
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:17.100]   It's it's it's bananas, how fast and responsive and accurate it is because they kept deforming
[01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:20.080]   the models and retraining it and deforming it and retraining it.
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:23.080]   It's like it's not going to be a huge feature to everybody, but it's a feature that every
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:25.200]   time I use it, it just blows my mind.
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:30.040]   It's it's it's it's it's such a simple solution to an annoying recurring problem.
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:32.120]   I've been I've been using a feature like this.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:35.840]   Google Android has something similar called lens.
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:41.600]   It's not quite as nice, but but when you've got someone who was when you're using an app
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:45.520]   like Instagram with that decides that, oh, I don't really don't want you to be able
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:48.500]   to tap links within a post and actually go somewhere.
[01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:53.060]   I can just say, all right, fine, I'll take a screenshot and the screenshot has a Google
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:54.060]   lens.
[01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:58.020]   I call Google lens, please highlight this this URL, please open this URL.
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:03.700]   Or if someone if again, if you've just taken a picture of a phone number or taken a picture
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:10.540]   or or or come across a photo of someone else's vacation and there's some sort of a clam shack
[01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:14.000]   in the background and you're like, oh, wow, he didn't say where he went, but that looks
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.180]   like a really cool place.
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:16.180]   Where is it?
[01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:20.200]   You can just select the text off of that sign and simply say, please show me where this
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:23.200]   is in Google Maps or a rapple maps.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:29.000]   That is one of those savory features that you don't you didn't ask for it, but once
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.300]   you have it, you find yourself using it all the time and you wonder how you ever did without
[01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:34.300]   it.
[01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:37.900]   It's a big step towards one of the best features of the later versions of Android.
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:39.560]   And I don't know if it's on all Android phones.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:43.720]   It's on the pixel, which is live text captioning.
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:49.840]   So if you're if you just open a YouTube video, it starts type as the guy speaking, it will
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:55.060]   in and do a pretty good job of having live captioning or even your own videos.
[01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:58.960]   That I would imagine is just one step beyond what Apple's doing now.
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:00.680]   And I hope this is the next thing.
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:02.960]   And the implementation app is still peerless.
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:03.960]   Like it's just so good.
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:04.960]   The pixel.
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:06.280]   It does an amazing job.
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:07.280]   Yeah.
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:08.280]   Right.
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:11.840]   When you do the the idea of doing an hour having an audio recording and then being able to
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:16.540]   say, Oh, take me directly to the place where we talked about the construction project in
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:17.540]   Wellesley.
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:21.240]   And because it knows where it knows the word Wellesley is, it will take you exactly to
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.240]   there.
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:25.800]   That's the sort of stuff where it's it's nice to have a it's nice to have a feature or
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:30.760]   a special app that you've added to the operating system where you're really, really turbocharging
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:35.120]   things is where you add something that makes every single thing you do on this device easier
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.120]   and better.
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:39.280]   And again, the idea that no, no, no, this is not a feature that we're making available
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:43.520]   to developers by virtue of the fact that this is using the audio component of the operating
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:44.520]   system.
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:47.960]   We will be able to do live translation of any audio that's coming into the river.
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:50.400]   Yeah, that's going to be great Apple app.
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:55.840]   And like I said, Apple is one up being Google lens this way by simply I still have to like
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:02.680]   find a way to sort of bring Google lens's attention to an image in order to make use
[01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:04.200]   of that feature with Apple.
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:06.120]   It's just simply, Oh, look, here's text.
[01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:07.120]   I don't care.
[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:10.800]   It's not my problem that it's just pixels on an aggravated pixels.
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:13.720]   The fact that it I've simply said, Hey, trust me, there's text here.
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:16.400]   Please find out what it is and do something cool with it.
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:20.760]   That's that really, really makes me happy as an iPad user, maybe as a future iPhone user.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:23.960]   I like the I like the phrase savory features.
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:24.960]   That's good.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:25.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:29.320]   Well, it's tasty.
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:30.600]   Not merely tasty.
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:31.600]   Savory.
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:32.600]   It's got some money.
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:36.120]   You'll be you'll be picking that feature from between your feet and enjoying all over
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:37.120]   again for the next two or three.
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:39.960]   I think the question is, is it savory or is it sweet?
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:41.800]   I mean, like, you know, is it a sweet feature?
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:42.800]   Well, that's what I think sweet.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:43.800]   It's been over you.
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:47.520]   So I think savory is adding a whole new dimension.
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:49.040]   Pretty soon we'll have a mommy features.
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:50.040]   It'll be great.
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:51.040]   Oh, mommy.
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:52.040]   Let's go.
[01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:59.120]   Mommy, by the way, once again, let me thank you for mushroom popcorn.
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.480]   The whirly pop.
[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:08.040]   I mean, far too much of it and and pointing me to the recipe by what's his name that started
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:14.440]   it all because putting the salt in with the popcorn is Alton Brown is a savory feature.
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:20.280]   And I also after reading his recipe realized I could put a few tablespoons of sugar in and
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:21.960]   make my own kettle corn.
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:24.520]   All of that before the popping even begins.
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:28.440]   It's the key to the operation is and it's only because you're stirring it.
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:32.200]   And I think I don't I think if you weren't constantly stirring it, that would be you would
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:34.360]   just have a crystalline mess.
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:35.360]   Exactly.
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:36.920]   The bottom of the bowl.
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:40.880]   But instead it's all evenly distributed.
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:44.440]   Nowadays, all I say to Lisa is sweet or savory.
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:45.440]   And what was it?
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:46.440]   Now, here's the question I have.
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:47.440]   I don't put sugar.
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:48.440]   I don't use refined sugar.
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:51.880]   But but if if the three tablespoons, you really ought to try it.
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:52.880]   You're sweet enough.
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:53.880]   I don't want I don't want to.
[01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:54.880]   I don't want to.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:55.880]   Refined sugar.
[01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:56.880]   Anything.
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:59.280]   It's not as good as as as plain.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.040]   I just can't handle it like it gives me headaches.
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:02.360]   And so I okay.
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:04.000]   So the but salt's very good.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000]   I have to say.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000]   Yes.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000]   Salt.
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000]   I ate a lot of salt anyway.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.960]   But the question about the sugar is how hard is it to clean after that?
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:14.320]   Is it sticky?
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:17.640]   It is it Chris and it also tends to to caramelize.
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:20.440]   But you know, you just soak it and it dissolves off.
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:21.440]   Right.
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:22.440]   Yeah.
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:24.560]   It's not as easy to wipe the inside of the pan as it is with just salt.
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:27.880]   In fact, salt kind of pre pre-conditions it for you.
[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:29.880]   It's very easy hard.
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:30.880]   It's not hard.
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:31.880]   Yeah.
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.200]   It might literally my parents liked it.
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:34.680]   I like it two seconds.
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:36.800]   For their birthdays, my parents have the birthdays in the same month.
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:41.200]   So for their birthdays, one of the things I got them was the the Jiffy pop with six pounds,
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:42.520]   I think of of that.
[01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:43.880]   That mushroom popcorn from Amish.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:44.880]   Amish.
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:47.040]   They brought it to the shore.
[01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:48.800]   Like they brought the Jiffy pop to the shore.
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:49.800]   Oh, I can't live with that.
[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:51.800]   I would bring it everywhere.
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:54.200]   And bring the Whirly pop to frankly.
[01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:57.600]   No, they brought the Whirly pop and the popcorn to the shore.
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.600]   And we had it like every night.
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:32:59.600]   It was like a thing.
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:00.600]   And it just gets devoured.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.400]   I mean, it was just they just went through it.
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.280]   So the kids went through it so fast.
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:08.760]   I've gone through two six pound bags already.
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:11.920]   I thought when you said, oh, get a six pound bag, I thought, what are you nuts?
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.400]   That's a lifetime supply.
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:14.400]   Oh, no.
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:15.400]   No, no.
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:17.800]   You can go through it really fast.
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:18.800]   Yeah.
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:21.800]   That's that's the standard human journey for popcorn.
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:23.280]   You see, you know what?
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:25.920]   I shouldn't be eating all these chips and Doritos and things.
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:27.480]   I'm going to have like unsalted.
[01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:28.480]   Well, you know what?
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:29.480]   Unsalted.
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:30.480]   It's crunchy.
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:31.480]   It's wonderful.
[01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:32.480]   You know, I'll add a little bit of salt.
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:33.480]   What if I try to add a little?
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:36.480]   And now you're at Carmel and I'm taking a second.
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:41.280]   Yeah, you're right back to Candy.
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:45.920]   Qualcomm is feeling a little M1 pain.
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:53.000]   They have announced, at least their CEO, Cristiano Ammon, says they're going to do an M1 competitor.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.600]   It's not going to be through ARM or their relationship.
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:03.280]   They're going to do a system on a chip for laptops that will include a 5G modem.
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:06.280]   Now given how poorly Qualcomm has done, it might be an arm.
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:07.280]   They did hedge.
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.880]   They said that if I'll use arms, but the hilarious part was they're like, we're going
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:12.240]   to catch up and pass Apple.
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:14.080]   It's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.080]   Sure.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:17.080]   No way Apple's going to catch up to our modems.
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:19.880]   Like we're going to just chomp Apple, but they're not going to come here.
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:21.320]   Yeah, because we have the pets, maybe.
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:23.320]   That's not how time and space works.
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:24.320]   No.
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:28.480]   The hard part is that it's the whole ecosystem that makes this work.
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:29.960]   And so making just the chip.
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:30.960]   I agree.
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:34.720]   There's just a lot of agreements and a lot of consortiums that are required to do what
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:35.720]   Apple's doing.
[01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:37.120]   And I think that that's going to be the challenge.
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:42.440]   And again, if they say they're going to do it right now, now they bought, is it Nuvia?
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:43.440]   Yes.
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.440]   Nuvia is the technology.
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:48.560]   So that's what we're applying towards that.
[01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:50.960]   It's an Apple engineer, it worked on the M1.
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:51.960]   But you're right.
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:52.960]   That's just the part.
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:56.720]   I think it's in response to Microsoft, because I think Microsoft, which is pushing Windows
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:02.040]   on arm, really does want to be able to make PCs that at least look competitive with the
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:03.040]   M1.
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.520]   That's got to, there's a little sting there, I think.
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:11.640]   Well, Qualcomm's real advantage is the Nuvia team, because those are people that probably
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:12.640]   built the M1.
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:14.400]   They built a huge chunk of the M1.
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:18.640]   We're in all those meetings and understands exactly where Apple's going and buying that
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:19.640]   company.
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:20.640]   And it lets them cash in.
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:23.640]   I don't know what the numbers were, but I bet you they made a lot of money.
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:26.440]   I bet you, that was a good, I bet you Qualcomm.
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:28.640]   They bought Nuvia for 1.4 billion.
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.440]   Yeah, so that was a good guess.
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:34.400]   It's a bit like saying you're going to compete with the 4GT by hiring the Model T team.
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:35.400]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:40.480]   Not because this is the team that worked on the transition in the lead up to the launch
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:41.480]   of the M1.
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:45.640]   And they can't bring with them a lot of the stuff.
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:46.640]   There's any consistency.
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:47.640]   Yeah, there's patents.
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:50.360]   Because we all know that Apple doesn't like patents.
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:52.600]   They don't like to patent anything.
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:36:00.840]   And it still would take them, I think, three to five years to get there.
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:02.680]   And then where is Apple going to be then?
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:07.640]   And can they get enough of the other hardware to work with it beyond just building the chip?
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:09.600]   I think it's a pretty uphill battle.
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:13.160]   Well, the big problem they have is that they're still a merchant silicon provider.
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:15.560]   And that creates such different dynamics than Apple.
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:16.720]   And Apple was smart.
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:20.480]   They could have become an in-house merchant silicon provider with iPhone and Mac.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:22.280]   And all these people are different clients.
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:23.280]   But they didn't.
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:24.280]   They don't have to carry any extra baggage.
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:26.360]   They basically said, "We're going to scale up and down."
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:30.600]   There'll be one chip in the iPhone and iPad Air, one chip in the Mac and the iPad Pro.
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:34.920]   And that lets them be very focused on one generation of silicon.
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:39.600]   And the Apple Watch is using A13 cores now, so they get to push their work through a
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:42.920]   bunch of devices and they don't care about profit or loss on any chip.
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:45.240]   They don't have to keep it on the shelf to make their money back.
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:49.720]   They get so much iPhone money that they can just let those teams run as fast as they want.
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:53.960]   And that's very, very hard for a component company to compete with because the economics
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:55.280]   are just so different.
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:57.600]   Well, they also have this thing called Xcode.
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:02.880]   That means that they are writing, they have the platform that all the code is being written
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:03.880]   on.
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:08.960]   They have the libraries that take full advantage of the chips and of the hardware.
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:12.920]   And again, that makes it super complicated to compete with.
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:19.000]   I said it very interesting that shortcuts, which is being ported to...
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000]   Is it in the Monterey beta yet?
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.760]   Isn't it developer beta?
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:25.840]   So I found it very interesting.
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:27.120]   It's not a catalyst app.
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:28.120]   It's not just a...
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:29.120]   No.
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:31.600]   They're not taking the iPad app and moving it over.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:37.280]   And this is where Apple's Swift UI is really beneficial to them because it makes it so
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:44.600]   easy, not with catalyst, which was obviously now, I think it's clear to say, interim technology.
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:48.880]   But so easy now to make cross-platform tools.
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:50.880]   This is going to be a huge cross-platform.
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:53.880]   You mean cross-platform between iOS and iOS and Mac OS.
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:55.880]   It's going to be really interesting.
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:56.880]   It's going to be cross-platform.
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:57.880]   That's a cross-platform.
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:59.080]   But it's huge, I think.
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:00.680]   It's a big synergy.
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:01.680]   I guess go ahead, Renee.
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:02.680]   I'm sorry.
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:04.200]   The interesting thing to me is that when Apple announced Swift, they said it was going to
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.200]   scale.
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:08.040]   It was going to scale from operating systems to interfaces.
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:10.840]   And we've seen that play out a little bit, like the Swift language, plus people make
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:14.000]   apps, Swift UI now, let's make all these interfaces.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.520]   And I wonder how long it's going to be until we see a Swift ISA, until Apple has just customized
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:22.320]   arms, you know, V9, and everything that's used next to be a Swift chip.
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:23.320]   Oh, interesting to be a Swift chip.
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:24.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:27.520]   They'll just use Swift to create the instructions that architecture for their next generation
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:28.600]   of chips at some point.
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:30.920]   There's a history of this.
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:35.280]   There are Lisp machines that were literally hardware created to run Lisp.
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:38.200]   I think fourth is the same thing for fourth.
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:42.480]   And that is, if you can get bare metal like that, that's obviously the ideal way to do
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:43.480]   it.
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:44.480]   And that is a hell of a synergy.
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:47.120]   Now you've got something very, very interesting.
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:50.760]   I think to some degree next was kind of...
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:54.240]   And they don't have to share code back with ARM the way their deal is now anyway.
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:57.960]   I think a large part of ARM V9 is just backporting all of the stuff that Apple's done with
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:01.360]   ARM since they've had that sort of license.
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:05.040]   And how far is Apple going to push that because so much of the other stuff is already custom?
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.720]   We are in July.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:09.200]   There's not going to be an announcement in July or August, right?
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:12.000]   We're waiting till September now for any new Apple hardware.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.640]   There's been spec bumps before in July.
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:16.640]   Okay.
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:18.240]   But I think if there's a new design, they're going to want an event.
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:20.280]   We're not going to see an M1X probably.
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:21.280]   Do you think?
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:23.680]   I don't think we'd see anything major over the summer.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:26.160]   And it won't be September because that's iPhone month.
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:31.360]   So it'll be probably October before we see new laptops, new Mac mini, perhaps a new mini
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:32.360]   Mac.
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:33.400]   Now I wanted July event Leo.
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:35.320]   I do want one.
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:40.840]   There's another rumor again who knows how reliable that we'll see MacBook Air in color
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.000]   in 2022.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.940]   Yeah.
[01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:45.600]   I would like that.
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:46.840]   That's such an obvious thing.
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:52.440]   I can't believe it's taken this long for even us to have a rumor about multicolored Mac
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:53.440]   book airs.
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:54.440]   I hope.
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:55.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:57.840]   So these things are supposed to be fun.
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:02.480]   I'm so glad that Apple's finally breaking out of the being that company of, hey, and
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:09.160]   it's available in two colors, gray or slightly darker gray.
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:11.720]   No, no, no, no.
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:12.720]   You're the fun company.
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:15.560]   Is it a materials issue, a process issue?
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:17.640]   Because of course, color plastics, no big deal.
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:21.800]   But although it was tough to get the shades that Apple wanted and the white was for
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:27.240]   black is hard, gold is super easy, black is hard, and that's the two ends of the spectrum.
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:29.320]   And then it's just getting the screws to match if you're really fussy.
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:30.760]   But they've been able to do with the phone.
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:32.520]   They've been able to color to aluminum.
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:33.520]   Yes.
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:34.520]   Yeah.
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:35.520]   Yeah.
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:36.520]   Screws don't match Leo burns my eyes every year.
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:37.520]   Oh, no.
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:41.320]   I think part of this just is a supply chain issue.
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:43.760]   Like how do you know how many people are going to want the orange one?
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:44.760]   How many people are going to want the?
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:45.760]   That's true.
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:47.120]   Skew all those shoes make it hard.
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:48.120]   Yeah.
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:49.120]   Yeah.
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:50.120]   So.
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:53.040]   So the glue in this is glass, right?
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:56.280]   But this is the surgical steel.
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:57.280]   But that's a pro.
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:58.280]   So that's steel.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:59.280]   Yeah.
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.280]   So that's the DLC coating.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:01.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:02.280]   So the vapor deposit coating.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:03.280]   That's vapor deposit.
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:04.280]   Like why is it?
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:05.600]   So it's not in the metal.
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:06.760]   It's on top of the metal.
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:07.760]   It's a paint.
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:09.560]   The regular tools are anodized.
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:10.560]   Oh, okay.
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:12.280]   Just making the aluminum react to various different substances.
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:16.480]   But that steel would be very, that would be, I guess they won't use steel, I'll use aluminum.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:17.480]   No.
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:18.480]   Yeah.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:22.360]   So making aluminum a color or is it painted in effect?
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:23.800]   That's actually what the IMAX are right now.
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:24.800]   Yeah.
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.160]   They just, they treat the, they expose the aluminum.
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:30.160]   Like I think iron makes the aluminum go golden color and there's different processes and.
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:31.160]   The IMAX are beautiful.
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:33.160]   I would do it for you.
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:34.160]   Yeah.
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:37.000]   So that, I'd love to see that color range in a Macbook Air.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.360]   That'd be fantastic.
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:44.520]   They also, this rumor says according to Dylan Dick, which is not a good name, but that's
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:53.120]   his name, Dylan Dick says M2 processor that the M1X will be reserved for the Pro Mac devices.
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:55.200]   The Macbook Air will have an M2.
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:56.200]   That's the thing.
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:59.640]   People are so confused about this, but if you just think about it, like imagine the,
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:02.120]   the number is the generation of Intel silicon.
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:04.240]   It's like Skylake or KB Lake.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:08.680]   And then the X at the end is like an I5 versus an I9.
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:12.720]   So like you, you have a generation of silicon and then you have how much capability that
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:14.720]   generates silicon.
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:15.720]   Is it add cores?
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:16.720]   Is it add cash?
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:17.720]   Yes.
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:18.720]   It does both.
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:19.720]   Yeah.
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:20.720]   Well, they usually they add cores.
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:22.280]   Sometimes the memory bandwidth is bigger.
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:24.040]   Sometimes it has extra capabilities on it.
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:28.600]   Like with the M1, it's not technically an X, but it is an A14X and it's got, you know,
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:33.520]   some, some specific silicon and more RAM, those sorts of things.
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:38.120]   This would be, this is somebody's idea of what a Macbook Pro might look like to match
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:39.120]   the Mac iMacs.
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:40.120]   Yeah.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.120]   That would be very pretty.
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:43.800]   It's a white bezel, but I guess we can live with that.
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:45.720]   People are saying the white bezels the right way to go.
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:46.720]   No.
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:47.720]   They're used to it.
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:51.120]   Well, you, you, I'm guessing you could also tell a lot about people about, okay, so they
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:53.400]   already have like, they already have the Tangerine iMac.
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:55.040]   Are they going to get the Tangerine?
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:59.560]   Do they, do they go for matchy matchy or do they go for, I want the opposite side of
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:00.560]   the color wheel.
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:01.560]   So it's a nice contrast.
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:06.720]   I want the, I want the, I want the lemon yellow iMac and I want the deep, deep blue,
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:11.640]   I, I pad next to it and Mac, Mac Air next to it.
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:20.200]   I may have made a tactical error because when I bought my AirPod Macs, I got the pink one.
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:23.160]   And people, it looks a little orangey actually.
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:24.160]   It doesn't look pink.
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:25.680]   It looks more like an orange.
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:27.000]   People definitely notice.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.360]   If I had red hair, maybe they wouldn't.
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:31.520]   This is, this is, this is actually a serious question.
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:34.400]   If you've been, if you've been wearing them and sweating into them, how does that affect
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:35.400]   the color?
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:37.400]   Is the color holding up or?
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:38.760]   I, I don't sweat.
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:41.120]   So I have not been sweating into them.
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:42.120]   You're so okay.
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:44.600]   I have, I haven't had them long enough to sweat into them.
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:46.080]   I don't wear them to work out or anything.
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:48.120]   I just, I just wear them to listen.
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:50.600]   You know, I, I, I'm thinking about this.
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:54.160]   I'm thinking about this partly because I have to sort of rescind all the complaints I've
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:44:01.240]   made about Apple and other streaming box companies giving you a black remote that, that's guaranteed
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:02.240]   to get lost.
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:03.240]   Because I'm, oh, wow, great.
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:04.240]   This, this is great.
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:10.000]   The, the, the, the Google Chromecast with Google TV comes with like a matching color
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.000]   remote.
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000]   So I got the white one.
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000]   So it's got the white remote.
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000]   So easy to find.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.000]   Yay.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.240]   And then I realized, oh, after, after two or three months, I can tell which button I usually
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:25.040]   rest my thumb on because it looks like looks like the bottom of a bus stop.
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:26.040]   Put down the remote.
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:28.040]   Quick.
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:29.040]   Yeah.
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:30.040]   Quick.
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:31.040]   Down the remote.
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:32.040]   So that's, that's got to be a problem too.
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:33.760]   How do you make color that actually wears?
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:35.760]   Well, that still looks brilliant and happy.
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:37.520]   White is that doesn't just make you sad.
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:42.720]   Remember how all those old, old, old Macintosh is yellowed with time with the base ones,
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:43.920]   the yellowed with time.
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:44.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:49.120]   And remember, remember how the one, the one, the most legendary product delays after an
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:53.400]   announcement was the white iPhone because they just couldn't get the white, right?
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:56.200]   It was such a hard color to lock the sensors.
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:57.200]   Yeah.
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:58.200]   Pokemon go.
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:44:59.200]   This is not an Apple story.
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:00.200]   I'm doing it for Renee.
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:02.200]   It's not my first of the week either.
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:04.440]   I was going to, but I knew you were going to beat me to it.
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:05.680]   Came out.
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:12.600]   It's hard to believe five years ago, $5 billion in lifetime revenue.
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:17.920]   And what's really interesting is it's going up, not down.
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:24.680]   It generate in 2020, and I think because of pandemic probably, 41% increase in revenue
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:28.120]   to $1.3 billion globally.
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:35.680]   And as we finished the first half of 21, the title is actually about the same in terms
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:36.680]   of revenue.
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:39.240]   So it is people, more people are playing than.
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:40.240]   They were smart.
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:41.240]   They were smart with it.
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:43.280]   But I think they're going to hurt themselves because they're going to reverse a bunch of
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:44.560]   the stuff they did for the pandemic.
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:46.520]   That was the longer distance.
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:48.720]   Yeah, it is because Lisa's already pissed off.
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:50.360]   They just for safety, simple safety reasons.
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:53.880]   Like you don't want people to have to cross streets or do all sorts of leases, pissed
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:54.880]   off.
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:56.080]   People were really, it's rightly so.
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:00.040]   They were doing the remote battles, the ability to spin a gym.
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:02.960]   I know people are going, what are they talking about?
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:03.960]   To spin a--
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:07.400]   $5 billion is what we're talking about.
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:10.840]   I mean, that's a fraction of what Fortnite made in one year.
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:18.760]   But it's still a good-- it's the most profitable of all of these location-based games, right?
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:20.600]   This is from Sensuit Tower.
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:23.440]   I don't think Nintendo is saying or Pokemon.
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:26.120]   The beloved franchise-- and Pokemon in general was huge this year, too.
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:28.240]   I mean, they just got a bunch of YouTubers unboxing them.
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:29.240]   It's in the price.
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:30.240]   Yeah.
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:31.240]   They're the whole thing.
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:32.240]   It's outrageous.
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:34.920]   So you still playing?
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:39.360]   Yeah, I'm not sure how much I'm going to go because I've gotten to the point where I've
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:40.360]   run out of experience points.
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:41.360]   I'm like level 46.
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:42.360]   And it's going to take--
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:45.120]   You're at 46 experience points to get to 47.
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:49.440]   Lisa's already saying-- if Lisa's at 43, she's already saying it's too much work to get
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:50.440]   level up.
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:51.440]   Yeah.
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:52.440]   Well, it's not the work.
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:53.440]   It's monotonous.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:55.960]   They keep making me monotony-based challenges.
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:57.440]   And I just--
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:00.080]   You have to fight 6,000 gym battles.
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:01.080]   It's like ridiculous.
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:02.080]   Yeah.
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:03.080]   No, yeah.
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:04.080]   It's boring.
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:05.080]   Yeah.
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:07.080]   I don't have much of a life, but the life I have, I like to keep going.
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:08.080]   I care about it.
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:10.280]   I care about it.
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:12.120]   Picks of the week coming up in just a bit.
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:14.560]   Let's get our picks of the week.
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:17.920]   I'm going to kick things off again because I don't-- I often don't have a pick of the
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:18.920]   week.
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:24.840]   Big discussion in the open source community and a lot of upset over a program we've recommended
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:27.080]   for a long time called Audacity.
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:30.960]   It's a free program available on Mac, Windows, Linux.
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:32.680]   And it got sold.
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:39.240]   It's still open source, but among the commits they suggested to add new tracking capabilities.
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:42.240]   In my opinion, there's a good article on ours, Technica, today about this.
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:47.560]   It's not the big deal that people think it is, but still, people are very concerned.
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:49.880]   So I started looking for an alternative.
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:55.120]   And actually, this is a really nice editor, also cross-platform, not open source because
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:48:01.960]   it was developed by a Brazilian university, but it uses patented plugins, O-C-E-N plugins
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:03.720]   from the Brazilian telecom.
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:07.000]   However, it is compatible with VST and Apple plugins.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:13.320]   So if you're looking for a free audio processor to replace Audacity, it's actually-- I think
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:14.520]   it's better than Audacity.
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:19.560]   It works all the way up to Big Sur and on Apple Silicon as well as Intel.
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:21.800]   So it's nice that they have a native version.
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:23.280]   It's called-- I have it here.
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:29.560]   I have the Linux version of it, but it's called O-C-E-N audio.
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:31.960]   And I have to say, I'm very impressed with it.
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:33.760]   I love the plugins.
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:38.720]   It supports-- you can record directly to it, but it also will support a lot of effects,
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:42.520]   including all the VST plugins and the Apple plugins.
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:47.120]   So if you are using Audacity and for any reason of thinking, maybe I don't want to use this
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:52.080]   anymore, or maybe just looking for something more up to date because Audacity basically
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:57.000]   is a Windows 98 app that was never really improved upon.
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.880]   Everybody uses it because it's free.
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:02.720]   We used it for years with podcasts and so forth.
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:04.200]   But this looks really good.
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:06.360]   So I just wanted to mention there are alternatives out there.
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:10.200]   I don't know if I have any music I can open on here.
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:15.360]   But it opens MP3s as well as a large variety of files.
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:16.360]   Very nice.
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:22.400]   O-C-E-N audio.com.
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:25.280]   Mr. Renee Ritchie, your pick of the week.
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:26.320]   So my pick of the week is just--
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:27.320]   Besides Pokemon Go.
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:28.320]   Besides that.
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:29.840]   Yeah, so I mean obviously.
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.680]   In addition to that.
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:32.680]   So no EEO.
[01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:34.680]   So no EEO.
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:36.560]   My pick of the week is a quickie, but it's a goodie.
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:40.640]   It's from Stephen Hackett, who some people might know from 512 pixels or is a co-founder
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:43.440]   of Relay FM, a prodigious podcaster.
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:48.600]   He's got a 2022 Apple hardware calendar that he's put up as a Kickstarter.
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:55.000]   He is a huge collector of vintage, you know, all different.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.480]   I want to have every color I'm at.
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:58.560]   That's the kind of dude that Stephen Hackett is.
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:02.080]   And he's putting all of that heat and heat and heat and light in his planet.
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:03.080]   I agree.
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:08.760]   Yeah, to work on making just a loving, a door, a passion project of a calendar for a next
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:12.720]   year based on all of this Apple hardware is just nice.
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:13.720]   It's kind of stuff I love.
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:17.040]   So it's kind of, it's not playmates.
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:19.040]   It's Macintashes.
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:20.040]   Firefighters.
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:21.840]   It's not firefighters.
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.840]   It's not hot firefighters.
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:24.840]   Look at all of these.
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:25.840]   It's hot Macintashes.
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:26.840]   Look at all of these.
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:27.840]   The 20th century Mac too.
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:28.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:29.840]   We used to have that.
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:30.840]   I don't know.
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:31.840]   I think we gave it away.
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:32.840]   There's not enough room in the world.
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:33.840]   Apparently Steve cares.
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:37.120]   Look at there's the duo with the dog museum in his back pocket.
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:38.120]   Look at that.
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:39.120]   That's great.
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:40.120]   All right.
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:41.120]   That's on Kickstarter.
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:42.560]   And it's already raised enough money to go ahead.
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:43.560]   $25,000.
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:44.560]   Like eight times over.
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:45.560]   Yeah.
[01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:46.560]   Yeah, 600 backers.
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:47.560]   25 days.
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:48.560]   There's 25 days left.
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:49.560]   Yeah.
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:52.160]   Search for 2022 Apple hardware calendar.
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:53.160]   Nice.
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:54.920]   Very nice.
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:56.600]   Andy, your pick of the week.
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:59.440]   I've got a really cool one.
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:03.320]   It's an app called Brickit, B-R-I-C-K-I-T.
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:09.840]   And what it does is it'll look at your collection of Lego pieces and it will show you models
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:12.160]   you can make based on the pieces you have.
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:19.920]   I swear to God, you just scatter them like ideally on a high contrast background, like
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:20.920]   a bed sheet.
[01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:24.120]   You don't have to be that fussy about making sure that they're all separated.
[01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:25.680]   You take a picture of it.
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:33.800]   And then you actually, for extra dazzle points, they actually analyze the picture and will
[01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:37.040]   actually put little halos around every single piece that it identifies.
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:39.640]   Then it will tell you, okay, great.
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:41.640]   You've got 273 pieces.
[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:45.080]   Here are some models that you can build with the pieces that you have.
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:48.200]   And no, they're not like thousand piece models or anything like that.
[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:49.200]   They're simple models.
[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:51.320]   But oh my God, it's so cool.
[01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:55.640]   And if you just have this bucket of Legos and you just want to play with your kids and
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:52:00.800]   being creative and inventive and making your own stuff doesn't appeal to you.
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:04.080]   It's like little X-wing fighters, little soccer players.
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:09.160]   But it's just like it's incredible that this thing works and it actually works.
[01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:11.680]   This is really amazing.
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:18.360]   You can also, if you have Lego sets that you're done with, you can also type in the number
[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:20.720]   of your Lego set and we'll just add that to, okay.
[01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:26.840]   So he has the Lego tuck tuck vehicle set.
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:30.320]   And so here's what you can build with all the pieces from the Lego tuck tuck vehicle set.
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:32.000]   Like a little gun, a little fish.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.400]   And I gave away all my Legos, man.
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:36.400]   Oh man.
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:41.920]   When I was a kid, I would just, I had such a pile of them unsorted that I would just, you
[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:43.080]   know, build stuff.
[01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:45.080]   But it'd be nice to have some ideas like this.
[01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:50.320]   Also Legos and baseball cars, they're sort of like the cultural heritage of the neighborhood.
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:51.320]   Yeah.
[01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:53.360]   And I'm in my neighborhood.
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:57.960]   It's like at some point you would find that your, your, your mom had brought home a huge
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:03.280]   bucket of Legos because the kid up the street was not like 15, 16 was using anymore.
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:04.880]   And then you become 15, 16.
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:08.680]   And then this even bigger bucket of Legos goes to this little kid.
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:09.680]   Exactly.
[01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:16.120]   I imagine that my little snowball of Legos is now a giant snowhouse of Legos because this
[01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:18.400]   is like, nobody throws up Legos.
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:21.280]   You just hand them on to the next generation.
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:25.520]   But yeah, this, but this app is like, it's just so fun just to say, I, you, you, it's
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:28.120]   this app that you download because there's no way this works.
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:31.680]   So come on, this is, I'm going to, I'm going to make such fun of this app onto.
[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:32.680]   Oh my God.
[01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:34.440]   It's actually, oh my God.
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:39.040]   Not only, and not only that, but if you said, okay, I want to, I want to do the, the,
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:42.880]   I want to do that little model of the, the duck riding a steam engine, it will then like
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:47.600]   return you to that picture and highlight in the picture where all the pieces you need
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:50.960]   are, assuming you haven't like scattered them on the bed sheets.
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:52.600]   And so this is, you took that picture.
[01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:57.200]   It's like, oh my God, I, I want to buy you a coffee, sir, or madam.
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:01.840]   I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to, I, I, whatever your philosophy in life is,
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:05.840]   I at least will listen to the first three minutes of it because you seem to get it all
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:07.080]   figured out.
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:12.360]   So many, if you search for Lego Sorters, there are a million projects of people built
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:13.680]   Lego Sorters.
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:18.600]   So that the AI to kind of figure out what each piece is is out there.
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:23.800]   But of course building a Lego Sorters, it's a little more complicated.
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:28.440]   You can, you can do it this way or you can build one that, this is a universal Lego sorting
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:31.880]   machine that somebody built that has a conveyor belt.
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:32.880]   Get out of Lego.
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:35.760]   Of course you have to make it out of Lego.
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:38.560]   That's part of the deal, right?
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:42.160]   Alex Lindsay, your pick of the week, my friend.
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:47.000]   So a long time ago I had this idea that it would be great to be able to control apps
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.920]   and you would be able to have a piece of hardware, but the hardware would be modular.
[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:54.320]   You could kind of click things together and I thought about ways to do that.
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:58.440]   And it turns out somebody did it without, without any input from me.
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:01.040]   And, and it's really pretty, it's pretty slick.
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:06.040]   And let me just, this is kind of Legos for, for software, for, it is.
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:07.040]   Yeah.
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:08.040]   Yeah.
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:09.040]   Alex Legos.
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:10.040]   So this is, this is what it looks like.
[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:11.040]   Oh, like.
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:16.520]   This is the modular, this is the monogram.
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:20.040]   And what they have here is, these are little, little pieces and they all just kind of like
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:21.040]   pop out.
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:22.560]   There's knobs and dials and switches.
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:26.560]   So you say, oh, I want, I want some buttons and you just snap on.
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:30.320]   And they're on a sign, but you would then as you saw for them, sign them to the.
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:31.320]   Yeah.
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:35.680]   So then what you can do is you can, let's see if I cut to this.
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:37.280]   This is final cut here.
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:41.160]   But if I, let's see if I, uh, he's making something, watch out.
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:43.280]   I see he's got the scale out.
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:47.080]   So, so anyway, no, but you have, you have, so this is the assignment.
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:51.280]   So you just kind of click on one and you say, I want to assign something to it.
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:52.920]   So you can assign whatever you want.
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:56.960]   It sees what they are and you can assign what, what they're, what they're all doing.
[01:55:56.960 --> 01:56:02.000]   And then if I go to final cut, you know, what you can see is I'm just turning a dial, you
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.720]   know, and able to control, you know, color.
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:09.800]   Um, you know, so I, I, that's what I assign to these and if I, oh, that's really neat.
[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:13.280]   So now I have, and it just gives you this kind of, and you can, it works with, you know,
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:15.280]   final cut, it works with, it works with zoom.
[01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:16.800]   I haven't figured that out yet.
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:19.400]   It also works with a lot of the Adobe products.
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:23.040]   And, and so anyway, and it just keeps, it's, but what's really cool about it.
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:24.040]   And here's like a little work.
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:26.360]   So the logic is well, Ableton live, Q base.
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:27.360]   Yeah.
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:32.160]   So, so, and, and some of these are much more, you know, some of these are very tightly integrated.
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:37.960]   And so the, anyway, so I think that it, it, it's not cheap.
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:40.880]   They're, they're, they're, they're really well made.
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:41.880]   They're good quality.
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:42.880]   Yeah.
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:43.880]   They're really good quality.
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:44.880]   They snap together.
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:49.280]   Um, it's a great little, you know, and again, this cool little modular interface that allows
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:53.360]   you to just decide how, how you're going to put that together on your desk and where
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:56.240]   you want it and, and where they like make, make the most sense.
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:59.280]   And you can see a bunch of different use cases for them on the website.
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:03.320]   So you can, you can keep on adding to them or subtracting or splitting them up and, and
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:07.720]   it's, um, anyway, it's a really, it's a really slick piece of hardware.
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:11.400]   We're going to have, we're actually going to have the developers of this on Office Hours
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:12.400]   on Friday.
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:13.400]   Looks really nice.
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:14.400]   Kind of walked through it.
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:18.080]   So they sent me one to, to take a look at and I was like, okay, this is, this is exactly
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:19.080]   what I wanted.
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:20.080]   Yeah.
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:24.120]   So, so, um, so anyway, yeah, so they're going to come on and show it and show us more than
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:26.640]   what I'm just showing here on, on Office Hours on Friday.
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:30.720]   But, but I think that it is, um, but I've been playing with it now for a little while.
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:33.520]   And it's, it's just a really slick piece of hardware.
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:38.440]   And I just love the idea of being able to customize what I'm, uh, you know, what I have
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:42.120]   control over and for each app have this kind of setup.
[01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:45.040]   Um, so we're, we're looking forward to using a lot more of it.
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:46.040]   Yeah.
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:50.280]   Works with the engine works with Capture One, of course, all the Adobe products, uh, final
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:51.280]   thing.
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:53.160]   And it's easy to say, well, you can just do it with a mouse.
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:56.840]   But when you have the hardware to interface, you just kind of smoother and get it done
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:57.840]   faster.
[01:57:57.840 --> 01:57:59.280]   It's more, it's more intuitive to, yeah.
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:00.280]   Yeah.
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:03.400]   When you're using faders to control mixes and things, it's much easier, I think, than
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:04.400]   doing it on the screen.
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:05.400]   Yeah.
[01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:07.400]   You just use move faster and time is, time is money.
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:08.400]   Yep.
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:09.400]   Yeah.
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:12.200]   You might want to check out last week, one of the video editors from Linus Tech Tips did
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:16.920]   a really good in depth, uh, review of this, of this unit because he'd been using the first
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:21.760]   one and he'd been like sending his feedback to the developers on the, on the second one.
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:24.520]   So he then spent all much time looking at the second one.
[01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:27.920]   Uh, and so they'll give you an idea of some of the things he likes, some of the things
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:30.360]   he didn't like as someone who just does nothing but video editing.
[01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:35.080]   Um, because it was a, it was a bit of a mixed bag, but it's kind of, I'm sure it's going
[01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:39.160]   to depend on what you want to use it for and, uh, what problem is going to solve for you.
[01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:40.160]   They are not inexpensive.
[01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:44.440]   I mean, we're talking hundreds of dollars for each module, but you know, if you care,
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:47.760]   but I love tactile interfaces, ma'am, they need to come back.
[01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:49.520]   Oh, there's so many things for all of these.
[01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:50.520]   That's not bad, actually.
[01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:52.520]   Yeah.
[01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:53.520]   Tactile.
[01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:54.520]   I agree with you, Andy.
[01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:57.920]   I mean, the bottom line is that I guess if I'm going to put something on my desk, I want
[01:58:57.920 --> 01:58:59.880]   it to work well.
[01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:02.400]   And that comes down to just working smoothly.
[01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:07.200]   And so, so I'm, I'd rather that pay a little bit more for each module than have it be,
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:10.200]   you know, kind of a cheap little scratches against the thing.
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:13.160]   And it just, it's just, it's one of those things that I want those things.
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:16.120]   When you feel, when you actually play with it, I think what I liked about it was that
[01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:19.560]   the, you can feel the money you spent on it.
[01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:20.560]   Like it feels good.
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:25.840]   Switch is, like, switches should feel like knobs, dial switches should feel smooth.
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:28.480]   They should have acceleration built in this.
[01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:29.480]   Yeah.
[01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:32.680]   All he wants is a video artist he needs is try to vary us.
[01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:37.720]   All I want, all I want is like that video fader, like brushed, brushed, brushed metal
[01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:42.040]   fader control, like they used to energize the Death Star main ion cannon.
[01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:43.040]   Exactly.
[01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:44.280]   That's, I just want more.
[01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:46.240]   I don't, I don't get one of those.
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:47.240]   But it's so cool.
[01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:49.240]   Just like put your hands up and.
[01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:51.240]   I think, I think, but I think that if you.
[01:59:51.240 --> 01:59:52.520]   You deserve volume control.
[01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:55.920]   I think, I think though that if you have that, you should just have it not connected to anything
[01:59:55.920 --> 01:59:56.920]   but a speaker.
[01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:58.920]   And when you move it, it just goes.
[01:59:58.920 --> 01:59:59.920]   Can I, can I.
[01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:02.680]   You know, once in a while, you need that like, feel a little tired.
[02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:04.520]   This has been a really hard project.
[02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:05.520]   Let me.
[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:06.520]   Okay.
[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:07.520]   Now we're going to light it up.
[02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:13.120]   I think we, is this, is, is the closest thing we have available, but would this work?
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:16.720]   You know, just a little, you know, it's a, it's a litheer slide right now.
[02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:20.040]   I want the, I want the, I want the handle to hold on to.
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:22.640]   And then like you push it for you to get your work to work on it.
[02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:23.640]   We'll just get there.
[02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:25.640]   You make a big handle and.
[02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:27.280]   You can get, I will.
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:28.280]   No, no joke.
[02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:33.920]   I have some, I have some eBay searches saved for like giving, give me a junk like color balance,
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:39.400]   color mixing video console from like the 1970s just so I can like cannibalize it for parts,
[02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:44.480]   probably like maybe use like a Raspberry Pi or, or, or tiny as a, as, as an interface.
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:47.000]   Again, I will figure out what this does.
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.040]   If it does anything after I get this thing together, if I just want occasionally, you
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:54.720]   just need to say, energize pad three.
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:56.080]   This thing is awesome.
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:01:00.600]   It's got an RS-232 control, a port on the back, but it does say gumple.
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:03.600]   So I figure Alex is probably looking for this.
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:08.840]   This probably is like the switch from the applause sign on the late night show or something
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:09.840]   like that.
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:12.440]   So we really, we do want to get that back to Alex.
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:16.280]   If you're looking for your applause switch, here it is.
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:18.200]   There it is.
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:25.480]   Can we hook this up to an applause sign that would be, I would like that.
[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:26.880]   Alex Lindsay, always a pleasure.
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:27.880]   Thank you so much.
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:28.880]   Yeah, there we go.
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:29.880]   You could blink it like that.
[02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:31.280]   It'd be great.
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:33.360]   So much pleasure to have you Alex.
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:39.400]   And of course, oh nine oh, that media is his day job, but the rest of the time he's
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:44.480]   at office hours, office hours dot global to find out more about all of the things going
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:46.080]   on at office hours.
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:48.920]   When you're not there, it continues though, doesn't it?
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:49.920]   It does.
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:51.760]   We had a whole different set of hosts last week.
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:55.040]   So people just keep talking with it without me.
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:56.760]   So it's great.
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:01.480]   I mean, it's incredible that you have a, every once in a while, I look at the folks
[02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:05.760]   there and we have just incredible skill sets in every panel.
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:09.080]   I mean, it's, it's, and it's generally a half a millennia of experience that's all
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:14.840]   stacked up there, you know, answering just every question that comes in and, and hitting
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:16.800]   a home run all the time.
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:19.240]   You know, it's, it's, it's quite a, it's quite a thing.
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:21.320]   Mostly a production, right?
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:27.760]   Video and audio production, but it's media production and virtual like, you know, virtual
[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:35.360]   production, virtual events, but people ask me, we do cook, we cook together.
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:36.360]   Yeah.
[02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:37.360]   It's awesome.
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:38.360]   It's really a community.
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:41.640]   I got to tell you, when you, we did a Raspberry Pi, there's a, one of our, one of the folks
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:45.800]   that's in office hours actually, um, wrote a program for the Raspberry Pi called the
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:49.400]   Playout B and it basically does what a hyper deck does except that it's just on a Raspberry
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:53.120]   Pi and you can load files into it and play them out.
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:55.920]   And, and it, they'll talk to the A 10 and everything else.
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:03:01.080]   And so we did a, we did a play out of a Raspberry Pi afternoon where we all put together this
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:02.080]   Raspberry Pi.
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:03.600]   So put it together from scratch.
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:07.760]   We all got the kit, put it together, got Playout B installed, got it all running with our,
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:12.320]   with our A 10 little mini mini's, A 10 mini's.
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:15.320]   What was fascinating was, is that when you do that with a bunch of other people that
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:19.200]   already have multiple cameras, it's an incredible experience.
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:22.920]   You've got like 15 or 20 people all with multi cam cutting, like showing you close up.
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:24.480]   What about right here?
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:25.480]   I don't understand this.
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:27.600]   And the other person going, Oh, no, and they cut to their close up.
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:29.000]   This is, this is the way to do this.
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000]   You know, and, oh, it is.
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:35.600]   I mean, this is, this is like a panel show where everybody on the panel is Jerry Todd.
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:39.480]   Like, oh, let me just change, let just the chrome on that.
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:41.720]   How about some color bars on Chiridl's read it?
[02:03:41.720 --> 02:03:43.320]   Well, I mean, we do, we do.
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:46.560]   I mean, so, so what's incredible though is that experience that we, when we do cooking,
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:47.560]   it's the same thing.
[02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:54.600]   You know, we, we cook together and, but we have, we all have multiple camera setups.
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:58.920]   And, and so you have these close ups of everybody cooking together and then asking questions
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:01.720]   and trading notes and, Oh, well, I cut it this way and you see a close up of them.
