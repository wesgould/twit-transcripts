[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   To cover the latest news from Apple, often no Mac news at all.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Renee Rich is here from iMore.com.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I'm using a Macleo. Is that enough? I'm using it right now.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I'm sitting in front of one.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Actually, this week there may be some Mac news.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Actually.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I'm holding my breath.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Andy and I co also here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And...
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Hello.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Hello. Here we are in...
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   What is it? Week two of the iPhone X era.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Yes, right. I was looking at some pictures of people from before the iPhone X era.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   What the hell is those flare browsers?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Did anybody used to wear their hair that way?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Ever did they survive?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Ming Chi Quo from KGI Securities is back our favorite analyst.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Yes, it's time for iPhone 11 rumors.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Well, actually one rumor is we don't know what's going to be called.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   But he says there will be three late 2018 iPhones.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   They'll all be model on the iPhone X, which is really not a surprise because
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   frankly, why wouldn't you?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I do like the one interesting slice in this rumor that there'll be a six and a half inch
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   model of a huge iPhone huge.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I'm not sure why they need three.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Six point one, six point five.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Oh, I guess four, five point eight.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   So small, medium, large.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   You know, he said this last time and he was wrong.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Well, maybe he wasn't though.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   There were three.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   There were three this year.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   So there are a lot of interesting things to think about.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   For instance, let's say that they still have supply issues about getting the
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   3D face sensors and all that sort of stuff.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Would they decide to make the notch a consistent feature across the board of
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   all iPhones, whether it has face ID or not?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Or do they want to make sure that look if you see the notch, that implies
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   that there's face ID present?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Right.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Apple says we're all in on the notch.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   We don't consider it a flaw.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   So the chair.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   The thing that was interesting to me is that one of the reasons Apple
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   reportedly went to OLD is that it's flexible.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   So they could literally bend the screen around back on itself and put the
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   controller underneath it so that you wouldn't have to have any bezel at all.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   You could go corner to corner.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Yeah, yeah, they're hugely rounded corners, but they are corner to corner
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   without any bezel.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And I didn't know if you could do that with L with LCD, but it was pointed out
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   to me that some of the prototype sharp LCD is now they've gotten good enough
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   that you can have almost no bezel.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   It's a little bit thicker than what is on the iPhone X right now, but it's
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   getting to the point where you can just pick your design and then your screen
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   technology, which at least would help alleviate the supply concerns around
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   OLD, which is still mostly a Samsung manufacturing constraint.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Yeah, although Apple is contracted both with Samsung and LG, although after seeing
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   the LG display in the pixel 2 XL, I think we're glad they went with Samsung.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   They're pouring money into it.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I mean, both Apple and Google are poor.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   They would love to have when you look at the markup that Samsung got for Apple
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   on the OLED screens, Apple would love to have competition.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I think Japan display and they're investing in other companies as well.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   They'll figure it out.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   One of the three, according again to quote, one of the three phones,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   the middle mid-sized 6.1 inch will not be OLD.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   It'll be an LCD lower resolution and lower cost.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   You know, if we've learned anything from the iPhone X and sales are apparently
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   through the roof, nobody worries about an extra couple hundred bucks.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   The price does not seem to be a Roblok in any respect.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   My pixel was 1500 bucks Canadian.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Yeah, these are not inexpensive.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   They're not quite iPhone X.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   I think the pixel and then the note and then the iPhone X, I'm not sure.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Yeah, I think that's exactly right.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Well, we each of those like with a note, you're getting a really a different
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   device than from a standard phone.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Also, we're talking about iPhone consumers as opposed to phone consumers.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   People who are price sensitive might have already decided that the iPhone
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   is not for them to begin with.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   And also, it's unfortunately Apple doesn't break down the numbers as finally
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   as we would like to get some good knowledge about this.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I think that I think suffice to say that the people who are spending the
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   extra 200 bucks for the iPhone X are the sort of people who are exceptionally
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   happy to have the very latest phone or they are just simply paying X dollars a
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   month forever just to get whatever have whatever phone is the is the latest and
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   greatest so they can swap in every October or September.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   It's I would be my opinions of the iPhone 10 would be a lot different if
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   they didn't have the iPhone 8 and if the iPhone 8 weren't such a superior
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   phone is so wonderful, wonderful device.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   It's hard to see where they cut any corners whatsoever on the iPhone 8.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   So it's not as though the iPhone 8 is any way a middle of the range phone.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I think Apple did very, very well by saying we have the iPhone 8 and 8 plus
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   are our top of the line phone still just like just like they've always been.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   The iPhone 10 is above our top of the line phone.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   That's the way you should think about it.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   I have to say now that I have the Pixel 2 XL and I got mine just yesterday
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   because I ordered it a black and white one with the orange button which
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   apparently were insurance.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   It's so cool.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I love the color.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I would if people are willing to wait for the iPhone 10, I'm willing to wait for
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   the Panda with the orange button.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   That's what I call it the Panda with the orange button.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   But now I'm only spending a day with it.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   It's funny because the screen isn't actually bigger than the iPhone 10 screen.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   The phone is considerably bigger but the iPhone because it has zero bezels
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   and this one has a couple of top and bottom bezels is a more compact device.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   I don't have any burning on this.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   I don't see any screen issues.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I mean, it's-
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   You had burn it today, Leon.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Well, in a way, I'm kind of, well, no.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Some people came out of the box burned in.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Really?
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Oh, no.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   I didn't do that.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   But I also have to say that, you know, it has the OLED issues.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And so forth.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   If you didn't look at any other phone, if you put it-
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   It didn't put it side by side with a Note 8 or iPhone 10, it would be fine.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   It also depends on your sensitivity because I know people who can't look at an iPhone
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   plus because they see the scaling and the one pixel flicker as you scroll through things.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   And they're like, I don't want to see that.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Right.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   It's just some people are super sensitive.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Some people came out of the OLED because it has smearing when you do the scrolling.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Right.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   So I-
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.800]   This is- If you're an Android fan, this is definitely the phone to get the pixel to the
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.800]   pixel to XL or the pixel XL.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.400]   They're very nice phones.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.800]   I love a lot of the features.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.000]   I have to say, I really do feel like the fingerprint reader is a consistent-
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.760]   Much more consistent for unlocking than face ID.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.120]   I kind of prefer it.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.000]   But there is no question in my mind now.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.680]   And it hasn't been for some years.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.280]   I haven't picked an iPhone as the phone of the year, but there's no question in my mind.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.040]   The best phone in 2017 is the iPhone 10 by a long shot.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.040]   I hate to say this.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.960]   I've got- If you- If your iPhone 10 arrived on the day of shipping, you have until Friday
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.600]   to return it and get your money back.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.560]   And I got until Friday and I was planning on going to the Apple Store today to return
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.600]   it because now I have my Apple review unit so I can do my last couple of weeks of stuff
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   with it.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:57.600]   I've got that little demon on my shoulder saying, but it's such a lovely phone.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.800]   And maybe you should- You know, the best- The latest iPhone you actually own is the iPhone
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.800]   6 Plus.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.640]   And maybe you should- I'm like, "Oh, it's $1,000."
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:14.000]   Why do I like this phone so much that I'm willing to throw away $1,000 on a second phone?
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.160]   It's a lot of money.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.960]   And you know what?
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.720]   And like I said, I think it's been three or four years since, in my opinion.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   I try to pick the best phone of the year every time.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.480]   And it's usually between an Android and an iOS phone.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.520]   iOS has not- Apple has not won in several years.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.520]   This one is- It's not even close.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.520]   This one move.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.920]   Face ID really moves the needle.
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.120]   I was on the radio on NPR the last week.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.240]   Every question from the studio host was like, "Yeah, but do we trust it?
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.240]   Do we trust it?"
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.800]   And of course, we had to tell the story about how Samsung's Galaxy S8 Face ID was broken
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.080]   in the room, the demo room, right after the announcement.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:59.040]   But the thing that makes this a star is that it's Face ID that actually works, that you
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.240]   would actually trust it for unlocking your phone.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:07.680]   And although as we expected, just like the Touch ID has some weaknesses, just like all
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:13.160]   during the summer, if your hands are sweaty or if you're just doing the dishes or whatever,
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.560]   you have to do a lot of wiping before Touch ID is going to work.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.080]   Face ID, there's some instances in which it doesn't work, but good happens.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.840]   As soon as you've got a week under your belt where you just trust it to work and you're
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:31.360]   no longer artificially waiting to watch the lock unlock, dang it, it works really well.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.920]   It really does move the needle.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.880]   The edge screen, okay, I've seen that before.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.880]   It's not really good.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.880]   It's the best screen though.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.040]   I have to say, it's the best screen I've ever used.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:45.240]   In terms of color and reproduction and accuracy, it doesn't have the vivid colors and brightness
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:50.040]   of a Samsung Note or an S8, but I think it's the most accurate.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.920]   It's just a beautiful, beautiful screen.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.680]   Both, I agree with an asterisk.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:01.160]   I think that it's kind of a problem now that so many manufacturers are touting, "Oh, well
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.600]   this camera got the best DXO score of any camera," whatever.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.640]   This screen got the best numerical score of this other rating.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.400]   And those are empirical.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.840]   As you put these three phones side by side by side, I think most people would pick up
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.640]   the iPhone X screen.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:24.600]   But when I go back to my Pixel version 1, which is my daily carry phone, or when I go back
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:30.840]   to the iPhone 8 I've got that I'm locking down, I don't think, when I go back to that
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.920]   one, I don't think it's a bad screen at all.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.320]   And most people aren't going to be walking around with two or three phones side by side
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.960]   to compare.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.040]   So Apple definitely gets points for having what I would consider to be the best screen
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.040]   in the business.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.480]   But I don't think that alone would be the reason why someone would go for the iPhone
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.760]   X instead of the iPhone 8 or even an iPhone instead of an Android phone.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.720]   I don't think it's great that you can have an iPhone 8.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.200]   I have both my iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8 and my iPhone 10 here.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.400]   And they look almost the same.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.120]   Even though the LED ones or the LCD ones use profoundly different technology than the
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.320]   OLED ones, just because of all the color calibration and color management apples doing, they essentially
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.120]   look like an iPhone to me.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.040]   And that's not always easy with the whole head to pull off.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.800]   You got to remember, it's not incredible that it's only this year that Android decided
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:21.800]   to make color management, color accuracy, really of the highest level important function
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.160]   of the operating system.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.080]   I guess now there are terrible displays before, but this is the first time that the operating
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.680]   system itself is going to say here is what calibration means.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.920]   Here is how to get accurate color from app to app and experience to experience.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.320]   Whereas Apple, just like they were the first company to really focus on, make sure the
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.880]   typography was a really important part of the user experience, they were the first to
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.680]   decide that color management is going to be an important part of the phone experience
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.680]   from day one.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.680]   You mentioned, go ahead.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.800]   I was going to say they decided that you literally could not ship a DCI P3 display to
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.760]   a customer without individually color calibrating it to the sub pixel level.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.560]   They just thought there was no point to color management without individual unit calibration.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.800]   And I'm guessing, I know you're waiting, your pixel two XL is in the truck.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.800]   This week.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   It's on its way.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.200]   But I will guess when you look at this, you will say, oh yeah, the colors are not as
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.560]   accurate and apparently they're batch calibrating.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.200]   But again, I don't know if it'll bother me.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.840]   It's like, I didn't know if the notch would bother me.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.600]   And then intellectually it bothers me, but in practical use it doesn't.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.840]   And it might be the same thing with the pixel.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.840]   I think.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.160]   I know about the beef, like, because all the lead screens have problems that I know about
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.280]   them, but I don't know if I'll notice them in day to day use.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.160]   You do see that, you know, off axis blue a lot more in the pixel than you do in the
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.160]   iPhone.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:38.760]   However, the differences aren't so great that if you prefer Android, just as you said,
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.200]   Andy, you're not going to switch the iPhone 10 and vice versa.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.200]   They're both kind of top of the line in the category they represent.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:52.200]   And if you're an Android fan, the Pixel 2 is actually great, I think.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.440]   It does teach a good lesson that the difference between, I've often thought about this, the
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:03.360]   difference between a 99 cent burger at McDonald's and the $19 burger at this wonderful restaurant
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.040]   in Cambridge called Craigies on Maine.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.760]   They only make about 20 a day and they're definitely worth it.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.640]   It's not so much that they're different.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.920]   They're still, they don't put truffles.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.320]   They don't put gold shavings on the top of it.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.120]   They just simply choose every ingredient perfectly.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.360]   And it's like the best, it's the best kind of meat they can find.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.480]   They make sure that they have quality control so that the grilling is perfectly fine.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:30.440]   The bread is, I think that you can have two phones that have kind of the same features.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:35.520]   One of them costs $150 more than the other, but that $150 difference could simply be that
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:41.160]   we decided to throw out four displays before we put this one in your phone.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.600]   Also, we spent about 10 hours calibrating it properly so that it would make sure that
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.600]   you would have the right color that this thing is capable of.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.560]   So it's not feature for feature for feature.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.320]   Sometimes there's money to be paid for just making sure that everything is done right,
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.560]   even if it doesn't necessarily have more features than another phone you're considering.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:05.320]   Yeah, and there are some people who, it's a very individual thing.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.120]   In fact, you're going to read all these reviews where they're really splitting hairs in many
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.320]   respects.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.720]   But people care, some people care.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.200]   And if you're a kind of person that cares, then you're going to have some decisions to
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.800]   make.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:24.080]   I just sometimes worry that as a reviewer, I'm more confusing people or more giving people
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.160]   reasons to doubt themselves.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.360]   I've still, before I bought my Olympus camera, which I absolutely, three or four years later,
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.400]   I still absolutely adore, I just got a taste of my own medicine about how I'm looking at
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.120]   every single camera site.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:42.120]   They have these wonderful online JavaScript based tools where here is you pick any four
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.440]   cameras that you want and it'll have this test pattern which each one, each camera,
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.200]   it's pick whatever four you want, then pick whatever ISO you want to pick it at.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:55.600]   And I almost like changed my mind because I'm like, ooh, but at 12,800 ISO, there's a
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.000]   little bit more color balance in this model instead of the Olympus.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.280]   And then finally, I had to say, look, as a total package, the Olympus is the right one.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.280]   I held it.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:09.320]   I'm not going to talk myself out of it because of this graph has a little more delta G than
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.920]   this other graph.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:15.400]   So that's why I think that when I review stuff, I have to make sure I note things like, oh,
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.160]   gosh, the iPhone 10 has the best screen I've seen, but also note that.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.840]   But when I went back to the iPhone 8, I didn't want to spit on it.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.840]   It's tough.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:31.200]   I can pick a path where I say, as a reviewer, I'm going to review it not from the specs,
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.200]   but just as the experience.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.480]   That's kind of what I ended up deciding about photography, which is if you pixel people
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.160]   like crazy, you can find all these differences.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.080]   And certainly, you can write about them.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:48.200]   But I've kind of chosen consciously to say, but my beat is really, is this a pleasing photo
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.560]   or not?
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.280]   And so the same thing with the phones, I prefer to do it that way.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.880]   Can you get the photo or not?
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.800]   Because in some cases, the camera can't get you the photo you want when you're in a party
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.200]   or a bar or a true two, isn't it?
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:14.040]   So apparently, Face ID has been cracked except, boy, you sure have to work hard to do it.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:18.720]   So people get really crazy, but technically, it's been spoofed, not hacked.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.720]   No one broke into the screen.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.520]   No, yes, that's a much better way to describe it.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.520]   Yes.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.520]   Yes.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.520]   It's like when touch ID was, you know, someone took a fingerprint and put it on a sausage
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.320]   and was able to open touch ID.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.960]   It's been spoofed.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.600]   And in order to do it, you're going to spend hundreds of dollars and you're going to have
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.240]   to make a composite 3D printed mask.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:40.760]   You're going to have to use silicone makeup and take pictures of your eyes, nose and lips
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.000]   and use cutouts.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.920]   And yeah, it works.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.960]   And we're not sure how they because there's a liveliness test apparently where it has to
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.960]   have minor bits of movement.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.880]   We're not sure how it got past that or if they did put in the passcode to train it for
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.960]   the mask, there's a lot of stuff that we don't know still about.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.760]   I'm not too worried about this.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.160]   Somebody steal my stuff.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.680]   So the thing to remember is always that face ID, just like touch ID, it's a convenience
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.480]   feature, not a security feature.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:13.040]   They actually, they are ironically in effect duplicated the face ID notch camera by doing
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:19.400]   a scan using a handheld scanner for five minutes of the face.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:25.160]   So yeah, if you wanted to all of that, I guess you can, you can fake it.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.080]   Jerry Hildenbrand, Fran Deuys, central had a great comment on Twitter where he said,
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.560]   you know, if I can get enough photographs of your key, I can cut one and open your door.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.880]   One's enough actually.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.720]   And that's how the TSA key was leaked was a close up photo of the TSA key was enough
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.480]   to 3D print them.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.480]   Yeah.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.920]   There was actually a startup based on that.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:51.600]   The idea that, oh, we can turn your keys into digital keys so that we can do whatever
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.600]   we can.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.600]   That's a good idea.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.520]   But the thing is that it was quickly pointed out that here are ways that if I just simply
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:03.080]   get access to your keys for three seconds, I can now essentially own everything that it's
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.680]   like, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.680]   Thank you.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.680]   Thank you.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.480]   Nice appearance on Shark Tank, but no, this is not a good idea.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:16.080]   But somebody should release software for 3D printers or something or a key cutter that
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.360]   I could use a picture of a key instead of the key.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.360]   Can Glowforge do that?
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.600]   I mean, can you just laser cut yourself a bunch of keys?
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.600]   Sorry.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.600]   They're already doing that.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:30.240]   3D printers are, it's, it's, we're, we're already hearing a, we were already dealing
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:35.280]   with the problem of what if you can simply get a milling machine that will simply manufacture
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.960]   the part of a gun that makes a gun a gun and they simply buy the parts legally to add
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.640]   onto it to turn it to something that can kill people.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.640]   And this is a device.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.240]   This is a machine that costs about a thousand bucks, fifteen hundred bucks.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.520]   And it's mostly, it's about 90% of turnkey operation.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.520]   3D printing.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.520]   Thank God.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.520]   It's so difficult.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:58.520]   Even you spend $2,000 and get that demo based to actually come out.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.520]   Okay.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.600]   If it were really as easy as we all hope it was going to be, they amount of fraud we
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.360]   could do with this.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.480]   The idea of getting a picture from, taking someone into a room, like an interrogation
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.000]   room and there's simply there are four cameras that get the face from all four angles.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.640]   They can print those sections of your face out of ninja flex or something.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:22.880]   So it's translucent, heat it up to 98.6 degrees and get your phone open even though you thought
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.880]   you locked it.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.200]   That's a, that's, that's, that's the premise for a very, very long and boring science fiction
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.200]   novel.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.200]   But it's, but it's very one.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.200]   Here it is.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.200]   Key.me.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.200]   Scan your keys and we'll make one.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.240]   A guy I know actually he was trying to replace the ductwork on his house.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.240]   They no longer made it.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.880]   So he brought one piece in, scanned it.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.680]   3D printed himself the rest of them.
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.680]   Wow.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.680]   Wow.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.680]   Okay.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.680]   There you go.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.680]   I like this.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.280]   You can use their scanner, scan your key.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.520]   You don't have to, and they'll send you some new ones.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.520]   Wow.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.960]   See, I think that if you're, if you have a need for this service, that's when you go
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.680]   for a smart lock.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.840]   It's because it'll give you all everything you'd want to do with the smart, with this
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:07.160]   sort of key duplication service with extra features that could, that could somehow make
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.920]   your doors even more secure by allowing you to create temporary keys that only work for,
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.160]   for three hours.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.160]   So it's yeah.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.440]   I mean, keys are obviously, you know, medieval technology.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.320]   We could do better.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.480]   You see, you see this so often.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.200]   It's like when you see the Techmoan channel, it's still one of my favorite YouTube channels,
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:32.560]   did a couple of different videos on when compact disc came out and the LP, like the
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.840]   vinyl record industry, tried to match.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:39.600]   Well, if it's the digital sound quality you want, we have this new noise reduction
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.600]   technology.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.480]   We have these records that are encoded with the CX or whatever DX technology.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.640]   And you need to just plug the special box into your turntable, but you're still dealing
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:53.960]   with, okay, so, but you don't understand that one of the clicks in the pops are only one
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.680]   reason why we don't like LPs anymore.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.080]   One of them is that they are freaking huge and you have to flip them over and you can't
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.040]   just switch to one track to another.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.720]   So I'm very happy for you.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:09.000]   I'm glad the engineers that needed jobs got paid to create the standard for you.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.640]   But you, if you're doing a more sophisticated way to make a copy of a key so you don't
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.640]   have to go to the true value hardware store that six miles up your road.
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:23.440]   Okay, I'm glad you got funding for this, but maybe you haven't understood why we're upset
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.720]   with the key industry at this point.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.000]   So this may be a little bit more concerning.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.920]   Familial resemblances may, however, be sufficient.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:39.280]   This is a 10 year old fifth grader, Amar Malek, who was able to unlock his mom's iPhone.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.680]   Actually, if you look at the two of them together, that's not surprising.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.240]   They look a lot alike.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:48.240]   Without any addition, it tells you that under 13, there's problems with...
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.200]   Well, but no, but it's registered to her.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.200]   She's not under 13.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.760]   Yes, but the geometry on his face is probably amorphous enough that it's doing a fuzzy match.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:01.160]   Well, and interestingly, she re-registered her face ID and it stopped doing it for a
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.320]   while.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:07.840]   What apparently made it possible was that as she used it and it trained in bad lighting
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.440]   and other conditions, it got more fuzzy.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:16.440]   More forgiving, and so he was able to unlock it again.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.000]   I mean, if you look at the two of them, they look a lot alike.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.320]   I guess his dad worked once with his dad.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.880]   Look, he unlocked it.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:33.720]   So just something to be aware of.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:40.400]   So Apple said, and I think it was misleading, that touch ID, there's a one in 50,000.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.520]   There's a chance of a false positive of somebody having the same fingerprint as you.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.120]   And there's one in a million with face ID.
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.320]   But that's not really true if there's people who look like you.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.440]   Yeah, one in a million strangers.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.440]   Yes.
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:24:03.080]   The other thing is that one in 30,000 chance, I can't just think of the people who work
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.960]   in my office and think that, "Wow, I never noticed it, but Josh has a fingerprint that
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.560]   looks so much like mine that I bet that I can unlock his phone."
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.800]   But the third time in a month when someone says, "Hey, are you Josh?"
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.000]   I would think, "You know, Josh has an iPhone 10.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.280]   It's worth at least trying."
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.800]   So that's a, but I don't consider this a scandal.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.480]   I think this is part of the education that we're, anybody who uses face ID is going to
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.480]   have to know.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:30.480]   Like again, if you hang out with a brother or a sister and you don't really trust them,
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:36.200]   if they forged their names on checks, perhaps you don't want to, perhaps you want to, you
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.560]   know, remember that trick where you hit the hit the power slash home button several times
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:44.880]   it will disable face ID and require a, require your pin.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:50.480]   Do you think Apple is just done with any other biometric for the time being that the next
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:56.480]   generation or two of iPhones will all be just face ID or is it possible to put touch ID on
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.080]   the back of the phone and?
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.400]   I think that they're going to be all in on face ID.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.440]   I think that they're going to phase it into every phone where they can get enough parts
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.720]   to make it work and where it won't be cost prohibitive.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.480]   So yeah, I think that they really aren't a belt and suspenders type of company.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.840]   I think they're the ones that would, they themselves would think that I, we believe in
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:20.080]   face ID so much that we see no need for touch ID.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:25.880]   And if they thought that face ID were as valuable as a, as a, as a pin code, then they would
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.600]   even replace the pin code with it.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.560]   Ooh, I wouldn't want them to do that.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.560]   It is.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.560]   No, I'm saying it.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:35.120]   But I'm saying that if they felt it were that secure, then I don't think that they would
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.640]   be the one copy that would say, no, you don't, you don't need to have a pass code.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.640]   It's so good.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.240]   Just one drop of blood every 48 hours onto the special sensor.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.240]   And that's all you need to.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:51.360]   I, I, I actually turned off the six digit pass code and turned on a longer pass code
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.520]   for a more security.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.960]   But some, and people got mad at me.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.520]   And I think maybe we talked about this last week.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.560]   I turned off the requires attention feature.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.080]   So I don't have to look at it to unlock it.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.400]   I find that makes it unlock a little bit more easily.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.360]   Is that really somebody said, Apple put all this energy.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:16.080]   It was a funny letter into face ID and you turn off attention.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.080]   What are you?
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.680]   Don't tell people to do that.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.680]   It's an accessibility feature.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:25.320]   If you need or want a wider, a more flexible, wider range of unlock parameters, you can
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.320]   turn it off.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.720]   If you, if you're more worried about security, you don't want somebody just holding it up
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.720]   to your face.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.720]   If they get.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.720]   If they have physical access of your phone, there's a whole range of issues that you
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.720]   not.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.720]   I'm not, I'm not worried about that.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.920]   I don't think that's an issue at all.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.480]   I mean, they had a United Arab.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.400]   I can't unlock it when I'm asleep.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:51.240]   So, well, they had an airline had to land because a woman's husband fell asleep and she put
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.960]   a sleeping finger on her ID.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.960]   It unlocked.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.440]   She found out all this stuff and they had to land.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.640]   I mean, so biometrics, you know, it go to Andy's point.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.640]   It's a convenience.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.640]   It's not a security.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:05.960]   It's that Apple would be right in saying this is the best possible balance of convenience
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.600]   and security.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:12.920]   It's secure enough is a phrase that Steve Gibson might use that, you know, for most people,
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.680]   this is more than Apple security.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.120]   You can turn it off.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.520]   You can have a long, strong pass phrase to open your phone.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.760]   You can also turn it selectively.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.360]   So you can have it if you're worried about your kids getting into your phone, you can
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.040]   turn it off for unlock and put in your passcode, but enable it for everything else inside the
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.040]   phone.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.880]   Or if you don't care about unlock, but you care about iTunes or App Store purchase is
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.880]   you can turn it off for that.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.160]   So you can go through all those little check boxes and choose.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.320]   That actually is a nice feature.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:39.520]   My bank, LastPass, I know one password does, we'll use Face ID just as they used to use
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.800]   Touch ID.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.800]   And that's pretty nice.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.040]   I think that's a very to log into your bank that way is great.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:50.000]   Yeah, that was the first the first time that I set up my bank for Face ID.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.080]   Actually, the only difficulty is that it's that's my money, man.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.080]   Yes, I've got.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.040]   That's where you want to be secure, right?
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.800]   I'm spending I'm spending three or four days like in another city where I'm totally screwed.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:07.960]   If I could clean out and I kind of want I kind of want a complicated process just to
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.000]   give myself self assurance.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.560]   Well, you can always turn on Face ID plus an authenticator code.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:20.160]   Yeah, that's what I do with two factors is really what is really cool is on on iPhone
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.080]   10 with Face ID Apple enables Face ID for auto fill.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.560]   So if you're in an app or you're in Safari, it will auto fill.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:29.800]   I learned by accident, I went to Regina Johannes Dern's review of iPhone 10 and it gave me
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.680]   the Wall Street Journal Challenge page.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.960]   And then I looked at it, it did the little face ID animation filled in my username and
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.440]   password and logged me in.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.440]   I was like, wait, what?
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.440]   How did it do that?
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.920]   Does that mean you have the username and password stored in the in the cloud key chain?
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.920]   Yeah.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:46.520]   So I don't always use iCloud key chain because I dislike that there's no master password.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:50.120]   I don't ever give my phone to somebody and let them type something and then suddenly get
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.120]   my credit cards.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.920]   But for sites like the Wall Street Journal, I really don't care if somebody has access
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.480]   to that once they have my phone.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.840]   So that was just an iCloud key chain.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.320]   And the minute I looked at it, it said, Oh, you're looking at me.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.600]   You must want to see this webpage filled it in and just gave me that webpage.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.200]   I didn't have to I didn't even know what was going on.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.960]   How can you selectively use the key chain to remember passwords?
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.440]   It asks you, do you want to remember this password in key chain when you put it in the
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.440]   first time?
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.120]   So if I use last pass or one password and I fill it in, it'll say, do you want to remember
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.120]   this?
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.120]   And I almost never do.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.880]   I must have turned that off because I don't see that anymore.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.480]   There's probably going to turn that off, right?
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.080]   But there's a bunch of low security sites that I'm really super fun.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.880]   Yeah, that's a perfect use.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:29.240]   I use this I do the bad thing, which is use the same password over and over again for
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:33.520]   those sites because who cares if somebody gets my Wall Street Journal password, but
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.720]   probably that would be a better way to do it.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.720]   I like that.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.440]   Yeah, it does look like passwords go away, which is like the magical thing about face
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:46.120]   idea and I hate using that word magical, but where it is significantly better than
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.480]   type of idea is it really makes you think your password or passcode is gone and you
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.880]   no longer even have to think about it.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:52.880]   And it will challenge you sometimes.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.880]   But when it works as design, you just pick up your phone and it works.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.880]   It's the app.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.880]   You're in.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.880]   You have to swipe up, but you're in.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.880]   I was so used.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.880]   It just fills.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:02.880]   Right.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.200]   And I've gotten so used to swiping up now.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.240]   That is a very it's such an easy one handed gesture.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.880]   It's a very natural thing to do.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:16.480]   In fact, I find all the gestures in the 10 superior, frankly, to the home button on
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.360]   the eight and predecessor.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.880]   I'm still trying to I'm still trying to figure out app switching.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:27.520]   I definitely understand the mechanism, but this seems like frequently I was just using
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.520]   Twitter and I dipped into Chrome for a second and I would expect if I simply swipe to the
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:35.400]   bottom, I'll get back into Twitter, but I'll swipe and then keep swiping and keep swiping
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.000]   and I cannot find Twitter.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   I'll find to finally give up and just relaunch it from the from the from the launcher.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.200]   So maybe I still have some stuff to learn.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.280]   Stack order changes.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.600]   So if you if you're in one app and you swipe sideways, you'll go to the previous app and
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.040]   you swipe back, you'll go to the app you were at before you swipe.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:57.080]   But if you do if you wait, I think it's three seconds or you do any interaction, then that
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:00.080]   becomes the active app and the other apps are stacked behind that.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.240]   And that bit of logic, some people, it makes sense to.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:07.120]   I think like command tab makes sense to some people, but other people just want object
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.280]   permanency where they know that these apps are always right in this.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.280]   Always little apps.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.800]   Well, I've been finding that some apps just get lost.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.640]   It's like I can't find them anywhere.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:20.000]   And this is this is an app that I was just using like a minute ago.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.240]   This is and I don't I've never had that problem with the Android app switcher.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.720]   So I don't know what the deal is.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:30.080]   We are dealing with a new mechanism that replaces something I've been using for several years.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:35.840]   So I can't testify to how much it is just my brain versus versus the technology itself.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.480]   No, but that's a I think an excellent point.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:45.280]   Well, in general, I feel like the gestures are intuitive, easy to learn and very easy
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.320]   to modify your brain.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:51.240]   There probably are some pain points for for people you've found a pain point.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.720]   So it's probably worth covering.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.920]   There are maybe some issues here and there.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:01.640]   My big issue is it's frustrating with apps that don't yet understand the iPhone 10 and
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:08.200]   put controls in a difficult to reach or inaccessible place up by the notch or down in the bottom
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:12.280]   or it's or it's obscured by like Instagram wiping out it's wiping out of a story is now
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.600]   the same as wiping out.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.560]   Those things will I'm sure in time be fixed, but you're going to run into a few apps that
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:22.400]   just like are baffled by this new phone.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:27.240]   That's not just exclusive to the iPhone 10 to a big change, especially to something that
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.720]   is productivity related is going to be a major pain point.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:36.360]   I do think that the changes made an iPhone 11 for the iPad for productivity are huge and
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.800]   they're definitely a big, big step forward.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:44.360]   But I still wish that that the slide over worked the way it always did.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:49.720]   Because I'm still a cook because they're oftentimes when I use when you slide over it is because
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:53.680]   I've got a main task in front of me and I just want to check something with the Google
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.280]   app or I just want to check a time on them on the maps app or something like that where
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:02.400]   and I like the fact that I could simply swipe over and then swipe down and here's a scrolling
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.440]   list of all the apps that are installed.
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:11.440]   Whereas I have to now I have to expose the file launcher and drag an icon from down there
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:17.120]   to over there, wait to make sure that it pops up in the way that I expected to pop up and
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.440]   then let go of it, which is not kind of takes me out of my flow a little bit.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.720]   There is some people were so confused.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.720]   They just thought it was gone.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.040]   They just thought that all the side by side apps were absolutely gone and they couldn't
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.040]   figure it out.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.040]   No, in fact, I didn't know.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:36.320]   And when Megan told me that I could just swipe at the bottom, yeah, that is the best,
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.320]   frankly.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.520]   I'd far prefer that than force touch or anything.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.800]   I mean, that's just a natural way.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:46.960]   In fact, maybe it's natural for me because I use workspaces on the Macintosh and I do
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.880]   control arrow all the time.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.640]   I make everything full screen and I just control arrow between the applications.
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.640]   So it just feels like a very natural.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.440]   For if you're at WebOS, they had that whole gesture area that will.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.440]   You love that WebOS.
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.440]   I did.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.440]   I did.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.080]   I didn't use it long enough to have it in my brain.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.000]   You keep trying to swipe on your LG TV.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.400]   You like WebOS so much.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.400]   Well, no, I mean, like the Blackberry playbook did it too, but I think that's an even smaller
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.680]   user base than WebOS.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:21.400]   Mark Gurman says that in 2019, not next generation, but the 2019 iPhone will have some sort of,
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:25.120]   you know, notch style sensors on the back.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.280]   That's really where they need to be for augmented reality.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:34.320]   He says that instead of the connect stuff, and I use that the Microsoft connect for the
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:39.880]   notch K-I-N-E-C-T because it's roughly the same sensors instead of an Apple did by the
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.560]   company that made it for Microsoft PrimeSense.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.840]   But instead of that, they're going to use a time of flight sensor system, which is a
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:51.840]   3D sensor system that maps the world based on how long it takes light to bounce off of
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.280]   stuff.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.280]   Because what you want, I think, for a rear-facing AR.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.280]   Rear-facing AR.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.280]   I know.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.280]   What does Tango, what does Google use with this project?
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.280]   I think it's similar.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.280]   I think they're using similar.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:06.360]   There's kind of a standard way of doing it.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:10.080]   It's more of a connect sort of system.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.640]   It has greater precision.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:16.400]   It can do things like figure out absolute distances without having to have a scale associated
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.400]   with it.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:22.840]   That's one of the, I wouldn't call it a limitation, but that's one of the missing features of
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:27.240]   Apple ARKit because I'm going to be moving into a new office soon.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:32.160]   And it kind of made me realize that how cool it would be to just be able to take measurements
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:39.640]   just by taking a picture of my desk back in my existing office and then be able to go
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.920]   into this new office and then just get a go or no go.
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:43.920]   Will it fit in that corner?
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.920]   Yep.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.920]   Here we go.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.920]   It'll fit.
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:52.480]   I think that Apple is still focusing on it just for...
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:58.600]   Let's call it recreational augmented reality and to enhance photography.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:05.920]   I think that the year 2000 vision of the future applications of it, that's next phase stuff.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.640]   That might be you have to wait until 2020.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:13.640]   According to German, Apple's talking to the companies that make time of flight sensors
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:18.280]   like Infineon, Sony, ST microelectronics, and Panasonic.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.560]   I think one of our sponsors...
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.560]   Infineon, I think it was Intel, right?
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.560]   Oh.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.560]   They're working on one thing.
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:25.560]   Interesting.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:29.200]   This lighthouse behind us has a time of flight sensor.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:34.280]   I think from ST microelectronics, as I remember, which said Dutch, I think a Dutch company.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.440]   But that's kind of a cool technology.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.600]   It's like LIDAR, but it's not 360.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.360]   Apple uses it already.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.920]   Like the Unwalk with Apple Watch uses time of flight to make sure no one's doing a replay
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:48.240]   attack halfway between you and your computer in another room.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.800]   No, they'll measure the time of flight for the signal from your watch.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.800]   Wow.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:52.800]   So then it can't be.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.440]   And if you're looking in between you and the watch with a Bluetooth retransmitter, they
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.080]   can't crowd the signal off your watch pass over to your computer.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.080]   Wow.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.080]   I did not know that.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.080]   That is awesome.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.080]   Yeah, there's a lot of cool tech in that stuff.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.080]   Talk about over-engineered.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.880]   That's amazing.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:11.040]   You know, cars should do that because that's a real problem with the transmitters unlocking
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.280]   cars that have the push button keys.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.560]   Huh.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.680]   That's a smart move.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.680]   That's a smart move.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:19.680]   They know what they're saying.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.760]   You know what's great is if you get a bunch of really good engineers.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:26.000]   You pay them fantastically well.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.280]   And then you say, you know, come up with some stuff.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.400]   That's funny because you can just picture Craig walking through the hallway and the
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.720]   engineers, when he, okay, send the picture to his phone.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.320]   We'll see if we can get it.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:43.880]   Actually the new tax bill, the one the Senate's looking at, will eliminate or at least make
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:48.800]   it very difficult for companies to bonus people like that with stock options because
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:53.640]   they will be taxed on their stock options as soon as they vest, which instead of as
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:57.840]   soon as they sell, which is the current law, and that, a lot of people are very worried
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.760]   that that's going to make it very hard to hire good people in Silicon Valley.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:05.160]   Unless they invest it in real estate or golf courses is my understanding.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.360]   If you're in golf courses, you're in great shape.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.360]   You're golden.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.360]   You're golden.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.360]   You're going to get stuck.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.320]   Everyone's going to get bonuses in golf course timeshairs.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.320]   Let's take a break.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.320]   We're going to have more.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.840]   We've got lots to talk about and we've got some great people here to do it.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.280]   Renee Richie from iMore.com Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.880]   I want to play with the Apple clips app in the second.
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:28.880]   That's fun, isn't it?
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.640]   Oh man, that's impressive.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.880]   They replaced, I'm glad they, you know, they were smart in the timing because they came
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:39.760]   out one week after the 10 so that people could use an emoji for a week and then stop.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.320]   Just stop it.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.400]   Now everybody's in the Millennium Falcons.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.160]   Yeah, stop it.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.400]   Then next week they can do something else.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.400]   Our show today brought to you.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.640]   We got a brand new sponsor, but something I've been using now in our bedroom for a couple
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.040]   of months and love.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:04.920]   It's a air purifier, but it is a state of the art way beyond anything that you've ever
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.920]   used before.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.160]   I've tried them all.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.480]   We live in the country.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.480]   There's a lot of pollen.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.320]   There's dust in the air.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.320]   There's allergies.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.200]   A couple of weeks ago.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:21.680]   I had a lot of fire smoke in the air, but HEPA filters, which is what most of these are,
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.360]   don't really do a very good job.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:28.760]   They can filter out large particles, but the problem is a lot of the stuff that you don't
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:33.880]   want to breathe are very tiny volatile organic compounds.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:39.600]   You know, the stuff from like paint drying that really are bad for you and they pass
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:42.640]   right through because the molecules are so small in HEPA filters.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:50.720]   So aptly named, here comes Molecule patented technology that I can testify really works.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.480]   Lisa used to wake up every morning congested with a headache from the pollen on the hillside.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:40:00.320]   As soon as we put the molecule in the bedroom, she says, "I haven't had a headache since."
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:05.600]   I accidentally turned off the Molecule a couple of days ago and she said, "Did you do something?"
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.320]   She got a headache.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.600]   I said, "Well, yeah, I went and I turned it off."
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:13.000]   This replaces 50 years of antiquated air purification technology.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.920]   The HEPA filter was invented in the 40s and that's what most people are still using.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:26.560]   Molecule uses Pico, photo electrochemical oxidation that captures and eliminates tiny molecules
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.200]   like allergens.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.560]   By the way, what you worried about black mold?
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.760]   HEPA filter won't stop it, but the Molecule will.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:39.560]   Bacteria, viruses, VOCs in the air, pollutants, a thousand times smaller than a HEPA filter.
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:43.200]   They've got a catalytic membrane in.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:48.840]   They've got a refilter plus a catalytic membrane in there that the tiny molecules are here
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:53.280]   to and then they have a light in it, which is really cool because you can see a blue
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.960]   light coming off of it, that oxidizes them and makes them disappear.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:03.160]   If you've got asthma, allergies, symptoms of any kind, you're going to be able to breathe
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.080]   through your nose for the first time in years.
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:12.080]   I'm telling you, funded by the EPA initially, third party tested University of South Florida's
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:17.920]   Center for Biological Defense, University of Minnesota's Particle Calibration Laboratory.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:23.440]   The guys who invented this are geniuses and I love it because it ties to your phone and
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:26.680]   just completely controlled by your smartphone.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.120]   M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.880]   It's also beautiful, really gorgeous design.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.520]   It does have a handle on it so it's easy to move around.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:40.320]   One of the cool things about the molecule app, it's monitoring your molecule.
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:45.480]   It knows when you need new filters and will automatically send you filters when you need
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.480]   them.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.720]   Here, look, this is my molecule.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:48.920]   I'm connecting to my device.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:52.400]   You can connect over the internet, so even though the molecule's at home, you can turn
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.800]   it off, you can silence it, you can boost it.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:42:00.440]   You can see here that my pre-filter has 78% depleted my nanofilter.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:03.480]   That's the one that gets the tiny molecules, 93%.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:07.760]   They will automatically send me a new filter when it's done.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:14.640]   There's a little problem with the phone and I should tell you ahead of time that the app
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:20.640]   will see 5 GHz Wi-Fi, but the molecule can't use it.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.760]   It will pair it to the Wi-Fi and then it won't, your app won't talk.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.560]   You can still control the molecule from the top of it.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.480]   Everything it can do.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:33.720]   My suggestion is, pair it to your 2.4 GHz network, not your 5 GHz network.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.520]   Once I figured that out and I did, it worked fine.
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:40.440]   You'll see a lot of reviews of the app in the app store saying that.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.440]   People were having problems.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.440]   That's what that was.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.600]   You got to pair it to 2.4.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:48.880]   The next generation of molecules, once they start the second generation of manufacture,
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.520]   that'll be fixed.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:52.200]   Nevertheless, I just wanted to let you know about it.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.440]   Once you pair it to a 2.4 GHz network, it's fantastic.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.840]   You could turn it on or off, you could have schedules for the light because the light
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:06.040]   is what oxidizes those micro-molecules.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.120]   You might want to have the light go off at night.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.440]   We do because we don't like a light in the bedroom.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.440]   You could have that.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:16.720]   You could say, "Don't do that oxidation thing in the middle of the night."
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.360]   You tell it how big the space is.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.720]   It really is amazing.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.720]   This thing is incredible.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.520]   I want you to check it out.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:26.280]   They told me they were going to give you your first year of Filters Free, which is really
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.440]   nice and $75 off your first order.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:31.440]   Go to Molecule.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.080]   M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E.com.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.320]   Read up on this amazing technology.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:43.080]   If you have kids with asthma, if you have allergies, if there is stuff in the inside
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:48.800]   areas, if you have a sick house or a sick office, a lot of offices you can't open the
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.040]   window, you need a molecule.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:55.360]   M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E.com and the offer code is MACBreak.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:01.520]   I told these guys at Molecule, I said, "I think you've got the right podcast because
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.560]   these people are technical.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:07.280]   They will understand the difference and why it's worth it to get a Molecule."
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.760]   I'll tell you.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:14.280]   I want to get one for the studio, John, because we have all sorts of chemicals flowing.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.280]   I'm sorry, guys.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.120]   We have chemicals flowing through the air in here.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.880]   I really want to clean it up.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:19.880]   Molecule.
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:20.880]   I can't afford you.
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:25.440]   It is fantastic.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:31.000]   Somebody says, "Oh, you mean it's collecting data about my emissions and sending them
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   the back?"
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   No, it's not.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.040]   You can turn that feature off.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:40.080]   If you don't want to use the phone and have it automatically send you filters because
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:44.640]   you need a lot of burritos, you can turn that off and just do it manually.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.160]   You don't have to do that.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.640]   You can operate it just like a regular.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.080]   Oh, it's about to guess again, really.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.840]   I happen to like that feature.
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:52.840]   I'm just saying.
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:53.840]   Oh, really?
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:54.840]   Hello.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:55.840]   You have to device.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:59.960]   Did the dog do that?
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.960]   That's the next generation.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.760]   All right.
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:05.600]   Let's talk about clips.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.040]   This is really cool.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:14.840]   I hope Apple obviously wants to release apps that are going to use the new Face ID notch
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.200]   cameras.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:20.320]   I hope that Snapchat will update and lots of others.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:23.120]   This clip-sap has been updated and you're only going to be able to take advantage of
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.920]   this if you have an iPhone X.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.880]   The clip-sap to me was a little video editor.
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.320]   You can add stuff.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.680]   The only cool thing that it did originally was you could dictate.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:38.080]   It would put those subtitles on there.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.720]   But now with these scenes, it makes me want to do all sorts of videos.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.200]   Let me show you here.
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.840]   I have to use my iPhone X. I apologize for this small camera.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.200]   But a couple of things you immediately see.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:52.840]   First of all, I am now in Hong Kong.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:53.840]   It knows about my microphone.
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:54.840]   I don't know why.
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:55.840]   I think it's probably-
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:56.840]   That's like Blade Runner to me.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:57.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.120]   It kind of is, isn't it?
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.160]   And I can't really show you because-
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.160]   It is 3D.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.160]   It's totally 3D.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.480]   It's so wild.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:11.560]   You can rotate around and it'll-but it also modifies what's really cool.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:17.520]   This is really more of a demonstration of how cool the A11 Bionic processor is.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:21.640]   In real time, I'm now in the Millennium Falcon.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:25.840]   It's interlacing and making me blue, so I look like Princess Leia on the R2 unit.
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:28.400]   There's a holo chessboard somewhere next to you.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.400]   You can, yes.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:30.720]   Yeah, if I could turn it around.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.820]   This is amazing.
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:38.640]   So this is the kind of rotoscoping that takes years to do in Hollywood.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.520]   The A11 is doing it in real time.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.520]   As I talk, I'm in Paris.
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.520]   There's the arc that's going on.
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.200]   You can't really see it because it's behind me.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.200]   But this is, I think this is really amazing.
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.200]   There's 8-bit.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:54.040]   Here's the cherry blossoms.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.680]   And by the way, you can apply these effects afterwards as well.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:01.280]   You can change the effects, which I thought was really amazing.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.280]   Anything to say?
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.280]   Wow, everybody should get it.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.280]   It's not-
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:08.160]   What's really cool about this is when I first started hearing rumors about portrait lighting,
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.160]   it was-
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.160]   I was trying to figure out what Apple would do.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.960]   And for a while, Apple's been trying to take DSLR features.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:17.160]   And while it can't reproduce everything that a real camera, a really big sensor or a really
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:20.960]   good glass can do, they want to be able to give you at least emotionally the sort of-
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.200]   Some of those features.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:25.880]   So portrait mode would give you the depth effect, the bouquet look, and you could get,
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:29.600]   you know, the blurred background that a lot of people liked in portrait photography.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.400]   And now portrait lighting, which is still in beta, is trying to give you those lighting
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.400]   effects.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:37.560]   So whether it's studio lighting or stage lighting, it wants to try to do what you were traditionally
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:41.240]   doing in a studio with light boxes and bouncers and all these sorts of things.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.720]   And I was trying to think, what would be next?
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:46.360]   And one of the easiest things to contemplate was portrait backgrounds, where you'd either
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:50.280]   have the equivalent of a matte or a digital green screen effect, that you take the kids
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.840]   for their school photos and they stand in front of a fake background or a green screen
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:56.640]   and they put in backgrounds, but doing that in real time.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:00.200]   And they didn't wait until IOS 12, they put that right into clips and they did it with
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.400]   video.
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:05.000]   And there's some things in there, like they have also some filters like watercolor and
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.520]   then graphite and they're doing, they basically found images that had that effect and they
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.520]   machine learned them.
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.880]   They said, we want people to look like this painting.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:17.760]   And then they did the usual machine learning, yes, no, yes, no, no, no, yes, no, yes, no.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:23.080]   And it learned in real time to study the scene and apply that, that sort of effect to it.
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:28.760]   So you're getting like this real time machine learned process video, like apply to it.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:29.920]   And it's really great for people.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.680]   Like I want to make a video log, but I have this crappy background behind me and I can't
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:34.680]   really build a studio.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.400]   I go outside, it looks like garbage.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:40.760]   Now you can do it from like a galactic background or something and maybe you're in your watch
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.280]   room because it's quiet in there.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.280]   You don't know.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.000]   And you can make these really cool little videos.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.080]   Yeah, we've seen these before.
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:52.280]   I mean, every camera, you know, when you get a webcam does something like this and it's
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:55.720]   not perfect, you know, it's not perfect keying, but it's pretty amazing.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:58.400]   And this is another thing I found out.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.120]   By the way, somebody was asking, can you do it in landscape mode?
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.480]   Yeah, it works in landscape mode.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.120]   If you cover the face ID, you disappear.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.160]   So you can make yourself kind of slowly appear.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:12.400]   If you had netting or something, you could have some fun with that.
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:18.360]   Yeah, I'm just, this is obviously a technology demonstration kind of a show off, but I love
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:19.360]   it.
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.240]   I mean, I think this really shows you there's a lot more that this is capable of.
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.800]   And I look forward to third parties taking advantage of this.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:28.040]   The biggest problem they have is that they don't, like Apple still looks at clips like
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.040]   an app.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:32.080]   It's software that the update, I mean, they did clips 1.0 last year.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.440]   And then 1.2 then 2.0.
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:36.040]   So you got these effects, but you're going to have these effects.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.040]   Everyone will use them for a week.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.760]   And then they'll be like, okay, I've used them.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:42.760]   Where Snapchat and Instagram are changing live effects, they choose like a service and it's
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:44.800]   updated every week, if not every day.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.800]   So it's all I got cat years today.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.920]   I got dog years tomorrow, but it's different.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:51.320]   And clips still isn't at the speed of an internet service.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.320]   I don't think.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:55.320]   Well, it's also, well, just imagine Snapchat.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:57.800]   It's, this is a sort of stuff that's a wonderful ambassador.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:02.880]   It's a wonderful promotional thing just for the iPhone in general or the iPhone 10 where
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:10.360]   people, how many times have I downloaded a new photo app because I suddenly see people
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.360]   posting awesome pictures in Instagram.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.360]   Right.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:14.360]   Exactly.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.880]   And so people will say, wow, how did you turn yourself into a cartoon on the surface
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:18.880]   of the moon?
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.160]   Say, oh, well, that's a, that's an app on my iPhone 10.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.160]   Wow.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.160]   Is that working my iPhone six?
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.160]   Like, no, you need the iPhone 10.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.160]   Okay.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.160]   I need the iPhone 10.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:35.280]   And the other thing I found out just today on iOS today, the HEIF, the high efficiency
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:40.600]   image format that the iPhone eight and the 10 are using stores so much information that
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:47.360]   you can retro actively change portrait mode and stuff on, not even on the iPhone eight
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:49.920]   or iPhone 10 on any, this is my iPad.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:54.480]   And you see with something that was shot with portrait mode, I still have access to
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:58.600]   all the portrait mode features because he or what do you, how do you pronounce it?
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.560]   He, he, so saves all that information.
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:04.240]   Apple is sort of cheats with the JPEG.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:08.320]   If you, if you still use JPEG, they'll put the portrait mode, the depth data into the
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:09.520]   JPEG header.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.000]   But what you can do with HEIF is that you get exactly what you're showing there.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   You can do all the lighting effects and you get the live, live photos is editable.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.320]   So you can do those bounce effects and the loop effects and the, the slow shutter.
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:24.640]   Because it's all there, they're saving them the raw data plus modifications.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.640]   That's pretty incredible.
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.640]   Right.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:30.440]   I wonder why they don't do that on every single photo, whether you've got it enabled or not.
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.160]   My understanding is that it works.
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.160]   That's true.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:38.160]   If you have enabled portrait mode, if you haven't enabled portrait mode, then it will just simply
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.640]   take a regular shot as usual.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.640]   Oh, interesting.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.640]   It's slow.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.880]   It's like old HDR is the compute is so intensive that it doesn't want to do it unless you
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:45.880]   ask for it.
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:50.640]   Or, but, but if, if it doesn't do the compute, like even if you just simply said, it's not
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.920]   going to do the compute is simply going to, it's something going to collect, like, like
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.520]   a raw is going to collect all the information you would need.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:00.520]   So that later on on another iOS device, you can say, well, what would have that look,
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:03.920]   what would that have looked like in portrait lighting or what would have looked like with
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.920]   the different facts?
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:07.880]   So is it, is it collecting all that information?
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.560]   Even if you're not in portrait mode?
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.560]   Not yet.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.560]   Okay.
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:17.600]   Well, it's, it's using the information is just not because, because whether you've got
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:22.720]   portrait mode on or not, it's using depth sensors to at least inform it on what the, what the
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.720]   exposure should be.
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.080]   It could store that in the heave image.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:31.560]   I'm speaking and I want to make sure I say I'm speaking out of ignorance here.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:33.640]   But I say, I don't, I don't know why they don't do that.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:34.640]   I'm not saying they should.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.480]   I'm saying that I don't know why they don't do that.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:40.760]   And I imagine there must be a either a with, with Apple, if they didn't do something, there's
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:45.960]   either a really strong technical reason why or be they just didn't have the time or they
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.840]   didn't have enough staff to make that happen.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.160]   And it's on a whiteboard somewhere.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.160]   Although.
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.600]   I understand that it's purely technical.
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:55.600]   It's the same way that HDR used to be an option because it would need to take those three
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.480]   photos and it would be like a half a second longer.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:02.160]   And now it's just HDR is always on because the processors are so fast that it's invisible
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:06.520]   that the, to capture all that depth data still take, you take it to chunk, it's better
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:10.680]   just being to do, do, do, do, do, do, and it's just a little bit longer than what they want.
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.040]   That's one of the few steps backward.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:16.400]   I think that Apple made for this new release that it's not that HDR is always on.
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.400]   It's odd.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:22.760]   It's that auto HDR is always on so that whereas before if you took a picture and you just realize
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:24.600]   it, wow, it really blew.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.240]   I don't know why it really blew up the highlights on that.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:32.240]   You could then go in and turn on HDR on, not auto, but on and it would definitely try
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.480]   to try to do HDR.
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:38.880]   You have to go back into camera settings and flip a switch to turn it, turn it to automatic,
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:43.720]   from automatic to back to like a regular turn on turn off feature.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:49.640]   That's the one, the one, the one consistent time situation in which the iPhone 10 and
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:55.360]   the iPhone 8 has been, have been taking bad pictures are again instances which I was really
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:54:00.840]   super surprised it didn't decide to HDR something and wasn't even to me, it wasn't even a close
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:01.840]   call.
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.440]   It was, no, you obviously you've got a white one.
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.520]   You've got a wall behind you where the sunlight is coming in.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.640]   You've got a foreground that's nothing but shadow.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:10.800]   This should not be a big wall of white pixels behind that.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.320]   There should be some detail there.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:13.320]   You've done this.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:19.200]   I think Mashable took the images from every iPhone.
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:25.040]   Here's, here's Lance, you went off in going all the way back to the 3G to the 10 and showed
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.760]   how these images have changed.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:31.640]   But the real problem and a number of people on Twitter have pointed this out is the selfie
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:36.360]   camera is too accurate.
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:44.680]   Unless you're a movie star or Kim Kardashian, this guy GQ Geo said you need a whole facial
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:49.480]   and moisturizing routine along with a spa day before you take a photo on that iPhone
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:50.960]   10.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:53.680]   It is, it's, I just put a fast lean on the lens like the old days.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:55.240]   It's too good.
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.720]   It's too detailed.
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.520]   I don't like it.
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:02.960]   Apple made a deal to say they could actually call that video effect the Ken Burns effect.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:06.880]   They should basically give some money to Kim Kardashian, say maybe the Kardashian effect
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:09.680]   where no, we know you don't look anything like this.
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.360]   We smooth that every single blemish.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:17.520]   We decided to make it, to get the pores on your nose so that they're not quite so, so
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.320]   easy to see.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:24.400]   People have a, people have a certain standard for selfie pictures that the back, they want
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:29.240]   nothing but accuracy on the, on the rear facing camera that shoots landscapes.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:33.440]   They want no accuracy whatsoever on the camera that's so, that shoots so.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:37.280]   They need a machine learned portrait mode that makes you look like Kim as much as possible
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.680]   with every selfie shot.
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:45.040]   It's so funny because I, there, that's the biggest difference in the cameras.
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:46.360]   It's not the rear camera.
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:49.000]   It's the front facing camera with selfies.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.760]   It's a damn accurate.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:58.280]   But I don't know, I have cameras with better, you know, selfie cams.
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:55:59.800]   And I never had this problem.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:01.200]   They're just too good.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:04.440]   So I'm going to start bringing a little jar of Vaseline around with this.
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:05.440]   Yes.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:06.440]   Vaseline of that.
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:08.800]   Smudge the lens a little bit.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:09.880]   It's terrible.
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:10.880]   It's terrible.
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.880]   I'm ready for my fit.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:12.880]   My ep, my ep, my ep.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:15.120]   And by the way, the sibble shipper, the moonlighting effect for something.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:16.120]   I do.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.120]   Yes.
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.360]   She was always in some blurry thing.
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:20.360]   By the way, it's only going to get better.
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:28.080]   Apple has acquired on Thursday TechCrunch reported a sensor startup called Envisage Technologies,
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:33.840]   which specializes in making small sensors do a better job.
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:34.840]   Yes.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:37.240]   So it's going to get even better.
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:38.240]   Oh, boy.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.880]   That's worth, that's worth, that's worth all headed.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:44.480]   If you're worried about how the selfie can't work, that's something that can now change
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:45.480]   in software.
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:50.560]   If there used to be limitations, you absolutely could not get around because of the lens and
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.280]   limitations of the sensor.
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:56.040]   Now it's like if there's any characteristic that you don't like about how this camera
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:01.560]   performs, there's a good chance you can mitigate it with software and with the computing power
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:05.640]   that's inside the iPhone or pretty much any other premium smartphone, really, that you
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:10.760]   can make photons bend to your will as opposed to bent to the laws of physics.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:11.760]   You are green laughter.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:15.960]   Envisage is technologies called Quantum Film.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:22.000]   And it's actually, get this, a photosensitive layer that goes on the lens.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.880]   This is from their own website.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:28.680]   They relies on their newly invented class of materials to absorb light.
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:34.000]   It's quantum dots, nanoparticles that can be dispersed to form or grid once they're synthesized,
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.640]   just like paint, this dispersion of solid materials can be coated onto a substrate, allowed to
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.800]   dry.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:49.000]   This is on your lens and then it improves light sensitivity.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:54.840]   So it gives you better results in low light and it gives a sensor, even an inadequate sensor,
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:55.840]   more detail.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:00.160]   Well, it has the word quantum in there.
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.160]   It's got to be good.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.160]   That's right.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.160]   I believe it's got to be.
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:04.160]   But does it have a sport drive?
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:07.120]   Does it have a sport drive?
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:08.120]   It's wild.
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:11.760]   And we are living in interesting times.
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.000]   That's all I can say.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.640]   And I love it that there's a company that's so freakin' rich.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:19.240]   Yeah, hey, you know what?
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:21.000]   Don't pay those taxes, Apple.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.920]   You're using it all that money better anyway.
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:24.920]   Keep buying cool technology.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:32.040]   They're so freakin' rich that they could just push the envelope so far in computational
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:35.280]   photography and a lot of other things.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:41.320]   I do feel like having looked at the images now on the Pixel versus the iPhone, and I see
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:49.760]   some of this in what they're showing on the Mashable page, that the newer iPhone kind
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:53.880]   of tilts things in a little bit.
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:55.040]   It's doing stuff.
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:56.800]   It's not exactly accurate.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.160]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:02.600]   Would you agree, Renee, when you look at the images coming out of the iPhone 10, they're
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:03.600]   better.
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:04.600]   They're more pleasing.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:08.920]   Yeah, so they have a philosophical thing where they never wanted to give you, because
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:09.920]   the showroom feel.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:14.160]   Some companies want to crush the blacks and boost the sat and give you a mainstream appealing
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:15.160]   photo.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.640]   And Apple never wanted that, but they didn't want to do a harsh reality either.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:21.160]   They always, their goal, and they shoot, they're gonna have a team like 200-some people
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:23.280]   now and they shoot edge case photos all day.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:27.560]   They wanted to give you what you felt you were looking at was their goal.
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:31.520]   It's a natural photo that matched your expectation when you took it.
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:35.800]   And that's a really weird target to aim for, and it's sort of, it's not over saturated
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:40.240]   or boosted, but it's not as grim as it could be if it was trying to do a one-to-one tone
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.240]   mapping.
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:45.840]   In fact, sometimes the pixel photos do look a little kind of desaturated in a grim.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:49.200]   Here, this though, you can see Apple actually doing this.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:52.320]   This is a close-up of the Mashable shots.
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:54.360]   The one on the far left is the oldest.
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:56.320]   It's the original iPhone.
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:57.960]   And that may be the more natural color.
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.960]   You see how warm it suddenly got in the 3GS.
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.680]   And then Apple said, "Yeah, no.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.680]   Let's go.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.680]   Let's back that off."
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.840]   So that was a big change, right?
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:10.840]   And then you can see them, now they've kind of settled on color balance because it doesn't
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.480]   change so much.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:15.680]   It's detail now that's getting better and better.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:20.280]   And you can see it mostly in like the lighted, probably the best place to look is the lighted
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:25.280]   windows in the building and the foreground as you can see more and more detail through
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.280]   those windows.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.280]   It's interesting.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.280]   And it's all compromised.
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:31.320]   But when you're talking to some of the photo engineers, there are things they could do.
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:35.480]   And we've seen like HTC especially has been really good at experimenting with this stuff.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:39.480]   If you drop the aperture, you gain this light, but you also get this distortion.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:42.760]   If you boost this other parameter, you might get this, but you also get that.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:46.920]   And I think both Apple and Samsung and Google even with the Pixel, they've made the best
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:47.920]   compromises.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.440]   Like they have a good aperture.
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:52.120]   It's not the most you could go to, but it avoids a lot of distortion.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:56.840]   They have a really good accuracy and megapixel range, but it's not so much that they're using
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:59.560]   tiny little pixels and chopping up the sensor too much.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.920]   So they're all making sort of intelligent choices now.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:08.640]   If you look at the detail in the brick on the six S and then the six plus, you know, by
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:12.960]   the time they got to the seven, especially the seven plus, they got the detail down.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.200]   Now they're tweaking colors and things like that.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.760]   It's very interesting to watch.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.760]   These are all 12 megas.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.760]   Textures.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.760]   Textures are the thing.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.160]   And the color of the sky feels more accurate.
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:30.380]   It's not that's, it feels like that's either early morning or late evening where the, you
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:35.020]   got the sunrise or sunset sort of painting the Empire State building there.
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:36.880]   That wouldn't be a piercing blue sky.
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.520]   It would be sort of a faded blue sky.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:46.080]   But look at, for instance, look at the, the spire on one, one, the world, the, the, how
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.840]   the color is changed.
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.200]   Maybe it's changing color actually.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.200]   Maybe it's changing color.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.200]   I don't know.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.180]   Like the, the, the, the blue on the 10 and it.
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.180]   This is like that.
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:59.960]   That could be incidental due to a due to what the process was doing.
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:04.120]   There's, there's only, there are two things that seem to hold true with almost every,
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.240]   with every iPhone camera that I've tried.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:15.440]   Number one is that it doesn't like it will do whatever it can to not drop down, not increase
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.480]   the ISO rating to not make the crank up the power to the, to the image sensor to make it
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:24.760]   more light sensitive, which means that if there's a subject that's moving around really
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:28.880]   fast, it's not the iPhone, if you're testing three or four different phones is not the
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.280]   one that's going to get a nice clear shot of that, of that subject because it doesn't
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:39.520]   want to, it would rather have a slow shutter speed and a low ISO than boost up the ISO
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.160]   to get a faster shutter speed.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:45.480]   The other thing is that, and this has been more true of the past two or three iPhones is
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:50.200]   that it doesn't seem to be very afraid of a blown highlights.
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:57.000]   It seems as though, if I, I don't know whether it's the way that Android phones process HDR,
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.880]   whether they're more adept at it, the way that I test phones is that if there's a HDR
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:05.040]   feature, I leave it on auto so it will choose whatever it wants to do.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:10.520]   But even when I, even whether when I have got HDR enabled on the iPhone, the number of
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.720]   blown, blown highlights is usually a lot more noticeable.
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:14.720]   Yes.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:20.180]   And sometimes, and that's, that's, that's hard to avoid in any camera, but I feel as though
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:23.760]   Apple, they have no fear of that.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:28.280]   And where there's a blown highlight, it's a really noticeable blown highlight where it's
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:31.600]   not, oh, look, there's a glint of light coming off of this surface.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:36.120]   It's no, here is a section of this digital photo in which there are no pixels whatsoever
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.660]   recorded.
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:42.040]   And that's a, that's a big problem, especially when you try to go and get an Instagram and
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.040]   slide.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:46.920]   Yeah, it's, for a fact, when the eight plus photo, look at the look at her forehead, the
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:53.380]   highlights of her forehead, there, those are blowouts, the eight plus on the iPhone 10,
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:57.340]   those are blowouts there in the eight plus, at least there's some image data there.
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:03.060]   You can see it's a less problem on the seven plus, but on the 10, that to me is a, that
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:04.940]   I was, I was going to say a big problem.
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:09.780]   I think that it's more accurate to simply say, that's really unfortunate because that's
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:13.340]   something that your eye gets just drawn completely to that.
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:16.780]   And it's actually, for all I know, it looks like she's tilting her head a little further.
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:17.960]   But maybe that's the problem.
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:22.520]   These are, it's very hard to get apples to apples and these kinds of things, control
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:23.520]   these.
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.760]   But still the iPhone 10 photo shows what I'm talking about.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:30.600]   If there, I don't, it's not, I don't expect to see that kind of blown highlights in Android
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.840]   pictures, whether this is using HDR or not.
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:38.560]   It's really, you know, and skin tones vary the variation in skin tones over time and stuff.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:44.320]   I think it's, this is, I would love to see somebody like DXOMark do this in a controlled
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:48.980]   way so that we can really look at it because it's clear that apple is constantly tweaking
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:49.980]   this.
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:50.980]   And I'm sure everybody is.
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:55.160]   I'm sure Google's doing the same thing with their pixels and looking to get it more accurate.
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:05:01.900]   This is a piece that appeared on Halloween and Mashable and it's very, it's, you know,
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:04.960]   at least you can look at it yourself and be the judge.
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.800]   But I find that fascinating.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:10.720]   But once again, remember that we're, we're the people that review these things.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:11.720]   This is pixel peeping.
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.920]   This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.280]   And this is, this is what, and this is what we're being paid to do.
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.720]   Regrated notice these things.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:25.400]   However, most of the biggest difference between a camera, a $1,000 camera phone and a $600
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:30.360]   camera is that the person who uses the camera is expecting perfection every single time.
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.840]   They really are out to get the best picture possible.
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:37.360]   Whereas, and this is not a slight whatsoever towards the phone camera operator.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.360]   They just want a snapshot.
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:42.880]   They want a picture of their mom holding their holding their, their two year old and
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.400]   their new infant, grandchildren together.
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:49.720]   It doesn't really matter so much if there is a blown highlight on her forehead or if
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.440]   there is a little bit of noise in the background.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:53.440]   It's just a snapshot.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:57.120]   It'll go on to Instagram about hundreds of people that they know and love will say,
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.560]   Oh my God, that's so adorable.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.320]   That's really what they're after.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.320]   But that's, and also mitigates the idea that if the color is a little bit off, if the blue
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:08.680]   sky, if you don't, if you thought the sky should be a little bit bluer, there is that
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:12.840]   step in Instagram or any other photo app before you put it someplace where if you're
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:15.080]   going to want to make the sky a little bit bluer, great, make it bluer.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:17.680]   If you want more detail, great, do that as well.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:23.040]   So I like the, I like Apple's point of view, which is we're going to do a conservative
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.040]   print up.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:27.880]   We're going to do a conservative interpretation of the numbers we're getting off this image
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:28.880]   sensor.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.520]   And if you want it to be more intense, by all means, go for it.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.320]   But we're going to, we're going to start you off with something that is probably going
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.400]   to make most people happy.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:41.040]   You, so the heat format is giving me raw material, right?
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.040]   I could.
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:46.600]   So that's one thing that a pro with expensive cameras doing is putting it in Lightroom or
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:49.400]   Photoshop or something in a Refinity or whatever.
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:55.040]   And, and tweaking it, doing the tweaking themselves that Apple does automatically now.
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:59.160]   But Apple is saving the raw image, right?
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.560]   I don't know if it's saving it.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:06.160]   It gives it like if you go to Twitter.com/SDW, Sebastian DeWitt who does Halide, I don't have
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.840]   pronounce it, Halide, that really good iOS camera app.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:14.720]   Here's an example of taking the image in Halide and then using the HDR features.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.240]   They're one underneath that, what dynamic range means.
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:20.400]   Yeah, they're like he takes the photo with the iPhone 10 and then.
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:22.400]   There you go.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.040]   In Halide, like the HDR qualities and I don't know.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.560]   It's probably halide because.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:27.560]   Halide, yeah.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:30.280]   Silver halide was the chemical used in early photography.
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.280]   Yeah.
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.280]   Oh, that's very interesting.
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.880]   Yeah, no, that's it.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:35.560]   That's dynamic range is important.
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:40.040]   That's why if there's a blown highlight on a regular camera, you don't worry about it
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:44.560]   quite so much because you know there's probably detail in there that you can recover.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:50.360]   But if you blow the exposure, again, if it's only recording white pixels, you can't put
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:51.360]   that back in.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.560]   You can't put in something that wasn't recorded.
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:55.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:59.840]   It says in audio, once you clip the audio, you can't recover it.
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.320]   Halide, well, I'm going to have to try this.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.320]   Have you tried it?
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:04.320]   It's a camera.
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.080]   It was going to work the week, but I can.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.820]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:08.820]   I'll save it.
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:09.820]   I'll save it.
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:10.820]   Yeah.
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.400]   Can you call on me first for Pixel the Week?
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.000]   I think I'll do it.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   I think I'll do it.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   I'll do it.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   No, no, no, no.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   Joking, joking guys.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   Something else.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.320]   I haven't done a pic in ages.
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:22.720]   You guys always take all the good stuff.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:23.720]   We're going to take a break.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:24.800]   Come back with more Andy and not go.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.980]   Renee Richie, yes or a picture around the corner.
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:27.980]   More apple do's.
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:29.080]   I got to find a max story.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.240]   I promised you a max story.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.440]   I'll find a max story for you.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:37.920]   The first word from a rocket mortgage, if you are buying a new home, if you are refinancing,
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.640]   you know what that involves going to a bank, a lender saying, "Pleisa, you better have
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:46.600]   some money," and you put up the house for collateral.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:53.480]   That process hasn't changed much in 100 years unless you go to quick and loans.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:55.200]   Quick and loans, the best lender in the country.
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:59.920]   Number one in customer satisfaction, seven years running according to JD Power, you can
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:01.080]   trust them.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.760]   They are really a great company.
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:06.640]   One of the biggest lenders in the country, but the best.
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:12.000]   And especially for us geeks because they have reinvented the home loan process.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.880]   They brought it into the 21st century.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:18.200]   It's a client focused technological revolution.
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:19.200]   First of all, it's convenient.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:24.800]   It's easy because you can do it on your phone, your tablet, your computer.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.600]   You apply simply.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:30.880]   It's easy because you don't have to go to the attic and go through boxes of paperwork.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:31.880]   You don't have to call the bank.
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.480]   It's like, "My bank statements."
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:37.000]   You don't have to give them anything except the basic information.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.960]   They have trusted partners with all the financial institutions.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:45.280]   So all you do is press a button and it's sharing your information with them.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:49.600]   You'll understand every step of the way what's going on because after they crunch the numbers
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:54.600]   based on your income assets and credits, they'll show you exactly what they did and which
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:55.960]   loans are right for you.
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:01.840]   And then you choose your down payment, your term, your rate, you can mortgage with confidence.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:04.720]   It's rocket mortgage by quick and loans.
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:07.720]   And it's so fast that you could actually do it at an open house.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:13.200]   You could go visit a house, say we want this house and before you leave, show the realtor
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:16.600]   we're approved for a loan with rocket mortgage.
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:21.560]   That's pretty important because I have to tell you, it's buying a house now.
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.560]   It's a little competitive.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.440]   It's a seller's market.
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:27.960]   And the person who is approved is going to win out over you if you're not.
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.760]   So bookmark this.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.760]   Will you?

[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:42.640]   your realtor.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.800]   If your realtor is one of those old school types from the 19th century that wants to
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:47.920]   see a printed letter, I love it.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:53.600]   Rocket Mortgage.com/Macbreak, equal housing, lender, licensed in all 50 states and MLS
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.720]   consumeraccess.org number 30, 30.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:07.320]   We thank them so much for their support of Mac Break Weekly Rocket Mortgage.com/MacBreak.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:12.880]   Oh, dear.
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:18.080]   Downtown Brooklyn, Apple Store, big plate of glass.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.960]   You know, Steve always loved that glass.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.600]   Broke.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:25.600]   And it's delayed.
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.800]   Look at this store.
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:31.640]   This is the Brooklyn, downtown Brooklyn Apple Store.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:32.640]   And whoops.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.800]   Oh, boy.
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:38.440]   This is actually, I was told by somebody who was on site, a problem with the spaceship
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:43.760]   campus is that those giant panes of glass could break.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:50.200]   And when they did, it was a massive task to recast them and they were expensive.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.000]   Boston's John Hancock Tower had the exact same problem.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   Yep.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.960]   10,000 windows that were popping out of a 90-story building.
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.280]   Yeah, that's not good.
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.120]   And every single one of them had to be replaced.
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:05.680]   That reminds me next time I'm in the giant Hancock building not to walk on that clear
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.400]   glass floor that they have.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:10.320]   So you can look down at where 90 stories up.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.320]   That's not good.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.400]   Not good.
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:20.160]   And then I guess they're remodeling the Australian Apple Store because thieves robbed the, the
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:30.200]   Apple Regent Street store in the UK, the Apple Chadstone location.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.920]   I don't know if they're related.
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:37.520]   It's going to be one of them genius growth things, kind of like we have here in San Francisco.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:45.800]   It's, I think they might want to, Apple has to kind of rethink the balance between security
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:50.000]   and style because they, like you said, they're wide open.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.160]   They love, they love having those big glass walls.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:59.400]   But the problem is that it's, they're given that there's not a police officer 10 seconds
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.040]   away.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:05.560]   These criminals are just saying, if we just simply ram a car through the front of this,
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:10.000]   we've got a good three and a half minutes, four minutes to put $50,000 worth of stuff
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.080]   into the back of that car, pull out and make a getaway.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:17.720]   It's hard to, it's hard to defeat that kind of a, that kind of a smashing grab.
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:23.320]   And this is, this is the reason why you, that's, this is why Cartier does not have big, huge
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.000]   Ford ceiling glass walls.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.840]   They, they like to have big thick walls that keep the riffraff and the, and the, the, the
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.880]   highway men out.
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:31.880]   This is kind of wild.
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:36.160]   Five, no, 10 thieves on mopeds.
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.760]   And there's a video, but it's not playing now.
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:41.640]   I don't know what I did to screw it up, but there, that you can watch the video on the
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:44.400]   evening standard, which is not responding.
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.800]   Thank you, evening standard.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:47.800]   I misread it.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:52.720]   I would, I, I don't condone thievery, but I thought that I saw a moped and misread like
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:53.720]   scooter.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.520]   And if I thought that, oh, it's like a band of mods, like, it's like, it's like, it's
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:00.800]   not going to be with those scooters with all the mirrors on the bed.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:04.200]   I wouldn't, I wouldn't approve of it, but I would be a little bit more okay with it
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:10.000]   if we got video of like the who, the kids are all right.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.800]   And now they're loaded with many Macs and iPods and iPhones and all that jazz.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:20.120]   Oh man, not only is it stopped responding, but I've lost control of my windows machine.
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:23.720]   Geez, there you go.
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:24.720]   Thank you, windows.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:25.720]   Just press the home button.
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:28.680]   Yeah, I wish I could close window.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:29.680]   Can I get out of it?
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.680]   I think it's crashed.
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:32.800]   Oh, little tip for iPhone 10 people.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.880]   Some people got once in a while the phone, like they, you think the phone is frozen.
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:40.840]   And most of the time you can just swipe up and swipe up gesture will overcome the freeze.
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:43.240]   But some people, I think Casey and I said, had this problem.
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.160]   They really feel like they're locked into that phone.
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.480]   You can just ask Siri to switch apps for you.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:52.320]   You can say, you know, you'll do that open mail and it'll switch to another app and then
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.280]   you'll be able to easily get out without having to reread the phone.
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.000]   So is that temperature related?
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.040]   No, it shouldn't be like any process can crash.
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:03.000]   And if the app process crashes, it's not a problem because the gestures are system-based.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.760]   But if something locks up the entire system, in the old days you'd be able to, you know,
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:10.440]   maybe the home button would force it or maybe you could do that memory flash trick where
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:13.320]   you'd hold down one button and then the other to just free all memory.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.760]   So this one, like if you feel like the gestures have locked you out and sometimes it's just
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:20.120]   not like the just that you're in landscape and you turn it back and the gestures stays
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:21.480]   landscape and you don't see it.
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:25.320]   But if you ever think that you're locked, just ask it to change to an app you know and
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.320]   then you'll be reoriented.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.320]   I love that.
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:30.760]   Can I just press the home, the on/off button to do that or do I have to-
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.000]   You can hold it down for Siri.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   Yeah, you can.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000]   I love.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000]   By the way, that is a great feature.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.320]   I'm now a big fan of that.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:41.240]   That was the old home button you'd press, but you just press the on/off switch and Siri
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:42.480]   will listen to you.
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:44.680]   And that seems somehow more natural to me.
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:48.880]   I guess because I'm holding the phone, I already have my finger on that button or something.
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.600]   So I could say switch to mail and it would just fix that.
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.400]   It'll go to mail and then you don't have to worry about being locked out.
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:58.760]   So what is the, the, Apple says they've identified an issue where the display becomes
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:02.200]   unresponsive to touches after a rapid change.
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.720]   I tested this so much Leo.
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:07.960]   I was out in mind like really cold Montreal weather for so many days and I couldn't reproduce
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:12.800]   it because I would go for walks where I would go outside and then use my phone for 30 minutes
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.480]   until I thought my fingers would fall off.
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:15.960]   You never could reproduce it.
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.400]   Yeah, and I couldn't reproduce it.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.800]   And then one day I finally could.
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:23.880]   I got out of a warm car into a freezing cold night and for about five or six seconds I
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:27.280]   couldn't hit the keyboard and then it started working again.
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:31.920]   So my understanding is that this is an issue with the algorithm that does the touch detection
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:32.920]   because it's doing a lot of stuff.
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:33.920]   It's doing false detection.
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.760]   It's trying to determine that it's, you know, it's actual skin and fingers hitting
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:39.360]   it, not your palm or some other object.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:42.680]   And that is getting disoriented when the temperature changes rapidly in a very short
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:46.560]   period of what drops sorry rapidly and they're going to push an update to that algorithm
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.000]   with a better sorting.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.240]   So it's not a hardware problem.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.200]   It's something they're going to fix in software.
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:54.720]   Nice.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:58.240]   And now I can stay inside with gloves on and not have to worry about it so much.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:02.680]   If you're a Johnny I fan, you want to know more about Apple Park.
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.880]   We have a couple of visitors in studio today who are all excited.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:12.320]   They came down from Seattle to CLCD sound system and they were going to go down tomorrow
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:16.800]   and look at the Apple campus and they found out they're going home Thursday.
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:19.960]   They found out that Friday the Apple Visitor Center is opening.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:23.720]   So right now if you go to the Apple campus, you just drive up to it.
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:24.960]   We have somebody who lives in Cupertino.
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:25.960]   I said, you can't see it.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.440]   There's berms all around it.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.440]   You have to.
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:32.120]   But once they open the Visitor Center, you were there, Renee.
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:35.720]   The Visitor Center is inside the fences inside the bulbs.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:39.640]   Inside the, it's right immediately after when you turn into the entranceway.
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:45.240]   So you'll get a better, if you were able to go there, you'd be able to see the, at least
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:46.720]   see the spaceship at a distance.
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:50.800]   Yeah, there's a coffee, there's a coffee shop and an Apple store, Apple store, Apple
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:54.240]   Park and then you can go up to a sort of an observation deck that gives you a better
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:56.600]   view of the ring campus.
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.240]   Oh, sorry, Chris and Ryan.
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.920]   You got to come back.
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:02.840]   At least you're going to see LCD sound system.
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.920]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:11.240]   Big article and interview, rare interview with Johnny Ive in wallpaper, which is a design
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:14.440]   lifestyle magazine in the loop.
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:21.760]   Johnny Ive on Apple's new HQ and the amazing disappearing iPhone featuring pictures in
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:22.760]   two.
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:23.760]   Does the iPhone disappear?
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:27.120]   Because if it does, I owe Robert Scoble lunch in Paris.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.520]   No, it doesn't disappear, right?
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:30.520]   Okay.
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:31.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.960]   I didn't get a chance to read the whole thing.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:38.320]   Any amazing insights in here or the building?
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.520]   It's just very Johnny Ive.
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:40.520]   It will evolve.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:43.680]   Actually, I'm more interested in being able to see the landscape.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:45.840]   It's the device stuff that he's talking about.
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:49.080]   Like he said, like he has the iPhone, but he's become so much a screen that more than
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.800]   ever the software is what defines the experience.
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:55.000]   And he expects that new and I don't know how much of this is just Johnny being Johnny
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.120]   and how much his actual forward looking software statements.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:01.000]   But he's saying that you buy an iPhone 10 within a year, it's going to be a different
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.560]   experience because the software is going to be continuously updated, which provide you
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:07.640]   with new features that change the way the hardware feels.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:11.600]   No, I think that is a lot of Johnny being Johnny, but it does show that when you have
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:18.560]   a full screen, anything that changes what's shown on that screen just feels very substantive.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:22.880]   He says as a design team, our goal has always been to get design out of the way.
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:27.560]   I think is what I think is remark about the iPhone 10 is that it's functionality is so
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:32.440]   determined by software because of the fluid nature of software, this product is going
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.800]   to change and evolve in 12 months time.
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.800]   This object will be able to do things that it can't now.
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:38.800]   I think that's extraordinary.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:42.800]   I think we'll look back on it and see it as a very significant point in the terms of
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.360]   the products we've been developing.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.400]   You could say the same thing about the camera, right?
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:51.600]   The photography as we get to computational photography, the same hardware can do new
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:54.800]   and amazing things that it couldn't do before.
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:59.680]   So while I'm completely seduced by the coherence and simplicity and how easy it is to comprehend
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:04.560]   something like the first iPod, I am quite honestly more fascinated and intrigued by
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:08.000]   an object that changes his function profoundly and evolves.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.200]   This is rare.
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:11.240]   That didn't happen 50 years ago.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:13.000]   From a designer's point of view, I guess that makes sense.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.320]   If you're used to designing physical objects, now that the iPhone is basically just getting
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:21.880]   closer and closer to a pure slab of glass.
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:25.080]   It also explains why the headphone jack goes away and eventually I'm sure the lightning
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.400]   port and buttons.
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:28.880]   It's all software.
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:38.160]   There's something to be said though for designing something that isn't going to be vague and
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:42.720]   it's not going to be abstract.
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:45.560]   Of course makes a great point.
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:49.600]   One of the most transformative things about phones, it wasn't so much just the simple
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:50.960]   idea of multi-touch.
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:55.200]   It's the idea of there is not a keyboard on the screen.
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:58.280]   There's not a keyboard on the phone until you need for there to be a keyboard.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:01.640]   There is not a camera shutter button until you need for there to be a camera shutter
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:02.720]   button.
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.320]   And so this thing can be completely amorphous.
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:06.640]   It's silly putty.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:11.040]   If you need a movie screen, then nothing is on that display except for the movie.
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:17.960]   However, there's a familiarity to a tactile interface that if you work to, I think you
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:22.840]   can drive that car completely off the cliff by saying that we don't need a clicky button
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:23.840]   of any kind.
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.160]   We don't need a headphone jack of any kind.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:26.840]   We don't need volume buttons.
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:34.520]   That means that as we saw, as I saw with the latest Macbook, when you have to reveal
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:39.000]   a volume button in order to change the volume, that's a pain in the butt.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:46.360]   And as it is, one of the few things that I really miss between the iPhone 7 and 8 and
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.800]   the iPhone 10 is I was using a camera shortcut.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.320]   I love camera shortcuts.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:53.560]   I love it when you like on my Android phone where I just double tap the power button and
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:56.160]   we'll just simply take me right to the camera.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:59.520]   There's some shortcuts that you kind of miss when you don't have a clicky button, when you
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:04.720]   have to wait for the phone to reveal, to wake up enough to present you with an interface.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:09.120]   When you have clicky buttons, you can have a clicky button do stuff before the camera,
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:12.760]   before the phone is even a phone before it's really fully woken up.
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:19.560]   So it's, but I love what he's saying that it's possible that you can buy a device today
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:23.360]   that in two years, two or three years from now doesn't just run apps that haven't been
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:27.080]   invented yet, but does tasks that haven't been invented yet.
[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:34.760]   Just like we used to travel with a CD player and a phone, a CD player and a telephone and
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.960]   a camera.
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:41.720]   Now imagine buying the CD player and actually two years from now, there's a software update
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:43.320]   and now it takes pictures.
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:47.920]   That's the kind of mind blowing sort of stuff we're looking at with modern phones.
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:51.240]   He says, if you think of what multi touch afforded on the one hand was so powerfully
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:55.560]   intuitive because you could directly manipulate content, but, and this is what you were talking
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:58.920]   about, Andy, because it wasn't affected by physical buttons, you could create an interface
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.720]   that was very specific to an application.
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:05.800]   That's why the app store could be, and you could have such an extraordinary range of
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:08.200]   application range of applications and user interfaces.
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:13.160]   It does have that double edged sword, Andy, because it's one of the problems I have with
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:17.640]   the iPhone is that it's not, every app has a different UI and it's not always obvious
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:19.160]   what to do next.
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:24.600]   On the other hand, it's a very fertile area to develop in and it's also what gives you
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:25.600]   the weird-
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.600]   Did you get a Snapchat right?
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.600]   No one knows how to use it.
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.600]   Well, that's right.
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:35.800]   Or you get the control panel where eventually everything will be on screen a range of very
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:37.840]   confusing buttons.
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:42.920]   So the trick is as a software designer not to do the control panel, but to come up with
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:49.360]   a way that's natural and intuitive without being just a bunch of on-screen analogs for
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.360]   physical buttons.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.360]   It's fascinating.
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.800]   It's like the same people who build all these iPhones and, you know, it's not just Apple.
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.360]   I mean, HTC is trying to make squeeze sides.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:58.360]   You don't have to have side buttons because you all want to get away from mechanical failure.
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.800]   Actually, you know, I love the squeeze on the Pixel XL.
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:01.800]   They're cool.
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:02.800]   I think you will too.
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.400]   That actually is intuitive and natural.
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:06.480]   I was skeptical, but it does work.
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:10.120]   These are the same designers who will unbox a Leica camera with every one of his twi-like
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.440]   little gadgety buttons on it.
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:12.440]   Love it.
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:13.440]   Want it.
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:14.440]   Yeah, absolute tactile abandon.
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:15.440]   Actually.
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:16.440]   Actually.
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.440]   I'm going to put on the Apple V. It's all but.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:22.560]   Excellent analogy because I do prefer, I far prefer my cameras where the things I do the
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:25.760]   most are physical knobs to an on-screen menu.
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:30.680]   But that's because the camera is all about physical manipulation.
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:35.840]   It's all about whipping a thing up, getting it right and taking a picture quickly.
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:38.080]   And there's no way that can happen on screen.
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:42.120]   My little God, some angel of God's son demanded for his brother in demand, but really wanted
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:45.680]   for his birthday, a typewriter, a good old fashioned typewriter.
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:46.680]   And he's still every day.
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:47.680]   What a weirdo.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:48.680]   He got it.
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:52.320]   Yeah, Georgia went and got it for him.
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:56.280]   And he just sits there delighted like this glowing look on his face, putting the paper
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:01.080]   and turning it, taps out tapping on the keyboard, and going back and there's and he has access
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:04.360]   to Mac books and iPads and all this stuff because she has everything he could possibly
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.560]   want and what he wanted was a typewriter.
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:07.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:11.640]   So as long as designers don't get, keep focusing on what their customer actually wants, what
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.640]   they actually need.
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.640]   Yes.
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:17.720]   Instead of focusing them into what they want, what they, what's useful for the company for
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:18.920]   them to buy.
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:22.840]   I got, I got a great deal on a camera that I've been searching for for a while.
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:26.960]   This is the Olympus OM2N.
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:31.920]   And it's, and the thing is the trend for modern cameras is to make cameras that look exactly
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:36.840]   like this camera that was made in like 1984, 1985, because as you said, for people who
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:40.200]   want to spend a thousand bucks on a camera, they want knobs.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:42.120]   They want controls and it's not nostalgia.
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:45.840]   It's because that's how you take pictures with a really good camera.
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:52.280]   And so, I mean, it's a, if you notice Apple, Apple, of course, they got rid of the, you
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:55.480]   don't see a, you don't see a headphone jack on the iPhone 10.
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:26:00.400]   But one thing you do see is you still see a mechanical button for silencing the ringer.
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:05.200]   That's because at some point when you need, when you want to shut the hell, get the phone
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:08.120]   to shut the hell up, you don't want to have to wake it.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:09.720]   You don't want to have to face an idea.
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:12.360]   You don't want to have to go to some sort of other panel.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:18.360]   You want to take a switch when, when, when, when again, that, that, I'm sorry, you just
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:21.400]   want to flip a switch and suddenly get the damn thing to shut up.
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:25.920]   So I think I wonder how long it's going to be before they finally decide to get rid of
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:26.920]   this switch.
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:31.320]   I really think that it's going to be the last thing to go because on a phone, that is the
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:36.240]   desperate, please, please, please, before anybody in this concert, hold realizes it's
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:38.880]   me who's making this noise with a phone.
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:39.880]   Shut the hell up.
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:44.000]   Well, and it's not just that because without turning on the phone, you have a physical read
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.360]   out of the state of your phone.
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:48.600]   You can see a physical thing that, and it's the same thing on that camera.
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:51.240]   I can look down and say, Oh yeah, I'm set at F two.
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:52.640]   I mean, there, those things.
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:53.640]   Interesting.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:54.640]   Yeah, it's information.
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:01.840]   So there is a good excuse for a physical interface in some cases.
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:02.840]   You don't want to design them all.
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:05.640]   You don't want this to be a slab of glass until we get our implants.
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:10.520]   Yeah, most most phones and you have taken away that physical silence switch.
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:14.440]   It is, it's one of the things I love about the iPhone that I miss on other.
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:15.440]   Yes.
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:16.440]   Yeah.
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:17.440]   Yeah.
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:21.680]   And I still miss the rotation locks switch on the, on the iPad because that's, it's kind
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:22.780]   of the same sort of thing.
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:28.460]   I can, I can be like on the sofa and suddenly just, if I'm reading a book, I've gone from
[01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:30.580]   like 28 minutes of reading it.
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:33.260]   I'm sitting straight up to another 10 minutes.
[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:36.740]   I'm sort of lying on my side or just, I'm sort of slumped a little bit just enough to
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:37.740]   get it to rotate.
[01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:38.740]   Me too.
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:41.700]   And it's so, and I just want to flip that switch and say, yeah, for this, for the next
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:43.500]   20 minutes, please don't rotate the screen.
[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:48.980]   I just, it's not that much more work to simply, to reveal it in control center, but it's like,
[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:50.460]   you, you gave me a switch.
[01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:51.460]   I like the switch.
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:52.940]   I've told them much, I like the switch.
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:54.140]   Then you took the switch away.
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:55.660]   I don't know why you did that.
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:28:00.620]   I was, I found the radar yesterday, I found the radar yesterday for smart orientation
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:02.700]   lock because I want my orientation locked.
[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:06.060]   But if I go to any media that's landscape, it should like Netflix, you just overrides
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:07.060]   it.
[01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:08.060]   It goes, no, no, you're watching a movie now.
[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:09.060]   We don't care about that.
[01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:12.060]   But also like an Andy's point, if I'm reading a book, I want orientation lock on.
[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:15.940]   But if I turn my iPad sideways, let me just grab the screen and twist my hand and put
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:17.100]   the book in the orientation.
[01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:18.100]   I want it.
[01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:19.540]   Like the, the, all this stuff.
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:21.620]   It's like I had an alarm go off my wake up alarm.
[01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:22.620]   It's not a normal alarm.
[01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:25.180]   It's the alarm you set in the alarm app in the bedtime mode.
[01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:28.660]   So all that alarm does is wake you up and I was on the phone and it went up.
[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:32.180]   It went off and I don't know why it doesn't know that if you're on the phone, chances
[01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:35.140]   are I'm awake and doesn't need to hit me with that alarm.
[01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:39.900]   It's like all these little behavioral things I think could be better at.
[01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:41.780]   Here is the final quote in the article.
[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:46.220]   This is a wallpaper magazine, by the way, the cover of wallpaper, special cover designed
[01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:47.220]   by Johnny.
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:48.860]   I've, you know what it is?
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:49.860]   It's just white.
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:51.540]   It's just a, it's just a white cover.
[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:53.140]   But he picked each one of those letter colors.
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:55.260]   You know, in a month with each color.
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:58.260]   Johnny, in a nutshell of type.
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:03.500]   That's, that's the literal, literal version of no, this, this design is so genius that
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:07.060]   only really smart designers could appreciate how genius it is.
[01:29:07.060 --> 01:29:09.180]   Oh, I think he was telling them.
[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:11.300]   I think he was trolling them.
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:12.620]   You know what?
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:13.620]   That is good.
[01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:14.980]   That physical copy is going to sell out.
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:16.340]   I promise you.
[01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:17.860]   Here's the final quote, which I think is very.
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:21.900]   You take it to the con and have, how are the designers write their own design on it for
[01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:22.900]   a extra $20?
[01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:24.260]   It's, it's the whitest.
[01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:25.900]   There's none whiter.
[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:28.700]   It's as white as white can be.
[01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:33.840]   The final quote I like when I look back over the past 25 years in some ways, what seems
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:41.100]   most precious is not what we have made, but how we have made it and what we have learned
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:42.340]   as a consequence of that.
[01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:45.500]   I always think there are two products at the end of a program.
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:49.980]   There's the physical product or service, the thing you've managed to make, and then there's
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:51.660]   all that you have learned.
[01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:56.860]   The power of what you have learned enables you to do the next thing and it enables you
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:58.380]   to do the next thing better.
[01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:03.660]   And that's where the continuity of Johnny and his design team really makes a difference.
[01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:07.860]   He's been an Apple, you know, longer than anybody at this point, right?
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:09.940]   He started, what was his first design at Apple?
[01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:11.260]   Was it the iMac?
[01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:12.260]   The color I'm at?
[01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:15.300]   His first was Steve, but he had his designs turned down for years before Steve.
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:18.580]   But he's been there 20 some years.
[01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:24.940]   And so the thing is, he is learning with every product and so many companies, you know, there's
[01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:29.100]   churn with the design team, there's churn with a lot of the teams.
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:31.180]   That's really important quote I thought I was going to say.
[01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:34.860]   One of the most amazing things I think about him is that when you hear him speak, he actually
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:37.700]   sadly, when he's on those white screens, there's no artifice.
[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:39.940]   That's the way Johnny actually talks and speaks.
[01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:43.980]   And I've heard him say things like, you know, we've done this keynote and we've created
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:47.620]   this product, but until we see it in the hands of our customers, we have no idea what it
[01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:49.020]   really is or what it really means.
[01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:52.100]   It's only when millions of people get their hands on it that they tell us how it's supposed
[01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:53.100]   to be used.
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:57.580]   You know, it seems like that's how he really thinks and talks.
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:02.380]   We should now the defect section of the program.
[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:03.700]   Apple has patched 11.
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:06.700]   What is 11.1.1?
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:07.700]   The auto correct.
[01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:08.700]   Did we mention this last week?
[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:09.700]   Maybe we did.
[01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:11.140]   I think we did, but they've patched it.
[01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:23.180]   I did want to show the Ohio State trolling Apple with their card stunt where they show
[01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:24.180]   the A.
[01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:25.660]   You got to look quickly.
[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:27.660]   They show the A question mark.
[01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:31.820]   Jeremy Burgess, the emotive media guy was fantastic because he viewed the iPhone 10 ad
[01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:37.860]   with, you know, exclamation point, square question mark, phone 10.
[01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:39.740]   Jeremy, we love Jeremy.
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:42.620]   I have to go to the Unicode emoji committee.
[01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:43.620]   Go ahead.
[01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:53.660]   I do have to say I really that that kind of a mistake is so big and so embarrassing.
[01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:55.780]   And I don't mean this as a joke.
[01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:57.380]   He across the way.
[01:31:57.380 --> 01:32:00.140]   That's the sort of stuff that I associate with like Samsung.
[01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:03.780]   So that's the sort of the sort of mistake that I associate with lesser companies.
[01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:06.740]   I don't associate that kind of mistake with Apple.
[01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:13.220]   And this combined with other things that I've been picking up here and there makes me wonder
[01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:18.140]   if Apple needs to take another look at its quality control when it comes to software.
[01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:23.260]   I feel as though that's not a mistake that would have made it into the wild a couple
[01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:24.260]   of years ago.
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:26.060]   There was a number of those.
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:29.780]   It was a machine learning system that went for some for some reason what was supposed to
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:33.500]   happen with the machine learning and the way it works now with quick type is that if Andy
[01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:38.980]   invents a new word like bazougala and it becomes super popular it the system learns
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:42.020]   it and then offers it as a suggestion or knows how it's spelled.
[01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:45.700]   So it doesn't make it doesn't mark it as an incorrect word and it propagates that throughout
[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:47.260]   the quick type system.
[01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:52.340]   But for some reason instead of leaving autocorrect, you know, minuscule eye to maguscule eye to
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:58.940]   uppercase eye it it learned that the letter the small eye should be corrected to small
[01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:05.180]   eye slash weird emoji non-brake space character that created this unrenderable character and
[01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:08.140]   then proceeded to propagate that to everybody's eye.
[01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:12.960]   So I mean I'm glad it was a signet but like and I can think this is the kind of robot gun
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:17.060]   wild I can take but it is like you see celebrities on Instagram.
[01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:18.060]   You still see it.
[01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:20.940]   I'm still seeing a lot of tweets like that.
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:22.460]   Do you could never happen to me?
[01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:24.660]   I don't think but do you not notice it happening?
[01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:28.740]   Does it does it just like you write the tweet it says I.
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:31.740]   You don't see it and you send it and you don't see it.
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:32.740]   Yeah.
[01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:35.060]   And when the social network renders it has a problem rendering the character.
[01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:36.060]   That's the issue.
[01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:37.060]   Okay.
[01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:41.500]   So you you I may have had and just didn't know I should look back through my tweets and apparently
[01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:44.900]   the more it happened like the more you saw it the more the system learned it.
[01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:45.900]   Right.
[01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:46.900]   Right.
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:47.900]   Yeah.
[01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:49.820]   But this once again this seems like the sort of whether it's machine learning or not this
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:53.300]   does it seems like the sort of problem that.
[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:57.540]   It's unusual for Apple to release this into the wild.
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:34:01.980]   It seems as though there would have been if it's possible for average Joe to encounter
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:03.500]   this problem on their own phone.
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:07.300]   It should have been possible for QA testers inside of Apple to have encountered it as well.
[01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:08.300]   Well but maybe not.
[01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:11.300]   I mean that's one of those things that shows up as people use it.
[01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:12.300]   Right.
[01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:13.300]   Yeah.
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:17.420]   When you get to millions of users but like I said it's it's you're not used to seeing any
[01:34:17.420 --> 01:34:21.940]   problems of that magnitude with as again we it's been years since we've had a real egg
[01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:24.980]   freckles scale problem with an Apple product.
[01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:28.260]   And this is egg freckles in the 21st century.
[01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:29.260]   Yeah.
[01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:33.660]   Fortunately I never use the word I so I haven't run into it.
[01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:35.860]   It did not did not seem to look.
[01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:37.660]   There's no I in Mac brick.
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:39.100]   I use yeah.
[01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:43.380]   I actually embarrassed at how often I use the word I but I've been fortunate somehow
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:48.740]   I managed to miss putting I into my I also should like Instagram and let's just look
[01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:52.260]   in real quickly because I you should you should do what Andy does and speak of himself in
[01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:53.260]   the third person always.
[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:58.580]   It's way more arrogant and you avoid using that Leo report would never do that and it
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:00.060]   loves yoga.
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:06.340]   Well what about this green line is that another is that a hardware bug the green line of I
[01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:10.140]   would just take that back to an Apple store and ask for yes I wouldn't even want to tend
[01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:11.140]   to mess with that.
[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:14.820]   No it's a green line that's appearing on the display of some not all.
[01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:20.540]   iPhone 10 is probably very few really and I bet Apple Apple engineers would be very very
[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:23.180]   grateful to actually have that back so can take a look what happened.
[01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:26.580]   That's not a that's not a seems like the pro this seems like something would happen to
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:31.340]   a handful of phones at the in the early batches and then you'll never see it again because
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:35.380]   it will figure out why that wasn't caught in manufacturing or why that was a defect that
[01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:37.820]   can happen in manufacturing.
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:38.820]   Yeah.
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:47.540]   Sometimes little bugs or surprise uses of devices are good as well as bad.
[01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:52.660]   Here is a fellow who was kite surfing he had his I love this story series three Apple
[01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:57.620]   watch on we never thought this was this is a kind of thing Apple would say but it actually
[01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:59.820]   happened.
[01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:03.380]   He ran into a shark infested waters.
[01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:10.500]   Apparently kind of a shark nursery a lot of baby sharks he couldn't get the he crashed
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:14.900]   into it he couldn't get the hydrofoil and kite back together after the crash he was a mile
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:22.500]   offshore he was fortunately wearing his series three with cellular apple watch.
[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:28.300]   So he called first he called his kids to say I'm going to be delayed and then he called
[01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:32.820]   back to say can you call the Ventura Harbor Patrol.
[01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:36.100]   I see I love the story because like he looked at his watch to tell the time and he's like
[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:38.300]   oh my god I have a cell signal.
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:42.140]   I'm going to call my kids and get the number like it's just it's such a cool sort of it's
[01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:43.140]   a misgomer.
[01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:47.380]   It's a mistake not yeah yeah and then as he saw the boat coming in he called again and
[01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:49.380]   said I'm over here.
[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:55.580]   Oh you got a hundred yellow sharks that's me in the middle.
[01:36:55.580 --> 01:37:01.340]   This is this is how humanity is going to end because people like that who said hey we're
[01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:05.500]   in the entire planet should I go windsurfing I know how about in the middle of a shark nursery
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:09.580]   those are people who get in the old system get eliminated from the gene pool.
[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:14.260]   We've probably get nipped at some point now oh wait no I've got enough discretionary income
[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:21.740]   I can buy myself a free pass from Darwin oh well that's not right and it's just not right.
[01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:28.020]   And this is also interesting although a little bit speculative but it seems AI can help the
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:34.220]   Apple Watch predict high blood pressure and sleep apnea.
[01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:40.580]   How about that that's the problem where you stop breathing in the middle of the night and
[01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:44.540]   you end up having to wear a CPAP machine to keep you breathing and of course sleep apnea
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:47.900]   can kill you in the long run it's certainly not good for you.
[01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:52.900]   Research was presented yesterday at the American Heart Association meeting in Anaheim that
[01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:57.100]   the Apple heart rate sensor and step counter can make a fair prediction of whether a person
[01:37:57.100 --> 01:38:04.820]   has high blood pressure or sleep apnea and this would be huge.
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:09.660]   Now this is not Apple doing this I think.
[01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:11.180]   It is says a study.
[01:38:11.180 --> 01:38:13.580]   Let me get out of Apple maybe.
[01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:19.220]   I wouldn't put it past to me this this is once again long range this is for long range
[01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:22.700]   planning you can get into when you've got two hundred and fifty billion dollars in the
[01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:26.700]   bank you can decide well we're going to have we have a plan for the Mac and five years we
[01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:32.980]   got a plan for iOS in 10 years but we also have a plan so that we can again impact human
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:38.500]   evolution to keep breathing a new every new generation will be more likely to be buying
[01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:43.460]   Apple products because we're causing people who buy Apple products to live long enough
[01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:45.220]   to propagate actually.
[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:51.140]   Chox at eyes black as coalio this is ironically about how about fertility monitoring once
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:56.180]   you see the every apple apple I watch becomes with fertility monitoring built in like oh
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:59.420]   ovulating I believe you want to have sex right now.
[01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:04.460]   Here I here I've already Apple pay order so that that Chianti that that you guys like
[01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:10.980]   and Apple music has a bunch of Barry Menelow and and Hester Wong for you.
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:15.980]   So it's from a company called Cartiogram which ironically was founded by former Google
[01:39:15.980 --> 01:39:21.700]   employees and informed by they work on speech recognition for Android phones and the Google
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:27.060]   Assistant they appeared with the University of California San Francisco and I'm just downloaded
[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:29.820]   their app they make an app called Cartiogram.
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:36.700]   Which apparently they had data from 6,000 Apple watch users enrolled in the study on mobile
[01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:44.060]   health they they used artificial neural networks to turn a speech.
[01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:51.540]   Oh no I'm sorry to turn the heart this information the system called deep heart gets heart rate
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:56.900]   and step data from multiple people and then of course maps that to information they ask
[01:39:56.900 --> 01:40:00.540]   for because the study in the study they have questionnaires about their health conditions
[01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:08.900]   and they were able to actually predict according to their report atrial feb relation from Apple
[01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:14.260]   watch data with one with one week of data unaware of the algorithms could predict hypertension
[01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:20.780]   with roughly 80% accuracy sleep apnea with about 90% accuracy.
[01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:24.260]   Wow I'm downloading it right now.
[01:40:24.260 --> 01:40:28.300]   Just don't log in with Facebook otherwise everyone else who has cardio things will start being
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:30.380]   suggested as friends.
[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:34.060]   That would be an interesting test I should maybe I will log in with Facebook just to see
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:38.140]   I don't have Facebook on my phone so I no longer log in with Facebook because it doesn't
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:42.700]   know my Facebook password and it's a pain in the butt.
[01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:51.060]   Boston Dynamics has modified their robotic dog to make it a little bit less scary kid-friendly
[01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:52.060]   yellow.
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:58.380]   It looked like zombie undead it just it was so freaky.
[01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:05.140]   Yeah that's sure I'm happier with the new it's called spot mini and no.
[01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:07.460]   Ah that's terrifying.
[01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:10.300]   It's going to be hunting us down there.
[01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:12.300]   Oh god.
[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:15.980]   Maybe maybe they should take a cue from Microsoft and just like with their laptops covered with
[01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:17.580]   that sort of felt material.
[01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:23.700]   They get fabric spot mini by the way is not mini it's huge.
[01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:27.460]   Oh and they watch the X-Men don't they know how this ends.
[01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:30.700]   If you if you haven't seen the video and you're what you're listening to us you've got the
[01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:36.580]   Verge has the animated GIF of the spot mini looking straight at you.
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:40.300]   I'm going to see me late but tell it drunk down in hammer fist the thing.
[01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:43.780]   I'm down and I'm making that my profile picture that is awesome.
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:44.780]   Do it.
[01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:45.780]   That is terrifying.
[01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:53.660]   And then the whole front turns into a laser beam and fries you.
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:54.660]   Yeah.
[01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:59.660]   Isn't it is isn't it interesting that that is usually we're seeing these demo videos
[01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:04.220]   like in the casual in the backyard of the of the lab or inside the lab of looking how
[01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:06.540]   look how fast it can jump over a table.
[01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:12.020]   This is like here here's a teaser for the actual trailer we're going to be releasing soon
[01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:15.460]   for this dog robot like a horror movie.
[01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:16.460]   I don't know.
[01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:20.220]   I mean it's dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.
[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:23.420]   You look at American politics the things that we're willing to embrace even though they
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:28.620]   are on the surface quite scary and disgusting Americans have a lot of lamp to us.
[01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:29.620]   Come with me.
[01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:30.620]   Come with me.
[01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:31.620]   Come on.
[01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:32.620]   Live.

[01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:38.460]   Coming up.
[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:42.900]   Finally but I can tell you my pick right up front and I don't think I will surprise anybody
[01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:46.420]   when I tell you I love the Joe B. Gorilla pot.
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:52.620]   In fact it has been a pick many times on on on this show.
[01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:55.060]   New designs are getting better and better.
[01:42:55.060 --> 01:43:01.540]   Maybe you've seen of course the Gorilla pot is known for its ball joint sockets.
[01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:02.540]   I'll give you this.
[01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:03.620]   They come in all sizes.
[01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:06.460]   This is actually one big enough to use with the DSLR.
[01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:11.860]   This is my and I love you can just fold these around and and rubberized rings and foot grips
[01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:14.580]   give you stability on uneven surfaces.
[01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:18.900]   I have I've taken these on places like where you put it around the railing.
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:23.100]   You know you don't tripod you could attach to a microphone.
[01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:28.140]   This is this is the kinder gentler version of that Boston Dynamics robot.
[01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:29.340]   You can mount flashes.
[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:34.340]   It's great to have several of them so you could put your flashes around video lights.
[01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:40.220]   It's using the quarter 20 mount so you anything with a standard thread can can be mounted with
[01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:41.220]   it.
[01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:42.220]   I love Joe B.
[01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:43.940]   They didn't realize this.
[01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:46.180]   They started in 2006.
[01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:48.180]   That was the first gorilla pod.
[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:54.460]   Now 10 million sold grip it, wrap it, stand it.
[01:43:54.460 --> 01:43:56.580]   No matter what you can use a gorilla pod.
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:44:03.060]   This is the grip type one gorilla pod stand that has a great holder for your smartphone
[01:44:03.060 --> 01:44:06.780]   any size smartphone and I have the new one with magnetic feet.
[01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:07.780]   That's fabulous.
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:10.300]   It sticks tight to anything metal.

[01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:55.780]   We got them for the kids.
[01:44:55.780 --> 01:44:56.780]   They just fantastic.
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:59.340]   You know, I'll tell you what you like you give it to a 10 year old.
[01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:01.540]   They're going to be doing stop action movies all of a sudden, right?
[01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:02.540]   Totally all the time.
[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:03.540]   That's amazing.
[01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:04.540]   Yeah.
[01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:06.940]   It's just like, oh, I know what I can do with this instantly.
[01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:11.700]   I always have a gorilla pod in my backpack or in my notebook bag.
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:15.700]   If I'm going to be out of the house overnight because it's not just a tripod.
[01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:21.300]   It's also a wrap it around a pole and give you make it six feet off the ground pod.
[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:26.820]   It's also a hang it off the top of a makeup mirror, a well mounted mirror or something.
[01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:29.060]   It's the amount of things you can do with it.
[01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:32.860]   I love these things where you get to make up your own solution to the problem that's
[01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:34.020]   right in front of you.
[01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:35.380]   And that's what a gorilla pod that you do.
[01:45:35.380 --> 01:45:37.380]   And they now have, oh, I just saw this.
[01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:38.700]   Oh boy.
[01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:45.700]   This is the high end DSLR machined aluminum version of the gorilla pod.
[01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:46.700]   Same ball.
[01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:47.700]   It's like a joint.
[01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:48.700]   It just cost me money.
[01:45:48.700 --> 01:45:54.060]   I want, I want, I must have with the ball head out and everything.
[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:55.460]   That's the tripod you want.
[01:45:55.460 --> 01:46:02.220]   The gorilla pod five K machined aluminum flexible tripod for DSLR.
[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:04.380]   It holds up to five kilograms.
[01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:08.300]   Oh, got to have, I didn't even know about it.
[01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:11.220]   By the way, you can put like lights and you can put anything on these, anything that has
[01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:12.220]   a standard mount on it.
[01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:14.380]   You can put lights, you can put rigs, you can put anything on them.
[01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:15.380]   They're fantastic.
[01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:18.300]   So if you're shooting in, there's like a tree and you want to hang a light off of it, just
[01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:20.380]   use the gorilla pod, put the light on it, hang it.
[01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:21.380]   You bet.
[01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:22.380]   In business.
[01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:23.380]   Yeah.
[01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:24.900]   Oh, incidentally, I didn't know this is even makes it more desirable.
[01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:26.940]   This has the standard ARCA mount.
[01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:31.340]   So I put an ARCA frame from really right stuff on all my cameras.
[01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:35.460]   So this has quick release, basically built into it.
[01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:38.940]   I want this.
[01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:42.220]   Mommy, can I have a Jobe gorilla pod for Christmas?
[01:46:42.220 --> 01:46:44.940]   I have one more Jobe one more Jobe, please.
[01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:46.620]   This is beautiful aluminum.
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:47.620]   Oh my God.
[01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:49.620]   And that red is fierce.
[01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:52.180]   That's a fierce red.
[01:46:52.180 --> 01:46:53.620]   Oh my God.
[01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:57.420]   It looks like the brake calipers on my Tesla.
[01:46:57.420 --> 01:47:03.780]   All right, who wanted to go first?
[01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:05.020]   Andy, you said you wanted to go first.
[01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:06.020]   So we're going to let you go first.
[01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:07.180]   Pick of the week.
[01:47:07.180 --> 01:47:10.420]   I was joking, but all I was all I my pick of the week.
[01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:13.980]   Oh, I haven't even hit the return on the what it is.
[01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:18.020]   I've been looking at the meditation apps on iOS and Android.
[01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:21.980]   And so I'm playing a lot with an app called Headspace and Apple.
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:23.540]   Calm.
[01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:24.700]   And they're both really, really good.
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:27.740]   I was surprised at how hugely popular they are.
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:28.740]   They're not.
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:33.900]   I have to say that I am the first person who disabled the like the little feature on the
[01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:37.580]   Apple watch that keeps interrupting you to say, why don't you calm down?
[01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:41.500]   Like I would be calm if you keep interrupting me while the middle of a show.
[01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:44.060]   But I like I like I like both of them.
[01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:46.780]   I don't really have a preference of the two of them right now.
[01:47:46.780 --> 01:47:50.620]   I like Headspace because it really it does.
[01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:54.540]   They both do one thing really well, which is you're not you don't have to sign up for
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:58.380]   a class in meditation or seminar and whatever and show up someplace.
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:03.500]   It really can be sort of like a downtime activity where you've got 12 minutes before
[01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:05.420]   like like just before the show.
[01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:08.940]   Like I was ready and set up actually like a quarter to two.
[01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:10.620]   So I got 15 minutes.
[01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:11.420]   I don't want to do it.
[01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:11.940]   So okay, great.
[01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:16.540]   I'll do like a meditation exercise or I'll see what calm wants me to do at this point.
[01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:20.700]   And you can sort of sneak in these little training things in which it will say, here's how we
[01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:23.020]   will guide you through a timed meditation.
[01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:27.980]   The Headspace does something that I don't know if I like or not.
[01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:29.420]   I mean, I mean that literally.
[01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:32.700]   I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing because it is saying, well, what do you want to
[01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:33.100]   help with?
[01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:34.300]   You want to help with anxiety?
[01:48:34.300 --> 01:48:35.340]   Do you want to help with focus?
[01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:36.060]   You want to help with this?
[01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:42.540]   And so based on that, it will give you exercises in meditation or mindfulness that will help
[01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:44.620]   you with focus or help you with anxiety.
[01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:49.660]   I don't have the wherewithal at this point to know whether that is snake oil or whether that
[01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:55.260]   there is actual science behind. Here's why we're giving you these lessons of these other ones.
[01:48:55.260 --> 01:49:00.940]   All I know is that it makes it interesting to do it makes it interesting to learn this new
[01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:06.620]   technique of not just there's a difference between just like doing nothing and staring at the wall
[01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:11.660]   and actually trying to slow your pulse rate actually try to look for muscles in your neck
[01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:14.620]   and in your back and in your arms and your shoulders that are tensed up.
[01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:18.140]   You'd know until you started looking for tensed up muscles.
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:22.780]   And it's just like I learned to play the ukulele just by and snatches of half hour here or 20
[01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:27.580]   minutes there and hour there. It's kind of interesting that of the course of a couple weeks now I'm
[01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:31.260]   sort of in the habit of, hey, I got a little bit of time. I think I'll practice this meditation
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:36.140]   thing a little bit more. So the headspace is they do charge you for additional lessons.
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:39.980]   They do charge you for additional features out of the box. It's very, very good on its own,
[01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:44.540]   but they're very, very good apps. They're very, very mature apps. They've got a huge community.
[01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:47.980]   So you know, it's something that has a lot of polish and a lot of support to it.
[01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:54.380]   So I recommend them to anybody who thinks that they have not been spending quite enough time
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:59.980]   focusing on their resting heart rate. And they can't remember the last time they did not feel
[01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:04.140]   as though their head were full of bees. And either of these two apps will help you out,
[01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:05.180]   I think with that problem.
[01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:10.860]   I should mention Headspace was a sponsor. I'm a big fan of Andy Puttycom. I love his voice
[01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:16.300]   when I'm listening. Com.com is great. And we probably should mention that Kevin Rose now has
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:22.460]   a very nice free meditation app called Oak. It's simple, but it has guided meditations.
[01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:27.900]   And you grow a tree from a tiny acorn to a mighty oak as you meditate or breathe.
[01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:32.460]   What is the third? There's three categories of things you can do to grow your oak.
[01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:39.100]   One is breathing and one is meditation. So yeah, good choice. I think Andy, it's amazing what
[01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:42.300]   even a little bit of mindful meditation can do.
[01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:48.380]   Yeah, I stress out, I don't think that down healthy way, but it's in the normal human way of
[01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:53.340]   travel through airports really, really sucks. And one thing that really helped me with it,
[01:50:53.340 --> 01:50:57.180]   this was actually a couple of years ago, when I sort of made it a rule that I'm not going to
[01:50:57.180 --> 01:51:03.100]   look at my phone when I have downtime, I was way, I distinctly remember the first time I tried this
[01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:07.500]   thing. I don't know if this was in San Francisco or LA where I'm sitting in that area waiting for
[01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:12.140]   that little shuttle bus that will take you to the gate or whatever. And this is a place where I would
[01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:17.740]   like check Twitter, check Instagram, I said, no, I'm going to sit here and just look at the letter A
[01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:23.020]   in that sign in the middle of that word. I'm just going to do nothing but look at that A and not take
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:28.380]   my focus out of it. And by the time it was like 15 minute wait, I was like, I felt like I slept
[01:51:28.380 --> 01:51:33.740]   for about eight hours. So now that's a rule, I try not to check my phone for to fill this time.
[01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:37.900]   I try to get especially in a high stress situation like that where it's like, I don't know if I'm
[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:41.820]   going to make my game. I don't know if I know. I still got to go check my slides for tomorrow,
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:47.980]   like, Nope, just stare at that letter A in the word baggage. Either of those two A's will work,
[01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:53.420]   just do nothing but stare at it and enjoy the black space in the white space, the little triangle,
[01:51:53.420 --> 01:51:59.260]   the middle. Try. Yeah. Okay. I'd be curious. Try. Oh, it's it doesn't, you know, nice thing about
[01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:04.940]   head spaces. It's like you have a whole course of stuff and and so forth. But this is these are
[01:52:04.940 --> 01:52:12.060]   just simple guided meditations. You can choose the sound you want. Ohms or waterfalls or white
[01:52:12.060 --> 01:52:17.580]   noise. I'm going to have a little sound here. I'll turn it up so you can you hear it. And then
[01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:22.380]   you can have a little guided meditation with this and you set them out of time.
[01:52:22.380 --> 01:52:29.900]   I think it's just kind of neat. And then your oak tree grows as you as you go. I think he's I
[01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:34.780]   think Kevin's done a really nice job and he gives it away. So that's pretty that's pretty neat to
[01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:45.580]   oak is a free app on iOS only. All right, Renee. All right. So you Leo, you said this was pronounced
[01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:51.820]   halide. Is that correct? Silver halide. Those are the crystals that are in the old style film.
[01:52:51.820 --> 01:52:55.900]   And that makes a lot of sense because Sebastian DeWitt, like all good, harder people is a huge
[01:52:55.900 --> 01:53:01.100]   like a fan. I'm letting it right now. This is an iPhone app and it's it's newly updated for
[01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:08.380]   iPhone 10 as well. And it's just a beautiful he is a longtime photographer, longtime,
[01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:14.300]   you know, image professional. He worked at Apple. He did the stitched leather on Find My Friends.
[01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:20.380]   He did double twist. No, really? Yeah, totally. He did double twist, which was the really good app
[01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:25.740]   for Android. He actually invented in the early days anti-aliasing for Pentile displays when
[01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:31.020]   they first became a thing. So really, really good designer. And this is the app that he's been
[01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:35.180]   making himself for a while. Well, he has a partner. He does a design for it. And it's just a very
[01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:40.620]   beautiful camera app, but it has a very tactile interface. It lets you shoot in RAW, which is what
[01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:44.540]   you were mentioning earlier. So you can really pull, you know, manipulate all that data. It lets
[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:49.660]   you get to the depth data, the manual controls, the focusing, the exposure, all of that stuff.
[01:53:49.660 --> 01:53:54.860]   And in a way that is very tactile. Like, I think he really wanted to pull out the tactility.
[01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:58.700]   Is that a word? I'm gonna say it anyway. The tactility of the interface. And make it
[01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:03.340]   something that was joyful for you to use, even though you're using a modern sort of a gadget.
[01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:08.220]   So there are a lot of third party camera apps. They all do similar things, but in very different
[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:13.420]   ways. And this is just a very, very nice way. It might suit the way that you shoot what it's got.
[01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:17.420]   You just swipe up to get more. Like, it's very simple to start, but you can swipe up to get
[01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:21.820]   more controls. You can swipe over to do more manual things. You can tap between JPEG or
[01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:26.620]   now heave and RAW to be able to get all that data from the sensor. And I was shooting with it in
[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:30.060]   New York City when I first got iPhone 10. And I really, really liked it.
[01:54:30.060 --> 01:54:35.820]   It's got manual focus. I do like it that as you're doing an exposure, you swipe up or down to
[01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:41.020]   brighten your darken it. That's a very natural thing to do. And the good thing about it in the
[01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:45.420]   iPhone 10 is you can really trust the display to give you a good readout on what you're getting.
[01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:50.540]   You swipe sideways here. You can change to manual focus. This is nice. You're right.
[01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:55.340]   I like it. This is very interesting. You can pull up to get a few more extra.
[01:54:55.340 --> 01:55:00.140]   Would you use this as your daily camera or just for special?
[01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:04.300]   I use it for photo walks. I really subscribed to what Andy mentioned a few shows ago where
[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:09.420]   the strength of iPhones built-in camera is from pocket to shot. It's very fast and you almost
[01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:13.100]   always get something you can use, especially if you take a few shots. But when I'm doing a
[01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:17.100]   photo walk or I'm intending to do photography, I'll typically go to a third party app because
[01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:21.100]   they give me access to those more thoughtful controls and parameters that I want when I'm
[01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:24.620]   sort of my mind clicks from, I wasn't expecting an issue. I need to get that picture because that
[01:55:24.620 --> 01:55:28.860]   kit is so cute right now to I'm deliberately going out and I want to get a bunch of good
[01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:36.380]   photography. Now tell me what this does because if I swipe right, I can get the depth camera.
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:40.780]   It's giving me this weird kind of- As like portrait mode where it's recording the depth
[01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:46.140]   data from the photograph along with just the regular picture data. What do I do with this?
[01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:49.820]   I mean, it looks weird. I need to get burns into the picture so you can do all sorts of
[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:53.260]   things later. You can get portrait mode off of it or you can apply the effects to it.
[01:55:53.260 --> 01:55:59.020]   Okay, so I have the raw, this doesn't, this is just additional information that's put in the picture.
[01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:02.380]   And then I could, what would I edit it with photos?
[01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:05.900]   Full- more examples. You can pull it into Photoshop now and in Photoshop they will put the depth
[01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:10.220]   data into a separate channel and you can even manipulate that channel and do anything you want
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:13.100]   with any food you're fixing it up if the edge detection isn't great.
[01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:17.500]   I love it that you have a histogram that is very useful. You can turn that off and on, of course,
[01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:22.380]   but that is very useful. Those horns are getting like, he uses it for a histogram and there's a
[01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:26.060]   new Reddit app called Apollo that gives you a volume slider in the left horn.
[01:56:26.060 --> 01:56:33.420]   Yeah, so left horn is histogram, right horn is the brightness. So I really do like that that
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:38.700]   you can see that. That is pretty good use of the horns. And it's out of the way.
[01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:42.300]   It's like a complex in the ears. Yeah, embrace the ears. It's like a watch
[01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:46.140]   complication. It's peripheral information. It's not what you're staring at, but it's in the
[01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:51.180]   corner of your eye if you ever need to look at it. This is sweet. The idea that the great thing
[01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:55.020]   about that placement is that it leaves the preview area completely
[01:56:55.020 --> 01:57:00.620]   un-sessed with. So you see nothing but the picture. I've noticed, for instance, when I
[01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:05.820]   switched your new camera three years ago, a lot of my pictures were framed with empty space at the
[01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:12.460]   top because the default place where they put exposure data was stretched on the top there.
[01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:16.060]   So it's really cool that they're basically using those two ears for information that otherwise
[01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:20.860]   we'd be covering up parts of your photo. I might actually put this in place of my camera.
[01:57:21.260 --> 01:57:26.780]   App on the dock and use this more. What do you think? Yeah, no, it's
[01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:30.300]   totally because you can get to the default camera in many ways. Now you can use it through
[01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:34.940]   the touchpot. You can use this wipe sideways. You can use the you can just ask Siri for it if
[01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:38.700]   you want to. So it's nice to have those other apps available. Yeah. I mean, the camera does
[01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:47.100]   video, which this doesn't. So wow, halide. Yes. Very nice. Five nine five dollars. 4.99 in the
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:53.980]   US. Speaking of video, quick plugs, I already called while put up her iPhone 10 camera view,
[01:57:53.980 --> 01:57:59.980]   which is entirely the world roller derby championships shot. She went with all the ESPN
[01:57:59.980 --> 01:58:05.260]   photographers with their giant cameras and she sat there and she shot it with an iPhone 10.
[01:58:05.260 --> 01:58:09.340]   And she was really happy with the result. It was more constrained like she had to pick her shots
[01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:14.940]   far more carefully than someone with an infinite zoom lens. But she got some amazing, especially
[01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:20.620]   the slow mo footage. She got some amazing 4K and slow mo footage. These are gorgeous photos.
[01:58:20.620 --> 01:58:27.580]   Yeah. Really, really nice job. Yeah, that's imore.com, folks. Yeah. Look at that.
[01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:32.540]   Now, so she didn't skate. She just watched from the sound. She skied us. She did all her matches
[01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:36.380]   and then she put it on her video hat and went to the media pit and the photo pit and started
[01:58:36.380 --> 01:58:40.380]   going and started recording other matches. I wonder, so the so she has this picture of her
[01:58:41.420 --> 01:58:46.780]   with her iPhone and all these guys with their big cannons. I wonder if they're
[01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:50.380]   side-eyeing her. Yeah, I wonder really how much grief she got.
[01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:57.100]   That's pretty funny. I bet one of the things that made her shots as good, if not better,
[01:58:57.100 --> 01:59:02.140]   is that she just came from actually participating. She knows what's going on here.
[01:59:02.140 --> 01:59:06.140]   Yeah. So exactly. She knows where to go. She knows where she can read where the action is going to
[01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:13.820]   be. Yes, you can't take a one-five hundredth of a second shot at 10,000 ISO, but you don't need
[01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:17.980]   that kind of stuff when you know that, okay, in three seconds, that jammer is going to be sitting
[01:59:17.980 --> 01:59:21.420]   right there and three people who are blocking are going to be on their butts. I better have
[01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:27.020]   the camera ready for that. Right. Yeah. She's got the, oh, wow.
[01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:34.620]   Very nice. imore.com, the place to go to find out, to see that and find out all about what you
[01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:41.180]   can do with your iPhone, your Apple Watch, your iPad. I only said Mac a couple of times in this

[01:59:45.900 --> 01:59:51.980]   to get the iMac Pro, Renee? Pardon me. Sorry. I mean, they were testing toxic waste warning in my
[01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:56.220]   city and they said it might go off. I just quickly went and closed the window. Holy cow.
[01:59:56.220 --> 01:59:59.580]   Yeah. Okay. It was a warning or anything, but I forgot that it was happening in four
[01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:03.660]   toxic waste warning coming up in three minutes. You know what? We're not going to end the show. I
[02:00:03.660 --> 02:00:07.740]   want to hear it. I want to check the weather stripping for her to work like that. That's
[02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:13.340]   you need a molecule. I'm going to have one sent to you right away. Yeah, totally. Holy cow.
[02:00:13.340 --> 02:00:17.900]   Holy cow. I just ran quickly and closed the close one. Renee Richie. imore.com
[02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:24.220]   in Montreal with the toxic waste is about to be released. Yeah. Thank you so much. I appreciate
