[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.360]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show the covers,
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.200]   the latest news from Cupertino.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.280]   And there is much news from Cupertino,
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.480]   but let me introduce the panel first
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.240]   before we get started on all that stuff.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.000]   Starting with Mr. Alex Lindsey of the Pixelcore.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.840]   Back from his travels, yay, Alex.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.720]   It's good to be back.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.960]   Pixelcore.com for that multimedia guild of artists,
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.000]   Pixelcore.tv for all the shows you guys do.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.520]   And you're building a neat studio in kind of part
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.480]   of the Twitch studios.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.480]   Yep.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.440]   Yours is coming along a lot faster than ours is.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.640]   Ours is much simpler than yours.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.160]   And so we're having a green screen stage motion capture studio
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.520]   and then probably a little physical studio
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.440]   with little saw loss.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.680]   It's going to be-- it's purely geek.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.960]   There's no shininess to it.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.720]   And I lease our side out to somebody
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.960]   and just come use your side.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.000]   Oh, man.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.520]   Oh, man.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.640]   Yeah, so what-- you know, Kelly from all I want truck built,
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.560]   but built the side.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.400]   Cove is already done.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.880]   Cove's done.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.040]   We're just getting ready to paint it.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.840]   Cove is the curved, seamless kind of background
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.840]   that you need for a green screen,
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.120]   because you can have any corners.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.280]   Yeah, so it looks beautiful.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.000]   How does he do that?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.560]   Does he soak the wood to bake it to bend like that?
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.120]   You know, we should ask him how he does that.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.520]   I'd love to.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.920]   I don't know.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.600]   I wasn't even there.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.320]   I was like traveling.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.160]   I came back and was done.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.840]   So beautiful.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.440]   It looks like a skate ramp.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.720]   Oh, and it's really thick.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.520]   A lot of those can be really thick.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.040]   Oh, really?
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.400]   Oh, that's good.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.360]   He said you could--
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.880]   You could--
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.880]   You could skateboard on it.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.600]   Not that I'm going to, because that would ruin the paint job.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.600]   No, please don't.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.640]   You haven't painted it yet.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.400]   Still chance.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.080]   There's still time.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.400]   Maybe we should do it before.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.160]   Also, with this Don McAllister back
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.960]   from his sojourn, his trip around the Cape of Horn.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.440]   Indeed.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.880]   Indeed.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.480]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.560]   Nice to be back again.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.680]   Good to see you, Don.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.880]   Don and his wife Barbara were on the McManial 11
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.920]   and then we went down to South America.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.640]   Patagonia.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.080]   I've got some incriminating video footage of a certain disco.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.240]   Oh, no.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.480]   Oh, no.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.480]   I'll have to explain.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.600]   I was just imitating the penguins we saw.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.560]   There was--
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.640]   It was-- oh, dear.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.120]   Never mind.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.560]   It's also bad to see you.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.680]   It's a good story.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.640]   That's Andy Anadko from the Chicago Sun.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.040]   Time's back from his trip out here.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.040]   Last week, thank you for your help
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.680]   on the coverage of the iPad 2 announcement.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.480]   Well, thank you for underwriting my travel expenses again.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.280]   It's always good when two interlocking needs--
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.720]   I'm glad you could be here for that.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.120]   I do apologize for last week's Mac break weekly.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.840]   We had hoped to do an actual show after the intro
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.680]   and, unfortunately, for technical reasons we couldn't.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.520]   So we just released our coverage of the product intro,
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.400]   which covered it, but it just took a longer time for us
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.760]   to say the salient features.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.880]   And then Andy joined us on this week in Google
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.240]   so that we could at least get his expertise.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.920]   Do you have an iPad 2 yet, Andy?
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.920]   Hey, let me introduce you to--
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.960]   Oh, Sparky.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.480]   Here we go.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.480]   He's a stretchy dog.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.480]   Hey, Sparky.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.400]   How you do?
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.200]   Oh, he's a piece of little shy.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.920]   But he's very distracting from questions
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.880]   that I really don't want to answer.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.600]   Shut your go, oh, shut your go.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.680]   You know what's--
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.200]   it's interesting, because I haven't even
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.040]   been able to pre-order.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.600]   By now, we would usually be able to pre-order.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   You said, Don, are they putting them on sale Friday in the UK?
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.040]   No.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.880]   No, no, no.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.480]   We've got another two weeks to wait.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.040]   Don't go on sale to-- it's only the US, that's the 11.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.440]   So it's the 25th of March, I think,
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.000]   for the UK and other major territories.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.720]   Now, boy, Genius Report did say--
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.360]   and I have to check--
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.360]   that we would get iOS 4.3 by now.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.000]   It's not out, is it?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.480]   They were wrong.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.440]   I haven't seen it.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.960]   No.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.440]   No.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.560]   Probably by Thursday.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.560]   Well, they were saying 10 a.m. this morning.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.360]   We record on Tuesday, I should say.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.800]   This is March 8th, for those of you listening after the fact.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.360]   Now, boy, Genius Report is saying tomorrow.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.360]   But we know Apple said at least by Friday.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.720]   Friday is 5 p.m. is when the iPad 2 is available in any form.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.280]   Some people have said, oh, the manager at the Apple Store
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.840]   said, I'm sure you'll be able to reserve one,
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.040]   but we haven't even seen the ability to do that yet.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.360]   Yeah, it looks like they're doing the whole--
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.080]   the line is good for PR.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.040]   I feel like that's the reason we're not getting to pre-order.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.480]   Well, that kind of bugs me.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.560]   That's throwing your consumers to the lines.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.840]   You disagree, Andy?
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.640]   I disagree.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.200]   I mean, if they were going to do that,
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.120]   gambit, they wouldn't have pre-ordered the first iPad.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.360]   That's what, but then why would they not pre-order this iPad?
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.320]   Then for a million reasons that we can't even conjecture.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.120]   Oh.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.040]   I'm saying that I would not assume that there's--
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.720]   because there's no pre-orders, there's
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.920]   any sort of scheme going on.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.040]   As I've heard from so many different companies,
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.920]   as big as Apple, and sometimes people including Apple,
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.920]   they say, I really wish that the company that I know
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.360]   and that I work for were as clever as to do something
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.040]   as big and smart as the conspiracy
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.800]   that you're suggesting that we're capable of.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.760]   But I mean--
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.120]   Can you come up with a reason other than just to build lines?
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.200]   Because you could put a pre-order.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.560]   You could say, ship it as soon as it's ready.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.880]   You could-- I mean, there's no reason you
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.320]   couldn't put that on the store.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.840]   It strikes me that what they're doing
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.320]   is they're trying to trump up excitement and get people
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.360]   in line at 5 p.m.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.720]   But 5 p.m. even implies that.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.840]   Think of it this way.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.080]   What does specifically does Apple gain
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.520]   by having pre-orders a week early?
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.880]   It's good for consumers so that I don't have to--
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.080]   OK, but what is--
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.080]   What is it?
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.880]   It's good for Apple.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.760]   We saw a happen with Verizon that when the iPhone came off
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.560]   of Verizon, and there were no lines.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.320]   And tons of people pre-ordered it.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.800]   That strikes me as an average--
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   The thing is--
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.040]   But no, look, do you not realize that the iPad has close
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.840]   to 87%, 88% of its target market.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.120]   That is the hugest consumer phenomenon
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.840]   in the past three or four years.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.440]   Do you think that Apple's particularly worried
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.680]   that there are only a few people lined up outside?
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.360]   Amal, Apple--
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.960]   Yeah, but how much better for Apple?
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.360]   If right before the low-pitched news goes--
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.680]   You bet along a lot.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.200]   Really?
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.040]   I think you're overestimating the value of that.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.480]   Really, they care about selling $10 million
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.960]   in the first three months.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.200]   And if they can do--
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.280]   They're the first six months, or whatever target that is.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.240]   I don't think that they're so concerned about--
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.080]   There should be video of really long lines.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.680]   They're going to get as much press as they want.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.760]   Actually, Gene Munster at Gartner says,
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.160]   "There won't be lines because it is available at AT&T
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.920]   Verizon, Apple stores, Target, and Walmart,
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.880]   all at the same time."
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.840]   So that's the case.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.800]   That's the case.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.600]   If that's the case, then it is true.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.560]   I mean, if Apple does that, then that is an anti-line move.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.840]   Yeah, but they did that with AT&T.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.840]   But the big thing is--
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.840]   There will be lines.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.840]   Most people--
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.840]   They're going to be lines.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.840]   Starting at 4 AM on Friday.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.840]   There's already lines.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.840]   There's some dude who's already got it.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.840]   There's always some dude.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.840]   Some dude does not align.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.840]   Yeah, you need two suckers to get a line.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.840]   So the--
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.840]   Otherwise, it's just loitering, right?
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.840]   Right.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.840]   So anyway, the problem is that I think it does do a lot for Apple
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.840]   because nobody lines up for any other phone or any other device.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.840]   We don't see these lines for anything else.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.840]   It's not like Apple doesn't want--
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.840]   Apple's so successful that they don't want additional
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.840]   positive publicity.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.840]   Yeah, because it's--
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.840]   But it does hurt them, I think.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.840]   I think it hurts--
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.840]   See, you made a distinction, Andy, between what's good for Apple
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.840]   and good for consumers.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.840]   But I think what's good for Apple is what's good for their
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.840]   customers, don't you think?
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.840]   In the long run?
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.840]   Yes, but you have to see--
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.840]   Here's what I'm thinking in response to all this.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.840]   That what does Apple gain by having pre-orders ready a week
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.840]   before?
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.840]   And helping customers is also a good thing.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.840]   But specifically, what do they gain from it?
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.840]   Not specifically anything.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.840]   So I don't believe that--
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.840]   Then why do they do it all this time?
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.840]   This is the first time they haven't done that.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.840]   I'm saying that I don't know the reason why.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.840]   And that I would have--
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.840]   If you were going to put like five or six different theories
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.840]   in front of me, the theory that they want the video of all
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.840]   kinds of long lines in front of the Apple stores on Friday,
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.840]   I don't think that that's something that they would
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.840]   particularly care about.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.840]   They know that people are going to hear about this iPad,
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:13.840]   whether we really realize that the lead paragraph in my piece
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.840]   last week for the Sun Times was absolutely true.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.840]   I sat down in my hotel lobby to write my on-the-spot piece
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.840]   for the Sun Times about the iPad, too.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.840]   I took out my iPad and within like five seconds,
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.840]   an electrician from the hotel walk past saw my iPad and said,
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.840]   quote, "I think I guess you're going to have to buy yourself a new
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.840]   one of those, the new ones coming out on March 11."
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.840]   And this was like two hours after the event.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.840]   And ran a few people.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.840]   So I don't think that they need that kind of a stone.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.840]   Samsung needed to sell out.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.840]   And I would believe that they would manufacture only like 50,000
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.840]   of them just to make sure they could say,
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.840]   "Oh my God, we sold out, we did not anticipate the demand.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.840]   Holy cats, we--"
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.840]   But I don't have that.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.840]   I think that the kind of the middle road of all of this
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.840]   is I think that there may be a constrained supply of the iPad
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.840]   twos, and so what you don't want to do is commit all of those
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.840]   iPad twos to pre-order because they would sell them all.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.840]   So then there wouldn't be anything available for the stores.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.840]   That makes sense.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.840]   I think that that's probably like the middle, like you want to make
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.840]   sure that you're going to-- because if you sell out the first week
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.840]   and the first day and everyone orders them the first day,
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.840]   you can say, "Well, it's going to be two weeks before you get it
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.840]   because--"
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.840]   But that's going to happen, right?
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.840]   But you don't want everyone pre-ordering and feeling like they got
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.840]   gypped because it didn't show up the day of.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.840]   So I think that my guess is that they're not clear that they can supply.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.840]   So next week we will sit here, and if they're all sold out,
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.840]   if you can't get one for love or money, then I think that
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.840]   that would probably confirm what you're saying.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.840]   Which would also be--
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.840]   But if next week we're sitting here and you can walk into an apple
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.840]   store and get one, it's like, "Hmm."
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.840]   Right.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.840]   The problem is as well as with the staggered launch days as well,
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.840]   because you've got the international customers who are sort of
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.840]   expecting two weeks later.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.840]   I know when the first iPad came out that there was--
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.840]   "Wow!"
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.840]   They pushed the date back.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.840]   They couldn't fulfill all the orders for the international customers,
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.840]   so they actually pushed the date back, and that caused a lot of bad feeling.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.840]   But Apple always like to sort of reinforce the message, don't you,
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.840]   though?
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.840]   They always like to push a bit further.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.840]   So they had this great launch and they got lots of press.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.840]   I do think there is an element of them wanting to have lines on--
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.840]   I'm almost sure on Friday they do want lines.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.840]   They definitely couldn't care less.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.840]   I don't think they don't care less.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.840]   They definitely want lines.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.840]   They want the free PR.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.840]   And you can't buy the PR that they get when they help.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.840]   And let's say it's not bad to get somebody in an Apple store.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.840]   They might buy some other crap.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.840]   Well, can I put it this way?
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:39.840]   I'm sure that the president's staff wants beautiful, cloud-free,
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.840]   piercingly-blue, beautiful skies for when he stands outside
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.840]   and gives us during Fourth of July address.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:52.840]   Would he be willing, like China did, to spend two weeks sending airplanes
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.840]   dowsing the sky with all kinds of chemicals to clear it up
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.840]   to make sure that would happen?
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.840]   I think there's a distinction there.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.840]   Good.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.840]   I hope you're right, Andy, because I would hate to think that Apple
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.840]   would do something for PR that disadvantages its customer.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.840]   I think if I was going to lay odds, I'd say it's because they have
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.840]   a constrained supply.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.840]   Yeah, I don't manage to exist.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.840]   I don't manage to exist.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.840]   That's conjecture, but of all the theories that could be put forward,
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.840]   that's the one that I would believe.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.840]   They would say, well, why take it where we don't get an advantage
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.840]   by pre-settling, let's just make absolutely sure that everybody who
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.840]   shows up at the Apple store the first weekend who wants an iPad
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.840]   can get one.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.840]   So if you really care about iPad 2, you will get your ass down to
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.840]   an Apple store.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.840]   You can see how Apple manipulates us.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.840]   Now they've got to say, rush out on Friday.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.840]   Don't wait until Saturday.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.840]   Rush out on Friday.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.840]   You better get in line if you want one, don't you think?
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.840]   Are you getting in line?
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.840]   I can't.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.840]   I'm on a plane.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.840]   I could go to -- I still haven't found out if the Apple store in
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.840]   Austin is going to stay open because I get in Austin at 10 p.m.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.840]   that night.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.840]   We're on a plane at 5 p.m.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.840]   They won't tell us.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.840]   They won't tell us.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.840]   They won't tell us.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:00.840]   So we have -- this is more -- this is more -- you know, Apple does
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.840]   like secrecy.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.840]   An awful lot.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.840]   They won't tell us if they're going to stay open.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.840]   So I don't know what to do.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.840]   I guess I just won't have an iPad 2 for a few days.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.840]   Well, I'll be in line.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.840]   Where?
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.840]   Are you coming to the States just to get one?
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.840]   Well, if you remember last time when the first iPad came out,
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.840]   I was actually -- it was a happy coincidence that was over there
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.840]   with the family.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.840]   And this time I'm going to come over just again.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.840]   You're kidding.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.840]   You're flying to New York City.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.840]   You're going to go to the Fifth Avenue store?
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.840]   But I'm going to --
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.840]   I'm going to do it in a couple of days.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.840]   It's only a short trip.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.840]   I'm going to leave on the Thursday.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.840]   Fly out on the Thursday.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.840]   Pick it up on the Friday.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.840]   Hopefully.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.840]   Get in line.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.840]   Get in early enough to get in line.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.840]   I don't?
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.840]   Get in line.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.840]   There will be a line.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:44.840]   I'm guaranteed there will be a line.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.840]   There will definitely be a line.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   I don't know.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.840]   I'm now going to be there first thing in the morning just to
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.840]   reach around.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.840]   I've seen some friends run over there as well.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:55.840]   And I'll do some sort of voting and tweeting and taking some video and stuff and put it
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.840]   all together.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:01.840]   So we don't know -- Eileen, they haven't told us either whether you could buy one or more.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.840]   And Eileen's going to be there.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.840]   So she's going to try to get one for us.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.840]   People are saying, "Well, you need one so fast so we can review the --"
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.840]   Because unlike Andy, we don't get him ahead of time.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.840]   It's our job.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.840]   We're recording iPad today.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.840]   That is our job.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.840]   That's what I tell Carlita.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.840]   Well, it's our job.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.840]   It is my job.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.840]   I mean, it literally is.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.840]   But that's my job.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.840]   That's why I'm doing it as well.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.840]   I eat and breathe this stuff.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.840]   I do video tutorials on it.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.840]   Two weeks delay.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.840]   It might be even longer if they do push back the international launch again.
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.840]   You need to do it.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.840]   No, no, you've got to do it.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.840]   It's not just -- I'm not just going off on a whim.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.840]   There is a definite.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.840]   And I'm also buying two actually.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.840]   I'm going to give -- again, like I did with the first iPad when that came out.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.840]   I'm giving one as a prize to screencast all our members.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.840]   So I believe there's just a limit of two for people.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.840]   So one for me and one as a prize.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.840]   And here's the guy in line.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.840]   So I don't see him in the tent, but he's got a good position for his tent.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.840]   I'm kind of surprised that they're letting him just put a tent.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.840]   Oh, letting him.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:04.880]   Gee, please, whatever you do, don't put a tent in front of our store implying that there
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.520]   might be a demand for the iPad to -- Oh, no, wait a minute.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.640]   Andy says they don't need to do that.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.640]   No need.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.160]   We'll sell plenty of them without that.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.240]   We don't need to resort to --
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.240]   Okay, you're right, and I'm wrong.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.240]   Apple is in real trouble here.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.240]   They're not going to sell many of these at all.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.240]   No, they're going to sell out -- however many they've got, they could have 15 million in
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.240]   stock, and they will sell them out.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.240]   It's pretty obvious.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.240]   I understand they're getting an endorsement from Jerry Lewis.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.240]   That's how important it is because celebrity endorsements in.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.240]   What I think is crazy is just how much of the repeat.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:43.240]   Everybody has the same freaking picture of the same freaking tent with the same -- you
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.240]   know, here's Leander Connie.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.240]   The first iPad two lines are forming.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.240]   It's 110!
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.240]   Justin Wagner, this is in Dallas.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.240]   MacCast.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.240]   Reader has taken this picture.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.240]   He's the first person in the line.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.240]   He's also -- apparently, the only person in the line.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.240]   And he has a website.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.240]   [laughter]
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.240]   Hardly, you know.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.240]   I wonder if he used Squarespace.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.240]   Look at this.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.240]   This is his website.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.240]   He's got the launch.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.240]   Come to igestonofficial.com.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.240]   Oh, please.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.240]   It's like the Paris Hilton of iPad launches.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.240]   You're an ILS hole.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.240]   You're a filthy ILS hole.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.240]   We see right through each other.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.240]   You're garbage.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.240]   These two 99-hour chat rooms says that's not a line.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.240]   That's a squatter.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.240]   [laughter]
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.240]   So, okay, let's play the game.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.240]   Predictions, first weekend sales.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.240]   Look, they sold a million Verizon iPhones in the first weekend.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.240]   They're going to have to sell, I put, five million in the first weekend.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.240]   They'll sell everyone they've got, right?
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.240]   How many they have is really what we're asking.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.240]   I see.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.240]   Three million.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.240]   Three million?
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.240]   Don?
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.240]   Yeah, it's going to be down to what they've got.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.240]   I think they'll be able to sell what they've got to be honest.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.240]   I agree with you.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.240]   So, we don't know what the supply is, but I think they will.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.240]   You're right.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.240]   Absolutely sell out.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.240]   That makes it really complicated when Galaxy says that we've sold two million galaxies in the first four months or whatever.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.240]   Don't get me started on the smooth sell-through.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.240]   So, Alex, Andy, what do you predict?
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.240]   I have no idea.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.240]   Remember, it took them a month to sell a million of the first iPads.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.240]   I can't even guess.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:32.240]   But that's what, and I think that was what really, that's what we got from Steve's talk last week is that they didn't know how the first iPad was going to be received.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:38.240]   They know now that they can do no wrong, that the competition can't compete.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.240]   It gets into that whole price thing as well.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.240]   The price versus all of the prices right?
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:51.240]   But don't people really go in and end up buying the 3G and they kind of say, "Well, as long as I'm getting 16 gigs, somebody will get the same."
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.240]   Someone asked me, "How much, it's $500 right?"
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.240]   And I said, "They looked at mine."
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.240]   I was like, "Well, I pretty much just buy the $867 version."
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.240]   I think that's the one that's got the 64 gigs in the...
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.240]   And you go in thinking you're going to go in to cheat, but then you're like, "Well, I am going to have this for at least a year."
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.240]   Nine months in my days.
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:17.240]   I think people will be more educated now, though, because we understand the use case, we understand where we're going to use it.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.240]   So we've got the experience now of using it for that length of time.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:29.240]   So I think probably people will be able to give more advice to people when people do ask them what sort of iPad should they have now, because we've used it for such a long time.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.240]   So I think people have a clearer idea this time around of what they need.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.240]   I guess my thing is I use my 3G all the time, my iPad's always full.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.240]   There is a question mark now because the new iOS 4.3 has tethering.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:45.240]   So if you have an iPhone, which I presume most people buy iPads have an iPhone, you may not need the 3G.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.240]   You saw the fine print on that, right?
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.240]   What?
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:54.240]   If you sign up for tethering, they are going to take away your unlimited bastards.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.240]   They killed Kenny.
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.240]   There it is.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:01.240]   Anytime they give you something that looks like it's too good to be true for an AT&T, it is.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:08.240]   But they have promised that if we don't do that, that we will be grandfathered, grandpa pod in on our unlimited 5GB.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.240]   For the iPad?
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.240]   It's unlimited 5GB or is it unlimited unlimited unlimited?
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.240]   I'm sorry, I never, I always ask this question because I never understand.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.240]   I don't know whether it's unlimited 5GB or unlimited.
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.240]   I don't know.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.240]   It's so...
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:27.240]   And now we have to read the user agreements from two different carriers instead of one.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.240]   No.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.240]   Damn it.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:36.240]   Well, we'll talk some more about the iPad 2 because I'd like to get your kind of your general thoughts about it.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:43.240]   We're starting to see, well, I don't know, Macworld UK put up benchmarks and pulled them down.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.240]   I guess that they were premature.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.240]   Oops.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.240]   But they were somewhat disappointing.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:52.240]   There's some thought that maybe that isn't an A9 dual core, that it might be an A8 dual core.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.240]   We'll talk about that.
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:03.240]   And if the iPad 2 is enough for you iPad 1, we iPad 1 owners to upgrade or should we just stick with what we got?
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.240]   Hmm.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.240]   And what about the camera?
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.240]   Does anybody know?
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.240]   Does anybody know?
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.240]   Shut your good ball, cuz...
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.240]   Shut your good ball, cuz...
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.240]   Anybody...
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.240]   Shut your good ball, anybody...
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.240]   Anybody know?
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.240]   Who might know?
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.240]   The actual resolution, the native resolution of that camera.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.240]   Does any bueller...
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.240]   All right, let's...
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.240]   He's got the...
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.240]   He's bullet...
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.240]   I've got the little squeezy.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.240]   Oh, come on.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.240]   Come on.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.240]   Okay.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.240]   Okay.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.240]   You got it.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.240]   Okay.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.240]   Oh, correct.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.240]   You're such a great distraction.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.240]   Hey, how many people remember Smile on my Mac?
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.240]   Yeah, great company.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.240]   Now they're called Smile Software.com.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.240]   We love them.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:50.240]   I use a text expander like "Saves My Life" every single day.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.240]   They have a product that I really love called PDF Pen.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.240]   I've recommended in the past...
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.240]   Remember, I recommend an open source program that was kind of okay
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.240]   that allowed you to edit PDFs.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.240]   Whoa, this is so much better.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.240]   They have PDF Pen and PDF Pen Pro.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:09.240]   If you go to Smile Software/MacBreak, you can get a free demo.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.240]   So if you...
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.240]   We all live these days.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.240]   We wish we could live these days without fax machines.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.240]   And one solution, of course, is to use PDFs.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:26.240]   And I have to admit, I've been opening PDFs in Photoshop,
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:33.240]   pasting in responses, signatures, printing, and then printing as a PDF
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.240]   just to get this stuff in here.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:41.240]   Or maybe you spend the money on the expensive Adobe stuff that lets you edit the PDF.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.240]   We've got some inexpensive software.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.240]   Well, it's getting that whole.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.240]   You got to sign stuff.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.240]   I mean, that's the best.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.240]   You still have to do it.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.240]   And most people now, at least they'll take back a PDF as the final product.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.240]   Right.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.240]   As long as it's bound into there.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.240]   But you need to do it.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.240]   And that's the number one reason I use it.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:00.240]   Well, wait until your kids get a little older because you start filling out a lot of forms too.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.240]   You got the medical form.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.240]   You got the parent question.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.240]   I fill out a lot of PDFs.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.240]   Fortunately, people do use PDFs now a lot.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.240]   And my fax software will send it to me as a PDF, which makes it much easier.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.240]   That's great.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.240]   So this is about a tenth of cost of Adobe's product.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.240]   It's called PDF Pen.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.240]   They call it the affordable PDF toolkit from Smile Software.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:24.240]   It allows you to edit your PDFs, make changes without going back to the original.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.240]   Go paperless.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:31.240]   You can OCR it to get the characters out of it, which is really great.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.240]   You can add text, images, and signatures.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.240]   In fact, they have a library, which is really nice.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.240]   So I have Jennifer's signature, my signature, my initials, her initials.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.240]   How does security work on that?
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.240]   Is there a login that you need?
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.240]   Well, no, it's not started online.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.240]   It's on my computer.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.240]   Right.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.240]   So I, well, of course I have a login.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.240]   I don't let people use my computer.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.240]   No, I was just asking if there was a login.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.240]   You know, that's good question.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.240]   I haven't tried that, but I suppose there is.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.240]   I mean, it's a lot within you.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.240]   You have a personal library within the application.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.240]   It's within your application.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.240]   It's not online.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.240]   Right.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.240]   So I actually did all the video tutorials for PDF.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.240]   Oh, did you?
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.240]   As well.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.240]   I did.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.240]   So if you go to the website, you'll hear my Dorset tones.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.240]   Yeah, it's a great, great product.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.240]   It's one of those products that the first time you see it, I think people think of a PDF
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.720]   and they don't realize that you, there is like a text layer within PDFs that that's
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.240]   the whole whole OCR thing.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.920]   You know, you can actually search by things, but they don't realize you can actually go
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:29.120]   in and edit the text and it's, it's to quote one of Steve's recent phrases.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.120]   It's pretty magical.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.120]   It's revolutionary.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.880]   Open it and you can actually replace an image within a PDF.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.880]   Why didn't you know that?
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:36.880]   I haven't done that yet.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:42.760]   You can check on the text and actually edit the text and it's, so it's not just sort of
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.760]   writing on the PDF.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.360]   There's tons of stuff in there that you can do.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.400]   There's all things like you can put redacted.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.640]   You can search a whole PDF, you know, if you're doing legal stuff and you want to
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:55.120]   redact a particular name or a sentence or something, you can actually put that in.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.680]   It'll search through and redact it.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.080]   Like, you can do all sorts of things, but that's really, really clever.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:06.680]   So if you go to the website, which is smile software.com/pdfpin, actually smile software.com/macbreak,
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.680]   do that.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.680]   That way we get credit.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.680]   Macbreak.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.680]   You'll see Don's.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.080]   I didn't, you know what Don?
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.520]   You were probably saying, "Oh, you had Don on because you knew you were going to be doing."
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.040]   I did not know.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.040]   I swear to God, I did not know that you had done these.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.040]   That's right.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.040]   No.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.360]   And so, but they were smart to get you to do them because nobody does better...
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.560]   There's a different ways of opening PDFs in PDF Pro.
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.600]   Nobody does a better job of these screencasts than Don.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.520]   So find out all it can do.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.520]   There's two versions.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:38.680]   There's PDF Pen and then that's $59.95 and then the PDF Pen Pro, which is $99.95, will
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:44.360]   let you create interactive forms yourself as well as convert websites to multi-page PDFs
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.040]   and the hyperlinks are preserved, which is fantastic.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.320]   So I take it, Don, you agree this is a good product.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.120]   Yeah, no, it's a fantastic product.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.120]   That's awesome.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.120]   Very, very good.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.120]   You can see why Don.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.600]   It will buy default open in preview.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.600]   Preview is the default.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.240]   This is so, you're just so comforting.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:04.480]   If I wanted to open it in PDF Pen, what I could do, well, I could obviously go into PDF
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.880]   Pen and do a file open or I can right click.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.880]   Look at this.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.880]   They open with, I love this.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.280]   In fact, I changed all my PDFs to just open in PDF Pen.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.280]   I don't want preview anymore.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.280]   I love PDF Pen.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.280]   Now, to change the default association.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.280]   Oh, so he's going to show you how to do that.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.280]   There you go.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.280]   Yeah, see myself at the right.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.280]   I was showing you because I thought you were talking.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.400]   I'm very confused.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.400]   I'm easily confused.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.640]   I might change this too.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.160]   So give it a try, smile software.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.160]   We love them.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.720]   Gene's been here on the show many times.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.600]   She's really a stalwart in the Mac community.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.280]   She was at our party after a Mac world.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.440]   I just love that whole company.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.600]   And I'm really thrilled to have them as an advertiser.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:51.720]   Just continuing in my strategy of only advertising stuff I really, really like.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.080]   Just wish I liked more stuff, I guess.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:58.440]   About this time I was wishing I liked more stuff.

[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.920]   Lately, it has come to my attention that some of you use other coupon codes, not other companies
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.640]   coupon codes, but like something like Twitter or something.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.240]   And then we don't get credit for it.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.880]   So please use Mac Break.

[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.720]   Those guys make too much money to it.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:18.720]   Exactly.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.680]   We don't need to support them.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:24.040]   Let the world know who you're loyal to.

[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.040]   we believe that it is twice as fast as the previous one.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.520]   So if there's anything that was a little bit slow on the iPad, we think it's going to
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.960]   be fast as it is right now.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:25.080]   If they tell you how much application RAM is it, you know that there are people who will
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:28.840]   just simply look at a bullet point chart and say, "Oh, well, look, the Samsung Galaxy
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:32.920]   Tab has 513 kilobytes of application memory."
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.720]   The iPad 2 only has 512.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:35.720]   Okay.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:36.720]   I guess my favorite decision now.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:37.720]   That's a higher number.
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.720]   Right.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.520]   And I agree with Apple to some degree.
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:44.120]   I mean, I think that there was a lot of BS that went off on that launch.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:48.840]   There was a lot of stuff spread out, spread around.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:52.760]   But I do agree that it is much more about functionality than features.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:57.400]   I mean, I think that that's in this next generation of these tablets, you really have
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:01.080]   to focus on functionality and not on the speed of every little thing.
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:05.760]   Because that's not what creates that seamless experience that has you want to carry it around
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:06.760]   all the time.
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.960]   I mean, the iPad 2 does not have widgets.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.440]   The Enbrough tablets do.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.680]   So again, you get a little bullet in that part of the bullet point chart, but does that
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.760]   mean that an Android tablet is better than the iPad?
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.440]   No, it doesn't.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.360]   People are saying, "Oh, you can't have a dual core AA.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.360]   Of course you can't.
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.920]   You just put two AA, it's in a chip."
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:27.920]   There's no, it's just a...
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:28.920]   I thought it was a five.
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.920]   I thought it was a dual AA.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:30.920]   Okay.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:31.920]   Apple call...
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:32.920]   Okay.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:34.360]   It is an A5.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.360]   That's what Apple calls it.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:39.880]   But we believe, I think some believe, it's an ARM specification.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.280]   And the question is whether it uses the ARM 8 or the ARM 9.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:46.320]   The ARM 9 is a true dual core as used in the Tegra.
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.320]   Okay.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:51.160]   But some are saying now, "Mm, maybe that."
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.520]   And you know why it may be relevant?
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:57.960]   It may also be relevant to the iPhone because whatever they've done in the iPad, whatever
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:02.840]   that is in that A5 chip will almost certainly be in the next iPhone, right?
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.840]   Mm-hmm.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.480]   Which is said to making their own chip, though.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.480]   This is their...
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.480]   They're not buying somebody else's chip.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.480]   They're using the ARM design.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.560]   Well, that saves them a lot of money.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.760]   We think they're using the ARM design.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.760]   We don't know what the graphics is.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:15.760]   I don't know.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:16.760]   Get BlessiFixit.com.
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:17.760]   That's when all the instruments...
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.760]   I know.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.760]   I love that when they tear it down.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.760]   It's almost...
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.760]   It's almost...
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:28.120]   Sometimes do you think that there should be like a voluntary like $5 tax on every Apple
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:34.240]   product more than, let's say, $299 and that a panel of 50 people decide that, "You know
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.240]   what?
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:36.240]   I fix it gets 50 cents of the...
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.880]   Of the voluntary tax."
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:42.080]   But because the contributions that they do just to the community of giving this free
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:45.720]   service, everybody in the planet is saying, "Well, we won't know until I fix it tears
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:46.720]   it apart.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:47.720]   Let's just wait."
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:49.720]   Although we still may not know, because isn't it labeled A5?
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:51.800]   I mean, you can't look inside.
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:52.800]   I can't...
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:53.800]   I say it's hard to believe.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:56.280]   Their resources keep expanding with each tear-down.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:00.500]   I'm sure that if they needed to know that answer, I'm sure that they would know what lab
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:01.500]   to send the actual...
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.080]   They would take a buzz saw out of that component.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.500]   They would know who to send it to to then cleave it apart and put it under scanning
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:13.020]   electron microscope to look to see what notices are actually engraved into it for microns
[00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:14.020]   wide.
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:15.020]   True, true.
[00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:16.940]   I think most people just be happy to know how much RAMs in there, because people are
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:17.940]   going crazy on launch.
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:20.260]   Do you know about how much RAMs in it and how much RAMs in it?
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:21.260]   Well, does it matter?
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:24.580]   I mean, there's only 256 in the current iPad.
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.380]   There's 512 in the current iPhone.
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:27.380]   Yeah.
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:28.380]   Yes.
[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.220]   Developers are interested in it.
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:37.460]   No, but for us, I mean, I was amazed that it was only 256 gig in the iPad 1, but
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.340]   again, it worked.
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:40.340]   It's great.
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:42.340]   It performs well.
[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:46.980]   I sort of trust Apple to put as much RAM as it's needed for the next 12 months to cope
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:51.620]   with developments that couldn't process what people are going to plan to do with the iPad.
[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:53.820]   We'll see when I fix it, get the hands on it.
[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:58.100]   You think that part of it might be just a question of we can't make the iPad... we can't
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:03.380]   give the iPad to so much more extra application memory that there'll be a huge difference
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:06.340]   in usability between the new one and the old one.
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:11.500]   I think that they understand that one of the biggest advantages of iOS is that if you buy
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:17.980]   one version of this app, it'll be okay for everybody who has an iPad as opposed to saying,
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:22.340]   "Well, unfortunately, you have the September version of this hardware.
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:25.020]   This one really runs best in the February version of this hardware.
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:27.740]   It's tuned for a faster processor."
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:28.740]   All right.
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:31.460]   Let's get one more rumor out of the way and then we'll change the subject.
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.860]   I want to talk a little bit about the new Mac laptops too.
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:39.580]   But what do you think of the rumor that the...
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:43.700]   I'll go to Andy first because I know he'll debunk this, of the rumor that Apple might
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:46.980]   have an iPad 3 this year?
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:51.860]   I thought that was a long shot to begin with because it would be unprecedented for them
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:55.020]   to release a product like that in the fall.
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:49:01.380]   The fact that they so pointedly last week referred to 2011 as the year of the iPad 2
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:08.020]   kind of implies that the iPad 3 is not something that they're really planning on.
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:09.940]   That's probably even the point of saying that, right?
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:13.900]   I meant to me for this year.
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:18.660]   If they release an iPad 3 at the end of the year at this point, it's not that they couldn't
[00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:22.380]   do that and simply say, "Well, it's still...
[00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:24.580]   The iPad 2 was out for nine months.
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:28.660]   The iPad 3 will be only out for six weeks, so yes, it's still the year of the iPad 2."
[00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:34.220]   But at this point, I'd be really, really surprised if we saw an iPad 3 this year.
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:38.060]   Do you think that April and now March is the ideal time to release an iPad?
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.700]   Doesn't that kill fourth quarter sales a little bit?
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:41.700]   Maybe not.
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:43.380]   Not really because they're still...
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:44.380]   Remember that they...
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:50.100]   I don't know whether the idea of the iPad as a post-PC computer is something that occurred
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:52.740]   to them recently or whether that was part of the strategy all along.
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.140]   It's what we've been saying from day one, right?
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:56.140]   Exactly.
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:50:01.660]   One of the things that I've always felt about the incorrectness of releasing an iPad 3,
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:06.340]   whatever, for the holiday buying season is that I don't think that they're looking to
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:10.100]   sell five to $800 devices as Christmas gifts.
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:14.020]   I think they're looking to sell them to people who are going to school, which means I don't
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:17.740]   know that, but they're looking to sell them to people who buy 500 of these for the school
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:19.140]   system for the upcoming school year.
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:20.900]   So this is the ideal time.
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:23.500]   So seeing that light, this is the perfect time to do it.
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.500]   Yeah.
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:25.500]   Interesting.
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:29.540]   I think it's clear that when Apple first released the iPad, they had no idea.
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:33.020]   I think it was just like, "We don't know who's going to buy this or why."
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:37.420]   I think they've kind of gotten into a pattern where you're going to see an iPad in the spring,
[00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:38.420]   you're going to see an iPhone in the summer.
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.420]   You'd like to keep that pattern of hugely releasing the iPad.
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:41.420]   I hear that pattern.
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:43.660]   Maybe now's the time to bite the bullet.
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:47.200]   If you think that September is the best time to put a new iPad out, bite the bullet one
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:52.740]   year and just adjust it and then you can have an iPhone in June and iPad in September.
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:54.540]   I think they'd be more likely to.
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:59.580]   I mean, they'd be more likely to wait an extra six months than bring it up because I think
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:01.780]   that that does kind of burn people.
[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:04.540]   Six months later, you're releasing another one that's upgraded.
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:05.540]   Well, that's right.
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:06.540]   It would be a hit.
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:07.540]   There's no question it would take a bit.
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:08.540]   People would be hit.
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:09.540]   Bummed.
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:10.540]   People would be bad.
[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:12.340]   They did the right thing with the $100 credit for iPad.
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:13.340]   Yeah.
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.340]   One buyers.
[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:15.340]   Go ahead.
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:16.340]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:17.340]   I didn't mean to cut you off.
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:21.100]   No, I was just going to say, I mean, I suppose it all depends on the strategy for how they
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.100]   move the iPad forward.
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:26.140]   It's still always going to be a single device every year or when they're going to start
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:29.700]   to differentiate and expand into a range of iPads.
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:31.940]   So maybe they do a seven inch or something?
[00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:32.940]   Well, I don't know.
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:37.220]   I think the seven inches is probably not because of the stance they've taken on it.
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.220]   Steve's quite clear.
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:39.220]   He doesn't believe in seven inches.
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:40.220]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:41.220]   Well, he doesn't believe in a lot of things though.
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:43.780]   He didn't leave a video on the iPad down the iPod.
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:44.780]   Did he get stuff like that?
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:49.580]   But it's whether or not they go, they do, if they want to keep it as a sort of a single
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:52.100]   product or would not, they want to split it into a pro level product.
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:56.500]   And I mean, if it's the post PC thing and, you know, they'll, and we're not talking
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:00.580]   the next year, but over the next five or 10 years and they start to move into, you know,
[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:04.380]   the touch computers, whether or not it takes the same route as the MacBooks, you know,
[00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:09.100]   the MacBook Pro, the MacBook, the MacBook itself, where we have different iPads.
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.100]   So it's not an iPad.
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:11.340]   It's a touch.
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:12.860]   You just say it's an iPad touch.
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:13.860]   Yeah.
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:15.860]   Like an iPad touch.
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:19.260]   Because iPads, iPads come out in September.
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:22.060]   Maybe that's it.
[00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:23.380]   I guess it doesn't really matter.
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:24.380]   It's completely unstuckated.
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:29.020]   I mean, even the original rumor was never, you know, it came from nowhere.
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:32.700]   So it actually does matter in the sense that we have people who are saying, well, should
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:36.140]   I buy an iPad two or is there a chance they'll be an iPad three, six months from now?
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:40.220]   And so I think this panel is saying there's, there's very little chance that they will
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:41.220]   do that.
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:42.220]   Yeah.
[00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:45.260]   I mean, it's a high chance that they'll release an iPhone, you know, for those of you buying
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:48.380]   Verizon phones right now, you're a little nuts.
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:52.860]   So I think it's highly likely.
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:55.980]   The rebate is what is the rebate deal?
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:58.180]   Do you have to have bought an Apple store within the last month?
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:52:59.180]   Is that the deal?
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.180]   Well, we'll look that up.
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:01.180]   We don't know.
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:02.180]   Somebody's asking the chevron.
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:03.180]   I don't know.
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:06.940]   Consult your local Apple expert.
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:10.780]   If you if you bought one of the last few weeks, I think you're good.
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:13.420]   I don't think you'd have to buy it at the Apple store.
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:14.420]   That would be silly.
[00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:15.420]   Right.
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:17.100]   I don't think it's foolish.
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:18.700]   Let's take a break.
[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:23.740]   Andy Anatko is here from the Chicago Sun times and his little puppy.
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:24.740]   I don't know.
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:25.740]   It is traction.
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:26.740]   How you do?
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:27.740]   How you do?
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:28.740]   It is puppy.
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.020]   I have no idea.
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:36.620]   Also with us, Mr. Don McAllister from the UK who will fly to New York tomorrow.
[00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:37.620]   No, Thursday.
[00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:40.180]   Yes, it will be tomorrow when it goes out.
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:43.940]   Just to get an iPad to.
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:47.340]   Two iPads and expensive to.
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:50.300]   You don't even know that you can get an iPad to two iPads.
[00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:51.300]   That's right.
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.500]   You've got to find a friend in New York.
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:55.500]   Yeah.
[00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:56.500]   Yeah.
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:57.500]   Also one who's going to be early in the queue.
[00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:00.420]   If I can just as we said, here, boom, kin, that might be the thing.
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:01.420]   There's that guy in Dallas.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:02.420]   You might just fly to Dallas.
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:03.420]   He's like, I got a ton.
[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.500]   It looks like it's a 10.
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:07.460]   You could two people could sleep in you and him.
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:09.660]   That would be so weird.
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:10.660]   No, no, no, no.
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:11.660]   Can I come in?
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:18.020]   It's too bad you can't use Goda meeting to buy iPads.
[00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:19.020]   That would be nice.
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:23.020]   Then you could just go to meeting over over the pond.
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:27.740]   That's what Goda meeting is great for is is taking is eliminating that business travel
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:28.740]   from the picture.
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:33.660]   I know we all feel like, you know, in person meetings are important, but a lot of times
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:37.820]   we're in this conference calls, whether it's across the, across the room, across town,
[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:41.820]   across the country, even over the pond, as they say.
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:45.340]   When you're having those conference calls, don't you wish you could show something?
[00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:48.940]   There's always the spreadsheet, the picture, the chart, the graph, the PowerPoint, the
[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:53.420]   most recent onion video, there's something that you'd like to share.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:58.540]   It's frustrating to be on the phone and saying, well, if you could only see this, that's where
[00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:00.100]   Goda meeting is so great.
[00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:01.660]   A picture is worth a thousand words.
[00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:04.860]   A meeting goes on longer when you have to describe everything.
[00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:06.700]   It's also less engaging.
[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:07.700]   You're next online meeting.
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:08.700]   Try it.
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:09.700]   Go to meeting.

[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:39.100]   What's great is it's so, you know, it's really idiot proof.
[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:40.900]   You know, that's the big thing.
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:43.560]   You set everybody up and then they get little emails and then they get little reminders
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:45.700]   and then they get another reminder.
[00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:50.340]   And so you don't have that whole, I couldn't find the link or I just had it three weeks
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:51.700]   ago or whatever.

[00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:56.500]   It's great.
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:57.500]   We even fired up the other day.
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:00.420]   Just fired up Go to meeting, even though we didn't have anything to show in case something
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:02.620]   went came up and we just used the teleconferencing.
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:03.620]   Yeah.
[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:04.620]   It's great.

[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:23.980]   The folks at Citrix have been so supportive.
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:30.140]   Actually when we're out at South by Southwest, we're going this weekend.
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:34.700]   I'm going to get Michael Guanera who was out there from Citrix to show us.
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:36.780]   You know, we there's been a go to meeting iPad for a while.
[00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:39.660]   Now they've got my PC iPad, which is so cool.
[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:40.660]   So cool.
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:41.660]   So we'll get a look at it first.
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:42.660]   Look at that.
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:45.500]   Go to meeting dot com slash Mac break.
[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:47.900]   Let me tell you a little bit about South by Southwest.
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:54.420]   In fact, let me check right now to see we've got John Slanina is driving the van.
[00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:56.620]   To us.
[00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:57.620]   That's a long drive.
[00:56:57.620 --> 00:56:58.620]   He left yesterday.
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:00.660]   Check on glimpse.
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:02.180]   He's going 73 miles an hour.
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:04.940]   John slow down.
[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:05.940]   John.
[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:06.940]   Hey, there he is.
[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:07.940]   It's a long way.
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:08.940]   You're going to get going.
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:09.940]   Look at that.
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:10.940]   Isn't that cool?
[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:11.940]   This is a Have you seen glimpse?
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:12.940]   G.L.Y.
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:13.940]   M.E.S.
[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:14.940]   I love it.
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:15.940]   Scoble was the first to show it to me.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:17.420]   You put it on your your I have it on my phone.
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:20.900]   And if you're on the way somewhere, you send him a text message that says, here's my live
[00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:23.020]   map at this speed.
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:24.020]   Oh, he did slow down.
[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:25.420]   Look, he's now a 68.
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:26.820]   No back up to 71.
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:28.820]   He's not listening.
[00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:30.700]   I don't even know where he is.
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:31.700]   I should figure out.
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:32.700]   Can you zoom out?
[00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:37.300]   Yeah, say zoom out.
[00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:38.940]   He's in Arizona.
[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:41.700]   He's riding down the road trying to loosen his load.
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:42.940]   He's going just south of Sedona.
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:45.660]   He's got a couple women on my mind.
[00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:46.980]   Two that want to own me.
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:48.220]   One that wants to stone me.
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:50.740]   One that says she's a friend of mine.
[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:53.380]   He's just a couple hours out of Phoenix.
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:55.820]   Looks like he's just south of Sedona.
[00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:59.740]   Like have a Sioux City, baby.
[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:01.220]   That's great.
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:02.220]   I love it.
[00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:03.740]   John, it's so fun that we can follow you.
[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:05.820]   So when it gets there, he's going to go straight to Momos.
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:08.220]   We're doing the show live Sunday.
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:10.780]   We'll be there actually all day Saturday and Sunday.
[00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:11.780]   We'll be broadcasting.
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:14.740]   In fact, our broadcast begins Friday evening.
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:19.940]   Brian Brushwood will be at the is he going to which he'll go to the Barton Creek?
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:22.540]   He's going to the domain Austin store.
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:23.860]   It's the more fun.
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:24.860]   It's outdoors.
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:25.860]   It's a cat.
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:26.860]   And Brian's an Austiner.
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:27.860]   So he knows.
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:28.860]   So he's going to be broadcasting.
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:30.860]   What time are we going to start our live coverage?
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:33.500]   I'm probably Pacific time 245.
[00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:36.260]   245 Pacific, 545 Eastern.
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:39.580]   God, I hope there's a line there.
[00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:41.020]   We did the Verizon phone watch.
[00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:43.020]   It was just so pathetic.
[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:44.980]   See that's why that's why there was just nobody there.
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:46.860]   Comes back to that's why it makes more sense.
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:51.660]   Oh, there's Frosty the Wonder Dog.
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:53.380]   I'm glad to see that you have an ear tag.
[00:58:53.380 --> 00:59:00.540]   If he gets lost, you know, they do have smaller chips nowadays, but your mic is frosty set
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:03.020]   on the mute button, I think.
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:10.700]   Meanwhile, meanwhile, back in the ranch.
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:12.500]   Did you put your mute?
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.780]   Oh, Lord.
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:16.780]   So she down.
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:17.780]   She turned.
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:18.780]   Oh, he does that trick.
[00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:19.780]   It's really cool.
[00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:22.420]   If you could see it, unfortunately, just off camera where he lifts the biscuit off his
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:23.420]   nose.
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:24.420]   Shh.
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:25.420]   He'll sit there with it.
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:26.420]   He's balanced on his nose.
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:28.420]   It's like that for hours.
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:29.420]   He's just like boy boy.
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:34.780]   And then you say, OK, and he just goes snarfs it right up.
[00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:35.780]   Such a good question.
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:37.780]   You're just like a good bus.
[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:38.780]   Your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your
[00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:39.780]   buster is that his name and keeps changing.
[00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:40.780]   Hmm?
[00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:43.420]   Well, so see that his job title is distracto.
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:46.580]   Oh, this tracto, the Wonder Dog.
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:50.780]   At least that's how I, that's how I clam on when I use, when I use the salary, do, you
[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:55.060]   know, siphon to hide some of the money that I've been making off of the poker sites.
[00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:56.060]   I can wait.
[00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:57.060]   Pay no attention to that, man.
[00:59:57.060 --> 01:00:01.700]   We also want to thank Get Glue for making a really cool South by Southwest sticker for
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:02.700]   us.
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:07.580]   So if you use Get Glue, look, you have to earn the South by Southwest Twit sticker.
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.780]   And if you come to Momos, we'll be broadcasting live.
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:15.780]   I'll be doing the radio show at one TNT at four, Twitter at five and meet up at six
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:16.780]   or seven.
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:21.100]   Twitter is over at Momos, it's a club in Austin.
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:25.620]   We will be handing, we have, we've printed one thousand of these limited edition stickers.
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:28.380]   There's only a thousand of them.
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:29.980]   Twit at South by Southwest.
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:33.860]   What we're going to do from now on in our live events is have special stickers.
[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:36.020]   He patches and you have to collect all 12.
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:39.100]   Well, patches, you could put a patch is okay, but then this sticker you could put on your
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:42.540]   laptop and people could have people could have clothes and then they could be putting
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:43.540]   not all right.
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:44.780]   We'll do patches and stickers next time.
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:46.700]   It's all about the patch.
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:50.300]   Yeah, you should get the Get Glue sticker and the South by Twit sticker.
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:52.740]   So collect all 12.
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:55.540]   If you want the sticker, you got to buy a flight.
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:56.740]   I think aren't you.
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:57.740]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:58.740]   You got to go.
[01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:02.580]   Well, there's a lot of people at South by and then we're going to cover the parties.
[01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:06.940]   Tom Merritt, Sarah Lane, Lisa Bettany and I will be going to the parties covering the
[01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:07.940]   parties.
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:10.780]   We're going to be at least that I will be at the dignity and party.
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:11.940]   Are you going to do it again?
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:12.940]   Are you going to?
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:13.940]   I don't know.
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:15.700]   I'm going to be kind of anti-climactic for me to crowd.
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:17.540]   Or maybe Lisa will do it instead.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.540]   That would be.
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:23.020]   That's a that's a you just you just quadruple attendance.
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.020]   That's what I was telling you.
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:27.700]   What am I building their audience for?
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:28.700]   Yeah.
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:29.700]   Twitter.
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:30.700]   I touched a girl for real.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:31.860]   That's my self.
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:37.420]   We're going to have a lot of fun.
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:38.420]   Sounds by so much fun.
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:39.620]   You know, it's really interesting.
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:45.140]   In fact, I spent a little bit of time this morning collecting all the group messaging
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:47.420]   clients that are out there.
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:49.540]   There's more than a dozen out there now.
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.300]   I'm liking fast society.
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.300]   I'll talk about it.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:53.740]   It's going to be my pick.
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:57.980]   So this is this is the hot, you know, Baluga just got sold to Facebook.
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:59.740]   What are you laughing at?
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:03.500]   I just heard this long discussion about grind or grinder or whatever.
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.900]   I was like, you don't like grinder?
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:05.900]   What's grinder?
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:06.900]   It's bad.
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:07.900]   It's grinder?
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:08.900]   No, I don't want grinder.
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:09.900]   I have.
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:12.260]   Yeah, no, no, I know.
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:15.380]   Just from the name, I'm thinking I know what grinder is.
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:19.300]   I may be wrong, but I'm just thinking I don't want grinder.
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:21.700]   Maybe I do want grinder.
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:24.900]   Maybe maybe you don't know me as well as you think you know me.
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:26.900]   Just look at the chat.
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.940]   Oh, I don't want grinder.
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:33.020]   Okay, never mind.
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:34.740]   You do know me well enough.
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:36.060]   Yeah, I know.
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:37.300]   I didn't realize.
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:39.980]   Okay, I didn't know what you're talking about.
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.580]   I have no idea what you're talking about.
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:42.580]   Let's get back to the Mac news.
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:43.900]   What do you say?
[01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:45.380]   What do you say?
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:47.700]   So here's the details on the $100 refunds.
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:49.300]   I have done my research.
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:53.020]   Well, at least I went to MacRumors.com and I checked with it.
[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.380]   They did the research for me.
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:59.420]   Apple, this is in the UK, but I think it's the same in the US.
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:02.380]   In the UK, they'll refund the 100 pound price difference.
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:07.620]   If you are within the 14 day return window, you only have two weeks.
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:15.060]   So you've had to have bought it and basically in March and a few days of February.
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:17.020]   In other words, it's a standard Apple sales policy.
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:21.300]   If Apple reduces the price on any shipped product within 14 calendar days of shipment,
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:25.180]   you can request a refund.
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:26.780]   This isn't exactly a reduced price.
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:27.780]   Oh, they did reduce the price.
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:29.740]   They reduced it on a hundred bucks.
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:30.740]   That's right.
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.260]   So that's what it's coming from.
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:33.780]   And you could now buy an iPad.
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:35.700]   So let's ask that question.
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:39.220]   Should you buy the iPad one for a hundred bucks less?
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:41.180]   Or should you buy the iPad two?
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:44.020]   I think it's a good entry level machine.
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:50.500]   And if someone has not specifically been waiting for the iPad until the cameras were out and
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:54.100]   they just wanted a good tablet device, sure.
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:57.700]   I'd hardly recommend it to anybody who didn't really need the camera.
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:00.500]   I guess you could also look on Craigslist and places like that.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:02.740]   But I bet there'll be some in--
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:03.740]   Gazelle and stuff.
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.500]   I think you're really going to want those cameras.
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:06.500]   Yeah.
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:11.460]   I think the cameras are a big-- that's the biggest thing to me for the iPad two, is being
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:15.380]   able to interact with folks.
[01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:18.180]   I think it'd be very hard for only $100 difference.
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:19.860]   I don't know if I would do it.
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:22.500]   Andy, what would you do?
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.060]   I'm not sure.
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.060]   I'm with Alex.
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:30.220]   The idea of-- if you're in for $3.99, you may as well be in for $4.99 and have the ability
[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:31.820]   to do video chat with other people.
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:35.660]   I'm going to let you say that because I said exactly that in somebody's Twitter.
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:38.100]   Leo is so out of touch with real people.
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:39.620]   $100 is money.
[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:41.420]   Lots of it.
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:43.420]   But you already spend $300?
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:45.340]   Yeah, you're already down $3.99.
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:48.220]   It's not like you're spending $100 from scratch.
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:51.540]   I just-- let me put this in perspective.
[01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:55.980]   For the past three months, I was like 95% sure that I was going to be replacing my pocket
[01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:59.900]   camera, which is about a two and a half year old pocket camera at this point with one
[01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:01.220]   of three or four different models.
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:02.780]   And the money was all set.
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:03.780]   It was ready to go.
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:07.900]   All I had to do was decide between two specific different models.
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:11.060]   And I was certain that by now I've made the decision to buy.
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:15.700]   And then the final thing that really made me decide to wait another year was realizing
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:19.460]   that the imaging chips on both of these cameras that I like are two and a half years old.
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.420]   And for that reason, maybe I would like to wait.
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:25.500]   And even if I have to wait a year for this type of camera with a brand new imaging chip,
[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:26.940]   I should wait and get that.
[01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:31.300]   For that same reason, it's not just the idea that you're getting a camera for $100.
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:35.940]   It's that you're not getting last year's process or you're getting this year's process
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:40.220]   or which will buy you a whole extra year probably of useful life out of this thing.
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:42.380]   So that's definitely worth the next $100.
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:44.540]   Good rational thinking.
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:47.940]   You like that Nikon P7000 a lot.
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:49.780]   I really love it.
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:54.260]   It's not to get into too big a distraction, but really another factor in the decision
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:57.700]   was that the camera that I love hasn't really been made yet.
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:01.220]   What I want is I want a micro four thirds big image sensor.
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:08.380]   I want the dial controls of the P7000, which has a 1.6 image sensor like a pocket camera
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:10.180]   image sensor.
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:15.100]   And I want something with a pop up variable flash and I could get maybe about three out
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:16.100]   of four of those things.
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:17.700]   I couldn't get four out of four.
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:22.140]   And I realized that at this point, you're just sort of I already have a four thirds the
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:25.740]   original Olympus four thirds camera from a year and a half or one, right?
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:27.460]   That's what gave me as a gift.
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:33.980]   And I realized that, okay, maybe it's not with all the strife and unrest in this world.
[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:37.020]   It is not a burden for me to use an old camera for another year.
[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:41.820]   I mean, yeah, because these old cameras are pretty damn good, but I do make a micro
[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:42.980]   four thirds camera.
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:43.980]   No, they don't.
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:48.260]   Right now it's still just Olympus and Panasonic, although a couple of different lens manufacturers
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:51.300]   are now getting into at least the lens end of it.
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:53.060]   But yeah, I do love that P7000.
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:56.580]   I think that if you're looking for a pocket camera and you don't necessarily need, you
[01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:59.140]   don't feel as though you need a large image sensor.
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:06.180]   Then, for if you do the kind of shooting that I do, it's it's I just love the idea of every
[01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:08.380]   function that I need one click away.
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.860]   I don't have to do I don't have to use a touchscreen to get out of that.
[01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.940]   I don't have to dive through four different layers of menus to get at it.
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:15.420]   It's a really sweet little camera.
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:16.900]   She's very, very sweet.
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:17.900]   Quick camera.
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:22.140]   We do have a new photo show, mostly photo with Lisa Bettany and we are still kind of
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:23.980]   work shopping it.
[01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:28.700]   But we're going to have a regular time slot for it when we get back from Austin.
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:34.580]   We'll settle that and love to have you on it, Annie, because I love your I love to be
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:35.580]   honest.
[01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:37.220]   Yeah, but my pick is photo related this week.
[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.220]   Oh good.
[01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.860]   We will get to that in just a moment or two.
[01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:41.860]   A couple more.
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:46.460]   We can do a speed round of the remaining Apple and by the way, well, as long as I'm plugging
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:49.820]   shows, I pad today, we're going to be doing that in Austin as well.
[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:51.620]   But I don't think we're going to live stream the taping.
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:55.540]   Sarah and I are going to tape it in Austin, but then put it out the following week.
[01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:57.460]   I pad today is normally on Thursdays.
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:03.140]   I think we do have one this Thursday coming up at 130 Pacific for 30 Eastern at live.twit.tv.
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:06.980]   Let's see.
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:08.620]   So iOS 4.3.
[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:09.620]   Okay.
[01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:12.300]   Now they're saying tomorrow.
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:15.380]   I'm not going to single you out.
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:17.220]   Anybody played with iOS 4.3?
[01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:18.220]   Hang on.
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:19.220]   Hang on a second.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.220]   Both of you.
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:21.220]   Both of you.
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:25.220]   I mean, I could do it too because I'm a developer.
[01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:27.020]   I'm a setup for the developer thing.
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.420]   But then I could talk about it so I couldn't do it.
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:32.980]   The thing is that there are things that are public anyway.
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:33.980]   We know.
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:35.300]   I'm going to develop an app for $99.
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:36.940]   It's not as though it's great.
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:38.420]   But I still respect the NDA.
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:43.740]   The things that have been announced publicly already, in fact, one of the shows I'm doing
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:44.820]   is I'm doing a show this week.
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:50.020]   I think it's a very significant development is the ability now with AirPlay to stream
[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:52.300]   from your Mac to your iOS device.
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:53.300]   Yes.
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:54.540]   Including your iPad.
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:56.980]   Yeah, iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch.
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:58.540]   So that's sort of giving me the push now.
[01:08:58.540 --> 01:08:59.540]   I think, right.
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:00.540]   Well, okay.
[01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:05.180]   I've gone so long now with having my iTunes library and this other sort of mash of media
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:07.340]   stuff that in all different formats and everything.
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:08.340]   So, right.
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:09.340]   That's it.
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:11.260]   Now I'm just going to go and put everything into my iTunes library.
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:13.900]   And then, you know, it's going to be a little bit onerous to get there.
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:19.140]   But once it's there, it will be so much easier to move media around to watch media wirelessly.
[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:22.140]   And I think that's going to be quite significant change for people.
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:23.140]   So what does that look like?
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:24.140]   I'm trying to work.
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:26.700]   So does that mean I have to have an Apple TV to do that?
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:27.980]   No, no, no, no.
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:32.460]   It can be your Mac with 10.2, which is the new version of iTunes.
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:33.460]   That's got it built in.
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:34.460]   It's got some build this week.
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:35.460]   Everybody should know.
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:36.460]   That's out already.
[01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:41.900]   So all you do really is on your iOS devices is going to the settings and put in your home
[01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:43.900]   sharing account details.
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:46.500]   And then immediately sharing is enabled.
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:50.060]   And you can see from your remote device or your different iTunes libraries that are already
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.340]   set up for home sharing.
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:57.020]   And then you basically just see your iTunes catalog from your device and just tap play
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:58.020]   and it starts playing.
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:00.020]   It's going to be sweet.
[01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:01.020]   Yeah.
[01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:06.420]   We have a Mac mini hooked up to a Drobo that has every movie, every, every, every, you
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:10.140]   know, song, all the podcasts, everything's all in one place now.
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:11.140]   And it's just me.
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:12.140]   How many terabytes?
[01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:13.140]   I don't even know.
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:18.140]   I mean, it's just like, you know, the Drobo is about seven terabytes and it's got other
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:19.140]   things on it.
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:20.140]   Almost full.
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:21.140]   Yeah.
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:22.500]   So it's a lot of, it's a lot of data there.
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:25.940]   But what's, you know, and I've been mostly using it for the Apple, you know, just for
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:28.300]   the two Apple TVs that we have.
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:31.860]   But you know, being able to just do it on any of the devices makes a big difference.
[01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:32.860]   It should all round trip.
[01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:34.660]   It should all just go everywhere from anywhere.
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:36.380]   I would think that'd be the.
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:38.620]   I'd actually want to be able to do it from anywhere, anywhere, anywhere.
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:39.620]   Anyway, anywhere.
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:40.620]   Not even.
[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:43.740]   Well, if you have a sling box, you can do that now.
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:50.140]   And then the question is whether the windows and open source iTunes server programs will
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:53.740]   be updated to support this feature as well.
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:54.940]   Cause then you could do it on anything.
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:57.620]   I presume that if you have 10.2 on windows, you could do it.
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:58.620]   Does anybody know?
[01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:00.220]   Don, is that, is that the case?
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:01.620]   I'm not too sure.
[01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:02.620]   Not too sure.
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:03.620]   No, but chat room.
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:06.340]   If you know, that would be of interest.
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:10.500]   I presume that Apple intends to do that, but maybe not.
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.460]   Yeah, maybe not.
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:16.300]   I'm going to retire my Mac mini from the TV now.
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:20.220]   I've sort of decided I'm going to pull that out and just just rely on the Apple TV once
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:23.580]   I've re-encodal my media and, you know, it's time it tunes compatible.
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:24.580]   I think so.
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:25.580]   The Apple TV is I.
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:29.140]   So the first Apple TV I bought and it's mostly just sat in the shelf.
[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:30.140]   I barely used it all.
[01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:31.140]   It was.
[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:32.300]   I loved it, but it just couldn't.
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:33.300]   It was laboring.
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:36.460]   And I use the Apple TV to every day.
[01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:37.460]   Yeah.
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.140]   You know, it's like it's just really, and you know, I switch between Netflix and then I
[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:46.020]   go to, you know, then I switch over to my media server and then I, you know, it's just,
[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:49.740]   and my wife's favorite feature is just the just playing pictures of the kids on the TV.
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:50.740]   Isn't that great?
[01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:52.860]   So it's just, it's a great, it's a great addition.
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:53.860]   I actually.
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:54.860]   And that's cool.
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:57.540]   They open it up to the fabled apps, right?
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:58.540]   Yes.
[01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:00.460]   Now that's going to be huge.
[01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:02.860]   Is this 4.3 get us closer to that?
[01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:11.660]   I guess if you had an HDMI connector on your new iPad two and you connected to the TV and
[01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:14.900]   I think that's probably why they have a power connector to.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:18.780]   So you buy an extra iPad to connected to your TV and it's mirroring.
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:21.780]   But it's not going to, it's going to, but it's not going to use your whole 16 by nine
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:22.780]   screen.
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:23.780]   It's going to, it's mirroring the iPad.
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:24.780]   Yeah.
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.700]   You could play Angry Birds on your big screen TV.
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:27.700]   Couldn't you?
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:28.700]   You could.
[01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:29.700]   And I think that'll let people play with it.
[01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:32.980]   And by the end of this year, I think Apple is going to start letting us.
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:34.940]   It's a little backdoor into that.
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:35.940]   Would you use air?
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:36.940]   How can you can?
[01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:38.740]   Don't forget that you wouldn't need the HDMI, would you?
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:42.340]   Because you can airplay directly from your device to your app and not trace your TV.
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:43.340]   Not all the video though.
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:44.340]   To Apple TV.
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:45.340]   Yeah.
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:46.340]   But not all the time.
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:50.740]   Like not talking about other time apps being able to do the airplay framework.
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:51.740]   Oh, and do.
[01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:52.740]   Oh.
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:54.980]   So I can airplay the apps.
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:56.660]   I don't even need the HDMI connection.
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:57.660]   Then I have a controller.
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:12:59.980]   And that's the issue for me is, well, how do I play Angry Birds?
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:00.980]   I need some air maps or something.
[01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:01.980]   No, you could use your iPad.
[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:05.620]   I just use my iPad because I don't need to have it hooked up next to the TV.
[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:06.620]   Okay.
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:07.620]   Interesting.
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:08.620]   That's very good.
[01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:10.620]   That's really good.
[01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.460]   I'm impressed.
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:17.500]   Everybody recognize it?
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:18.500]   Apple has shipped.
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:25.020]   According to Apple Insider, over 1 million MacBook Airs in the first quarter.
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:27.980]   I don't know the numbers for the other laptops.
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:29.740]   That sounds like a very successful launch.
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:30.740]   It's good.
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:31.740]   They're great.
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:32.740]   They're certainly better than the old Air.
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:33.740]   They're great machines.
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:35.740]   Pretty cool.
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:38.460]   Congratulations, Apple.
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:40.660]   And now they have these new MacBooks, which I have.
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:43.020]   I'm sad to say I broke down.
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:44.020]   You broke down.
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.020]   I haven't broken down yet.
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.020]   I'm holding on.
[01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:47.020]   You know what I do?
[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:48.020]   It's foolish of me.
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:49.020]   But I go to and I put it in the cart, right?
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:51.020]   I pick what I want.
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:52.020]   And then I put it in the cart.
[01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:54.860]   And then I say, but I'm not going to press by.
[01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:59.180]   But then it's very easy to impulsively just go to the cart and go buy.
[01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:01.340]   What did I do that?
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:02.340]   What?
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:03.340]   Well, now I'm stuck with it.
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:05.900]   So I'll use it in the client.
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:10.380]   You don't want to hurt Amazon's feelings by or Apple's.com's feelings by taking back
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:11.380]   the sale.
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.380]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:13.380]   I mean, they've already started building it.
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:14.820]   I mean, as we'll just take it.
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:17.420]   Now, the reason we have a new employee, don't tell the new employee.
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:18.420]   We have a new employee.
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:21.220]   And he, when somebody comes here, we give him a computer.
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:24.380]   I think that's kind of standard operating procedure.
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:27.180]   And he wanted a MacBook.
[01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:28.260]   He wanted an i7 MacBook.
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:30.940]   And I said, I haven't had an i7 MacBook.
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:32.100]   It's only nine months old.
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:35.820]   Maybe if I don't tell him, I clean it up real good.
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:38.140]   It's got a 500 gig hard drive in it.
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:41.660]   So instead of buying him a new one, I gave him my old one.
[01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:42.660]   And then I bought the new one.
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:43.660]   But I did buy the SSD.
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:48.340]   I bought the 128 gig SSD because the air has convinced me the SSD makes a big difference.
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:50.340]   We're Thunderbolt.
[01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:52.380]   But can I use Thunderbolt for anything yet?
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:55.380]   But it's going to be huge for people like me.
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:56.380]   So for professional--
[01:14:56.380 --> 01:15:00.380]   Well, I love the idea of a Thunderbolt gigabyte hard drive on there for my photos and stuff.
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:02.380]   Well, and also being able to--
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:04.380]   So they don't want 128 gigs because I got Thunderbolt hard drive.
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:09.380]   The crazy thing is that I'll be able to take this computer and hook a RAID to it, and then
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:13.380]   hook a big camera to it, and have it bringing the video into the computer, and then out
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:17.380]   to the RAID, and it can all be done through this crazy little connector.
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:21.380]   You know, I can get uncompressed footage out of an F23 or F35.
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:22.380]   It's going to be huge.
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:23.380]   It's going to be huge.
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:24.380]   Unbelievable.
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:25.380]   Yeah.
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:28.380]   When has anybody seen any Thunderbolt peripherals promised?
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:30.380]   I bet you we will--
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:31.380]   Go ahead, Annie.
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:36.380]   I got one press release about a device, a drive that's going to be coming out in June or
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:37.380]   July.
[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:38.380]   Okay, I can wait.
[01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:39.980]   That's the only thing I've even seen.
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:43.740]   You know what put me over the top is this engadget review, Neely Patel did, where he
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:46.380]   says the fastest computer I've ever seen.
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:50.380]   He said, "Oh my God, it's so fast."
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:58.260]   He's not a particularly Apple fanboy kind of guy, I don't think, but he has the review,
[01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:02.260]   and they were just blown away by the overall speed.
[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:06.180]   I did get the 1680x1050 display.
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:07.180]   I got a glossy.
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:11.180]   I like glossy, but I was looking at their benchmarks, and they are kind of remarkable.
[01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:15.500]   You know, it's really interesting that the MacBook Air, which really on the numbers,
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:20.100]   is very kind of pathetic.
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.100]   You feel that slow.
[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:26.100]   I mean, it's less than half the speed of the OpenGL performance on the MacBook Pro
[01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:27.100]   Radeon.
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:31.700]   It's about a third the speed on Geekbench overall performance, and yet it doesn't feel
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:32.700]   that slow.
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:37.100]   Yeah, it really does underscore the fact that your computer spends most of its time waiting
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:38.500]   for you to click a button.
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:39.500]   Yes.
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:44.420]   And for so many people who, I think 80% to 90% of the people don't even need the performance
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:49.540]   of an i5 or an i7 and can get along perfectly fine with the MacBook Air.
[01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:51.540]   In terms of CPU speed, I actually love that.
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:57.220]   I think in a 64 gig or 128 gig footprint is another question entirely, but speed wise,
[01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:59.220]   it's hard to find and complain.
[01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:02.940]   And I think we'll probably see when we're at NAB, we'll probably see a bunch of announcements
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:06.740]   related to Thunderbolt, because that's where the first real industry is going to be.
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:11.340]   Broadcasters who need that, for instance, a company like Blackmagic has been doing tons
[01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:16.060]   of USB 3 peripherals that all of us on the Mac side are drooling over and I can't use
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:17.060]   them.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:19.860]   I don't know if they're going to announce something NAB, but it's going to happen.
[01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:26.420]   I can't imagine them not taking those peripherals and adding Thunderbolt pretty quickly.
[01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:28.620]   Something in the chatroom saying, "Let's see."
[01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:30.300]   EJZ is saying, "Let's see."
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:32.220]   Is making external hard drives with Thunderbolt.
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:35.300]   Well, the issue you're going to get into there is just the speed of the drive at that point.
[01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:37.060]   Yeah, you're way faster than the drive.
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:40.180]   You need to, you need to, you need to, I mean, the reality is most of these drives aren't
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:41.860]   fast enough for the Firewire 800.
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:47.040]   Yeah, you know, they're doing 40, 50 megabytes a second when the 800 is able to hand the
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.660]   them that data at 100 megabytes a second.
[01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:51.900]   So what are you going to use like a RAID array or?
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:54.620]   We already use RAID arrays, you know, even portably.
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:59.020]   We got these little G-aids and other stuff that we use for on-site stuff.
[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:02.580]   But that, yeah, being able to attach it to a real RAID and have 300 megabytes a second
[01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:08.180]   or whatever is a pretty, to a laptop without a express card, that's the other thing is
[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:09.780]   that we've been able to do this.
[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:13.740]   We've been able to connect these fast peripherals, but only through the express card, you know,
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:16.900]   which means we had to buy, I have two 17-inch computers that the only reason that they're
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:20.240]   17-inch and not 15 inches because of the express card.
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:21.240]   This is what I want.
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:22.640]   I don't even know what this is going to cost.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.440]   Let's see, make something called the little big disk.
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:28.600]   Yeah, that's the one.
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:30.440]   And it's solid state.
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:34.800]   Oh, RAID 0, pre-striped solid state.
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:37.280]   I can't even imagine what this drives.
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.280]   500 gigs.
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:42.000]   It's got two, two 50s in it.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.800]   Must have.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:49.600]   They say 700 megabytes, megabytes a second.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:53.220]   That's a daisy chain between the computer and the monitor because of course it's coming
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:55.160]   off your mini display port.
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:19:00.720]   Oh, how much is this going to cost?
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.560]   Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:07.680]   We know I Leo always does the show while sitting on an easily clean, vinyl exercise.
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:11.400]   It's got to love the final.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:13.400]   I need one of those.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:21.080]   It's got two Intel 510 solid state drives in a nice pretty, let's see, makes pretty little
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:22.080]   enclosures.
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.080]   Wow.
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.080]   Wow.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.080]   Yummy.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:26.080]   Wow.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.080]   So there it is.
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:30.680]   And that's just so Andy, you say that'll be this summer.
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:32.480]   The release I got said sometime this summer.
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:33.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:34.480]   Sometimes.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.480]   Exactly.
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:40.160]   It's hard to know how to read my review of the new Macbook is coming either late this
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.560]   week or early next week.
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.560]   And so you have one.
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.680]   Yeah, I have one in the office right now.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:50.480]   As a matter of fact, I'm planning on buying one a little bit later this year.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:55.080]   But it's so hard to review it like Thunderbolt because it's okay.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.080]   It's state.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.640]   There's a new there's a light on the side.
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:02.000]   That's that's more exciting than a little TV.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.720]   Apple Apple told me some stuff that I can then tell to you.
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:08.080]   How do you test it?
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:13.280]   If if if I like lick my finger and spread a jab it in there real good, it's kind of hurts.
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.520]   What else can I tell you about this wonderful new?
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:17.160]   How is the how's your view?
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:20.640]   You can figure is it a spinning driver or solid state?
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.120]   Spinning drive 500 gig.
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:26.080]   I believe it's the lesser the stock 540 RPM.
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:33.440]   It's a stock five, six four hundred, fifteen inch, not the two point two gig gigahertz
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:36.360]   processor, but the lesser one.
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:37.360]   What do you think?
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:39.240]   Sounds like you're going to buy it.
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.680]   I like it a lot.
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:46.560]   Yeah, the the the the the boost in processing speed is so the last years, the last years
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:51.160]   Macbooks was faster than the previous generation.
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:53.640]   These are another couple of leaps forward.
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:57.680]   I will be honest and say that one of the reasons why I'm definitely getting it is because
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:01.920]   my my current my current Macbook is now like three years old.
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:05.240]   So it's really near at the near end of life anyway.
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:09.920]   But I'm very very pleased that I'm getting something that has not only a real like four
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:15.000]   or five year processor behind it, but also the next generation of connectivity behind
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000]   it.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.120]   If I'd bought last, I'd be pretty disappointed that I bought the that I hadn't waited a
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:20.120]   year.
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:25.240]   I was I mean, this I seven is nine months old and it was like, Oh man, but this is this
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:28.120]   is kind of a future proofed laptop as you're going to get one.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:30.080]   Yeah, you're you're definitely going to skip these ones down.
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:32.160]   I'm I'm waiting for the next generation of my bookers.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:37.600]   They want my my map a care with Thunderbolt on for goodness sake, a backlit keyboard,
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:38.600]   please for the next.
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:41.200]   Oh, yeah, that's the one thing really missing that I really miss.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:42.920]   Believe it be how much you miss it.
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.560]   I'm pretty surprised about that.
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:48.880]   Why I think the other thing is I feel like they have to put out Mac pros and iMacs because
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:51.520]   it's just kind of like I don't want to buy anything without Thunderbolt built in.
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:55.200]   I mean, like I don't like I don't want to invest in any more computers for our office
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.600]   until yeah, you're right until I got Thunderbolt connections.
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:01.160]   Yeah, I just bought a Mac pro too and I'm feeling like, Oh, shoot, right?
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:05.960]   Well, the we'll leave the desktops must need the Sandy Bridge updates whenever they're
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:06.960]   alone.
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:07.960]   One would imagine.
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:08.960]   Yeah, I have a I don't have Sandy Bridge.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:10.560]   No, I have the I pray.
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:15.760]   Oh, I you know, I thought I avoided this whole cycle by buying right when Apple came out
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:18.720]   with a new product, but apparently that's not even enough.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:19.720]   We don't know.
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:24.160]   Maybe they maybe won't see another Mac Mac pro until I think it's a good question.
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:25.560]   I'm guessing June.
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:33.440]   Yeah, the IMAX do for a refresh soon because it's it's a so it's do for refresh because
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:34.960]   I just bought four of them.
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:35.960]   Right.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.960]   That's why it's a funny.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.440]   We need to find out when Leo buys one.
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:42.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.920]   Well, I'm building a new studio at great expense.
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:47.000]   I might as well just throw in some more money and buy some new computers.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000]   She's low.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000]   Where?
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.840]   Very well, where is it?
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:54.120]   I'm really curious to see what Apple does with the new IMAX.
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:23:00.960]   If either the next IMAX or the one after that is going to be a radical redesign, we are
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:04.760]   not going to recognize it based on the IMAX that's for sale right now.
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:06.400]   I'm absolutely convinced of that.
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:11.320]   It's time because not not not only that, but they've taken so the movement there.
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:16.240]   There's so many interesting things that have been added to 10.7 based on the developer
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:21.160]   preview that makes little sense for the current iteration of IMAX.
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:27.160]   Plus you have the fact that there there so many of the Mac book pros are doing so much
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:31.160]   of the heavy lifting that before you can only get with an IMAX.
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:35.760]   Apple needs to do something to distinguish the desktop consumer line from the mobile
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.000]   consumer line.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.600]   And I think that you're not going to see screen keyboard mouse slot for DVD drive.
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.920]   I think you're going to see something radically different.
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:48.440]   I don't know if it's going to be this year next year, but either this next iteration
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:53.760]   or the one after that is going to be just the Willy Wonka version of the IMAX.
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:24:00.080]   Well, I mean, I think it's going to be a 46 inch TV that has all the Mac capability,
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.080]   iOS capability.
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:02.080]   I mean, that's the...
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:07.360]   Because that one big problem with the IMAX is that you can't get reality TV shows on.
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:10.360]   I can't get the bachelor on it that I just don't want to be bothered with this.
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:14.360]   It certainly would be consonant with the post PC era that Apple has proclaimed.
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:18.920]   I mean, it's kind of getting hard to sell PCs in a post PC era, make it a TV, and then
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:19.920]   it's a post PC.
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:20.920]   I mean, Apple already has that figured out.
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:22.480]   I mean, they were not that far away with a 30 inch.
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:24.240]   I mean, they have the technology figured out.
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:26.080]   They have the pieces figured out.
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:27.960]   All they got to do is just make us larger screen.
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:33.320]   And I mean, it's input a Visa mountain on the back.
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:36.240]   You believe the rumors that Apple is negotiating this comes from Bloomberg.
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:41.560]   They say they have three, not one, not two, but three sources say Apple's negotiating flat
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:45.320]   fee unlimited music downloads believable, credible.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:48.760]   Would the music industry treat with Apple or would this give them too much power or does
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:50.640]   the music industry even have a choice at this?
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:52.000]   So this is a subscription service?
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000]   Is that what they're...
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.680]   Well, I'll read you what it says.
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:57.000]   I couldn't when I looked at it.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.320]   Negotiating unlimited music downloads.
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.320]   This would be...
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:02.920]   I thought what that was really referring to when I read it was that you are able to hook
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:04.920]   up as many computers as possible.
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:05.920]   Well, you could...
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:06.920]   I thought it was...
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:07.920]   You could...
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:10.720]   I thought it was an unlimited number of computers attached to use the music that you already bought.
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:13.640]   But right now it's limited to five, which made sense until you start having a family
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:17.920]   full of iPhones and iPads and computers and Apple TVs.
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:21.240]   You end up in this situation where five doesn't turn out to be very good.
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:22.240]   I guess you're right.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.240]   I guess you're right.
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:24.240]   I think that what they're looking at...
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:27.120]   So the deal it says, the deal would provide iTunes customers with a permanent backup of
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:29.600]   music purchases if the originals are damaged or lost.
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:30.600]   That's law, law style.
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:31.600]   Right.
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.200]   Kind of streaming.
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:37.920]   And then the service would also allow downloads to iPad, iPod and iPhone devices linked to the
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:38.920]   same iTunes account.
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:41.320]   Well, you can do that right now, but it is limited to five.
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:42.320]   Right.
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.520]   Actually, is it?
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.520]   No.
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:46.480]   On portable devices, there's no limit.
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:47.480]   It doesn't check.
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:48.480]   Right.
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:49.480]   So it's only on compute...
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:51.000]   You have to register each iTunes.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.600]   You have five iTunes you can register.
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:53.600]   Right.
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:58.360]   But you can make it on five different iPhones or 20 different iPhones or 20 different iPads.
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.120]   So I don't know if that's...
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:02.520]   But I thought it was...
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:04.680]   I thought they were looking for unlimited devices.
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:05.680]   That was not happening.
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:11.560]   And nor is anybody at the music companies.
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:16.720]   An agreement about so-called read download rights may be reached by mid-year, although
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:17.720]   it could be later.
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.520]   One of the people said Apple typically announces...
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:24.320]   So this may be something for the fall.
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:27.840]   Yeah, I'm not sure I understand what it is.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:30.560]   I was thinking, you know, when I heard it, I thought, "Oh, great subscription."
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:31.560]   But no.
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:32.560]   I think it's...
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:35.360]   Well, in effect it is, though, because if you buy a song, you could put it anywhere and
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:37.600]   presumably stream it if you've got it backed up to the internet.
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:38.600]   Right.
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:39.600]   I mean, that would be a...
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:40.600]   That would be an upgrade.
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.000]   It's not subscription service.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.000]   Right.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000]   It's not a flat fee.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000]   I misread that.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000]   It's not a flat fee subscription service.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000]   That would be great.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000]   I mean, that would work into what we were talking about before about the Airplay, you
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.840]   know, being able to stream from your Mac to your iOS device.
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:57.640]   If you could actually stream that same music from the cloud to your portable device when
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:59.480]   you're out and about, that would be fantastic.
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.840]   So I have whatever is 40 gigs of music.
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:07.560]   If they said, "Okay, now we know you have all this 40 gigs of music and now it's yours
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:11.240]   to stream to any device you want anywhere," that's practically a subscription.
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:12.800]   I mean, you have to buy individual songs.
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.200]   You still have to buy the songs.
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:15.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:18.400]   I always wondered what the licensing was like about that.
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:22.360]   What would be involved for Apple to be able to host a service like that?
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:26.440]   And I can't even imagine what lawyers have to get naked with what other people in order
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:30.600]   to convince the music industry that, "No, if we do this, it doesn't mean that there's
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:35.120]   going to be," I know that right now there's no piracy of music of any kind.
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:39.320]   But I'm not saying that if we were to stream music that would suddenly create piracy in
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.320]   the industry, that would not happen.
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.320]   You haven't had fun.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:45.520]   I think that one of the big problems is that the entertainment industry in general is not
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:48.760]   coming to grips with how bad the sickness is.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:51.880]   And so they're trying to hem and hem over Netflix.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:54.520]   They want to make sure that Netflix doesn't get the best movies and everything else because
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:56.360]   they're afraid that Netflix will come to the next Apple.
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:59.280]   And if Apple gets subscription service, they won't leave anything but stubble.
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:06.000]   I mean, like literally it would be, Apple having that, they have such a large market already.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.240]   No one would be able to compete with them and then they know what Apple would do if it
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:12.400]   had leverage because it proves what it does when it has leverage is that it uses that
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:13.400]   leverage.
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:20.160]   And so I think that's one of the big issues for them giving them that piece.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:24.360]   But I think that somehow they're going to get back to the good old days when they were
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:27.880]   able to sell individual items for 10 times what it was worth.
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:33.920]   The classic question for any of these content producers is the same question that app developers
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.120]   are now facing.
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:39.400]   You can in this world, if you want to build a mobile app or tablet app or phone app, you
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:43.400]   can either have leverage or you can actually make money.
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:47.000]   And so Apple will take all the leverage away from you, but it's the one marketplace where
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.480]   all the gold is lying on the street.
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:51.400]   And if you want to bend down and pick it up, you're going to bend down first.
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:55.560]   It's kind of the same argument we've been having about apps and about everything else.
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:58.680]   And pretty much dominates the whole chain.
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:02.440]   Well, I think again, I think that comes from a clear understanding of functionality over
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:03.440]   features.
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:04.440]   And that's what people are.
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:07.520]   You know, that's what they seem to know better than everybody else.
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:09.240]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:10.240]   Come back with your picks.
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:14.160]   So get your gentlemen, start your picking in just a moment.
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:18.480]   But first a reminder that if you are ready for your web page or you have a friend who
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:25.240]   doesn't have a web page yet, godly, you really ought to having your own place on the net
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:26.240]   is so important.
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.480]   Sure, you can have that Facebook page and everything, but you've got to have your own
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:29.480]   place on the net.
[01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:33.120]   And that's where Squarespace, whoops, let me pull up that picture of Squarespace here,
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.800]   does such a great job.
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:37.800]   Squarespace.com/macbreak.
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:42.800]   You can try it right now.
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:43.800]   So easy to set up.
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.040]   Just click this green button, try it for free.
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:47.040]   No credit card required.
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:48.520]   You just set up your site.
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:51.440]   Look at the examples to see what people have done, whether you're a blog or it doesn't
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:55.040]   have to be a blog, though, or just you're selling something or you're a restaurant.
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:56.040]   I know Alex, you...
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.320]   My sister just built one.
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:58.320]   That's cool.
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:29:59.320]   What's called?
[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:00.320]   What's the series about?
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.320]   Familiarlight.squarespace.com.
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:02.520]   What does she do?
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:06.080]   She's probably the best photographer I know, actually.
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:09.280]   And I shouldn't say that on a big show.
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:11.920]   And she's talking about taking pictures of your kids.
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:13.440]   Taking pictures of your basic ideas.
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:20.120]   So she's an incredible photographer, mostly what she takes pictures of are her kids.
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:22.360]   But she'll show you this great thing, but then at the bottom, it'll give you the technical
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:23.560]   information about what it took.
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:24.560]   How it's done.
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:26.560]   Like here, she's talking about how to take pictures of...
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:27.560]   That's a hard thing to do.
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:29.200]   Yeah, so she's talking about how she does it.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.680]   Blowing out a candle on a birthday kick.
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:31.960]   Never get that picture right.
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:36.120]   There's probably nobody that knows how to take pictures of kids, or especially her kids,
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:37.120]   than her.
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:38.120]   That's a great idea.
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:39.120]   Oh my God, that's fantastic.
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:41.160]   But she threw this all together in Squarespace by herself.
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:42.160]   And she's not a...
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:43.160]   She's not a techy.
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:44.160]   She's not a techy.
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:45.160]   She's a photographer.
[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:46.160]   Oh my God.
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:47.160]   She's a very good photographer.
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:48.160]   She's a very good photographer.
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:50.080]   She's, as I said, she's the best photographer I know.
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.080]   Holy moly moly.
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:52.080]   Yes.
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:53.080]   Oh, we got to get her on mostly...
[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:55.080]   You should definitely have her on.
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:56.080]   Take a picture of the kids.
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:57.080]   Deal.
[01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:58.080]   Oh, I love that.
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.040]   Oh, I love that.
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:01.040]   So here's the deal.
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.040]   Look how...
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.040]   You put it all together.
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:04.040]   She just did it.
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:05.040]   And that's the thing.
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:07.680]   Squarespace makes it possible for you to set up your site so quickly.
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:09.280]   Look at the examples.
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:11.960]   You have great templates to start from.
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:13.520]   60+ designer templates.
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.160]   They've got an iPad, an iPhone app.
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:18.680]   Makes it easy for you to not only post, but to moderate your comments.
[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:22.160]   You can import and export to all the major blog APIs.
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:26.480]   So if you've got an existing site, it's simple to try, Squarespace.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:32.080]   Two weeks for age, just go to squarespace.com/macbreak and set that up.
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:37.000]   And if you decide you want it, it's hosting and all this great Squarespace software, just
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.280]   starting at $12 a month.
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:44.200]   Couldn't be easier to use and it is so satisfying to have your own site.
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:47.120]   squarespace.com/macbreak.
[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:50.680]   We thank Squarespace for their support at MacBreak Weekly.
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:54.920]   Andy Inaco, let's start with your pick of the week here.
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:32:00.520]   I'm one of these people who really enjoys cameras and photography and taking fun and
[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:04.200]   taking pictures and doing things with cameras I wasn't able to do before.
[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:10.760]   And so I'm really, really shocked how much fun I'm having with the GoPro HD cameras that
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:11.760]   I just got sent to the theater.
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:14.160]   I see people wearing these all over the place.
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:18.960]   Yeah, you see them in commercials and stuff and they're being advertised pretty much everywhere.
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:23.320]   This is the one where you basically wear it on your head and then you do a lot of throwing
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:28.280]   the goat gestures as you win surf and do stuff like that.
[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:33.280]   The upshot is that for, depending on which model you get, anywhere from $99 for the standard
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:41.000]   definition version to like 300 bucks for the high definition version, what you get is this
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:48.000]   tiny little camera in a dust proof, wind proof, waterproof housing.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000]   With a little box of different things you can mount it to.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.040]   This is just like the base that comes with it in the package.
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:56.440]   But inside, I'll take it out of the waterproof housing.
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:02.920]   It is this adorable little, just a basic camera with the best user interface ever.
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:04.080]   It's just got two buttons.
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:05.960]   It's got a shutter button at the top.
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:12.320]   It's got a power and a mode button at the front and that's really exactly it.
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:19.640]   And it will shoot video, it will also shoot photos up to shoot five megapixel photos in
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:20.640]   multiple modes.
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:25.360]   It has a time lapse photo mode, for instance, so that you can just actually just snap a
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:27.440]   picture the way you would with a regular camera.
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:31.520]   Or you could just simply put it someplace and say just put it on your helmet, put it
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:32.960]   on your wrist, put it on whatever you say.
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:37.400]   Just take a picture every two seconds, every 10 seconds, every 30 seconds until the memory
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:40.760]   card fills up and it will take a card up to 32 gigabytes.
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:46.560]   So it's possible to just leave this thing on your wrist, go and explore a new city and
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:47.560]   then come home.
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:51.680]   In addition to your real camera, you'll find out exactly what kind of pictures that you
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:54.040]   wound up taking with it.
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:56.760]   The images on the GoPro website are just amazing.
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:59.120]   And the quality is good.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:01.320]   This is 720p on the top of the line.
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:02.320]   The quality is excellent.
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:08.400]   But one of the other really cool things about it is that this lens is a huge, fisheye lens.
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:10.880]   It is something like 170p.
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:14.440]   So the first thing, one of the first things I did with it is I just put it on the dashboard
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:18.640]   of my car and just drove around a little bit just to shoot some video and just see how
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:19.640]   it worked.
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:24.800]   And it looks like I'm flying an airplane because all you see is the sky through the
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:30.440]   windshield and way, way, like four miles back, you see this guy and holding a little steering
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.800]   wheel in the deep, deep background.
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:38.000]   So I could see so many circumstances where you can't get a good picture of the space
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.920]   that you're in with the current pocket camera you've got.
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:41.920]   But that's okay.
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:46.360]   Just take this out, take a snapshot with your five megapixels super fisheye camera.
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:51.360]   And when you consider that, now that the $99 version of it is just standard definition,
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:53.600]   but it's still a five megapixel camera.
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:35:00.440]   So just on that basis alone, I would consider as a photo nut myself, it's worth $99 to have
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:05.200]   this tiny little pocket camera that can do two or three hours for the time lapse on one
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:09.920]   battery and can shoot 178 degrees in one exposure.
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:12.000]   That's a lot of really cool stuff for $99.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.080]   And the fact that it's in an underwater housing so that if you wanted to, not just, you might
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:22.120]   not think that, well, look, if there's very few times when I jump out of an airplane and
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:25.960]   then land on a surfboard and do wakeboarding and that same thing.
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:29.640]   Yeah, but okay, how about the last time you took your kids to the beach and you didn't
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:34.000]   want to take out your camera because you were worried about sand or you didn't want to,
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.680]   people were splashing around in a pool or something and you didn't take pictures there
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:39.360]   because you're worried about that, you're good.
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:44.400]   It's for 99 bucks, that's a place to put a camera where you would normally would not
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:48.720]   even think about taking your existing $300, $400 or $500 camera.
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:49.720]   It's pretty nice.
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:51.400]   So I'm having a hell of a lot of fun with it.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:57.480]   Right now, I haven't even done my real, like, I'm a real attempt to go shoot video that
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:00.600]   is going to accompany the review yet for the past two days.
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:05.360]   I've actually just had one of the railings on the porch just putting a dish with peanut
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:07.400]   butter out, setting it for time lapse.
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:12.960]   I say, I want to get super, super close up of like squirrels and the peanut butter.
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:15.720]   Unfortunately, the squirrels and the chipmunks are publicity shy.
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:16.720]   They are, they are.
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:17.720]   Yeah.
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:22.960]   But I'm taking it to the public garden sometime in the next couple of weeks and they're not
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:23.960]   shy over there.
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:29.840]   So I'm going to get some really good, almost 3D, you know, feeding frenzy shots there.
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:35.960]   And to my point of view, any camera that gets you inspired to get out and take more pictures,
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:39.840]   particularly any camera that lets you take pictures and environments where you would not
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:44.600]   want to take a camera ordinarily is a big, big win because there's so many parts of your
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:49.480]   life you'd love to document it, but you just don't want to sacrifice a $400 camera to try
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:50.680]   to document it.
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:54.720]   And again, for anywhere from 99 to 299 bucks, that's not a whole lot of money to spend on
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:56.200]   that kind of a thing.
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:57.200]   Very good.
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:59.800]   So it's go cam HD.
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:02.200]   If you Google go cam, you can find it very quickly.
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:05.800]   They've got a great website, go pro.com.
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:11.520]   We, I've seen it in use in a couple of different situations during the Macma 11.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:13.240]   Didn't Wally Cermannsky have one of those?
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:14.240]   That's right.
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:15.240]   Yeah.
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:18.360]   Wally took one and he did some horse riding down the beach and struck it to his chest.
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.720]   On his chest a lot as we wandered Machu Picchu yet.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:24.560]   So I can't wait to see his video, you know.
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:25.720]   See, that's why I absolutely love.
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:28.680]   They sent me a box with just about every month that they have on it.
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:31.720]   And that's the thing that, that's, that's not one of those things that really kind of
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:36.560]   got me inspired because there are times when, there are times when you just want to remember
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:38.760]   what it was like to be in a certain moment.
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:41.080]   And I am the guy who always has the camera up.
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:43.480]   I'm taking a walk and you never know what you want to see.
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:48.680]   But the idea of just coming, coming back to the hotel, doing just getting thumbnails
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:53.560]   of these thousand pictures that the camera took automatically and realized, oh my God,
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:54.560]   that's a perfect shot.
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:56.160]   That's exactly the shot that I could have gotten had.
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:58.160]   I've been thinking at that moment, but I didn't.
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:01.000]   So again, 99 bucks for, for God's sakes.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:06.800]   Again, the next time you tell, tell you what, the next time you take out a loan on a car,
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:10.920]   round it up to the nearest hundred and get yourself one of these cameras or the next 300.
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:14.260]   I mean, really Leo, Leo, you should like be buying five of them.
[01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:15.260]   10 of them.
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:16.260]   Wow.
[01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:19.840]   I, I, I, I, I, I, what the, what the exact note is for one of our camera guys.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:24.840]   And Brent by when John C. Dvorak went to Madrid for the Ford Focus Global Challenge,
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:31.760]   Brent took, has a go, go pro camera and attached it to the hood of the focus as John was driving.
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:36.560]   So we have some amazing footage from the outside of the car of John looking at John as he's
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:39.120]   driving, which you'll see when we get that video out.
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:42.620]   I was going to say when I, when I, when I, I'm taking like about an hour long, two hour
[01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:47.600]   long drive someplace in about four or five days and it would never, I don't even need
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:51.840]   like front of like, I was driving back from breakfast this morning.
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:56.280]   I was like on, I was sitting on the, on my driveway looking at the front grill of my car
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:57.480]   saying, you know what?
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:01.240]   There's just enough space between the license plate and the radiator.
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:02.720]   I'll use gaffer tape.
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:05.840]   I'll put a couple of twist ties just to be safe, but I'm going to shoot video of the
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:08.360]   entire two hour drive and it'll be awesome.
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:11.520]   And I'll watch it once and I'll think it's awesome and I'll never actually show it to
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:13.280]   anybody, but it'll be awesome.
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.680]   But I'll have it.
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:16.720]   It's go pro dot.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:17.720]   Come.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:20.600]   And now it's time for Mr. Don McAllister to give us a pick.
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:24.240]   I'm just wondering if I can get one of those cameras before it goes to New York on Friday
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:25.640]   and do the line with Russia.
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:26.640]   Yes.
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:27.640]   Russia order.
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:28.640]   Yeah.
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:29.640]   Okay.
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:31.200]   Well, my pick is an iPad pick.
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:32.200]   I'm not a designer.
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:35.720]   I'm not particularly good drawer, but there's one that actually caught my eye and an application
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:40.480]   called InkPad by the, it's the guy who, who actually designed brushes, which I think was
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:42.560]   one of the first iPad applications.
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:45.400]   And it's a vector illustration package.
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:49.960]   So you can actually create these vector diagrams, sports multi layers, all sorts of Bezier curves
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:50.960]   and everything.
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:53.760]   But the thing that really fascinated me is just how well the touch interface works
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:55.960]   on such a complex application.
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:59.080]   And normally you think of these drawing applications as being very precise.
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:04.280]   You know, you need a tablet pen to actually draw or you need, you know, a mouse.
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:07.400]   But this is all done using the touch interface and he's done it really well.
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:10.600]   There's some quite complex and quite advanced things in there.
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:14.120]   And it really irritates me when I hear of people, you know, sort of going on about how
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:18.160]   the iPad is just a, it's just for consumption and not for creation.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:22.160]   Well, this is one of those applications that's just shouting out, you know, create something
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:24.840]   in me because it's a beautiful application.
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:25.840]   It's InkPad.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:26.840]   And it is.
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:30.280]   Yeah, it's actually just been, I think was only launched a couple of days ago and it's
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:31.280]   currently on offer.
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:34.480]   I think it's $199 for a limited time.
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:36.480]   Or I think it's £1.19p.
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:38.560]   So it's been a good one.
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:43.320]   One pound and almost a shilling or something.
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:45.520]   InkPad from Steve Spring.
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:48.360]   Sir Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:50.800]   Sorry, I was busy buying InkPad.
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:55.440]   So anyway, so anyway, I've already bought both the camera and I know I'm ordering the
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:56.440]   camera afterwards.
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:00.440]   There's a little too much of a distraction at one time.
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:05.120]   So mine, this is something I saw at CES and then they sent me some of the tests and I've
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:06.640]   actually really gotten attached to them.
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:08.200]   So this is by Proclip.
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:10.520]   It's proclipusa.com.
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:17.320]   And what they do is you want to attach your iPad or your iPhone to your car, but I don't
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:18.320]   want to screw anything in.
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:19.440]   I don't want to make it permanent.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:21.800]   I don't want to stick anything or screw anything.
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:24.360]   I don't find that suction cups really work.
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:28.000]   And so what they do is they have this little guy here.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.160]   So that is a custom made for the CRV 2010, which is what I have.
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:35.440]   So you actually go into their little website and there's a little worksheet.
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:39.760]   You say, I have this kind of car and this year and this is where I want to put it.
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:42.120]   And they literally give you this.
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:44.040]   So this is fit to your desk.
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:45.040]   It goes into the seams.
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:48.120]   You literally, you poke it into the seam and then pull it down and it just pops and it
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:49.120]   just grabs onto the seam.
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:52.640]   It doesn't do any, you know, it's not permanent, but it's very tight.
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:57.400]   Like I put one into my CRV for my iPhone 4 right by the driver's seat.
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:59.080]   And then what it is is modular.
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:02.480]   So that's just the, that is the anchor.
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:04.520]   And then you can buy different things.
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:12.000]   So this one, for instance, is for the iPhone 3 and 4, and what that little base there can
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:18.160]   be unscrew that little base that's in the bottom and you screw that into the, you screw
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:19.160]   that into that one.
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:20.960]   But that could be an iPad holder, it could be a whatever.
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:26.240]   So you put these bases in and then you screw the different mounts, you know, on it.
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.880]   So this exactly fits an iPhone.
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:28.880]   Right.
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:29.880]   And that one's actually a little adjustable.
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:32.320]   So you can fit an iPhone 3 or iPhone 4.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.320]   I put the iPhone 4 in.
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:37.920]   And it's a really nifty little device that I put it in.
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:40.720]   I mean, I've been really wanting something that sits right next to my driver's side.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:44.000]   So I can put, so I can do my Tom Tom and it's right where I want it.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.280]   I'm not looking for it and reaching for it.
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:50.200]   And anyway, so that is my, that's my hardware pick.
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:52.920]   The only other pick I have is that I do have a new game.
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:54.480]   I get Twitter questions.
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:56.560]   My new game is World of Goo, which I played on the PC.
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:57.560]   Isn't this fun?
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:58.560]   Love World of Goo.
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:42:59.560]   Yeah, I've played on the Mac.
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:02.120]   On the Mac, I mean, and it's, it works really, it works.
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:05.560]   It's more fun on the iPad than it was on the, it's also in the App Store.
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:06.560]   So it's everywhere now.
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:07.560]   Right.
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:08.560]   App Store, OS 10.
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:09.560]   Right.
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:12.960]   And if you haven't played World of Goo, it's, it's just a great, it's great.
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:14.400]   So that's it.
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:16.000]   Alex, this picks my pick.
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.920]   Well, I came from some research I was doing this Morgan, trying to figure out what we're
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:24.600]   going to use when we go to South by Southwest to stay in touch with each other.
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:29.000]   And I, there are so, this is the hottest category out right now.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.160]   There've been a couple out for a while.
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:31.160]   It's group messaging.
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:33.120]   Maps been around for a while, text plus.
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:38.440]   The idea initially of these was that you would use your 3G or Wi-Fi connection to bypass
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:44.080]   text messaging and just go directly, which makes it a little faster and certainly cheaper.
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:47.200]   You don't have to buy any additional text plan.
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:48.520]   But now there's a whole ton of them.
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:52.560]   Beluga was just sold to Facebook, but it's still around.
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:56.360]   And all of these guys are tuning in, by the way, now you can connect with Facebook.
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.000]   What a surprise.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.320]   They're all being tuned up for South by Southwest.
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:06.520]   Remember that Twitter launched in 2007, the Southwest, 4-square in 2008.
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:13.040]   It's been a great place for people to use software of this kind and expose it.
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:17.840]   My pick right now, after trying all of them, group me, kick, yobongo, yobongo is kind of
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:20.240]   neat because you don't create a list of friends.
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:22.760]   It just says, "Who's nearby using yobongo?"
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:26.280]   So you could say, "Hey, what's a great sandwich place around here?"
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:28.520]   "Hey, wire.
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:29.520]   What's app?
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:33.760]   Text plus, there's Vauxer, which is an iPad as well as an iPhone app that allows you
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:37.000]   to kind of do a walkie-talkie thing.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.040]   But I like this one, Fast Society.
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:42.120]   Oh, yes, I have an internet connection.
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:45.280]   Fast Society allows you to set up groups.
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:51.880]   It asks you right at the beginning, "Where's the party, man?"
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:56.520]   So it's very party-focused, but you make a team and a team has a kind of lifespan.
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:45:02.840]   I've made this one, the South, Twitter, South by Southwest for seven days, but you can also
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:07.400]   make it forever if you should show choose.
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:11.360]   It allows you to send text, but also multimedia stuff.
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:16.240]   You can even send a, I don't know why it's not opening here, that's thinking.
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:21.080]   You can even send a message that says, "Here's where I am with a map."
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:23.880]   It's kind of like glimpse what we were showing earlier.
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:27.000]   So this is, if you're going to South by Southwest or you're going to an event, this might be
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.200]   a great way to kind of stay in touch with a team.
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:31.640]   I've got all my team members on here.
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:33.400]   All of these will look up.
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:43.280]   You can use push, i.e. 3G or Wi-Fi or text messaging if you wish, so it'll use either one.
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:44.280]   It's pretty interesting.
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:46.840]   This one is called Fast Society.
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:51.840]   All of these are being updated right now as is GoWala and 4Square at all.
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:57.600]   These other location-based social media apps because they're just, this is the time of
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:00.520]   year when the apps come out to play.
[01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:01.520]   But I did like Fast Society.
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:07.200]   I thought that was, as you can see here, it says "built to party."
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:09.640]   So they're really focusing on getting around to the party.
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:10.640]   There it is.
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:14.240]   You can see you have six days, 21 hours or 49 minutes left.
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:16.240]   Sarah's on this.
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:17.880]   It is iOS only.
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:19.200]   I've made a list of them.
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:21.000]   We're trying to figure out which one we use.
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.760]   It's kind of crazy.
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:23.760]   Kind of crazy.
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:25.000]   Does it rotate when you rotate it?
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.600]   Does it give you a different?
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:31.000]   Not as far as I know, although I may have rotation turned off.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.640]   I don't like, I kind of don't like things.
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:33.640]   No, I don't.
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:34.640]   It's not turned off.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:35.640]   Kind of like don't like things to rotate.
[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:36.640]   No, it doesn't rotate.
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:37.640]   It doesn't rotate at all.
[01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:41.000]   And it doesn't have an iPad version.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.000]   But you know what?
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.840]   I'd love to hear if somebody's got a better choice.
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:46.440]   We haven't decided yet.
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:47.440]   We might use Beluga.
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:50.920]   The problem with Beluga because Facebook has bought them is who knows how much longer they're
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:52.320]   going to be around for.
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.320]   Facebook?
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:54.800]   No, Facebook will be around.
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:57.000]   But Facebook typically kills companies when they buy...
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000]   I think Facebook's a big flash in the pan.
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.000]   It's not going anywhere.
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.000]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.440]   Now they've got those Facebook comments.
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:07.640]   And I have a feeling that basically everything's going to go through Facebook in the future.
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:10.000]   What did you see you can now rent movies on Facebook?
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.400]   And now they're doing Warner Brothers just asking you to get the Dark Knight?
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:14.680]   That you can buy with Facebook points.
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:15.680]   But how do you...
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:17.040]   But you can only play it on your computer, right?
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:18.400]   I think so, yeah.
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:19.400]   So when's...
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:24.080]   You know, next Facebook's going to do a Facebook TV device, right?
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:26.400]   Or just integrate it with the TVs that are already out there.
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:27.880]   You know, who needs the internet?
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:30.560]   We've got Facebook.
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:31.560]   Facebook and Apple.
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:32.560]   Facebook is the internet.
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:34.400]   And Apple is hardware and we're done.
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:39.080]   A tort who's one of our photographer friends who joins us in the chat room all the time.
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:41.200]   He's a really good photographer.
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:42.360]   Send us this picture.
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:43.360]   You might like Andy.
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:45.040]   He took this with his...
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:48.680]   His Go camera, his HD Go driving through a tunnel.
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:50.680]   He didn't move, but the car obviously was.
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:51.680]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:52.680]   Great.
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:53.680]   99 bucks.
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:56.880]   Why don't we do that for 99 bucks?
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:57.880]   $99.
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:47:58.880]   All right.
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:00.880]   Let's get the heck out of Dodge.
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:01.880]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:05.320]   Thanks to our sponsors Squarespace and Citrix with Go to Meeting.
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:08.640]   And our brand new sponsor, really glad to have Smile Software with us.
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:10.080]   And make sure you try PDF Pen.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:11.280]   It's really awesome.
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:12.960]   And Alex, Lindsey, thank you for being here.
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:13.960]   Thank you.
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:14.960]   Great to have you back.
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:18.920]   Alex is at the PixelcorePixelscore.com for that great guild of multimedia artists learning
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:19.920]   and working together.
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:23.720]   And of course, Pixelcore.tv for the great shows that they produce.
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:25.600]   And Boredersack is his blog.
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:26.600]   That I sometimes update.
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:30.960]   One, you know, Andy, I mean, Alex starts a blog every six months.
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:31.960]   Updates it for a while.
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:32.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:33.960]   And then I go...
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:34.960]   And then I go...
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:35.960]   And then I go...
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:36.960]   I haven't started doing one for a long time.
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:37.960]   So I'm gonna stick with this one.
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:40.320]   It's great to have you, Don McAllister from across the pond.
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:41.320]   He's coming to New York.
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:42.320]   Get ready.
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:43.320]   Yep.
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:44.320]   Thanks for having me.
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:49.040]   But for that 50% discount for Macbreak Weekly, people are still on Screencast Online.
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:50.840]   So just use the coupon code MacBreakWeekly.
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:52.400]   Well, that's fantastic.
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:53.400]   Thank you.
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:56.800]   I'll leave it running anyway, because I get a lot of interest from the viewers and the
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:57.800]   listeners, so that's cool.
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:01.840]   We love Screencast Online, so I'm really glad that we could do that.
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:07.080]   Screencast Online, use the offer code MacBreakWeekly when you check out.
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:09.400]   Thank you so much, Don.
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:10.400]   No problem.
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:12.880]   And of course, Mr. Andy Inotko.
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:13.880]   Thank you for being here.
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:16.920]   I know you've got lots to do with that new iPad too, so you just go on out and enjoy
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:18.920]   with your little doggy.
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:20.920]   Is that your god, boy?
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:24.640]   No, we don't know what he's got.
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:25.640]   We don't want to waste a guy.
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:29.560]   But I have to say, I think about half of our chat room now has a GoPro camera.
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:30.720]   Well done.
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:31.920]   Well done.
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:36.040]   They have a photo of the day Facebook page, by the way, if you want to see that.
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:37.800]   And Todd just sent me the link to that.
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:42.760]   Andy is at the Chicago Sun Times, and of course his website's www.cwob.com.
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:44.720]   We'll look for that GoPro review soon.
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:47.880]   And your MacBook Pro reviews as well.
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:49.160]   Thanks for joining us, Andy.
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:51.440]   Good to have you back home.
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:53.480]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:54.480]   We'll see you next time.
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:55.480]   Now get back to work.
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:56.480]   Right?
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:56.480]   Time's over.
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:03.480]   [MUSIC]
