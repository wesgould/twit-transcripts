[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Alex Lindsey is here. Renee Richie and the Inako.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   It's a slow news day, but there's still lots of talk about, including that new Apple malware that even affects M1 based Max, what Apple's doing about that.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   The epic versus Apple battle continues on. We'll talk about the Unreal Engine versus the competition. Alex Lindsey has some thoughts about that.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   And then it's rumor central. There's lots of rumors. We'll debunk one about an Apple event next month. It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   And here we are gathered together. The three of four of us with no news at all. Alex Lindsay is here from 090.media.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Hello, Alex. Oh, manually. Color graded with a custom LUT. He is exactly the right head size. His Boca is beautiful.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   What else can I say? I felt like I had to pick up the pace a little bit. My first couple were a little rough.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Perfection. I had to get back into the design. Perfection. Also with this Andy Vaco from WGBH at Boston, Boston Public Radio.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Hey, I see you have your CU, your Colorado University hat. Are they doing their annual, what is it called?
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   The Conference on World Affairs. They're doing it virtually for the second year in a row.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   So, oh well. It's the sort of thing where it's sort of like a Ted Conference light where the big thing for the public is.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Hey, look, here's some videos you can watch. So they'll still get their mission done. It still works.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   And this way, everybody can go. Everybody can go and cost the speakers like $1,300.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Yeah. It's an uncomfortable day to deal trouble.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Oh, it's nice to get together and bolder and see everybody in all that, I'm sure.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Exactly. I keep meaning to... Well, I'll go the next time they have a live one.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Also with this from Montréal. It is René Ricci, Baudreis from...
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Montréalillo, San Fabien. San Fabien from youtube.com/René Ricci.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I love the "No New Shows." The "No New Shows" are the best shows. Historically, I believe...
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Yeah, because we can talk about WandaVision. Yes, you can explain what's going on.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Alex is what? All of the above. There's mostly just rumors this week.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I was warned. And malware. I remember the malware.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Rumors and malware. Rumors malware. I guess let's start with the malware thing,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   because there's actually good news on that as well. Apple has taken steps.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   But first, let's report that this malware discovered last week by a tech security company, Red Canary.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   They called it, by the way, Silver Sparrow. So maybe they have a thing about birds.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   But Red Canary discovered that there was a strange malware.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   First of all, we love it. It's one of the programs optimized for the M1.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   On the bright side. That was hilarious part to me.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   There was so much terrible reporting. One of the big newspapers, a trade paper,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   is actually said, "I'm going to go throw my M1 in the trash now. What's even the point?"
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Apple spent the WDC and the November event telling you how easy it was to port code
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   from Intel to M1. That's all anybody can do. It's just code.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And they don't... Red Sparrow doesn't say whether it's a fat binary,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   but I would guess it's universal. Right? I don't know.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   They use the dev tools. Okay. They use Xcode. It's odd, because it doesn't do anything.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It has been found according to Red Sparrow on 30,000 max worldwide.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   How is that? Is that because Red Sparrow... They must be offering some sort of antivirus or something.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   They're working with malware bytes. Malware bytes gave them that data that at least...
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   That's only confirmed citing, so there could be way more than that.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Yeah. 20... Yeah. So that would have to be Mac users who put malware bytes on their system,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   and then the malware bytes discovered 29,139.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Mac OS endpoints across 153 countries, mostly US, UK, Canada, France, and Germany.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   But what's weird, it has no malicious payload. It doesn't do anything.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   It installs itself. It does set up a command and control server.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   One of the commands, apparently, that it's capable of is erase yourself now.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   So there's some speculation. Maybe it's just proof of concept.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Yeah. Well, I didn't have it. I checked right away, and it was not on my system.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   So I don't know how it was spreading.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   So far, we ended up quoting our technique. So far, researchers haven't seen either binary do much of anything.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Prompting the researchers to refer to them as bystander binaries, the X86 code...
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   It's the crowd. They're like, "We're going to do something really bad, but we want a lot of computers to watch."
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   They're ordering. They want to... Stand back and stand by.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   When run, when executed, the X8664 binary displays the word "Hello World,"
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   while the M1 binary says, "You did it."
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   It's just a test, Leo. Everyone's got it run tests. Everyone's got a beta.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Apples responded by revoking the developer certificate for both files, which means you'd have to go through hoops.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   You couldn't solve the system. It has intended.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Yeah. The system working as X, I think, X protect, is looking for it.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   So they revoked the certificate, which is exactly what's supposed to happen, which is why I found the reporting so amusing.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   It's a curiosity. It deserves some attention. It deserves information, but the reporting was so curious.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   According to Red Canary's resembles previously seen macOS, Adware.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   It's literally ported. It's ported over.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Since there is a command and control server, it could be... You could have it sitting on your system and then it could be activated.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Patrick Wardle says the most notable thing was that it was found on almost 30,000 Mac endpoints.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   These are only the endpoints malware bytes. You could see. The numbers probably way higher.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   That's pretty wide spread.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   How?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Say again, Renee.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   I just how it got there. I don't want to cut Andy off, but just how it got on so many machines.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   That's right to me.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   I was going to say the same thing.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   If this story broke, the blog post hit on Friday, most of the... So it gave everybody basically a weekend to start scrambling about this.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And we still don't know much more than what was in the original blog post.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   So we don't know what the purpose was. We don't know what the vector of transmission was.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   It looks... It does look like you're classic. Let's create this botnet or let's create this network of infected machines
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   that we could then essentially rent as a cloud computing sort of core for whatever malicious things that people want to do.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   But the thing is that usually when these things are created, they're created stealthily enough that they're not detected before they actually do anything.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   To say nothing of the fact of why are they so interested in Macs to begin with for this sort of thing.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   It's always smart to remind ourselves that Macs are absolutely not virus proof. They're not malware proof.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   However, given that most of the people that are writing this stuff, they're writing it for profit so that they can create again a network so they can do things anonymously or create this amazing laser cannon weapon to attack the website or the service of someone's choice,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   it just seems weird that they would choose to rope Macs in on there. Although I will say that this is a testament.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Apple has reason to be proud. This is how easy it is to create code for the M1 processor. It's exactly that simple.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   But oh well.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   There is a clue here, Dan Gooden writing in ours, Technica. Once installed, Silver Sparrow searches for the URL that the installer package was downloaded from.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   He says most likely so the malware operators will know which distribution channels are most successful.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   The URL check though suggests that malicious search results may be at least one distribution channel.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   So you do a search for an app and then the installer poses is that app. This is one of the reasons I don't recommend malware bytes because the real malware bytes works but people type in malware bytes and the search results may well include
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   a rogue malware by said is the malware. So it's the exact opposite of the intended function.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   An Apple spokesperson provided a comment on the condition. They not be named in the comment, not be quoted. So that's all I can say.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   No, the statement said that after finding the malware, Apple revoked the developer's certificate. Apple loaded. There's no evidence of a malicious payload being delivered.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Really, the most impressive thing about it is that it's buying. There's still binaries. One for x86 and one for the M1.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   I thought even impressive. It's like checkbox. It's easy. It's easy. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, I would guess you're right, Andy, that there is a payload. It just didn't get around to doing it.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   How did you, Renee, how did you just look for it and remove it? Did you use a tool to do that? I didn't remove it. Like I just looked at what I do is every once in a while I'll download malware bytes and I'll just run it like once or twice, like once every month or every two or three months
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   because I don't like leaving on the system because it uses far too many backward background resources for my liking. Yeah. And I use good behavior. So I'll just do it as, or just to see, like in this case, I didn't really need to run it, but I wanted to see if it detected anything. So I downloaded it.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Said there was nothing there. So then I promptly removed it again. Yeah. Yeah. That's probably the best, best thing to do. There are also online scanners. I don't know how well they work though. You know, and all Apple stuff is all Apple. It's all secret in a black box. Like, I don't know what x protect is protecting me from. We're discovering or blocking and I don't know a gatekeeper. Like, I just don't have that feedback.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   So if I want to know something, I have to find it safe to assume that because of the steps, Apple's taken that we don't have to, even if you had it, you wouldn't have to worry about it or no, you should still try to detect it and remove it.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   It shouldn't be able to execute because of both this and the other one, the developer certificates were revoked. So it shouldn't be. It shouldn't be run.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   It shouldn't even run. Okay. Yeah. But if you already got it.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   It couldn't run on boot, right? For that reason. No. Yeah. It couldn't. It could no longer run because it's no longer signed. But if you want to add an abundance of caution, you can always download something, run it and then remove that thing.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Right. Yeah. The rules about malware is that you never know if they've come up with something incredibly clever that will do an end run or anything else. So yeah, I'm absolutely with Renee.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   I don't run malware bites as often as he does, but it is one of those things where once I hear about something, I will install it, check out my system and then remove it again.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   It's not a bad piece of software. It's just that, like Renee said, a lot of background processes that I would much rather not have to deal with.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   And to be safe, make sure you get it from malware bites. Exactly.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Go to www.majbytes.com and that's M-A-L-W-A-R-E-B-Y-T-E-S. It's important you spell it right because some of the rogue malicious versions probably spell it differently.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Well, I think it's always a good time to talk about whether you're on a Mac or a PC to you just have to be really careful about what you're clicking on.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   There's just a lot that's going out. One of the things that I'm probably more problematic about related to my kids in school and we'll get stuff from the school or teachers that just CC you know all the parents that are there rather than a PC.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Oh God. I mean, you know what I mean.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   I don't like teachers because honestly they've been thrown into this. No one's taught them how to do this.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   No, no, no, no. I'm not going to.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   There was a very important, Michael's a senior in high school, so it was a very important counseling thing for the kids.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   And three different invites were from three different zoom meetings were sent out.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   And so Lisa and Michael joined obviously joined the wrong one.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   So they were sitting there for an hour. Nothing happened.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   And then they sent out and they said, "Oh God, we're sorry. We sent out three invites."
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   So they said, "Here's the new invite, but they had the wrong date."
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   So, and I don't blame them. They're not trained to do this.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   It happened with my colleague.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   No, no. And this has been for years though. It's not been COVID that we get these from different teachers.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   And I know that they don't know what that situation is, but I'm that parent who always goes back, please don't do that.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Don't, you know, I'm not angry.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   I'm just like, you know, by the way, you really need those emails.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   You're just, you know, that's like, it's been actually easier to talk to teachers about it now because I just related to a virus.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Like you just, when you send it out to everyone, it's like, you know, you know, you know, everybody has one.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   You teach them to use BCC. You teach a man to use BCC and he can fish for life.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   I just found out that people don't know you don't have to reply all on Twitter.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Like we all get all these things where they're responding to 30 people.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   It's nothing to do with us. And it's like one word.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   And I put up a short note saying you can actually click one box and it won't be, it won't copy everybody.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   And most people didn't know that. And I feel like it's a service to Twitter if they make that more apparent.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Yeah, I am so hesitant to say thing bad about teachers because God, this has been a tough year for them.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Yeah. And we're very, you know, it's not, it's mostly like I just always feel like an education parent.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Yeah, but I'm that parent. I'm always like, I don't want to sound it makes it sound like I'm complaining.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   I know that things are hard. I just, I just, but I do want you to not do that again.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Educate.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Oh, God, this meeting is public. Please. This meeting is public. Oh, God.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Oh, there you go. That was our story for the week. Thank you very much for joining us.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   See you next week. Bye, everybody.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   See you next week.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Apple is, as long as we're in this vein, let me also do this story from a motherboard.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Lorenzo Franceschi Biqueira.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Apple is going to make it harder to hack phones with zero click attacks.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   By the way, which also makes it harder to jailbreak them.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   So it's, you know, it's a win-win.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   It's hard to differentiate between good, you know, good actors and bad actors.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Good zero click attacks and bad zero click attacks.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   So this is something that will be coming in a 14-5, which is imminent, right?
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   How, how, how, how soon Renee pretty soon?
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   My, my guess is it'll tie in with whatever they do for a March release cycle.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   If there's an event, yeah, we're going to get to that March.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   They did last year with the Magic Trackpad and the cursor support.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Right.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Several security researchers, I'm reading the story from motherboard, who specialized in finding vulnerabilities in and crafting exploits for iOS.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Believe this new mitigation, this new secure code system will make it much harder for hackers to take control of an iPhone with a zero click exploit.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Remember, there was a very bad zero click exploit exploit, just a discovered or revealed just a month ago.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   It had been patched before it was revealed, but it was scary.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   It will make sandbox escapes more difficult significantly harder to at least, you know, that's the plan.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Something around, something around ISA pointers.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   They're doing a lot there.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Like they're doing a blast door.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   They're doing the zero click.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   They're really addressing a button.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   They're hardening a bunch of security of classic security vulnerabilities.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Well, and it's one of the advantages of the way the platform works because their whole business is around, is not around advertising, not around having to get through things or be opened.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   They can just keep on closing the doors and welding them shut.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   You know, and so it's a little easier for them to do than other platforms.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   I mean, this is actually surprisingly akin to welding it shut.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   They use crypto to sign pointers with the pointer authentication codes or PAC codes to cryptographically authenticate the pointers and validate them before they can be used, which keeps bad guys from executing arbitrary code by modifying the pointer and saying,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   "No, no, don't run that area memory. Run my area of memory."
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Do you have to tell the kids that crypto has nothing to do with dodgecoin in these days?
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Has it been so perverted that we have to actually put disclaimers that this is security cryptography and not cryptocurrency?
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   I have to do my daily check on the Bitcoin.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Oh, it's down to 46, 8, 8, 1.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Holy cow, I should have...
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Tesla lost 30 million.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Elon's no longer the richest man in the world, thanks to his big Bitcoin investment.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Actually, I think they made money on it, and then they lost money on it.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Which is kind of the...
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   As one does.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   As one does.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   I think that's the malware report.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Unless Steve Gison comes up with something later on in the day, and I'm sure he...
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Just be informed.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   But don't be scared.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   I think a lot of times these headlines are done to scare people.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   My mom calls me and she's like, "Oh, BBC is saying that there's malware on the new Mac."
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   She's like, "No, no, just let them inform you, but do not let them sensationalize or scare you."
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   That is the real malware.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Do you tell mom to use malware bites?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   No.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   My mom has moved...
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   We got an iMac, and she liked it, but we moved her to an iPad Pro, and that is the best computer she's ever had.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   It's the one that's made her feel most empowered.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   The one that's let her do the most things.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   She doesn't have to worry about a lot of the computer-y.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   And my mom is like a university professor.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   She taught art history and architecture and all these things.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   But computers just didn't...
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Classic computers were just a lot of overhead for her.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   And now it is incredible to me how much of a utility a tool an iPad has been for her.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   And luckily, so far we don't have to worry about those kind of things on iOS.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   I wonder why Apple...
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Maybe it's time for Apple to have some sort of a little widget inside the utilities folder that says,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   that will do that kind of a scan for you automatically.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   Not a new form of Gatekeeper, but here's a database of signatures that we keep uploading,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   updating every single day.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   If you want to check to see if you have been infected by a known form of malware, run this app,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   it's already pre-installed.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Because, like we've been discussing, oddly enough, one of the easiest, one of the most popular vectors for malware is
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   to infect an app that scans from malware or protect against malware.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   I just send my mom the Apple platform security white paper and I say, "Read this, mom.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Everything is in there."
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   But they have that app.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   That app exists.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Like that app is Ex-Protect.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   It is just totally headless.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   It does all of that.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   It checks signatures.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   It's up to you at all times.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   It's just frustratingly for people like us.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   There's no front end.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   So we can't see what it's doing.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   We can't tell that it's found those things that it's protecting that it's been updated.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   And that's probably good for most people.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   It's not good for us.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   And the ironic thing about all of this is, yes, it was super easy, barely an inconvenience to port any code,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   including malware code to M1.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   But M1 is hardened like iOS is, like the A15 is.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   They are secure top to bottom.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   So it's almost like you ported your garbage, but now you're throwing it against a steel box instead of a balsa wood house.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   So congrats.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   I'm going to burn my pick of the week.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   I have another one, so I'll find something else.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   But this was going to be the pick of the week.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   This came out the most recent security platform paper.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   This is such a good document that Apple puts out.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Is it a yearly thing?
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Every version of iOS.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Every version of iOS.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   And it refers, by the way, to iOS, iPad, OS, Mac, OS, TV, OS, and watch OS as well.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   So there's a lot of information in here about encryption, about app security, about why you're safe on a Mac.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   And it shows, and I'm sure, you know, this may well be.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   I haven't checked with Steve yet.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   I wouldn't be surprised if he made this one of the topics for security now because he's always, he reads these.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   This is his idea of a great bedtime story.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   And he, he, it variably says, I am so impressed with the stuff they're working on, the stuff they're thinking about,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   and the way they think about it, it's very, very impressive.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   So, they do put out a lot of really good user facing documentation.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   There's even a doc that's entirely based on, here's how to lock down your account and your devices.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   If you feel as though someone who previously had access to your device is now someone that's kind of dangerous.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   And it's not a technical paper, it's not even, I'm sure it's probably part of the, it's probably support talking.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   But it's a PDF that you can simply download and just read in iBooks or wherever.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   And it's, it's like a commercially created book to that walks you off through the stuff.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   So, this is something that I wish that Apple could promote a little bit more.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   You usually have to go to, I find these things and I bookmark them.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   But every time I think I found like the entrance point, do we hear is where Apple stores all of these documents?
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   I find out that this new document that I found is not available there.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   The starting point is the iBooks store and look for documents that were created by Apple.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   But there's such a wealth of great information that people don't have to pay for and is the canonical argument on the topic.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   And this is, of course, the deep dive, the white paper for security professionals.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   But it's, you know, it's, it's great.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   And they are so smart.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Like that team is run by Ivan Karstek, who's, he did Bitfrost and he did the first versions of sandboxing.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   And he did a talk at Black Hat last year, famously describing how some of these things work, like how Apple protects all of the different handoff continuity features that I thought was remarkable.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   But I love the consideration they put into it.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Like when they think of these systems, they're designed for humans.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Like, well, a real person might want to do this.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   So how do we allow a human to say, no, I actually want to do this and not just lock everything down because every system is safer if no humans are involved.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   But unfortunately, we've got to build it both ways.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   And the sort of, they're not always perfect.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   They always have mistakes.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   They try to fix them fast.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   They're getting better at doing that.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   But I love the sort of human approach they take to security.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Yep.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   So if you want to find that, you can just search for the February 2021 Apple platform security document.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   And I tried to read it.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   I did.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   First few pages, not too bad.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   You had audible stuff to get through.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   And I went back to listening to podcasts.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Let's take a little break.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Andy Enoco, Renee Richie, Alex Lindsay.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   I'm going to task you because we've just run through all of our news stories with coming up with something, something to talk about in the next segment.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   No, I think actually there's a few other things.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   We can talk about the Apple and Epic battle, which is even more epic.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   LOL.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   LOL.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   LOL.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   Our show today brought to you really quite literally by the new tech TriCaster to Elite.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   As you know, when we first started doing video, I talked to everybody, including Alex Lindsay.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   And he said, "Get a hardware switcher."
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   But I said, "But I need so much more and I don't need all that."
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   And I said, "So I actually, I think it was against your recommendation probably, Alex.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   I bought the new tech TriCaster."
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And I have never looked back.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   I love our TriCaster.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   And it's really made it possible for us to do what we do.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   It's, yes, it's a live video production system.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   And we use this much.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   We use 10% of the total capabilities of it.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   But it's really much more than a live video production system.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   It's an all-encompassing digital media solution that will help you, no matter what you're doing, whether it's creating content for the Internet, or mobile devices, or streaming, or whatever.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   And it's really a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   And so we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   And that's really, really important.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.

[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   And we're doing a lot more than the actual data that we're doing.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   And we're getting emails from Leo late Sunday night.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   Like, where is the episode?
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   I'm like that.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   I'll have it to you at like three o'clock in the morning.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   I'm like, here it is.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   And now we could totally do it.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   We could totally do it.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   We could ISO each camera and then just have the editors, you know, just do the whole thing
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   after the fact.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   But you know, when we got the track, Esther, we got a nice new control board, too.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   You should come in and see it.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   It's really sweet.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   That's the one with the instant replay button.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Nice.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   On we go with the show.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   A bunch of victories, I think, for Apple.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   A UK court has said Epic Games cannot contest Apple's Fortnite ban.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   I think that's the US courts have already ruled that.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   The UK antitrust tribunal ruled on Monday Epic Games cannot pursue its case against Apple
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   in the UK over its app store payment system.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   I think it's victory after victory so far.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   That's what we did.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   What did Mark say?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   It was hilarious.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   He said they Epic demanded Scott Forest Hall's last known address in contact information.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   And Apple supplied a PO box in his Twitter handle.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   They're having trouble finding Scott Forest Hall.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   The musicals are closed.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   It's not in production right now.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Forest Hall has kept a very low profile since he left.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   He's doing, as you said, Broadway production.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Epic wants to depose him, I would imagine.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Apple offered to pose and then later represent Forest Hall, but Epic says Apple is now staying.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   It never offered the deposition.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   They say Apple "kipped promising it would provide a date for Mr. Forest Hall's deposition,
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   but it did not."
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.600]   It's amazing how many of the smoking guns in both the US Congress and Epic's court cases
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:25.000]   hinge on emails between Steve Jobs and people in the 2009, 2010.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   I really hope they have more than that.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.240]   The thing that really keeps alarming me though, and initially I thought that Epic could be
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.640]   really good here, but when it came to that point where the judge said, "Why don't we just
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.000]   put the money in escrow?"
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   And when you figure all this out in court, let people keep playing or put the money in escrow.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   And when we figure this out, then whoever wins gets all the money and Apple said, "Yes,"
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   the judge said, "Please do this."
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Epic was like, "Nope."
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   I'm like, "Okay, your intentions are clear to me.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   I'll be following this very differently from now on."
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Epic has asked to and will be allowed to depose Tim Cook and Craig Federighi, a judge ruled
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.280]   in December that they will have to appear for a deposition at the request of Epic, but Epic
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:10.560]   has to march tense, not so long, but a few weeks, to locate Scott Forstall and to see
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.560]   his agreement.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.720]   I feel like Scott might.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.200]   Is it possible he's hiding?
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.200]   No.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.760]   What is it going to tell them?
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.760]   What do they want to know?
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.560]   What do you thought about the app store when you launched it?
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:25.560]   He just wanted a safe app console for users, and he was super pro accessibility.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.440]   It's like when Apple wanted to get the information from Valve.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:31.880]   It's like, "I understand this is legal shenanigans, but at a certain point it makes you look silly."
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.080]   Well, and Apple makes a good point.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.080]   They can't force.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.320]   He's not an employee.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.680]   They can't force him to testify.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.880]   It's just not.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:45.640]   I think the fundamental problem is that Epic's case is really weak.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:50.760]   They were hoping to get more of a groundswell from users and everything else.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:55.960]   I think this was more of a political play than it was an actual legal play, because the
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.440]   legal play was really, really bad.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.320]   They just found that Apple users don't really want to be messed with.
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.560]   These don't want things to change.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.880]   Apple was pretty good at cutting their legs out from under them when they started creating
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:16.240]   a 15% for everyone making for 90% of the developers now.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:21.040]   I think that they've been kind of flanked a couple of ways.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.760]   They're just getting swallowed up in it.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.960]   The problem really is that they had a really good relationship with Apple.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:32.560]   They're getting shown off on one or two keynotes a year, which they've pretty much eliminated.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.600]   That's not going to happen again.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.600]   Most likely, Apple, with all the AR stuff, Apple needs a partner.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.200]   The only other partner is Unity.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:46.720]   They now have Apple gunning for them with their partner, I guess.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:51.800]   We haven't seen it yet, but it seems like the natural place to go.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.760]   It just seems like it was just a...
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.760]   We've been...
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.560]   I guess I've been saying this since they won.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.400]   I mean, I'm a huge fan of what Unreal did.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:03.280]   If you look at the new meta-human project that they did, it's one of the most stunning
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:06.800]   CG things I've seen in a long time.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.240]   They're doing stunning work.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:13.840]   It's just unfortunate they're making unforced errors in this area that they should just drop.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.840]   They should just drop and walk away.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.080]   They're not going to because they're too much pride in it.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.880]   They got too much PR in it, but they're going to lose.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:25.040]   It's going to cost them a lot of money.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.040]   They smell the money.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   They smell the control.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.920]   They smell the ability to become the next Google Play or the next App Store.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:34.320]   They want the Epic Store to be unequal footing, and that's such a tantalizing prize to try
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.320]   to win.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.760]   It's billions and billions of dollars.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:43.200]   It was probably worth the gamble from their point of view though, because when you start
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:48.600]   asking yourself, "My partner is not doing much for me in this partnership, I would like
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.240]   to divest myself of this partnership."
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:56.000]   Not only that, but there are ambitions that we have as a company that we can't achieve
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.640]   if we are handcuffed to the terms that this company is giving us.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:06.120]   Every single company's biggest goal is to be able to be as independent as possible,
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:11.640]   to be able to pursue absolutely its own five-year plan unencumbered by any other outside
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.640]   force.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:17.680]   If I imagine that their idea was that this was worth the gamble because they thought
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:21.520]   that it was going to be likely that they would get some sort of concession that would work
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:25.240]   for them, that would be better than the situation they are in right now.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:30.240]   When you look at the things that they're giving up, it's a point of pride to get a showcase
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:35.320]   in the keynote, but how does that translate into more people actually paying for their
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.320]   product?
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:43.080]   Their development platform, that's no one's—so long as Apple doesn't ban the use of
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:48.040]   that platform and that product on all other apps that are being submitted to the App Store,
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.960]   that's also kind of a push from where they go to.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:55.000]   I agree that it was foolish in retrospect that—and I agree that at this point, they're
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.160]   kind of stuck with this legal action that they can't really back out of until they're
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.480]   willing to sort of eat a lot of crow here.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.120]   But it wasn't foolish.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.640]   I mean, it's stupid.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:11.000]   It does come down to independence.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.960]   They almost had dominance.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:18.880]   So if Unity is used in the next two or three—one of the next two or three keynotes that Apple
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:23.840]   does, that's the expense, is that they just put a company that most of us had forgotten
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.880]   even existed back on the map.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.360]   Because most people don't know who Unity is.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.480]   I mean, a lot of people don't.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:36.800]   And so if Apple starts pushing them hard in the next couple—because Apple's got
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.840]   an AR thing that they're doing, they need—I don't think they can do it all themselves.
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.920]   They need that platform.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.240]   And I think that Unreal was that platform until then.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.640]   And AR is in the baby states.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:53.000]   So to say that it's not going to hurt them, Apple, I don't know how anybody else is going
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.720]   to be very competitive in AR.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:58.400]   And Apple's going to run down the path on that process.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.800]   And Unreal is going to get shut out everywhere Apple can shut them out at this point.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.880]   And I think that the problem is—I'm not saying they should have never picked the fight.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.360]   I'm just saying that I think they picked it too early where they—you've got to always
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:12.360]   understand when you pick a fight, like the size of the opponent and the size of yourself
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:17.240]   needs to be comparable enough that you can actually think that you can pull it off.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.480]   And I just don't think they miscalculated it painfully.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:27.600]   And I think that, again, that we'll see, if Apple doesn't put Unity on the map, then
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.160]   it's probably not that big of a deal.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:36.600]   But if Apple promotes Unity in one of the next three or four keynotes, that's going
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.240]   to cost them billions.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:41.160]   Is Unity as good as Unreal 5?
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.160]   No.
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.840]   It doesn't look technically good, but it's really widely supported.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.680]   And it seems like big companies like Pokemon use it.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:52.280]   The one thing I'd like to add before we switch on is that this often happens when things
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.800]   slow down and Fortnite is slowing down for Epic.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:55.800]   That was their golden horse.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.360]   And now, for everything, it's slowing down.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:02.080]   And when that happens, one of the worst but most common things people do is they stop
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:05.600]   looking at how to grow the pie for everyone and they start looking at how to take more
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.920]   of the pie that exists for themselves.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:11.240]   And you see this destroy so many valuable partnerships over the years.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.280]   It's like, you're getting 50%.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.280]   I'm getting 50%.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.600]   I feel like I deserve 60%.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.120]   And then you go to war over that instead of doubling the 50% value for everybody.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:25.440]   And I fear that's sort of where Tim Epic ended up in all of this, seeing Fortnite slowing
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:30.520]   down, seeing maybe some potential in the Epic store, and realizing that if you pick this
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:35.240]   fight now, it might stop growth, but it might get him a lot more short term value.
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.240]   Alex, what is--
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.240]   I think that Apple--
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.240]   Go ahead.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.240]   Go ahead.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.240]   Sorry.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.840]   Alex, what is Apple lose by losing Unreal?
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.280]   And Unity step in and give it--
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:50.640]   Yeah, from the Unity's easier for the little guys to use, right?
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.640]   And it's--
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:55.240]   Yeah, a lot of our early development was all in Unity because it was just easier to set
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.240]   up.
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.840]   So it was easier to get it up, get it running.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:02.560]   The tools over time have become much better on Unreal.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:06.800]   And Unreal, from a broadcast perspective, we do a lot of stuff in broadcast.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:13.680]   We can't use Unity because Epic spent a lot of time supporting 29.97 instead of the
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.680]   30 frames a second.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:18.280]   And that turns out to be, for us, a real problem with Unity.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:21.320]   So Unity is very much an online platform tool.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:26.400]   It can't be-- so Epic's gone into all these other worlds of broadcast that we really can't
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.320]   use Unity for.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:33.040]   So at that moment, we started forking over most of our stuff to Unreal.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.320]   And there's a lot of great tools in Epic.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.600]   And again, the new engine is amazing.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.400]   The new meta-human project is amazing.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.560]   So there's all these things that you want to use.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:49.000]   But as a primary Apple developer, you kind of go, well, let's see how this goes.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.760]   And so there's a bunch of us.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.880]   There's still a lot of people that are just using Unreal.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.600]   I don't think that it's hurt them yet.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.160]   So for instance, you can't block Unreal.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:05.680]   That would hurt a lot of people that are not Epic.
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:09.760]   Right now, I don't think it's hurt them that much.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:17.680]   And it starts to hurt is really going to be when-- if Apple starts expanding-- because
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:25.360]   again, I think that AR, especially on the Apple platforms, is that it's very, very small
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.000]   state, very beginning of that hockey stick.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.760]   And I think that-- so they basically cut that all off before it started going up the hockey
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.960]   stick.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.400]   And now Apple's going to be focused on a lot of other things.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:42.160]   And that, I think that the market that is going to most likely happen with AR is going
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.120]   to be far bigger than anything that games was doing.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:48.840]   And I know that sounds crazy, but I think that AR, when we start looking at where we
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:53.600]   can put AR and how we can use it, it is almost in the possibility.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:54.600]   That's interesting.
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.920]   So the future of these gaming engines is not-- I mean, of course, it's going to be games,
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:00.840]   but it's AR as well.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:01.840]   You use it too.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.720]   It's embedded into everything.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:09.440]   So if you-- like some of the tests that we've done, we started building out-- you can start
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:14.240]   using the real world as a context, but you can have all kinds of other things happening
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.400]   inside of AR.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.880]   So we were playing around with tests where we scanned my family as a golf course.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.880]   We scanned the whole golf course.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:25.280]   And the idea was that we started playing with the idea that you can play a different game
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.280]   on the golf course.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.280]   Like, there's little things that pop up that say, try to hit this and you get an extra
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:36.720]   strike or you try to hit this over here with all kinds of extra bits and pieces or when
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:42.040]   you walk into an event center or something like that, having all the directions that
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:47.560]   you want on a heads up or being able to tour historical locations on your tabletop and
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:51.400]   being able to just move your-- we did one of the early tests we did actually in Unity,
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:44:02.680]   was having a band play-- a live band, there are CG version of themselves, playing in a
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.360]   motion captured, but live.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:08.240]   They can stop talking to you, all those things.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:12.600]   And you can move your hand-- you can't-- camera around, do-- get close up, go wide.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:16.120]   And so there's a lot of these things that are going to be-- and then obviously the game,
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:19.920]   that's why Magic Leap got so much money that they didn't turn out.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.680]   But the point is, is that if that comes out and Apple keeps on going down that path and
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:30.120]   you start to see it, like even with the new phone, with the new 12, you go to their Apple's
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:36.240]   website and tap on one of those little objects in USDZ and have it pop up on a table, and
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.240]   you can rotate it around.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.880]   Well, imagine every product being like that.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.600]   So I'm in Amazon and I want to see a product and I want to pop it on my table and rotate
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.600]   it around and open it up and look at it and everything else.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:50.880]   So games are-- there's really games that are big market, but everything is a bigger market.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.400]   There's three distinct markets then.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.160]   There's the video production market like Mandalorian.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.640]   There's the AAA game platform, just to the general game platform.
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:04.160]   And now this AR platform are three distinct markets.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.360]   Why doesn't Apple have their own engine?
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.600]   Why don't they have an Unreal or a Unity-style engine?
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.280]   Well, I mean, they have parts of it right now.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:17.120]   If you look at AR creator, I mean--
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:21.080]   Should they just buy Unity and--
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:25.640]   That would have been a great thing to do a couple of years ago, but it's exploded.
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:26.640]   It's too late.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.360]   Yeah, these companies are too expensive to buy.
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.640]   I mean, they're too expensive to buy for that.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:34.400]   I mean, Apple can afford it, but sorry?
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.400]   There was TeamKit as well.
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:39.320]   There's TeamKit and there's AR creator and a couple other tools.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:42.360]   But are they in the League of Unreal Engine and Unity?
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.720]   No, they're just--
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.280]   We're talking about a decade of production.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:49.880]   A decade of creation knowledge is really hard.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.080]   That's the kind of thing as a company you buy.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.400]   You don't try to develop yourself.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.760]   Is it the same?
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:58.000]   So I always assumed it's AAA game engines.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.920]   But is it roughly the same job to do for AR and movie production, or video production?
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:05.880]   Is it for--
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:06.880]   They're all using real time.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.680]   It's all the same thing.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.640]   Well, they're not the same.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.760]   They have different requirements.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.360]   But they all are using these real time engines.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.960]   And they're using them in different ways.
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:19.840]   So games made in one area would or would not help you.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:21.320]   Mandalorian news is unreal, right?
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.120]   Yeah, Mandalorian is unreal.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.800]   For some of the backgrounds.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.360]   And there's definitely--
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:31.920]   eventually, we're going to see situations where you can merge those things together.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:35.520]   So imagine having an AR rollout from Mandalorian
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:40.760]   that lets you walk through the sets with your phone because they're all done in 3D.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:48.120]   And we're looking at running some of the Unreal 5 video from the announcement back in June.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:52.280]   This is the thing that really-- this in the meta-humans is what the--
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:58.840]   I mean, these are billions, literally, as Carl Sagan was a billions and billions of polygons.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:03.080]   And it's in the lighting.
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:09.400]   And if you look at that display, I mean, we're really getting to a whole new world
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:14.240]   of where this stuff is going.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.960]   And so it's pretty stunning.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:21.400]   And so the new engine and the meta-humans has a lot of us excited.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.320]   But if you're--
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.880]   Can Apple afford to lose Unreal Engine?
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.200]   Does Facebook have their own engine?
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:27.520]   They can't.
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:30.040]   Don Carmack give Facebook an engine?
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.480]   I don't think so.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:34.000]   I don't think so.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.720]   There's been a lot of--
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.840]   I think there's a lot of legal issues around that.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:49.240]   So the-- but I don't think Apple Day 1 needs what Unreal's doing as far as that level of realism,
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.800]   because I think that it is--
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:58.600]   if you look at USDZ, the way you're using it as an example files or 3D pieces of visualization,
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:02.760]   I don't think that the really high-end Unreal stuff is stuff that they need.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.400]   It'd be nice to have, and they would show it off.
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:09.680]   But what Unity does is plenty for what Apple's going to do probably for the next couple of years.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:17.560]   Could Epic hold the Unreal Engine hostage as part of this battle?
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:18.640]   I don't think so.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:19.640]   I don't think--
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:20.120]   I don't think--
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:26.920]   Apple-- Apple's number-- I still think that Apple's number one problem for this decade
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.360]   is going to be antitrust.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.480]   So how they treat everyone is going to have to be--
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.800]   it's got to be kid gloves.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.440]   That's bigger risk.
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.520]   So they just have to be really careful.
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:40.840]   They can't just shut somebody out, but they can put whoever they want on their keynotes,
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:44.840]   but they can't start shutting out engines and so on and so forth.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.520]   That's going to get them into--
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.840]   But Epic couldn't--
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:53.400]   wouldn't want to shut off Unreal from Apple either, right?
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.720]   I mean, that's not in their business interest.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:59.320]   They did hire some of Valve's really, really good 3D people,
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:03.480]   like a lot of the high-profile 3D people from Valve are now on Apple's payroll.
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:06.440]   So there are some indications that they're working on this stuff.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:11.960]   I definitely see Apple poaching-- you know, poaching Unreal, you know, and poaching,
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:16.440]   you know, really hard, you know, and that could be a more problematic thing.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:20.280]   Although, again, because of things like John Carmack and
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:27.160]   Leventowski, you know, got to be very careful about poaching and--
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.120]   Well, they can't bring anything.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.480]   You can't bring anything with you, including your own brains, apparently.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.920]   They said we don't have Scott Forstahl's number.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:40.200]   I looked in the internet Broadway database and the last show that the Forstahl's have produced
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:44.120]   was back in 2016 and they don't have his number either.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:47.240]   So it might be hard for Epic to find--
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:48.520]   He's spending time with his money.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:49.000]   What do you want?
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.440]   It might be hard.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:51.720]   He has next stock.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:55.720]   He learned very quickly something that anybody has ever produced a Broadway play.
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:59.080]   I was told this by somebody who tried to produce a Broadway musical.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:02.360]   It's the fastest way to turn a billion dollars into a million dollars.
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:05.560]   It's just not a good investment.
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:12.520]   So it looks like Scott and Molly, her, his wife, have decided to end their
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.760]   involvement with Broadway a few years back.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:19.800]   Apple is now the number one cell phone brand according to Gartner.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:23.880]   Apple sold 80 million phones.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.680]   Apple doesn't break this out, but according to Gartner,
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:33.000]   80 million phones in the last calendar quarter of 2020 following the launch of iPhone 12,
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:40.120]   overtaking Samsung to become the world's largest smartphone maker for the first time since 2016.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:45.320]   Huawei, which had been doing really well in China, suffered a sharp slide.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:50.040]   Their sales were down 41% in the quarter due to US government sanctions.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:58.200]   So Huawei now, number five on the list, Xiaomi and Oppo also Chinese companies are actually ahead of
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:58.600]   Huawei.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:04.600]   Now, and I think some of that is the lack of Google apps on the Android devices.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:08.760]   Just the US market, they're fine inside China without Google.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:12.280]   They're mostly fine inside China without Google, but not being able to sell into the US market.
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:15.480]   Like they just announced a new foldable that everyone's going gaga over.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:20.440]   And it's so expensive because they don't even have access to a lot of the manufacturing
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:22.360]   resources that they had previously.
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:25.240]   So it's super expensive, looks super nice, but no one in America can buy it.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:26.760]   So it ends up being a curiosity.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:32.120]   Let's take another break.
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:40.360]   As I continue to scan the wires, looking for news, actually there's some concerning news.
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:45.080]   Tiger Woods was in a horrific auto accident in Los Angeles.
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:47.640]   They actually had to cut him out of the car.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.920]   It's unknown, his condition.
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:53.480]   But we don't do breaking news here, but I did think I'd mention that because I know
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:57.000]   some of you are following that story.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.600]   Those of you who are watching live anyway.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:05.080]   Our show today brought to you by, as it has been for a couple of episodes now, Uber
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.760]   for business.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:12.760]   Now, I know you all know everybody knows Uber, but this is for businesses who want to
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:21.880]   use Uber as a way to reward clients, colleagues, keep your employees engaged,
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:27.240]   keep your customers happy, especially nowadays where we don't even see our employees.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:31.160]   We don't have face-to-face interactions or when we do this very limited.
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:34.040]   Uber for business is exactly what you need.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:40.760]   You can use Uber to gift rides or meals from restaurants you love.
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:47.240]   Over 160,000 companies are using Uber for business to improve customer and employee satisfaction.
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:49.480]   Just think of all the ways you could use it.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:54.040]   If you're having a hard time getting people to show up or stay engaged in virtual team meetings
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.880]   and events, I know it's hard, right?
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:53:01.640]   With vouchers for Uber for business, you can add 20 bucks to their personal Uber accounts so they
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.240]   can order meals through Uber Eats.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:06.520]   You can say, "Hey, if you come to our meeting, lunch is on me."
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:10.520]   Want to make your customers love your business even more?
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:15.160]   Offer them a voucher for a free meal or a ride when they make their first purchase or
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.600]   spend a certain amount.
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.440]   Any company can sign up.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:19.640]   It's free to sign up.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:26.280]   Best of all, you don't pay for the rides or meals until they use the voucher.
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:31.080]   You can immediately start delivering extra value to the people who matter most.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.880]   They're simple to send, simple to redeem.
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:37.080]   You have total control over who gets the vouchers.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.920]   You can set an expiration date.
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:43.000]   You can say what portion of the ride or meal you want to cover.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.920]   Share them via email.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:51.320]   You can even text them and your employees or customers can redeem them with a single tap.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:53.880]   But again, until they do, you pay nothing.
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:58.920]   Right now, for a limited time, get a $50 voucher when you create your first
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.080]   vouchers campaign and spend 200 bucks.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:05.480]   Go to uber.com/macbreak to learn more.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:06.200]   That's Uber.

[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.520]   What a great way to spiff your employees or to thank your customers.
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:20.680]   Uber.com slash Macbreak terms and conditions apply.
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:22.920]   I just bought a new car.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:26.840]   It'd be kind of cool if when you got a dealer and you got a perspective,
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:31.160]   you could say, "I'll send you a voucher so you can take an Uber over here and pick up your new car
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:32.200]   or take a look at our cars."
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:42.200]   I can think of all sorts of ways you could do this.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.040]   Uber.com slash Macbreak.
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:47.240]   Apple is cracking down on apps with the irrationally high prices.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:53.640]   Now, this we talked about this last week with the subscriptions that are $50 a week and things
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:58.600]   like that that you just don't really notice until you've paid thousands of dollars and so forth.
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:06.200]   According to 9-5 Mac, they got a rejection email from a developer that provides a subscription
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:07.560]   service through their app.
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:11.480]   The message from Apple says their app would not be approved because the prices,
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:16.680]   quote, "do not reflect the value of the features and content offered to the user."
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:21.640]   The email actually says, literally, it's a rip-off.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:35.160]   9-5 says, "The first one's going to have to defend that process and I think it's good that they're
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:42.520]   going down that path because I signed up for something on some little app that I was testing
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:47.560]   and then proceeded to end up paying something like $150 over a year.
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:48.760]   I just forgot about it.
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:53.400]   It was sitting there somewhere and I suddenly realized, "Holy smokes, I used this for 10 minutes
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:57.240]   and paid $100 a few dollars over a period of time for having it on my phone."
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:01.640]   Then, immediately went through and unsubscribed from a whole bunch of things.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:07.000]   I just went into this mean, and basically, what I got into the habit of is just unsubscribing to
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:07.480]   everything.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.920]   When it comes up, I make a decision.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:17.320]   You can unsubscribe to something with a one-year, now what I do is I buy stuff and then I let it
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:21.160]   wait a day and then unsubscribe and then it gives me a warning that it's unsubscribing or whatever.
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:26.040]   But it will automatically, basically, I've created an expiration date for the month or for the week
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:29.080]   or whatever, especially if I haven't used it very much.
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.840]   That's not the behavior Apple wants.
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:34.840]   Or the developers is people creating expiration dates, but if they get screwed,
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:38.040]   they get really touching and then they tweet about it and talk about it.
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:40.280]   It's not good for anybody.
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:48.120]   So Apple's just basically saying, "We want to make the app store safe for our users and
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:52.200]   some of these ridiculous prices are a little scammy."
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.240]   A rip-off.
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:55.160]   That's a very Steve Jobs phrase.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:56.520]   I have a feeling.
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:00.280]   At first nine to five, Max said, "When we saw rip-off in the letter, we thought this must be a
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:04.760]   phony, but then we looked through the guidelines and rip-off appears many times in the guidelines."
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:09.000]   I could just see Steve dictating that one.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:09.880]   It's a rip-off.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:12.760]   Let's talk about rumors.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:15.800]   And first, we'll start with a rumor debunking a rumor.
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:22.600]   Mark Gurman, there is not going to be a March 16th event.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:30.120]   This is just a guesswork from, and you've talked about this a lot, Renee,
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:33.960]   too unreliable Twitter-Mac leakers.
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:36.920]   Anonymous Twitter rumor thirst traps.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:42.280]   So tired of these wannabe leakers, as Joe Russen y'all.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:46.120]   Frontron is one of them.
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:54.280]   And it's pretty clear that it was just based on previous years,
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.120]   March 16th is probably when it would be.
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:58:03.080]   And in fact, it could be March 16th, but Mark Gurman says, "There won't end up being one."
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:05.640]   It's getting worse.
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:08.840]   There are a few accounts that are totally anonymous.
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:13.320]   They continually post things that are not true and increasingly large-scale blogs,
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:17.800]   like some of the biggest blogs in the industry are covering it based on them and
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:19.480]   sourcing, not dual sourcing.
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:22.200]   And then they say the same Twitter account will say it twice,
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:27.960]   and then those videos will say confirmed as if two fake rumors suddenly means that Apple
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:28.920]   has an announcement.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:32.360]   And then they go back and say, "Oh, this was fake, obviously."
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:34.760]   And they get a third bite at that Apple.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:35.880]   And I get why they're doing it.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:39.320]   I can't imagine the pressure that corporate overlords are putting on blogs these days to
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:41.320]   perform in terms of page use and stuff.
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:45.240]   But I would like to think they could do the exact same work and educate people.
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.080]   Say there's a rumor going around about this event.
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:52.040]   This is why it's not trustworthy or we can't depend on it or the reasons why it might.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:56.200]   Like just make some attempt at educating people while you're getting their click, please.
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:59:02.200]   Gurman actually says, "There will not be an event on the 16th."
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:05.320]   He's not even just saying that's speculation.
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:07.800]   He's saying, "There will not launch."
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:09.400]   He says he tweets launch-
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:11.000]   He might be one on the 16th.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:11.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.280]   Yes.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.680]   Yeah, it's like the 16th.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:16.520]   The 16th is not when the event will be, I think he's saying.
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:17.800]   Okay.
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.920]   Obviously, there's got to be a march.
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:27.240]   If at the 16th is a Tuesday, could it be the Tuesday before or after or what do you think?
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:31.400]   I think betting odds are on one of the Tuesdays after and at this point.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:31.720]   Okay.
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:37.640]   And this would be when we'd see the rumored new iPad Pro, maybe a new mini
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:39.720]   AirTags.
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:40.840]   I had Pro and AirTags.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:44.760]   John Prosser put up a video about it saying the only thing that he's heard,
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:45.400]   there could be more.
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:50.200]   The only thing he's heard is iPad Pro, new Magic Keyboard and AirTags.
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:51.480]   Oh, and a new Magic Keyboard?
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:53.080]   What would be new in the Magic Keyboard?
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:54.760]   I don't know.
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:58.840]   I think it's early for a new Magic Keyboard because they typically let accessories linger.
[00:59:58.840 --> 00:59:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.600]   Well, and there's nothing wrong with it.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.520]   I don't know what you would do to fix it or change it.
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.000]   Maybe I'll escape.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.080]   So, developers put their torches down.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:05.400]   Okay.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:06.520]   Escape key would be nice.
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:11.160]   You could replace it with the same keys, which is they put in the M1 Mac Pro.
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.440]   Back with Pro.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:12.680]   Okay.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.240]   So.
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.040]   It's the...
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.320]   Why they have a...
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.080]   Why they have a plug in the ear to do that?
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.120]   I don't know why, but...
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.200]   I would love for it to...
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:25.800]   Yeah, be a little more on the keyboard and then have an M1 chip in the iPad Pro.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.200]   And they just...
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:30.440]   Well, you'll get an A14X, which is essentially the exact same thing as an M1.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:33.240]   Yeah, they have the Apple without the Mac Pacific Silicon.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:33.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.800]   It pretty much is an M1, right?
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:36.600]   That's the whole idea.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.480]   Or vice versa.
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:43.320]   Yeah, it just doesn't have the virtualization and the translation, the Rosetta stuff in it.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:46.200]   German does say, and I think this makes a lot of sense.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:51.800]   Apple's working on a MagSafe battery pack that would go on iPhones,
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:54.120]   snap on iPhones.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.400]   He says it's been delayed.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:59.480]   They've been working on it for more than a year because of software issues.
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:06.440]   The battery pack would snap onto the back of an iPhone 12 using the MagSafe system.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:11.480]   Some prototypes have a white rubber exterior.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:18.920]   The new accessory would only differ from Apple battery add-ons for previous iPhones
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.200]   because it wouldn't be a case.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.000]   It would just be a little battery pack.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.840]   And it wouldn't be as efficient, which is weird because the whole point of the smart battery case,
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:30.520]   the whole reason why a bunch of reviewers didn't understand it to begin with is because it was
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:36.760]   all based on efficiency, not the total amount of power delivered, but the efficiency that it was
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:37.400]   delivered at.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.320]   Wireless inductive charging isn't that efficient.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:44.600]   So curious to see how much power they can actually deliver in a reasonable package.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:48.520]   Why not just, if you're going to put something on, why not just use a lightning port and do it
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:49.080]   efficiently?
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:53.880]   To say nothing of mitigating the heat that you kind of burn off when you charge that way,
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.240]   and how that would affect performance?
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.720]   Actually, Anker has such a thing.
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:08.520]   Yeah, it looks like the wallet, but it's a battery pack.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:12.920]   A MagSafe compatible wireless power bank.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:18.280]   For iPhone 12 users, the Anker PowerCore magnetic 5K wireless power bank,
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.640]   5K because it's a 5,000 milliamp hour battery.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:31.560]   It can basically refill an iPhone 12 mini to 100% an iPhone 12 to 95%, 97% on a 12 Pro,
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:35.480]   only 75% on the 12 Pro Max.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.760]   They don't say how long it would take to do that though.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:42.120]   $39.99 shipping March 3rd.
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:47.400]   Yeah, it's really interesting to me because again, when they made that smart battery case,
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.320]   the things that it did, it was cut around the sides, so it had that hump, but that
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.840]   meant it didn't obscure the radio.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:57.240]   And usually battery cases would obscure the radio, making the radio amp up the power draw,
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.880]   defeating part of the purpose of the battery pack.
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.760]   And it did a bunch of smart things like this, like I kept it in mobile mode,
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:06.040]   so wouldn't start doing all the networking and then waste even more power.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.200]   And this is almost like the ultimate version of that.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:12.600]   It cuts away everything, but literally the battery sells, but isn't active.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:16.200]   New research note from Guoming Chi.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:20.520]   I'm going to use your preferred order of names.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:23.080]   Renee, which is correct, right?
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.920]   You did Chinese.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:26.440]   Yeah, that's correct.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:32.280]   Guo is his surname and Ming Chi is his personal name.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:35.080]   And so usually it's surname than personal name.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:35.800]   Guoming Chi.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:41.000]   Anyway, Ming Chi Guo, however you say it, has got a new research note that,
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.680]   I thought we talked about this already, but it says that we did in the second half of 2021.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:46.840]   Not this note.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.000]   He's now repeating the same for a mark.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.040]   He had it first, and I think then Mark followed up, and now he's following up on the follow-up to
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:54.600]   the follow-up.
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.080]   Got it.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.760]   Well, there's consensus now.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:00.120]   Either that or an echo chamber, I'm not sure which,
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:05.320]   but the MacBook Pro that will be released in the second half of 2021 will have an SD card slot.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.160]   I know Alex is happy about that.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.960]   And an HDMI port.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.280]   Wow.
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:15.160]   USB-C as well as high-speed USB 4.0 upgrades.
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:17.240]   I would like to see the SD card slot.
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.680]   Some people are complaining about this already because they're worried that Apple's not going
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:24.360]   to just add them on, but are going to take away some of the USB-C ports.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.600]   And they feel like those are more multipurpose.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.080]   And they're also thinking that Apple's only going to do like,
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.760]   I forget, I think this was on 9-5 Mac.
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:34.040]   They're going to do a micro HDMI port.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:35.880]   So you're still going to need a dongle.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:39.720]   It's just going to be reducing the amount of useful ports for a specific kind of dongle.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.720]   So we're always going to have the sum of all fears.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:46.360]   Well, I have to say that I don't, I almost, I don't own any.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:47.720]   SD cards.
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.880]   I mean, I don't use any cards regularly.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:50.680]   I use micro.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.720]   They're all micro SD.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.000]   I only buy them as micro.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.240]   And then I buy them, they come with a little adapter.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:55.640]   Really?
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:57.240]   And I do that as I have so many cameras.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.600]   Yeah, I have so many cameras and my drone and all these other things that use micro.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.920]   It seems like a waste of money for me to buy with something that's so big.
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.520]   Just put an adapter when you're going to use that.
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.080]   But in your bigger camera, you just put an adapter on it.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.600]   So we're the adapter.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.080]   It's just as fast.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.280]   It's just as good.
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:10.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.040]   Just as fast.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.320]   I'm going to have to look at that.
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.600]   I never even thought of that.
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:16.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.920]   And I do have like, I have a Dell with the micro SD card reader and I thought,
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:21.960]   well, who needs that?
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.680]   I guess Alex does.
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:25.800]   And now I understand.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:30.200]   Well, for like lots of some of the little cameras and then also, again, drones are all,
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:30.760]   are all that.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:38.520]   For me, it's like, I have CF Express cards now from my C500 and my R5.
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:41.640]   And so I'm going to benefit from getting the darn card reader back.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:44.280]   Other world computing has
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:49.480]   announced they've made a cable universal for everything.
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:52.600]   The only cable you'll ever need labeled.
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.960]   There it is.
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.720]   USB four.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.440]   Oh, look, it's got a four on the cable.
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:03.160]   Of course, it's a type C interface design for, I guess, the current max.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:07.480]   I will say that I'm really glad they learn thunderbolt four,
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.600]   thunderbolt three, USB C, USB four.
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.240]   It does it all one cable does it all.
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:18.920]   Can deliver a hundred watts of power up to 40 gigabits per second of data.
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:26.040]   8K video capability connected to a four K five, K six, or eight K thunderbolt or USB
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:30.360]   C display one cable to rule them all.
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:33.240]   That's pretty good.
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:36.520]   I just like that it's labeled like, I mean, it's good.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.160]   It's good to have it.
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:37.640]   I know.
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:41.000]   I'm going to roll them all, but but oh my, you know, like you just, you get these USB
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.080]   C and, and, and thunderbolt cables and the, and I never know which ones I'm absolutely
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:49.000]   certain are going to be thunderbolt versus USB C and see if they just kind of
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.720]   plug them in and see if they work and a lot of things work with it.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:54.840]   So for instance, I would just just stock up on these.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:58.280]   I'll throw out all my other cables and just stock up on these because it'll do everything.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.200]   28 bucks.
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:02.840]   It's not cheap, but it's not as expensive as some of them are.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:07.720]   And just the lack of frustration, not having to wonder, is this a power delivery cable or not?
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:07.880]   Right.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:09.560]   Will this handle displays or not?
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:09.720]   Right.
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:13.240]   Like USB C was supposed to solve all this and it made it worse because they all looked
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.520]   that's so confusing.
[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:18.760]   So this has a four on it and a little lightning bolt.
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.040]   So now you know what you got.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:25.880]   And I'm very much looking forward to adding it to my collection of going back 15 years of
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:28.280]   the 1 cable I ever need for the rest of my life.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.680]   Point eight meters.
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.560]   That's 2.62 feet for 30 bucks.
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:35.960]   I don't know.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.000]   I am tempted.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.280]   I have to say, having many times used the wrong cable.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:43.800]   I have an enormous number of USB C and Thunderbolt cables.
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:47.080]   When I may get like, I'm looking at that, like I might get four of those that just go into my
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:49.080]   backpack that just go, I know what these are.
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:52.600]   You know, like it's just not like, I'm not going to get rid of the other ones, but I just,
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:54.360]   I know that these are going to work everywhere.
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:55.000]   Yeah.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:55.880]   I actually did that.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.320]   I ordered a bunch of them.
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:00.360]   They're sealed like Ziploc bag.
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.440]   And I just, I know those are the good ones.
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:03.560]   Those are the data ones.
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:06.200]   I can use those and I just keep them in my backpack.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:06.680]   Exactly.
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.720]   I will say that the cables are the one place where
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:15.240]   getting the good version of it is so much less expensive than getting the good version of
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:20.680]   the monitor, the good version of the CPU that it'll save you so much heartache in the future.
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:26.520]   This is why when I find like a one specific kind of commodity item, like a cable that I like,
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:32.120]   I will buy four copies of it and make sure that there is, there's a cop, there's one for my laptop
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:37.960]   bag, one for my backpack, one for like my small, my small case so that I will never have to like
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.360]   take it out of one bag to use it someplace else.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:42.920]   And everywhere I go, I'll make sure that I'll have the right thing.
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.480]   So the number of times I've been on a trip and I've been, I've been
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:51.240]   horked because I grabbed, I grabbed a cord out of my, out of my drawer where I keep all like the
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:55.880]   USB cables. And I accidentally grabbed a charge only cable and not, not a data cable.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:58.680]   It's like, ah, damn it, damn it.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:01.560]   Why must I do not always get this fuzzy into the lollipop.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:09.000]   Well, and I think that I have, I've had more failures due to cables than due to equipment.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:09.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.560]   You know, so that's, that's the issue.
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:20.040]   I've had cables. I think I have, I think I am frying things with my type C power delivery
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:25.400]   stuff because I think there are, at least there were originally in the early days,
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:30.840]   some, mostly was the headphones, you know, like the AirPods that have a battery case.
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:38.840]   But like my job was, I think I fried them by using them with, with maybe a hundred watt PD
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:44.120]   wall wart. And, and maybe they didn't have the circuitry to prevent it from over
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:48.360]   driving it. But I had a whole series of dead things.
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:54.120]   So be careful, I guess, or get, get, get more modern gear.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:10:03.160]   Speaking of which 52 audio, a Chinese, I guess audio site has the new, as a picture, they claim,
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:08.280]   which will be the next generation AirPods. Is this a credible source?
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:12.760]   It's, I don't know if that's what's incredible, but it lines up with all the rumors we've heard
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:17.160]   that Apple would be making them more like the AirPods Pro, but without some of the,
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:23.080]   like the pro level features, like the active noise cancellation, which is again upsetting
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:27.720]   some people because as much as when we had the regular AirPods, everybody wanted tips
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:32.040]   to make them more customizable. Now that it sounds like they're all going to have tips to
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:36.120]   people who like the original EarPods design are getting really salty, saying those are the only
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:40.440]   ones that didn't bother them by being inside their ear. So the news is I'm
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:47.080]   silicone tips, a shorter stem, but you're saying no ANC?
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:51.800]   Yeah, no ANC to keep the cost down. The ANC is going to stay on the AirPods Pro,
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:54.520]   which are supposed to be getting a no stem redesign.
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:57.400]   No stem, like the job.
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:01.800]   No stem. It's going wildly over getting rid of all these Paul Marks of the brand.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:09.480]   Yeah. Of pressure, they'll have a pressure relieving system as seen in the AirPods Pro,
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:14.440]   so that you don't create, like with the tips, you could create a suction.
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.280]   You don't want that.
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:21.720]   I think they discovered that with the stem, they were a lot too easy to find after they fall out
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:28.120]   of your ear and losing money on the re-cells. As we speak in today's mail, it's got a notification
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:34.760]   that the replacement earbud for my Sony noise canceling true wireless buds finally arrived.
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:41.960]   Because I've decided that's the last set of truly wireless earbuds I'm going to buy because
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:47.000]   they are just trying to keep up with a toddler who's running around the room. They are going to
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.400]   pop out. You are maybe going to be able to get it back. You are maybe not going to be able to get
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:55.800]   it back. There are just so many things that I do in my life that end with, and it's gone.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:03.800]   If you buy this rumor, then you'll be glad to know that these new second generation and
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:08.840]   next generation AirPods will appear in March. According to the rumor, they'll be part of that
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:13.160]   March event, which will not be on the 16th, no matter what you say.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.320]   Under no circumstances. Under no circumstances.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:18.600]   It might be the 17th. But not the 16th. We just know that.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:25.880]   I also rumored to be released this year, the Mini LED iPad Pro and MacBook models.
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:31.560]   I think that's a fairly safe bet. I'd love to see how Apple implements Mini LED that I'm really
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:37.560]   curious about to see how close to OLED they can push it while keeping the advantages of it being
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:41.960]   Mini LED. That's going to be really interesting. And I love the idea of making their
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:45.800]   escape you in the iPad. I think that's the place we can really show off the best.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:53.240]   Because a laptop is, it would look great, but it's not the playback mechanism.
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:57.320]   It's not the I'm just going to sit in bed and watch a movie on this thing device.
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:02.440]   And a watch and a phone, they're also nice, but they're not big enough to let you really, really
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:08.520]   enjoy it. And this will be a big, big upgrade for almost anybody like myself who bought maybe
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:13.000]   the first generation and has been looking at it saying, those bezels are awfully large,
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.720]   aren't they? Oh, micro LED. Wouldn't that be interesting?
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:23.240]   Yeah. And it increases differentiation from the iPad Air, which is now very much like
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:30.200]   a, you know, iPad Pro. And it also, they recently moved both like all these technical things like
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:35.560]   displays under Johnny Saruji. And he's very year over year methodical performance oriented.
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:39.400]   So I'm hopeful. I'm hopeful that we'll see more things like Apple modems, Apple displays,
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:43.960]   coming in the future, maybe not right away. But I think this all sets the stage for that.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:49.080]   I'm really hoping that we do see an iPad mini. So I think that's one of the greatest products
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:53.560]   that Apple's ever made. And it's, I'm kind of, I think it's kind of unfortunate that it hasn't
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:14:00.040]   received a lot of love or any love in the past few years. I mean, if it were, for me, if it were,
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:05.160]   if they were to create a very, very modern version of the iPad mini that has the same styling,
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.760]   of like very, very small bezels and a very high quality display,
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:13.960]   it would be very hard for me to turn that down because the number of even my, I think it's,
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:18.360]   I think mine is a third generation. It's, it's, it's old as hell. But the number of times where I
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:22.760]   just throw it inside this little satchel of mine because it is exactly what I need for the,
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:28.280]   for the day that I'm going to be having outside of my office. It is, it is the, it is the, it is the
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:31.880]   it is the unregarded highlight of the iPad line as far as I'm concerned.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:36.120]   This word is, I would love to see Apple make a magic keyboard for it too. Like if,
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:39.800]   how would you engineer a magic keyboard for an iPad that small? That is a problem. I want to see
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:45.720]   solved butterfly, with license, side beams, butterfly keyboard. Oh yeah. I could unfold this sideways
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:52.840]   keyboard. Yeah. For the first time, M1 Max are appealing appearing in Apple's certified
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:58.920]   refurbished store. This is a good place to save a little bit, not a lot, but a little bit of money
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:04.920]   on Apple gear. This is through the Apple store. Not a lot of money, a little money, a little bit,
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:12.520]   a little bit of money, 120 bucks on a refurb Mac mini. That's not bad. 150 bucks, 140 bucks on
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:19.960]   another Mac mini. They've got 13.3 inch MacBook. It'll pay for your dongles. 849 dollars for the
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:26.120]   base MacBook Air. Not bad. Or think of it as getting the, getting to max out the RAM for free,
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:31.720]   or getting to max out the storage for free. Right. These are, I'm not a big fan of refurbs,
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:35.720]   unless you buy it from the manufacturer with the full warranty and their current stuff,
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:41.640]   which usually means it was purchased and returned without being, almost without being used,
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:46.920]   you know, almost right away. They can't sell those as new. 14 pages of M1 Max.
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:51.880]   So there's quite a few of these. Those are all the people who bought the 8 megabytes, 8 gigabytes,
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:55.800]   immediately regretted it in order to 16 gigabytes. Yeah, probably. Probably. That's probably,
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:59.720]   although you can get some high end stuff.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:05.640]   Wow, we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel here.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:15.640]   Wow, there is just nothing. That's it. We're done. I can't. I can't find anywhere with these
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:21.160]   stories. You guys have anything? You're tapping out? I'm tapping out. Don't do it.
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:25.160]   Don't do it. I can't. I can't go on. I have a tiger Leo. I have a tiger.
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:32.240]   Oh, this just in Apple has released to Epic. What they say is Scott
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:36.920]   Fourstalls number eight, six, seven, five, three, oh nine. That sounds familiar.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.920]   Is that the butterball hotline?
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:46.680]   Just joking. You know, I did. I did watch an incredible landing on Mars on my Mac.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:52.120]   That was pretty cool. Okay. Was that not cool? It was amazing. And then even more cool yesterday,
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:58.600]   at the press conference, they showed the video. Boy, they got a couple of GoPros up there,
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:03.400]   something that's really good high quality. It was incredible. That three minute landing was just
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:08.840]   amazing to watch. I mean, yesterday and I just watched the video a couple times to watch it through.
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:12.040]   What did you think as a video production guy?
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:18.440]   Well, the choice of cameras were what I thought was amazing, like just that you that they thought
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:24.040]   to do it to point up and point down and to get the you know, the the mix of those I think was
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:28.760]   was really, really great. You know, I wish that of course I just wish they used a higher res
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:35.080]   sensor, you know, because it's just 20 megapixels. That's pretty good. Well, it's I guess maybe
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.920]   they just didn't show that on the YouTube one. I think they don't have the full. Yeah, I don't
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:43.720]   think because remember, they've got to download these from Mars. Although they said they almost
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:50.280]   have a gigabytes. Yeah, it's pretty amazing. Talk about a long ping. Yeah, so so the
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:55.480]   but yeah, I just thought overall, I just thought it was amazing. And
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:18:03.400]   that that right there was so cool that was over the. Yeah, but just the fact that you're looking at
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:09.320]   a video coming in from. Yeah, here comes Mars from space. It comes Mars. We're coming.
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:14.680]   Is perseverance complaining about its Google Stadia playback frame rates?
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:22.280]   You heard about the parachute code that got cracked. No, what happened? So, so you know, so if
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:26.760]   you look at that video, that there's a weird pattern of red and white on the on the parachute. Yeah,
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:30.200]   and I thought it was some sort of okay, well, I guess they got some sort of like an orbiter that's
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:35.720]   that needs to target on it. No, it's actually a hidden code with a pattern of stripes on there
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:44.360]   that spells out that the the inner circle spells out dare the the enters the second one spells out
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:50.280]   mighty and the outside one spells out things. So the message there mighty things and the outermost
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:58.360]   rings is the is the geo coordinates of the launch center. I think OMG. Of course, they didn't mention
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:02.840]   it that in say that they they tweeted yesterday. So okay, it took everybody only six hours to figure
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:08.280]   out that there was a hidden code inside the fence. So it's got a lot of talk now.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:13.720]   That is yeah, that is amazing. And then of course, we heard the first sound from Mars,
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:20.360]   which was surprisingly quiet. There the only thing you heard was something that you usually
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:25.640]   don't want to hear on a microphone, which is wind buffeting. Alex, did you think maybe this
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:31.640]   should have had a better wind, maybe a dead cat on that mic? Yeah, but yes, then you would have
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:37.160]   heard nothing. Nothing. Nothing. I got filled up with with Mars dust and then we wouldn't hear
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:42.680]   anything at all. But I it's fun. I think that there you know, I wasn't that excited about the
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:47.000]   coverage that they had for the for the actual launch. I felt like they could have done a lot more.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.960]   I think that these launches are just such an or not the launches, but the landing. I feel like
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:57.640]   there's such a huge opportunity to you know, excite kids. I mean, I stayed up and I stayed home
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:01.960]   from school and watched shuttle launches. And I was super excited about it. And you know, really,
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:06.360]   I stay a lot of my yesterday and watched it. Are you kidding? I was just as excited about it.
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:13.160]   11 AM. I'm there in front of the TV going, all right, let's see it. One and a lot of my interest
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:17.720]   in science and physics and everything else was it was my interest in rockets and my interest in
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:22.200]   rockets was from watching all the NASA stuff. And so I so I think that there's this unique
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:26.120]   opportunity when there's you know, millions and millions of people are watching to really
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:29.800]   take it over the edge. I think what they're doing here is exactly what they should do.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:34.520]   I think that they just need to do more of that during the actual landing where they just they
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:40.200]   really tightened up and make it a show. They have this video till later because they had
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:45.400]   a but but they just have there's all these explanations. They had some good animations and
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:49.320]   everything else. Yeah, you could turn if you handed this off to a TV, a real thing.
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:56.920]   Walter Cronkite. Let's face it. They just I think there's such a there's such a risk they would
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:21:01.320]   have screwed it up. I I love that I was watching it. I was watching them the direct NASA feed.
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:05.560]   And what I loved about it was it was just the engineer's big, really, really excited about it.
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:09.880]   No, I don't want to say that. Hey, who let's go to and now let's go.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:15.800]   No, in fact, that's what I don't like about the SpaceX stuff. It's too produced. I really enjoyed
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:21.720]   the guy. I think the guy who was narrating it and then shut up while it was landing.
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:27.080]   And then he comes back and he's he's kind of breathless and teary. And I think he was a former
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:32.040]   director. I Rod Pylai space guy told us on the radio show. I can't remember who he was,
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:37.160]   but he had a lot of he had the dog in the hunt. Let's put it that way. And he was just he was
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:41.960]   you could tell and I love I agree with you, Andy. It wasn't as polished, but I appreciated that
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:45.000]   because those were the actual engineers. Those weren't, you know, TV.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:51.160]   I felt a little bad for the for the public for the public announcement of woman who was doing
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:55.240]   the announcements. She was just as excited as everybody else. Yeah, but she has this. I'm calm.
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:22:01.800]   But she had the sense of touch down for the person who planned to a new dusty.
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:08.040]   So exciting. Yeah. So Alex, you can you could produce the hell out of it if you want. That's fine.
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:12.600]   Yeah, that's that's why I do it on location. Everybody let it let whoever wants to do like
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:17.080]   the color commentary, make it into a show, do that, but give me access to just nerds,
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:21.560]   engineers who are just like watching just watching like this, not knowing exactly.
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.040]   I get to do it on location. That's the whole point.
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:28.280]   I get a little irked by the space X stuff because it's a little too polished for my point.
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:31.480]   Oh, see, see, I think that space X is like half of what they could do.
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:36.280]   And the thing is, is that my thing is, is I agree with you that there are points in time
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:40.120]   where you want to stop and just just absorb it without anyone talking.
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.840]   And that's what Walter was good at. He knew when to shut up.
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:47.080]   Right. So I agree with you that you don't want to talk over important moments,
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:51.400]   but in a launch that's six hours, there's like, you know, there's 12 important moments that are
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:55.720]   each three or four minutes long. And then the rest of it, you can use at between it. You can be
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:23:01.240]   talking about how it works and behind the scenes. And like, I would be shooting behind the scenes
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:06.600]   of this stuff from day one, you know, the meetings, the, you know, you know, so you think about the
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:16.440]   packages. Like I was, we were talking, we had the guys from Frame.io on office hours last week.
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:20.360]   And they were talking about the keynote that they did the week before that. And, you know,
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:26.200]   that keynote is probably the best keynote I've ever seen by anybody. And I've worked on a lot of
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:32.360]   them. And they started shooting pieces for that, you know, 15 months ago, you know, like, you know,
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:37.320]   they knew where they were going. And so if NASA spent three or four years, you know, they should
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:41.160]   have videographers. I mean, when we work on movies, we have people wandering around behind the
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:45.240]   director shooting it all the time is really shoot all of that and shoot it great. And if we look at
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:52.760]   the Apollo 11 stuff that was released recently on Apple TV, I think in the movie, that, you know,
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:56.680]   that was 70 million millimeter film with their shooting and all that behind the scenes and
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:59.560]   loved. They don't, they're not, I don't feel like they're doing that anymore. And I feel like
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:02.680]   they, you know, they were, it was new and it was exciting. It's like your first, your first kid
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:07.400]   that you take all those. Well, ironically, and no, they, that 70 millimeter footage was lost for
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:10.760]   years. That's why they said Apollo 11 movie was a big deal. We finally got to see it.
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:15.160]   Right. But I'm saying that they even made the effort to do it. Now they can be shooting, you know,
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:20.760]   4k and 8k and 6k or whatever. Well, I mean, I saw Red felt like they could have used it during the
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:27.560]   show. Elon is for sure, because I saw red cameras on the dragon, a crew dragon launch for sure.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:35.000]   Hey, we have the, John has found the decoding of the parachute. So there is from the verge.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:40.200]   What it all means? Was it binary? What was the, how was it done?
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:46.760]   Oh, I don't know what that is. I have to double check. I think it was the
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:53.080]   Dits and Dashes based on sector and have to reread this.
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:25:00.840]   Cool. It's cool. Yes. Cool. You know, Alex, I'm told that NASA does offer a narration free
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:07.400]   version for EDU use. You could take that and polish it up, but you need the source material.
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:12.120]   I understand. Oh, you also need the budget. I mean, you need, you need the source material to do
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:16.840]   the background and you need a budget to do it. You know, that's all. I mean, it's, I think that
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:20.840]   there's an opportunity there, but I think that NASA, it's in their best interest to do it.
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:23.960]   And it's in the best interest of SpaceX to do it to get people excited about what they're doing.
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:33.880]   I think NASA is very PR aware that I've always been impressed by their kind of self
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:38.360]   awareness about all of this. They know they've got to get public support to get congressional funding.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:44.360]   Well, and they're very, they're very busy doing it too. I mean, I've done, you know, I've done,
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:49.640]   you know, three or four events with NASA and and probably not anymore after I just said this,
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:55.560]   the stuff I just said, but they, you're fitting into a slot where they're doing something every day
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:59.240]   with the space station. I mean, you know, like you get your slot, but there's all these other slots
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:02.920]   and they're doing all the stuff. And so there's tons of outreach and they do an amazing job at it.
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:07.000]   And, and they are so good at it. It's so much fun to work with NASA because they're,
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.440]   they're, you know, there's this, you know, just the comms. I don't know as a geek, as a geek.
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:18.200]   The ultimate geek is, is we were, I think I might have said this before, but we were on a shot where
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:22.280]   they go, you know, space station. This is Houston. Do you read us now? Like we read you loud and clear.
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:26.840]   They're like, they're like, pixel core. This is this is Houston. Do you read us? And I was like,
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:30.440]   we read you loud and clear. And then we looked over at each other, like we're talking to space,
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:36.200]   you know, like, anyway. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So, so it's, um, uh,
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:41.720]   anyway, so it's there. What they do it constantly, I just feel like,
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:48.440]   I just want more as someone who just loves, I think loves what NASA does probably more than any
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:53.640]   other agency in the United States government. You know, um, you know, that I just, I think my,
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:58.200]   my frustration is not out of. I don't think they're doing, I just feel like I just want,
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:03.720]   I want a week of a launch, you know, like a week of content, you know, around a launch as a,
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:09.240]   like the Oscar huge fan. Yeah, just like as a huge fan. I mean, I, to me, to me, a launch by
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:13.480]   NASA is way bigger than the Oscars. You know, like it's just, I'm so excited about what we're
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:19.000]   doing. No, but I totally agree. I just, I just don't want to wind up in a situation where someone is,
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:25.000]   to where at some point, some engineer with like three doctorates and is 20% responsible for the
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:31.480]   key systems is told, sorry, you're not good looking enough to be in the live video feed. If you,
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:35.560]   if you could like what we've set up a desk for you in another, I don't think you,
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:40.200]   but I think that I don't think that's playing your role now. Yeah, exactly. I don't think you
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:43.800]   need to do that. I mean, we've done, we've done so many live events with so many people from
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:47.320]   all different backgrounds. You just want to give them a space where they're comfortable,
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:51.000]   where they look good and sound good. I mean, they just weren't, you know, the, the, the folks
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.120]   at NASA, they, I don't want to change any of the actors. They just better lighting, better sound,
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:59.400]   better, you know, like that, just to make them that they just didn't get the star treatment.
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:05.160]   I'll just, I'll just wind it up by saying it by my, my, I don't fear that kind of an approach.
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:09.240]   I fear that they're not going to hire someone. Do you like you to do it? I think it's, I think
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:14.200]   they're going to get like sitting Mardi Croft or someone who will turn and just like everything
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:20.040]   has to come our reality show at some point. Yeah. No, this isn't interesting enough. We've got to
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:24.280]   introduce some drama. How, how about we have the, we have that one engineer that people just don't
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:29.720]   kind of get rubs people the wrong way. When Alex, he turns around, make sure he says the B word.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:36.360]   Yeah. Yeah. That's walked away. So apparently it was, it was, by the way, it was Reddit that solved
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:43.080]   this, of course, but it's, it started because a NASA engineer said, they actually do use
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:49.800]   those stripes to see the angle the parachute is deployed at, whether it's twisted. But when NASA
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:55.320]   commentators said, sometimes we leave messages in our work for others to find. So when we invite
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:59.560]   you all to give it a shot and show you work, and of course somebody in Reddit wrote a Python,
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:07.880]   script to, to figure it all out. And it, so the technique, this is the description from the
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:13.000]   Guardian, binary numbers. Yeah. The zeros and ones have to be split into chunks of 10 characters
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:19.240]   from that adding 64 gives you the computer ASCII code. For example, seven white stripes,
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:25.320]   a red stripe, the two more white stripes represents, well, seven zeros, a one and then two zeros,
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:31.880]   which is binary for four, which adding 64 gives you 68, which is the ASCII code for the letter D,
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:37.400]   and the first letter in the message, which is, and I, I think this is another good thing. Thank you,
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:44.040]   Guardian for figuring this out. The origins of the phrase are from an 1899 speech by Teddy
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:51.480]   Roosevelt, in which he said far better it is to dare mighty things to win glorious triumphs,
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:56.440]   even though checkered by failure, than to take rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:30:02.520]   much nor suffer much because they live in the great twilight that knows not victory or defeat.
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:05.160]   That's so on brand for Teddy Roosevelt.
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:09.960]   So let's just charge over that hill.
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:12.360]   Yeah, I dare mighty things.
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:16.600]   But given that Reddit did this, the only, the only thing we're missing here for the next one is
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:23.000]   they just have to drop a banana from the, from the thing, they just drop a banana from the
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.360]   lander before it lands, just drop a banana down there and just have a little arrow that comes
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:33.400]   down and says banana for scale. So somebody asks on slash our NASA, does the parachute have some
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:43.160]   sort of hidden message? And then within three hours, R D W, R D T W T one says, had to realign
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:48.120]   the rings to start after the big block of ones, this Python code gives me this output dare mighty
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:53.000]   things. And then, but I can't figure out the outer ring. And then a couple of hours later,
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:31:01.480]   the outer ring, this is 10 dog is the, is the coordinates for the JPL in Southern California.
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:05.960]   And then somebody says, and what stocks should I invest in?
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:09.560]   Welcome to Reddit. Welcome to Reddit.
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:18.440]   And then somebody else says, well, shoot, CHUTE, that was quick. And somebody says, that went
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:25.560]   Rover well. It's Reddit. But that's the beauty. I think that's one of the things I love about Reddit,
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:30.600]   is it, you know, within three hours, somebody and Reddit Reddit Python script and figured it out.
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:34.600]   Hello fellow. One of my favorite subreddits on the entire thing is what is this thing,
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:38.760]   where someone will make this request like I've got, Hey, my, my, I found this thing,
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:43.800]   my, my, this was in a box that my grandfather left behind, we're cleaning out his house,
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:47.080]   and it seems to be made out of brass and it seems to have a chunk knocked out of this.
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:52.440]   And, and someone will say, Oh, well, it was, was your, was your, was your grandfather working in
[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:57.960]   the gas industry and Arkansas by any chance? It was very, very similar to like, we would pin
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:06.520]   spend that back. And I'm not even joking. It's like, it's so good. Yeah, that's what,
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.160]   that's what I do on Twitter. Like, if I see something I don't understand, I'm like,
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:11.800]   I just tweet out a picture, just go, what is this? Yeah. And then I go,
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:16.840]   Oh, that credit is Reddit is the ultimate crap in crowdsourcing, right?
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:20.200]   Yes. That's really that's what that's really what you're seeing.
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:28.120]   What is this thing has 1.8 million members? So I figure there's probably nothing they can't
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:35.080]   identify. All right, let's you guys, you did a good job of filling. Well done.
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:41.800]   We've amped. You've amped well. Now I'm reading what is this thing. And I probably should pay
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:49.000]   more attention to the show. Yeah. That's doing a show here. I need, I need a Reddit client that
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:54.760]   like has, it will only scroll up to like 100 things. I know the app. Let me do it again.
[01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:58.920]   But I have to like relaunch the app to do it because otherwise it's like, Oh, I did intend to
[01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:11.320]   sleep. I'll leave today. But okay. John Stewart picks CBS News veteran as showrunner for
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:17.320]   upcoming Apple TV. This is the, this is the scooter X news. Scooter X sits there in their
[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:25.880]   chatroom trying to find stories just to keep me from ending the show. Upcom, upcoming Apple TV
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:32.440]   series that John Stewart, former host of the Daily Show is doing. He has tapped Brenda
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:38.760]   Atikari, who was an investigative reporter for CBS Evening News where she won an Edward R.
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:48.200]   Murrow Award in 2020. Richard Pepler, of course, is involved. He's the HBO CEO who went AT&T and
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:57.480]   Stanky John Stanky came in, said I'm out of here and moved over to Apple TV plus. There will be a
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:05.560]   comedy because Stewart has also tapped some comedy writers for this show New York Art Affairs
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:11.800]   series on Apple TV plus. It was such a great filter for society. I agree. I agree. Although I
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:15.960]   watched John Oliver, I think John, John Oliver's kind of picked up the metal. They're all great,
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:19.320]   but the way he would take it, like he would have all the clips, he would have all the receipts and
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:23.480]   he would just say, excuse me. No, you said this, then this, and it would just, comedians are always
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:27.480]   the ones who hold us to account. That's just how our society is evolved. No, I agree. Comedy is
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:35.080]   often where the truth is told. Just a few days left, auction ends Thursday, if you want to get
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:44.600]   one of the original Apple retail signs, circa 1978. It was displayed by an authorized reseller
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:50.680]   who learned about Apple by attending a computer conference in 1976. Rainbow colors remain bright
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:56.200]   overall. Very good condition. Current bid, I guess minimum bid $12,000. There is no current bid
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:02.120]   on the Apple acrylic sign. Put a light behind that, put it in your studio. I think...
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:09.240]   On the blockchain, Leo, no one's going to buy it. If I could unlock my Bitcoin, maybe I'd buy it.
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:15.800]   We'd be doing the show from Hawaii. Yeah, we probably would be. We'll take a little break.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:21.640]   Then we will get your picks of the week. But first, a word from CashFly. Our show literally,
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:27.400]   quite literally brought to you by CashFly, the content delivery network. They've been around
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:38.760]   since 1999. We started using them, I don't know, 2009, 2010. CashFly, because they have servers,
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:42.680]   pops, they call them, points of presence all over the world, over 50 of them,
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:46.760]   brings our content closer to our listeners, no matter where they are in the world,
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:55.160]   so that they can download our shows faster. But CashFly also does video. In fact, they now offer
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:36:03.480]   something called ultra low latency streaming, less than one second of latency. This isn't web
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:11.800]   RTC. This is something unique to CashFly. An HTML5 player offers easy support anywhere with an
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:16.920]   SDK for even better mobile support, whether you need the player to run on websites, applications,
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:22.680]   mobile devices, or another platform, you could play anywhere. And of course, because CashFly is
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:30.280]   global, low latency, ultra low latency streaming, less than one second latency everywhere in the
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:35.800]   world, doesn't matter what continent. And it is infinitely scalable. CashFly's ultra low latency
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:43.240]   video platform can handle up to a million, not up to more than a million users concurrently,
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:51.000]   as well as in just thousands of synchronous streams. Their platforms designed for transmuxing
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:57.000]   thousands of streams simultaneously with live failover, whether it's RTMP, RTMPS, SRT,
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:04.120]   or more to deliver ultra low latency SLDP and HLS streams at the same time. It's a solution
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:09.480]   that can be customized to fit your unique needs, but all built on CashFly's reliable,
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:15.960]   robust, global network with ingest and delivery wherever you need it anywhere in the world. And
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:22.120]   of course, the best support these guys are great 24/7, 365 days a year, priority support. They're
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:27.080]   always there when you need them. And I could testify to that. We love CashFly. CashFly's
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:32.200]   infrastructure can support more than a million concurrent streams. Right now, it's the most
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:39.160]   reliable CDN in the world backed by a 100% SLA. They're also good people. They're partnering with
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:45.560]   World Central Kitchen to serve a 300,000 warm meals to people in need during the COVID crisis.
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:50.840]   They've donated over $50,000. CashFly's been around for a long time. They pioneered the first
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:56.920]   Anycast CDN infrastructure in 2002. Their best hop technology automatically finds the fastest
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:02.200]   route to and from customer origin across their global network of pops for maximum performance
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:07.480]   and reliability. And I could just say, we have never been let down by CashFly after more than a
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:12.840]   decade. It's just the best. Right now, CashFly is giving away a complimentary detailed analysis
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:17.800]   that can tell you bring them your CDN bill, your usage trends. They can tell you if you're
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:23.080]   overpaying as much as 20% or more for your CDN and they can show you what their brand new
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:33.160]   ultra low latency streaming can do. Twitch.cashfly.com. Twitch.cashfly.com. Thank you, CashFly,
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:41.560]   for providing the support we need to do the job we do. Speaking of NASA, Andy and Akko's
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:47.320]   pick of the week, actually, you have two of them. I'll defer, if it was true on time, I'll defer
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:52.680]   the one they had before. Since we're talking about NASA and all the great things they do to
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:58.840]   educate, they opened up this really great app that's both a desktop app and a web app called
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:05.240]   NASA eyes in conjunction with the Jet Propels Postion Laboratory. So if you go to eyes.nasa.gov,
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:12.760]   you will see a whole bunch of different software bars that will give you these beautiful 3D
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:20.360]   representations of live real time information and data. And so, for instance, you can have,
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:24.760]   while the while the orbiter while Perseverance was landing, you could see like an actual
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:30.920]   simulation of exactly what it was doing at any time with 3D models of Mars and everything that
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:39.880]   was surround Mars and the and the orbiter. There's also a an orary, which is just endlessly distracting
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:44.680]   and wonderfully distracting. It's just a model of the entire solar system that you can just navigate
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:51.400]   however well you want. It's a complete like game like 3D model of the thing. So you just simply zoom
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:56.120]   in, click and zoom on to whatever you want. If you zoom in on Mars or double click on Mars,
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:01.080]   it'll know that, okay, so now we're taking a look at Mars and it's not only okay, here's the
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:05.800]   mighty red planet, the closest to the Earth. It's just simply, oh, but here's here are the things
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:10.360]   that are currently orbiting Mars at the moment that we've put in there. Here's the location of
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:13.640]   the rovers that we've got down there. If you zoom out a little bit, you'll see
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:20.840]   comets, you'll see asteroids, you'll see other spacecraft we've got in the solar system. If you
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:26.040]   go to Earth, you'll see like primary like scientific spacecraft that is orbiting Earth or orbiting the
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:36.520]   Moon. You'll see the Solar Trust real Observatory. I'm sorry, he's getting with what the acronym is,
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:45.080]   but NASA has this really wonderful pair of solar observatories. One is the near one,
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:50.520]   one is the far one. So it's short for stereo. So it's always taking stereo images of the sun.
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:55.080]   There are all these spacecrafts that maybe you didn't know were actually out there until
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:58.840]   you actually look at the planet and say, oh, what's that thing? Okay, I know what the ISS is,
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:03.080]   but what is the stereo thing? And you double click on it, you'll be seen like, here's where
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:09.720]   stereo near is exactly. Here is, you'll see a 3D model of it, like actually in space. So if you
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:14.440]   want to rotate around it, you can see it from all angles and see what it looks like. It really is
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:20.440]   the most wonderful use of a second screen or a third screen hooked up your computer
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:25.640]   imaginable. You just maximize this window. And in real time, it'll just show you what's going on.
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:32.120]   It's just such a fun thing. It's exactly what an atlas is supposed to do, where you take something
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:37.400]   off the shelf, maybe to find out a fact, but you wind up leaving through it for half hour to an hour.
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:41.800]   This is the exact same thing. It's just so easy to go through. And they keep coming up with new
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:48.440]   products that are new packages that are based on this piece of software. Again, when you go to
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:55.400]   the top, eyes.nasa.gov, you'll see that they've kind of got like different volumes of information
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:42:00.280]   they've set up with this. But you start off with the solar system, you could get stuck there for a
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:04.840]   very, very long while it's getting. It's exactly what they're, it's exactly what I love about their
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:09.080]   mission to not only do science, but also to share that science with people who are not necessarily
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:17.160]   writing research papers. Beautiful, beautiful stuff. Neat. Nasa's eyes.nasa.gov. Renee Ritchie,
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:22.360]   pick of the week. I have two of them as well, but they're super short. So I'll give you both of
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:27.080]   them quickly. The first one is just a resource for anybody who does YouTube or YouTube videos.
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:32.360]   It's thumbs up.tv. You can go there, drop your image on. It'll show it to you in every single
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:38.600]   context that YouTube supports on the YouTube homepage, the sidebar, the suggested page,
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:43.960]   the just everything. And you can see what gets overlapped, what gets cut off, what gets truncated,
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:48.760]   so that you can make it look as nice as possible. So there's not overlapping any text or anything.
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:53.640]   I've found it to be invaluable just to make better, more presentable thumbnails.
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:58.360]   And the second one, I'll admit, is a little bit of payback for all my American friends who keep
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:04.040]   getting way better stuff than all of us international people do. And that is Disney Plus has rolled
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:08.760]   out Star, which is a new tab. And I believe it's only international. I don't believe it is actually
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:14.040]   in America yet, but it's basically all the Fox properties. And I'm really confused because I
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:18.760]   never know what is Fox Studios that airs on other networks, what is Fox Network that's made by other
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:24.360]   studios. But there is a remarkable amount of content in there, like all the die hard movies,
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:29.400]   of course, Deadpool, but just a ton of TV shows and procedurals, including The Killing,
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:34.680]   which is a remake, I think of a Danish show, but first two seasons of which are brilliant,
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:37.640]   there's a lot of really good show. Is it the British?
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:38.760]   Us?
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:39.560]   Snap Lindell.
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:41.080]   It's the American version.
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:41.720]   American version.
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:45.080]   So, yeah, so good though. Like some of those episodes were so
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:50.920]   thickly. And there's a bunch of shows like that. So, you may not see me for a few weeks as I descend
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:55.400]   into, that's been the thing for me. Disney Plus has been a remarkable vault of content,
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:44:00.600]   but I've seen some of those things a hundred times over the years. And it's all on franchise.
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:05.880]   It's all stuff that is Disney Star Wars or Marvel and just injecting the Fox catalog in there.
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:10.520]   Like, yes, there's Firefly and there's things that you'd expect to be on Fox, but there's a
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:15.560]   bunch of stuff I never expected to be in there. And I'm just thrilled that we,
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:19.560]   because we don't have Hulu, we don't have HBO Max, we don't have all these networks that you
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:23.800]   get to enjoy every day. So finally, getting a little bit of a content infusion has made us
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:24.680]   drunken giddy.
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:25.640]   Now you get star.
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:28.840]   Is it on the Disney Plus app?
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:32.200]   Is over the top or is it on cable? It's over the top.
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:35.880]   They're increasing. No, it's in the Disney Plus streaming service. They're increasing the price
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:40.440]   by $3, which I think we expected because they came in so low. But now you get this
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:47.160]   extra tab. So you have like Disney Marvel, Star Wars, National Geographic, and now Star on the far
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:51.240]   right. Oh, I see. So we get in the US too. You don't have to be in Canada to get this.
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:55.640]   Oh, you get in the US too? Damn it. I don't know. Do we? Oh, is it Canada only? I don't know.
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:59.320]   It's international because I know they're getting in other countries, but I'm not sure they have
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:04.440]   figured out all the rights. Ah, they can only do it, which is the bane of my video existence.
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:07.880]   The fact that they've all these companies were so hungry for money, they've split the
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:11.640]   rights to all these shows eight different ways from Sundays, and it becomes almost impossible to
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:18.280]   piece them together again in a way that's satisfactory for viewers. Alex Lindsey, pick of the week.
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:24.600]   So have you done much club housing? I have done way too much club housing.
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:30.440]   I don't like it. I don't like it that I do it, but I do it. Well, it's actually, there's
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:34.600]   some very good stuff on there. There's also some horrible stuff on there, like gross stuff.
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:42.360]   But yeah, yeah. So you get something for clubhouse? Well, I had this problem that I'm doing shows,
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:47.880]   and I want to make it sound good in clubhouse. So I want my mic, I want this mic to go into
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:52.280]   clubhouse. Oh, yeah, because most people just hold their phone up to their ear and talk in a clubhouse.
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:58.920]   And the results may vary. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So I was trying to figure it out, and I think that
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:07.240]   the best solution I found so far is this Dante adapter. Dante is a, I'll go like this. There we go.
[01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:12.200]   That's in focus. This is a little Dante adapter by Audinate, and what it is, is a Bluetooth to
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:18.280]   Dante. So Dante is the way we move audio around, and they have lots of little adapters, but this is
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:22.760]   how we move audio through networks. So if you want to have all your audio go from one thing to another,
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:27.320]   you can get it. So I just bought this, and what it does is it allows me to pair with my phone. So
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:34.280]   this just looks like a headset to my phone. And, but then I plug ethernet into a PoE, you know,
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:39.400]   just I just plug ethernet into my network. And now it can see my computers. It can see my, I,
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:46.120]   I, oh, my show is a Scorpio, which is on Dante as well. So it's a sound device, Scorpio, which has
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:52.280]   a Dante already built into it. So the foot, the computers, the whatever is there can all see that.
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:59.640]   So anything you want to put into clubhouse is something that if you have Dante, and so what you can do is,
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:03.560]   if you, for instance, if you're using your computer for this, you could have what's called Dante
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:09.080]   virtual sound card. It's like 30 bucks. That will, you put it on your any computer that you want to
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:13.160]   be available on the network, but you could also have, there's a lot of different things, but you
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:18.200]   could basically set up, basically connect this to anything that you want to connect to your phone.
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:22.840]   So I had a lot of other tools that I was using, you know, little headphone jacks and adapters and
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:27.240]   this little analog thing that I was using to, you know, to connect it and everything else.
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:32.760]   But this was by far the, the slickest one, because now all I do is I plug this into my network,
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:37.640]   and I open up my phone and say, make that my headphones. And then it's, and then from, from
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:45.800]   clubhouse's perspective, it's just now a headphone headset. Anyway, so, so it's a, it's a, if you're,
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:50.360]   if you're in the clubhouse and you're trying to perfect your sound, so you can use real mics,
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:56.760]   which is nice for all of us. So you're recommending the blue tooth, the blue tooth one or the one,
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:02.120]   well, you want the blue tooth one because it's only type C for the other ones. Yeah, there's no
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:07.000]   lei. Yeah, so, so the, I would recommend the blue tooth one is the easiest one to pair. You
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.080]   still then need to figure out, you know, you have to have something on the other side, but there's
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:15.080]   lots of different options there. But you need something on the other side to hook up to your mic,
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:18.920]   but if you're already doing it, have professional equipment, like a lot of us use Dante for
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:23.160]   everything else, what's great about this is you can just throw this into your network and it'll work,
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:28.680]   but you can again, have a computer that you put the virtual sound card on and these two will,
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:33.080]   you compare these two up so you can send your computer audio, for instance, out to, you know,
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:36.760]   out to the, out to the show. So for those of us who are trying to improve it, I'm,
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:41.480]   I'm getting ready to, we're probably just going to, we've been testing it a couple times here and
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:47.640]   there. So on Wednesday nights at seven, I'm doing just pure clubhouse. Oh, you know,
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:53.000]   just we're just doing clubhouse. And then it just, it's just office hours, but in clubhouse. And then
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:58.200]   in the next couple of weeks, we'll start doing just pumping office hours out to a clubhouse every
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:01.880]   morning when we, when we go live, it'll just be one of the outputs that we use. Oh, that's nice.
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:08.280]   We with this, it's two ways. So you could be in clubhouse and I could still bring you into
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:13.640]   office hours and zoom with the way my setup is, is kind of built. So you could kind of,
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:17.240]   people could fork into it if needed. So this basically,
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:24.120]   way audio makes your, it's ethernet audio and it makes your computer appear to be a
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:30.040]   headset to your iPhone using Bluetooth. Well, it makes your audio, whatever, whatever output
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:34.600]   comes out of your computer or anything that you have to have the Dante driver on your computer.
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:41.000]   That's an additional $30. Yeah. Yeah. So $324 for the Dante Bluetooth,
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:48.680]   a VIO adapter, and then another $30 for the software to go on your computer. And then you too can have a,
[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:54.040]   well, there's a whole lot of people that pass stream. There's a whole lot of,
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:59.720]   I've been, I've been super sizing social networks for a long time. Like this is my business.
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:05.960]   This is super sizing it. Like your peak Alex. It feels like it should not be that expensive.
[01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:10.200]   Because it's an Alex. It's a half. No, it's got some dedicated chips. I mean,
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:14.200]   so one of the reasons Dante works over networks is because of the chips inside to process it.
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:23.640]   And so it is not just, you know, it's, it's their business. You know, getting connected to it.
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:28.760]   There's no other cheap way to do this. Well, yeah. So it's the right, it's the right number, the
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:36.200]   the, yeah, it's the latency. What's the latency like? Is it pretty, pretty good? Zero. I mean,
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:40.440]   nearly zero. Yeah. I mean, it's not maybe zero, maybe six milliseconds or something, but essentially
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:44.760]   zero. And I don't even think it's that. I think it's more like less than one millisecond.
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:48.920]   I someone, someone listening is going to be like six. No way. It's probably less than one
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:56.600]   millisecond, you know, latency. So Dante has to be on your land, not on your land, because it's so
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:02.120]   sensitive to that. It's clocking everything. It's really, this is how we run massive events,
[01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:06.680]   you know, using this, this back end, you know, you can have hundreds of channels of Dante. So
[01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:11.320]   being able to just, this is like a simple, the simplest thing you could possibly do to get on.
[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:16.200]   But it is, for again, there's a handful of people that are listening to Mac break that just went,
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:20.520]   Oh, right. That would work really well. That would work really well to get my show into club
[01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:25.640]   house. Anyway, so that's, that's all. Yeah. Yeah. I wish it was a little expensive, because
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:30.280]   I would just like to use it. Then I could listen to clubhouse on something besides my phone speakers.
[01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:36.600]   Clubhouse does not seem to like this, but there's no way they could stop it because they just
[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:41.080]   think you're on AirPods. They don't know. Yeah, it just identifies itself. There's no, I don't,
[01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:44.440]   I don't think there's enough of us doing it yet. I mean, a lot of times they do this to try to keep
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:50.200]   everybody in the same. Everybody sounding the same, but you know, my goal, of course, is to have
[01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:55.480]   everybody have radio mics, right? And much is so weird. Like it doesn't even present for
[01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:59.560]   AirPlay. It is there, they're doing something to make all that stuff work that is
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:05.880]   not standard at all. Well, the cool thing is, is that with this, with this, I can actually,
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:12.760]   because it's looking at it as a headphone, I can route it through loopback. I can actually pass
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:17.400]   it to AirPlay. And I have listened to clubhouse just on my, on my Air, my HomePod. Then I'm
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:21.240]   cleaning the dishes listening to blue with the clubhouse, which is a lot better. You can't do
[01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:27.080]   that otherwise, can you? That's, I keep trying to cast it to my stuff. It doesn't present as an
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:32.760]   audio source. It's frustrating. It's frustrating. You have to listen on the phone. But now,
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:39.480]   thanks to Dante. Yeah. I probably thanks to Dante and I probably ruined it for everybody,
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:42.600]   because it'll, it'll now work for another week and then suddenly won't work anymore.
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:49.080]   So from a $350 solution for putting clubhouse on your professional microphones near clubhouse
[01:52:49.080 --> 01:53:03.000]   stream, I've got Flotato. Flotato is actually kind of a cool way to turn any website into a Mac app.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:12.120]   It's a FLOTATO.com. It's using WebKit, of course. So it's essentially using Safari,
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:16.280]   but it could be Twitter, it could be Gmail, it could be Instagram, it could be Netflix.
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:21.000]   It's not Electron. It's a little lighter weight than that because it's using WebKit.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:28.040]   But you can now use Flotato to turn, and there's a free trial version. I don't think it's very
[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:34.440]   expensive to buy. I can't remember. But you can use Flotato. And I'm going to basically make every
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:39.640]   webpage that I go to every single day, just make it a little Flotato. You could even put it in your
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:51.720]   dock, which is pretty cool. FLOTATO, it's $19, one time only, a little cheaper. But it's basically
[01:53:51.720 --> 01:54:02.200]   a potato with flow. That concludes this edition of Mac Break Weekly. I really want to buy this
[01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:08.280]   Dante thing, but it seems so expensive just for... And you know that in two weeks, Alex will have
[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:15.160]   a much slicker version available as a recommendation to you. See, that's the key. Just don't buy these
[01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:19.640]   things when you recommend them. Just hang out by the dumpsters behind this office a month later.
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:24.760]   Boom. Oh, that's just a list. You can get it for $2.59 on a B&H.
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:32.760]   Except it's a new item coming soon. I think I bought mine from Sweetwater.
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:37.640]   Should check it out. And it's the same one. It's the Audinate, right?
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:42.120]   It's the only one that makes it, I think. Audinate's Dante, AVIO.
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:46.600]   It's July, but we didn't need it to. Two by one Bluetooth I/O adapter for the Dante audio network
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:53.640]   puts any Bluetooth device onto the LAN. And it's a good easy way to bring callers into. I mean,
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:55:00.360]   if you're on the road, so it's not the only thing you can do is put it on... Anything you need to
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:05.960]   connect this to your computer or connect it to hardware, it's a super simple way to get the phone in.
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:11.800]   And everybody in the chat are saying, "Lio, don't get it. It's PoE. I have a PoE network. Sorry, guys."
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:15.640]   I can put it on my head. Who do they think they're talking to? Who do they think they're talking to?
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:23.800]   Yeah, but that is a point to make that it gets its power from the ethernet. So you have to have a PoE
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:28.520]   adapter to make that work. The injector is like... I mean, I have it on most of my routers have
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:36.200]   at least one. Yeah. I stupidly, when I set up my... You're recording network, bought a 48 port PoE
[01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:42.440]   switch. So I got room. I got room. I got room.
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:53.320]   Okay. Okay, kids. You did it. You stretched, you filled, you made it to the end of the show.
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:56:00.280]   Thank you so very much. Mel's House of Audio has one for $39.95, says Rickcon.
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:06.920]   Should I get it from Mel's House of Audio? Not Dante. Not to be confused with Mel's House of Pancakes,
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:10.600]   but you definitely don't want to get something from him. Rick, are you teasing me?
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:19.240]   That's Alex Lindsey. Now, we really should mention Office Hours, because if you enjoyed
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:27.400]   even a tenth of what Alex said today, you will love Office Hours. Best place to go is twitter.com/
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:34.680]   I'm sorry, youtube.com/AlexLindsay, and you can watch previous recorded portions of Office Hours,
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:40.520]   but there's also a link there to the Zoom meeting. So you can join that meeting.
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:44.760]   Starts, you know, at last time Alex was on, you said around 5 a.m. Pacific?
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:49.000]   Yeah, well, that's the pre-pre-show. It's kind of like the first breakfast.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.400]   It's the red carpet. If you want to join him on the red carpet.
[01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:55.480]   Yeah. Yeah, so it's all you got right Maxwell on. That's awesome.
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:58.120]   Yeah, no, Ray's great. He's there. I love Ray. Many days now.
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:02.600]   Good. Ray's there. And what happens is you just keep on adding some really,
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:07.480]   you know, just smart people. And when it comes to media or virtual production,
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:10.920]   there are very few questions you can ask on any given day where we don't come up with a reasonably
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:15.080]   good answer on it. And there's just not many places on the internet that you just do that and have
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:19.960]   people just give you the answer and talk through it a little bit and explain it in a way that we
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:24.600]   could be very hard to do on forums, you know. And so I learned something every day, you know,
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:27.880]   and I've been doing this for a long time, but I'm learning from everybody else. They're learning
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:34.600]   from me. They were, you know, it's a cross pollination at a pretty large level. So there's 300 or 400
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:39.720]   people there every day, minimum. Usually, I mean, over the course of the whole morning, there's
[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:46.520]   probably four to 600. Five AM till about what 10 AM Pacific? Yeah, I mean, really, the core of
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:51.480]   the show is from seven AM to nine, nine AM Pacific. That's when we really are doing the show. Everything
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:55.640]   else is us just, you know, hanging out as we get ready to do the show and then finish the show.
[01:57:55.640 --> 01:58:01.480]   We are starting resolve training from from Blackmagic. And she resolved. I'd like to do that.
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:06.440]   Yeah. So that starts on Saturday. So basically, we're putting out a coupon today for to buy the
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:09.480]   resolve training from Ripple Training, which is the best training out there right now.
[01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:18.200]   And it's for the new 17. And then we're going to Mark and Steve will be teaming up to basically
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:22.920]   spend an hour with our group every Saturday to answer questions. So the idea is you watch the
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:26.840]   video, you play with some of the ideas, and you come in the weekend and ask questions and you
[01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:31.800]   have the people actually built the training answer in the questions, which is pretty nifty. So,
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:40.120]   yeah, so that's a. So we're doing more and more of that right now. We're doing zoom OSC in training,
[01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:43.400]   you know, training in the same way. We're going to do it. Basically, there'll be something going on
[01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:47.320]   almost every Saturday where people are learning different pieces of software that we think are
[01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:56.600]   important to where media and virtual event professionals need to go. You know, so we're, you know, so
[01:58:56.600 --> 01:59:00.360]   we're resolved we're doing because we think that HDR and surround is going to be a big deal.
[01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:08.520]   YouTube.com/AlexLindsayly. And DSAY for more information and to watch previous videos,
[01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:13.720]   previous days. By the way, that that the still on my YouTube page, I just realized what it was.
[01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:18.680]   Like I put it up a long time ago. That was actually one of the events we were doing with NASA.
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:21.960]   Oh, nice. That's a NASA event right there.
[01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:27.160]   Yeah, we were building a conference. We were in a Google conference room, I think, in in LA.
[01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:33.000]   Lovely. So lovely. Thank you, Alex. Andy Inaco, you're going to be on GBH on Friday.
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:39.320]   Actually, I'm a day early this week, Thursday at 1230 for about a half hour. As usual, go to
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:46.680]   WGBHNews.org to stream it either live or later. Nice. And of course, I have no idea how to spell
[01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:55.560]   his name. That's how you remember it. I H N A T K O dot com. And Mr. Renee Richie, YouTube.com/Renee
[01:59:55.560 --> 02:00:00.760]   Richie. It's YouTube stars all the way down. Anything coming up soon?
[02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:07.640]   I'm continuing this week yelling at the clouds. I did a rant about Facebook and their approach
[02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:13.320]   to privacy. And then yesterday about Intel super dodgy slides about the M one where they kept
[02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:19.800]   switching the models they were testing. Oh, Intel got served for that NASA event.
[02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:24.600]   Because they put out the tweet. I'm actually meant to mention this on the show. They put out
[02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:29.800]   the tweet that said, well, you can get it. If you if you want to really if you want to launch
[02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:37.320]   rockets or play rocket league, you need you need a PC with Intel chip. Obviously taking a pot shot
[02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:43.960]   at M one Macintosh is except I did notice on that NASA feed quite a few Macintosh computers, including
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:49.080]   one of the big displays. One of the big displays looked like it was Windows. The other big display
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:53.480]   was definitely a Macintosh. So maybe they're just small part of the market. It seems like
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:59.000]   totally not worth their time. It's not like you can buy it. It's a weird allocation of resources.
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:04.440]   Yeah. And you know, but it's true. If you want to play rocket league, you need a PC.
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:11.320]   That one, I'll grant them. They are one of the sponsors of I think a rocket big rocket league
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:15.480]   event. That's probably why Rocket League got the mention. But I did notice that at NASA,
[02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:21.640]   they use a few Macs. They still use Macs to all. I'm yelling at clouds all week. That's my new
[02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:27.560]   yellow clouds. YouTube.com/renayrichy also, of course, Apple talk to show you do with
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:33.080]   Georgia Dow. Thank you all three of you for being here. We really appreciate it. We do this show
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:40.360]   every Tuesday 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time 1800 UTC. You're more than welcome to watch us do
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:46.200]   it live. All you have to do is go to twit.tv/live. There's live audio and video streams there. They
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:51.480]   look just like that. You can also chat with us while we're doing the live show. Our chatroom is
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:02:00.200]   irc.twit.tv. You can use a browser like that, but it's usually better if you get an IRC client.
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:03.960]   You'll have a lot more fun. So if you're going to come back more than once, get yourself an IRC.
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:08.760]   On-demand versions, the show, of course, are always available at the website, twit.tv.
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:18.440]   All our shows are there. In this case, it's twit.tv/mvw. We also have shows. There's a whole
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:25.880]   dedicated channel on YouTube, youtube.com/macbreakweekly. And you can actually, the easiest thing to
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:30.200]   probably get a podcast application and put it on your phone or your device or your
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:35.880]   computer and a download Macbreak Weekly. Once you subscribe, you'll get it automatically.
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:42.360]   The minute it's available, so you never have to think twice about that. If you are a asynchronous
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:48.120]   listener, you don't chat with us because you're not listening live, there is a really great twit
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:54.120]   community at www.twit.tv.com. Community are forums. Lots of great talk. Every show gets posted there,
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:03:00.520]   so you can leave your comments there. And there's also a, and my lower third now has it,
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:07.560]   Mastodon Instance, just for twit listeners, twit.social. Both of those, you have to be approved,
[02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:12.520]   but you'll be approved quickly. I check pretty much every day. Just leave me a little message
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:17.000]   about why you would like to be part of our community. I do that to keep spammers out.
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:25.240]   Because spammers are so funny. They'll say, "I want to join to share wisdom about our fine product."
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:31.320]   It's like, "I think you might be a spammer." So we just, you know,
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:34.840]   "Have you gotten the clubhouse spam yet?" No, what's the clubhouse spam?
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:39.240]   So they put up their hand, they come in to ask a question, but they go, "I offer services and
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:43.240]   solutions for venture capitalists who are looking to take advantage of crypto marketing." My question
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:50.920]   is, click. It's just a matter of time before clubhouse becomes as spammy as anywhere else.
[02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:52.440]   That's pool, like everything else. Yeah.
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:04:00.520]   Mel's house and body. Oh, you can't join. No, sorry. Thanks for joining us. We'll see you next time
[02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:07.000]   on Mac Break Weekly. Bye-bye. We do appreciate you watching this show right here on the Twit Network.
