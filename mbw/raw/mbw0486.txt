[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.200]   We're going to talk about, of course, the 60 minutes, you know, segment on Apple.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.600]   We'll dissect it. We'll, we'll zapruter it. We'll figure out everything that it means and doesn't mean.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.200]   Plus, we'll end a lot of rumors from other sources and maybe start some new ones.

[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   For December 22nd, hello everybody. Alex Lindsay in studio.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200]   Hello. Nice to see you.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.200]   Once again. Mr. Renee Ritchie from Christmas, Christmas year, Morale.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   Leo, it's going to be 16 degrees on Thursday.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   I saw that.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.200]   Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200]   16 Celsius.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.200]   Like 30, I don't know what it is.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.200]   No, it's like in the 50s or something. That's ridiculous.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.200]   We're melting. All of Canada's melting sent help.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   I was all worried because we're, and Andy Enoco's also here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   On Saturday, we're going to New Jersey to get on a boat.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   And it's warmer there. It's 57 degrees in New Jersey right now.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.200]   For the moment. But what are you doing getting on a boat in the middle of the winter?
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   No, I think it's going to be warmer there than Orlando.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   It's a weird heat snap. Are you, you're, you're also a little warm, aren't you, Andy?
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   Yep. 54 degrees. I went for my morning constitutional, leaving the house in just like one layer of like a thin t-shirt.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.200]   And I came back and I was just like wet with sweat. It wasn't, it's like, as, as I'm like showering and stuff,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.200]   I'm thinking, well, I'm glad that I could have comfortable constitutionals,
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   but I can't help but be concerned that it's in the mid 50s, three days before Christmas.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:07.200]   Like, as I say, I feel as though not our children, but our children's children are again going to have an interesting reality that.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   Deny this lawmakers.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   I would say buy a house away from the coast is what I would say right now.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   And get some nice speech on property and a few generations.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.200]   Yeah, if you talk filing gasoline, cause bandages.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.200]   You tie it. Well, you know, I am, I'm working to get off the grid. We've got solar now.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   Completely are you are you self-sufficient? Not yet because we're waiting for the Elon Musk super battery.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.200]   But I'm on the waiting list. Then, then we'll be off the grid and then, well, not 100% would be off the grid only if the grid does.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.200]   Like the new Apple headquarters. Yeah. Okay. Let's talk about that. 60 minutes. I didn't see it.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.200]   Oh, I'm good. I'm so mad because I was watching Sunday night football and they thought, oh, wait a minute.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.200]   I got to watch 60 minutes and I tuned in right as it tuned in Charlie Rose asked Johnny Ivan.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.200]   Where is your office going to be? On the top floor scene. It's over.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.200]   It's the only thing I learned. Nobody has a corner office.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   Yeah, because there are no corners. So you guys, it's up to you to fill me in. What did I miss?
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   I missed. I know one thing. Tim Cook. Did he actually get peeved by Charlie Rose pushing on the overseas tax issue?
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:24.200]   He got animated. I don't know if he was peeved. I think he was animated. Well, it was the Tim Cook you heard when, like I said,
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   why do you waste all this money on environmentalism and accessibility? And then Tim Cook told him to get the hell out of the stock.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.200]   It was a similar thing. What this tax money in Tim was like, we've already paid taxes on every dollar we earned in those countries.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.200]   We pay more again in the US with the biggest taxpayer in the world.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   He does say it's awful for America. What he doesn't say is it's great for Apple.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.200]   Because let's not, I mean, look, they're not breaking a law. We've talked about this before. They're not breaking a law,
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.200]   but they're taking advantage of a loophole that allows them to offshore significant amounts of money.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.200]   And the way they do it is you open a, and Google does this too. A lot of companies do this. I want to do it. I'm about to do it.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:06.200]   Although it's less favorable than it used to be, but you open a division in Ireland, which has zero, had zero corporate tax.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.200]   I think they're changing that. They didn't have zero corporate tax. They had, I believe it was 12 percent or the 12 percent on,
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   and then now they're dropping it to six, I believe, or 12 and a half.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   So the drop to six point, yeah, they're dropping it.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   It's 12 and a half. Moving some of the loopholes and moving it to 6.25, not that I've had to research this.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:34.200]   So what they do then, what Apple did, and Google does in others, is they license key technologies to the Irish division,
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.200]   and then they pay license fees, which is a way to offshore profits.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.200]   And then, and there's a Dutch turnaround somewhere in there.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:51.200]   Dutch Irish sandwich. To get to zero, I think that what they do is they do something, yeah, there's another piece of that to get to zero,
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.200]   so they're not paying the 6 point, then the 12.5 percent.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.200]   And what Ireland's trying to do is go to 6.25 percent, but then remove some of those loopholes, so they actually, which would be good for Ireland.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   In any event, it is completely legal, and if it were me and I were making all that money, I guess I would consider doing this.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   But I also think, and you know, it, Cook was called before a congressional committee a few years ago to testify about this.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:22.200]   But they didn't change the tax law. They didn't eliminate the loophole, they just investigated it.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   Because I'm sure, well, and let's also say that I'm sure Apple and others are lobbying.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   They're spending as much money as they can on Congress members so that this law stays this way.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:42.200]   It's interesting because a lot of the stuff that we've seen is just business, international law does not keep up very quickly with things like technology and things like the Internet,
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   which basically destroy the idea of borders and who do you owe money to?
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.200]   If Apple is selling something in Germany and they're paying taxes in Germany, they have to pay taxes on the same money in the US.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:59.200]   Can a German company then ask US companies who are doing business in Germany to pay taxes on all their, everyone is going to want everything at a certain point?
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.200]   At a logical conclusion, everyone that has any bit of data going through them might have some claim on money from that data.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.200]   And I think just we have to come up with the system and you see this with everything, with shipping, with purchasing,
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.200]   with how companies do all their business that we don't have a good system for handling anything internationally,
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.200]   financing rights, anything.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.200]   Well, and our tax rate is very high.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.200]   I mean, I think that corporate tax rate in the United States doesn't matter.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   That's the rate. I pay it. You pay it. I don't think you're offshoring your...
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.200]   No, I'm not.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.200]   Doesn't matter. That's the rate.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   And you could say, yes, if it's legitimate income, overseas income, but if a company is intentionally doing this,
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.200]   creating an Irish division, transferring licenses over the internet...
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.200]   We should look. I don't think that they're actually...
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.200]   That's a conscious effort to defer taxes. Not illegal.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:54.200]   But the question is, and I don't actually know the answer, is how much of the money that Apple keeps offshore is US generated
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   or and how much of it is formed because two thirds of their business is formed.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:06.200]   So I think that actually... And I don't know this for sure, but I think that actually what's happening is that Apple's just saying,
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:11.200]   "We're not going to take any of the money that we make overseas. We're not going to bring it back to the US."
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.200]   I don't think that there are some companies that are offshoring that money, but I don't think that Apple's offshoring it,
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   and I don't know that for certain.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.200]   But I think that they are simply...
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.200]   Google for sure is doing it.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.200]   I'm not a member of the companies are doing it, but I think that what Apple's doing specifically is saying,
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.200]   "The money that we earn overseas, we're not bringing into the United States. The money we make in the United States, we need."
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.200]   They need actually more money than the United States.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.200]   They want to bring it back.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   And they would bring it back.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.200]   No, I understand now they can't bring it back because they'd be double-text.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.200]   Is it 40%? Leo, is that what we need?
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   It's 40% although there was briefly an amnesty. I don't know if that amnesty's continued, but there was...
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.200]   Or at least propose. I know Obama's one who hasn't amnesty.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:09:00.200]   You can't... You also have to blame Congress and maybe a lot because they created this situation.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:06.200]   But every single one of these companies that's benefiting has lobbied heavily to keep this loophole.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.200]   I mean, this is...
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   I would too. It's your billion talking about billion dollars in taxes. A lot of money.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.200]   Well, in the bottom line is that you're in a situation where the Democrats want to give an amnesty
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   and the Republicans want to make it permanent.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:23.200]   And so that's why it's not getting... Not moving forward.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   So the point is that some of its money earned off-shore.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.200]   Some of its sales are maxed on that.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.200]   I believe with Apple it's all of the money that's overseas.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.200]   Okay, and then that's not a big deal.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.200]   Yeah, I believe that some companies do this licensed thing.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   And you're saying Apple does not do this.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.200]   I don't believe they do because I think that they're selling...
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.200]   And there's nothing...
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.200]   I don't think enough overseas that it's something...
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.200]   Two-thirds of their profits are overseas.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.200]   If that's the case, then there isn't an issue.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.200]   They're just saying they won't bring it back into the US.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.200]   I mean, people still say, "Well, you're a US company and you should be paying taxes."
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.200]   No, I don't disagree with that. I don't think you want to be double taxed.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   If you're getting taxed in China for Chinese sales, whatever that tax rate is, that's what you're paying.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.200]   Now, you can't repatriate that money. That's why they're not repatriating.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.200]   That's why they take loans out to do buybacks.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.200]   So the crazy thing that Apple's doing is they're paying interest to banks so that they can...
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.200]   So that they can pay down.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.200]   And they have debt that they would...
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.200]   I'm sure they'd be happy to pay off at a lower percentage than what they're paying right now.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.200]   Cook says the tax code was made for the industrial age, not the digital age.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   In other words, we're in the international...
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.200]   We're in a global market right now.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.200]   And so the tax code needs to reflect that, although I kind of think it does.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.200]   Again, here's the clip if you want to see it.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.200]   This is from CNN Money.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:52.200]   How do you feel when you go before Congress and they say, "You're a tax-avoider"?
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:57.200]   What I told them and what I'll tell you and the folks watching tonight is,
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.200]   "We pay more taxes in this country than anyone."
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.200]   Well, they know that and you should because of how much money you make.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.200]   Well, I don't deny that. We happily pay it.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.200]   But you also have more money overseas, probably, than any other American company.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   Because, as I said before, two-thirds of our businesses over there.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.200]   But why don't you bring that home?
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   I'd love to bring it home.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.200]   Why don't you?
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.200]   Because it would cost me 40% to bring it home.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.200]   And I don't think that's a reasonable thing to do.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.200]   This is a tax code, Charlie, that was made for the industrial age.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.200]   I don't think Tim's explaining it well.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.200]   It's backwards. It's awful for America.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.200]   It should have been fixed many years ago.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   It's past time to get it done.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   But here's what they concluded.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:43.200]   Apple is engaged in a sophisticated scheme to pay little or no corporate taxes
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.200]   on 74 billion in revenues held overseas.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.200]   That is total political crap.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.200]   There's no truth behind it.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.200]   Apple pays every tax dollar we owe.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   And here's the thing.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   That's the debate, is whether it's a tax avoidance scheme or...
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.200]   Let's make sure we're clear that many people use H&R blog
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.200]   because their job is to make sure that the individual pays not many more than I have to.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.200]   I pay every penny that I do in the government.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.200]   And if you show me a model that has me legally not pay another two pennies,
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.200]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.200]   And almost every American would be the same way.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:25.200]   So the whole thing is that the issue is that we act like Apple's doing something
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.200]   that we wouldn't do if we weren't...
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.200]   If we were in the same position, of course, we would just repatriate it.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.200]   No American would say, "Oh, I'm going to just repatriate and give up 40% of it."
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.200]   They'd be like, "I'm going to keep it over a season."
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.200]   Take a lot of vacations.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.200]   The only thing I would have a problem with is if...
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.200]   And I know some companies do this and this is what I'm trying to find out.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.200]   I'm doing a search as fast as I can.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:48.200]   Whether Apple does this, which is this whole kind of run around to avoid taxes
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.200]   by creating an offshore division, transferring licenses to that offshore division,
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.200]   and then paying out money to those.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.200]   And I don't think they do that.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.200]   And specifically, I think one of the problems for them is that they're a hardware company.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.200]   I mean, a lot of the companies that do that are intellectual...
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.200]   They can do that.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.200]   Totally.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.200]   I don't think Apple can do that as easily.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.200]   So I think that's not the case.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.200]   But I am not over here.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.200]   But if it's merely money that they've earned in sales overseas,
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.200]   I don't have a problem with that at all.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.200]   And I believe that that's the issue.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.200]   Bik Microsoft has $108 billion offshore.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.200]   IBM's $61 billion offshore.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.200]   Cisco, $53 billion.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.200]   Google, $47 billion.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.200]   HP, $43 billion.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.200]   Oracle, $38 billion.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.200]   Intel, $23 billion.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:33.200]   $43 billion.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.200]   This is a wide practice.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.200]   And again, I don't think there's anything wrong with it.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:45.200]   If the money is earned offshore, the issue is if there's some sort of legal scheme to do that.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.200]   All right.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.200]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.200]   And then we'll talk about it.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.200]   I think his tone of voice during that interview sort of says it all.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   He was very, very patient and very, very explanatory when they're talking about him.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.200]   And how they do that sort of business.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:05.200]   And he didn't start getting not loud but forceful when the conversation shifted from,
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.200]   "Isn't it?
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:11.200]   Does it look a little bit weird that Apple is not paying as much taxes they're making internationally?"
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:16.200]   It's only when they talk about, "Well, are they trying to avoid an in a tax avoidance scheme?
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.200]   Are they trying to get away with something when he just makes the...
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:25.200]   It's just like you alluded to a moment ago that if you have the ability to hire an accountant
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.200]   for your taxes, you will pay a lot less than taxes because he or she knows that a lot of
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.200]   the stuff that you buy, you can actually write off, that there's a lot of ways to if you
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.200]   inherit $15,000 or $20,000, there's things you can do with that money so that you don't have
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.200]   to pay $22,000 in income.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.200]   And there are people who can't afford attorneys or they don't have the expertise and they
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:51.200]   have to use the short form, in which case it probably is going to kind of hit them in the
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:57.200]   market.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.200]   And so, I think that's a good thing.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.200]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.200]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.200]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.200]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.200]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   Are they doing the double Irish with a Dutch sandwich or is this just tax that is...
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.200]   Show title?
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.200]   No, that's actually the name of it.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.200]   It's a tax avoidance technique employed by certain large corporations involving the use
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   of a combination of Irish and Dutch subsidiary companies to shift profits to low or no tax
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.200]   jurisdictions.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:39.200]   The double Irish with a Dutch sandwich involves sending profits first through one Irish company,
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:44.200]   then to a second Irish company headquartered in a tax haven.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.200]   It's also the name of something that's totally legal in Nevada.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.200]   It sounds delicious.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.200]   It might even be a bigger problem for the EU because if they have favorable tax rates,
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   there's probably money from the EU that's going to Ireland.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.200]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.200]   Actually, that's another good point.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.200]   It's a mess.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.200]   The tax code is a mess.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.200]   That's why you have to hire yourself.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.200]   Compute for our taxes.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:07.200]   I don't know what we spend every year with a CPA firm.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.200]   We have bookkeeping all year long.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.200]   We have CPA firm.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:15.200]   We probably spend $5,000, $10,000 a year just to do the taxes, maybe more.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.200]   At least.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   More than 40% of Twiks revenue goes to IRS and state.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.200]   But that's the price of living in a great country.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.200]   I'm sorry, that's fine.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.200]   Your tax rate is even higher, Renee, I'm sure.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   Yeah, I think it's pretty much just half of everything.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:40.200]   But it's like 30% to 50% income tax and then 15.5% sales tax and 10% luxury tax.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.200]   Exactly.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.200]   Anything else?
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.200]   So, we saw Johnny Ives design.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.200]   That was so cool.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.200]   They showed like the 10 different iPhones that they, the different size ones that they were,
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.200]   they were prototyping before they did the iPhone 6 and 6+.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   And he spoke about why they chose the 4.7 and the 5.5 and they showed his sketchbook and he had this pen and paper sketchbook where he drawn the Apple Watch and then the CNC machine that was sold.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.200]   And the CNC machine that was carving out of aluminum after they put it on AutoCAD.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   Did you notice he was using one of those pens?
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.200]   The pen that Johnny Ives was using was one of those ones that records everything that you write.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.200]   Oh, wait.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.200]   Digital Lizzie.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.200]   Interesting.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.200]   I have one of those.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.200]   You're such a gimmick.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   He just was using them.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.200]   I mean, that's what I'm sure.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.200]   Yeah, they're the 10 phones.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.200]   That's kind of cool.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.200]   And they have the CNC email that I want.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.200]   Look at all the tables are covered with.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   Over with.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.200]   That's the 2016 products.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.200]   Oh, man.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.200]   Wouldn't you like to just peek on it?
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:49.200]   And they showed, I forget his first name Townsend was showing the camera, the optical image stabilizing camera from the iPhone 6s plus and all the different components that go into it, including the tiny one quarter hair with wires that suspend the entire assembly for the stabilization.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.200]   Did they leak a new MacBook?
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.200]   Oh, that's not the article.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.200]   That was the dumbest story on the Internet yesterday.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:02.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:28.200]   I'm not going to say that.

[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.200]   I'm not going to say that.

[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.200]   I'm not going to say that.

[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.200]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:37.200]   I'm not going to say that over Bluetooth or.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.200]   This is a remarkable camera phone picture.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.200]   I can't believe the detail.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.200]   Well, that's also a remarkable squirrel.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.200]   Yes.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.200]   Yes.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.200]   Well, again, they know they know the deal, though.
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:48.200]   They can say can have about as much as they run away.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:52.200]   But that's another part of the way I try not to do.
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:56.600]   I try to make it very clear, like, on that picture, I know I came to the park at the
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.200]   right time of day when the sun is low.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:02.200]   I had made sure that the sun was facing Mr. Squirrel there or Mr. Squirrel.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.200]   Right.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:06.600]   You've got some nuts, but I don't think it's I think there's.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:07.800]   Oh, no, maybe those are just seeds.
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:09.800]   She does.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.320]   That seems impossible.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.600]   But that's a very important point.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.200]   But yet, Andy, that's true of any camera.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:20.480]   Knowing the time of day, picking the right time, all of that is true on any camera.
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:26.280]   So it, you know, that's not really anything bad about a smartphone camera is it.
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:27.280]   You just have to know your camera.
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.280]   You have to know your your tools.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.360]   I think that's what's rolling shut.
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:32.760]   I guess I gotta say, sometimes a rolling shutter is a great thing.
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:33.760]   That's a great effect.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:35.760]   That's a great effect.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.880]   You wouldn't have got that on the on the Olympus.
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:42.400]   And I do think I wouldn't be surprised if we, you know, end up with all these cameras
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:46.160]   having global shutter at some point, you know, just because it's good.
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.120]   It's a good marketing thing.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:49.120]   Nice.
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.120]   Very nice.
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.120]   All right.
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:52.120]   Let's take a break.
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.920]   I'm enjoying your pictures though.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.840]   As always, Andy, really fun.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.120]   If you don't follow Andy on Flickr, you should.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:02.160]   Andy I is his handle.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.680]   Flickr dot com slash Andy.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.320]   That's how long I've been a member of Flickr.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:07.960]   My handle is a last name and a last initial.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:08.960]   Really?
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.080]   You don't do that anymore?
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:15.440]   No, because now it's I feel there.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.440]   It's more.
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:21.440]   I can't always get Andy I and I like to have like this for for for accounts that people
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:24.200]   want to be able to find me at it has to be consistent.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:31.320]   And also it would kill me if like I I'm late in getting account on the next Facebook and
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:35.000]   someone else is a not go on that thing that would that would break.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.840]   So you're an not go almost everywhere else.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.680]   I'm an not go every place there.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:40.960]   I want public the public to find my stuff.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.640]   Yeah, the name that no one can spell.
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:48.840]   But it's easy if you just know that the mnemonic is I have no idea how to spell a not go.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.400]   I H N A T K O.
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:54.280]   I do that by the way every time I type your name.
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:58.000]   I believe it's still actually in the spell checker for Mac OS.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   Oh, nice.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:06.040]   If you capitalize I and if you spell it correctly, I think it was I haven't checked it in a while.
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:08.760]   But for a long time, that was definitely true.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.880]   I showed a brought to you by fresh books.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:15.120]   If you are a freelancer, you have to do invoices at the end of the month.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   You know, that's the worst.
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:21.360]   It's just a pain rummaging through the receipts to keep track of your expenses and then fire
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:24.160]   up word and excel and kind of.
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:27.520]   Oh, yeah, yeah, I just hate doing all of that.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:31.400]   And I hated it for years until Amber MacArthur told me, hey, there's a company in Toronto.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:32.400]   This is 2004.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.400]   It's doing this new thing.
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.440]   Very web 2.0, she said at the time.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:39.200]   Now I guess it's whatever it is, web 5.0.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:44.040]   It's fresh books.com and man, it was a lifesaver.
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:47.200]   Here I am just easily making invoices.
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.000]   I was billing Canada.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.720]   So I had to have it in Canadian currency.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:51.720]   No problem.
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:52.720]   They do the conversion automatically.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.160]   It's even easier now.
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:58.080]   You can use the fresh books app to take pictures of receipts, automatically get them into your
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:53:59.080]   invoice.
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:04.680]   If you bill for time and hours, easy, easy, easy, the app will automatically, you know,
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:08.480]   start and stop and then put it in the invoice.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:12.240]   And fresh books does some of the things that are also kind of that you don't want to do.
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.880]   For instance, automatic reminders to customers who don't pay you on time.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:19.520]   Although I have to say you get paid faster with fresh books.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:25.080]   I think part of it is because you can send it as an email which has a pay me button on
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.240]   it.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.480]   And clients don't mind.
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:31.840]   In fact, they prefer it, I believe, because frankly, they hate the whole process of paying
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:36.280]   the bills as much as you hate of printing the bills and sending the bills.
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.960]   So when they just have a button that says, hey, pay this invoice, they'll do it fast
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:40.960]   and easy.
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:45.120]   Now, fresh books has a new request ability to request a deposit ahead of time in fresh
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:46.120]   books.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.760]   So you get paid up front.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:48.760]   Let's love doing this too.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:52.280]   No more covering costs out of pocket or waiting until the end of a project to get paid.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:54.240]   Fresh books handles the whole thing.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.640]   Does the middleman thing beautifully?
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:57.640]   You can track time.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:00.560]   You can organize expenses.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:04.760]   Their automated customer reviews report lets you see your reviews in one place.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:05.920]   Easy to post them on your website.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:10.200]   They're just adding a lot of nice features that make it your freelancer life a lot easier.
[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:11.760]   They just added a new card reader.
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.000]   It's EMV enabled.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.760]   That means it's chip card enabled.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:22.480]   So you can swipe or if you could dip the chip or swipe the stripe, baby, the new fresh books
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:27.600]   app will automatically, what you do is you show, this is so cool on an iPad.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.800]   You show the customer the invoice.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:34.440]   If you're a contractor or a inspector, if you come to the person's house, you show them
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.440]   the invoice.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:36.680]   They say, fine, here's my credit card.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:39.440]   You swipe it and you're done.
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:41.760]   You're paid right there.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:45.960]   I'm telling you, start it right now, 30 days free and you'll wonder why you never did it
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:46.960]   before.
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:47.960]   It's changed my life.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.960]   Could change yours too.

[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:57.560]   And if they ask you, I think they do in the form, where'd you hear about it?
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:01.680]   Do me a favor and say Mac break weekly.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:02.880]   That way everybody's happy.

[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:10.760]   We thank them so much for supporting our little podcast.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:11.840]   I'm fully chipped now.
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:13.400]   My last card got replaced.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.400]   That took them a while.
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:18.040]   It was the law when it affected the October and November.
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:21.320]   Actually, that law, I thought it was a law.
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:23.920]   But I think it was just that the credit card companies insisted on it.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:28.360]   The law said that whoever is the least secure is liable.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.360]   Right.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.160]   Basically the credit card companies, I think, either they-
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:32.160]   They pushed the law.
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:36.600]   Well, they basically said if any vendor now that doesn't handle the chip-
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:37.600]   It's not our fault.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:39.600]   If they get, yeah, you're going to be on the hook, so-
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.600]   Stung-dung-d.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:41.600]   Stung-dung-dung-dung-d.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:45.160]   A stimulus investment.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:46.160]   You wrote a good column.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:50.960]   I think Renee wrote this on the Apple executive titles.
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:51.960]   Yes.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:55.680]   Can you explain to me these new titles?
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.640]   There's really two separate things here.
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:02.440]   One is that titles were made public that had been internal to Apple for a while.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:03.640]   The positions really.
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:08.280]   So Tim Cook was chief operating officer and he became CEO and Jeff Williams, who'd been
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:11.120]   vice president of operations, became senior vice president.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:14.160]   And Tim Cook is an operations guy, one of the best operations guys in the world.
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:16.680]   So it was sort of like, do you need a chief operating officer?
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:20.640]   But I think for a company of Apple size and value and importance and for shareholders,
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.640]   you need a chief operating officer.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:23.960]   What does Tim has other things to do now than-
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:24.960]   Yes.
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:27.480]   Call Shenzhen and say, "Where the hell are those watches?"
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.000]   Although, yeah, do that for the pencil.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   I wish he would do it.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.400]   Where the hell are these pencils?
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:35.760]   So he's been acting as chief operating officer for a while and that's been recognized.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:40.720]   And Johnny Saruji, who leads platform technologies, there's a little bit of misunderstanding because
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:43.280]   Bob Mansfield used to just do everything at Apple.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:47.520]   And then when he left, Dan Ricchio took over the hardware engineering, but all the architecture
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:52.800]   stuff, the chipsets, the touch ID, the sensors, the screens, all of the core technologies went
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:56.480]   to Johnny Saruji, who comes from Israelis and Arab-Israeli.
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:00.720]   He came to Apple and I think he was, he became first known for the A4 processor and he's been
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.160]   leading all their Silicon levels.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:06.320]   And arguably, Apple came out of nowhere and became the most interesting Silicon design
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.840]   company in the world right now.
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:09.480]   And I don't think anybody expected that.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:12.080]   And it's largely due to Johnny Saruji and his team.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:13.080]   Just amazing work.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:18.400]   So again, he's effectively been a senior vice president for a while, but now it's all public
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.400]   and official.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.560]   The real story is, and I know what you're about to say.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:23.560]   Yeah, they really-
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.760]   They finally have somebody in charge of the store.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:31.120]   Well, yeah, so previously the App Store, it was basically separated.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:36.960]   The actual servers and the store and the software that ran it, as well as the store management,
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:41.680]   the business development, the editorial side, all of that was under Eddy Q because it all
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:42.680]   spun out of iTunes.
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:46.280]   It uses the exact same backend and process that iTunes did.
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:50.800]   But Phil Schiller historically has had developer relations and evangelism and app review under
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:52.000]   his purview.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.920]   So it was sort of- the App Store existed in these two different organizations and sometimes
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:59.320]   the interests were really well aligned and sometimes they weren't.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:03.120]   Sometimes maybe Eddy Q's organization wanted to sell more apps and Eddy's wanted to maintain
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:08.400]   the user experience or the design on how they wanted software to work.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.640]   And it wasn't always in parallel.
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:14.160]   So now Phil Schiller officially gets that title because he's a senior vice president at Apple
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:16.060]   and he already has a ton on his plate.
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:19.720]   Some of the other vice presidents in marketing are taking on greater responsibility so that
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:23.720]   he can focus on the stuff that's really core to what he wants to do.
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:27.760]   But effectively it means we have one person now to go to for App Store stuff.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.160]   That's great because previously if you wanted more resources maybe you had to talk to Eddy
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:35.000]   Q, if you had a problem with review you had to talk to Phil Schiller, now the buck stops
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   at Phil.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.440]   Whether it'll be better or not we have to wait and see because App review has been one
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:42.760]   of the biggest thorns in developer's sides since the beginning and that's always been
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:44.160]   under Phil Schiller.
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:47.520]   But with his name I think officially on the door and everybody knowing that it's officially
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:52.080]   him that puts an enormous amount of pressure on Apple.
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:56.280]   And the biggest challenge now will be that most of the complaints that we see on Twitter
[00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:00.200]   are from our really good friends who are like independent developers and that's not always
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:05.920]   aligned with what Apple does and with things like MLB and Candy Crush and other companies
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:06.920]   like that.
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:11.480]   So to see what Phil Schiller does with the Mac App Store and with the iOS App Store to maybe
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:17.320]   address the concerns of independent developers but also keep what's basically a billion dollar
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.920]   you know multi-billion dollar business going is going to be super interesting.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.200]   Well and do you think that these are the number one thing people want to see addressed
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:30.600]   is the reviews or is it the updating process and the ability to do demos and that type
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:31.600]   of thing.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.760]   There's both so and again that's historically been a huge problem because for example the
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:38.760]   Mac App Store people are complaining it's not at parity with the iOS App Store but they
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:42.360]   don't have enough engineers to keep the iOS App Store moving at the pace they want so
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:45.960]   any resource they get it goes to the iOS App Store and you have to make a case to them saying
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:49.320]   yeah this is supremely important you've got to pull some people off or figure out a way
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:53.160]   to get more given that not everybody wants to work in Cupertino and that everybody wants
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:57.360]   to work on those teams you know everything is a constrained resource but I think with
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:00.760]   review the thing that's hard from the outside is we just say this is bothering me and I
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:05.000]   want it fixed but they have to look at repercussions like if you do something like trials how long
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   is a trial on other platforms they've had to experiment and change it and what happens
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.600]   if I go and I get an app and I try it and I put in my data and I decide not to buy it
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:16.360]   is it locked in then if I download an app and then delete it but never opened it do I still
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:20.280]   get to try it for free do I if I read download it a year later then there's just a whole
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:23.840]   bunch of things that they have to work out and make everybody happy with so they're all
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:28.280]   non-trivial processes but again I think a dedicated person at least can be held accountable
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:32.280]   to all those processes maybe they can make the search in the store work that's crazy
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:37.320]   that's another thing that's an Apple problem that's beyond App Store yeah I hope this
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:41.360]   doesn't come across something too harsh but we just spent a whole lot of time admiringly
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.760]   talked about how much work and effort they put into the camera and they do that they
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.360]   solve all those unsolvable problems and make those compromises and decisions because they've
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:53.600]   decided that making a great camera is really important to Apple so there are lots of problems
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:58.840]   with the App Store not just as journalists who talk about such things and talk to journalists
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:03.160]   but people who want to buy an app but can't find it even though they know exactly the app
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:09.400]   they're trying to look for you can't help but ask if they really thought this was a problem
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.960]   would they be able to fix this and I think that it's I think that they think it's an
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:16.960]   important problem but it's not yet at that tipping point where it's like look we're gonna
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.880]   have to address this we know we can better why they don't think this is a big problem
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.880]   I think I think they do but it's there are a whole bunch of things that they acknowledge
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:30.160]   are big problems but they don't have the resources or they don't have enough they don't have
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:38.560]   enough it's like they have 130 units of attention company wide to spend on everything that they're
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:43.120]   doing and some things will get 40 units of their attention some will get three units
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:48.120]   of their attention and sometimes years right because that's where the money is but no but
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:53.560]   again it's just that it's not it's not even just a personnel and budget it really is how
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.120]   much focused does the company have to say this is so important that we're gonna put our
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:02.640]   firehose of resources to fixing this problem and right now the App Store has not gotten
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:10.400]   to the that point of either being enough enough of an embarrassment or important enough so
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:14.720]   much more important as anything else in there in the rest of their portfolio that they figure
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:18.440]   that look we have to do something to fix this immediately it's terrible and I think there's
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:21.800]   lots of places I mean Apple does I think they do a pretty good job of not getting into too
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:25.480]   many things at one time but there are things that they I think they just leave a lot on
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:34.200]   the table I think that the whole ecosystem of iTunes apps I books I mean the I book author
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:39.280]   I think is a perfect example of something that Apple basically they're seating the entire
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:44.360]   education market to Google because they're not willing to invest what they can afford
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:49.840]   to invest in a proper I to you know I books offer I get that it doesn't do what the textbook
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:53.560]   companies wanted but the teachers are going crazy with it and and the thing is is that
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:58.240]   they should be that should that should be to develop they make more money you know a lot
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:02.080]   more money than they spend if they really developed I books author and the ecosystem
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:06.920]   to create the next generation of books rather than this somewhere in between that they've
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:12.640]   that they've created it's still really old the infrastructure is usually only we're running
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:18.520]   the App Store off of things that were designed to run iTunes music decade over a decade ago
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:22.240]   and that all has to be updated and all has to be replaced and and it's running billions
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:26.160]   of dollars of transactions in a ston trip it's like you have a Golden Gate Bridge and you
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:29.200]   know that you have to take this thing down but you can't just tear it down because then
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.760]   no one can cross you've got to build the other bridge in parallel until it's ready to go
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:37.440]   and then carefully start moving people over I have to think it's harder than that there's
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:43.140]   it's somewhat intractable because I I a apple knows it is in Apple's interest because developers
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:48.200]   and apps are key to the success of the iPad and the iPhone and to some degree it now the
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:54.480]   Macintosh so they is this is bread and butter stuff it must be harder than we know and sometimes
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.640]   the answer is different like there was a lot of angst when I forget the name of the app
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:00.720]   now though the sketch or no it wasn't it was one of the apps that left the Mac App Store
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:05.480]   last week the one that did interface yeah that did interface design and Apple's thing
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:09.120]   is and yes that's that's it's a problem that that app can't live on the Mac App Store but
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:12.560]   Apple developed gatekeeper on the Mac because they know that because of the what they want
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:16.160]   to do with the Mac App Store there are some apps that just will do better not being in
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.640]   the Mac App Store and they're okay with that and so sometimes the answer to these things
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:23.280]   is well it would actually be better if you not to be there and that's that's hard because
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:27.200]   we want everything to be everywhere there there are a lot of subtle points to I mean
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:31.920]   sometimes it's not as it's not as simple as do I want to be in the app store or do I
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:36.080]   not want to be in the app store sometimes it's things like look I don't want to support iCloud
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:41.280]   iCloud library it's just not it's just doesn't make sense for our app it does doesn't make
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:47.280]   sense for for our own roadmap for our product but if we want to use a if we want to be have
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:53.680]   a placement in the app store we have to use support all these new APIs and iCloud is
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:58.440]   still is just one of these big bricks that Apple's dropped in these developers backpacks
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:02.040]   where it's it's kind of like it's kind of like saying you we will allow you to publish
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:07.600]   a book in our library but you have to translate it into cling on and then from cling on into
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:14.320]   Esperanto and then back to English and make that version available and say well I don't
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:17.840]   that's we don't care about having cling on editions of our books you're basically saying
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:22.880]   whatever however however few resources you have is a four to eight person programming
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:26.560]   shop you're gonna have to spend some time supporting this and supporting the users who
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:30.760]   are using this even though it's not something that you care to do or maybe you have other
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:36.600]   plans for the next 800 hours of your office productivity so this this is a law it's it's
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:40.920]   not any one thing there's just such a long list of things that are just making the app
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:47.040]   store more and more of a burden and making so many people's decide that is this the day
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:52.360]   is this if we have the ability to back out of here is this year that we do that.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:55.040]   I wrote a thing about this last week called in the shadow of two app stores where you
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:58.200]   have the Mac app store which is absolutely not getting the resources that the iOS app
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:02.560]   store is doing but also you have the iOS app store where it it essentially created a new
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:05.440]   category of apps they're pop apps they're not the kind of apps that all of us grew up
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:10.200]   with the people who were involved in technology with shareware culture and you know traditional
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:14.400]   software packages and most people just didn't buy software back then it's not that there's
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:18.840]   been a transition it opened up the market to new people and it's not clear like Apple
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.440]   looks at all this and they look at data and sometimes they misjudge sometimes they realize
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:27.240]   like with software stability where they were counting crashes and not annoyances and annoyances
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.880]   in volume are worse for some people than crashes they look at this data and they see more
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:34.840]   people buying more apps and using them and engaging with them and yes it is candy crush
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:38.920]   and it is Facebook and it is WhatsApp and it's a completely different kind of software
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:43.200]   but from their point of view this is a hugely successful app store for them so when our
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:47.120]   friends who are making software for 20 years have problems they understand that but they're
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:51.000]   seeing the success of the app store as well and reconciling those two things making it
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.520]   a phenomenal experience for pop apps and for mainstream app consumers and making it a
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:59.440]   place where indie developers can create sustainable apps those are almost like two separate
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:03.440]   worlds and maybe there needs to be two separate app stores we were talking before I just
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:07.600]   can't buy Apple I can't tell Leo or Andy or Alex here's a link go get this Apple TV
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:12.280]   app I'm on my iPhone I see a link for a great Mac app I have no way of buying it there's
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:16.520]   iTunes preview on the web but you can't buy through it there's all these things that just
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:21.080]   stop us from from converting on the app store and all this need there's just so much work
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:26.640]   that needs to be done still I'm certainly a lot more bold and brave when I'm shopping
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:31.440]   for Android apps for my Android phone because almost all the time I can get a demo version
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:35.760]   of it I know that if it's really if it absolutely doesn't work it's not compatible with my phone
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:40.480]   I know that I can get a refund within 15 minutes and as you said Renee that's a tricky proposition
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:46.640]   with some negatives but I hate the fact that when I'm buying apps for when it for instance
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:52.280]   for my iPad Pro it's like I really felt like I have to buy like five different note taking
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:57.520]   apps to find the one that is perfect because all them have one of them one of them is is
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:00.720]   really good but doesn't have this feature that I like in this other one but that one has
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:04.680]   a latency problem they haven't cracked the code of how to make the pencil work properly
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:08.960]   and if not for the fact that I am a journalist who writes about technology I can certainly
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:14.360]   write off all these expenses it just kind of bites that this the one app that I really
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:19.080]   love that cost I was happy to pay six dollars for I kind of had to spend like thirty four
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:24.040]   dollars for in order to find it so there there are a lot of there are a lot of tension points
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:27.680]   in the app store and I hope that there's a way to address I am grateful though that we're
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:34.160]   seeing more iPad Pro apps you know the you've mentioned before the Autodesk graphic which
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:40.600]   is really I played with a spectacular the D what was the DJ program you mentioned last
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:47.800]   week DJ a DJ Pro DJ Pro of course you make is crazy yeah and I and I bought my mom and
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:52.320]   iPad Pro because she's an artist for Christmas in fact I thank you Alex for letting me steal
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:56.640]   your pencil because she because her pencils like back ordered for three more weeks and
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:00.080]   I it's I feel bad I still have one floating around it's gonna show up sometime in January
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:06.680]   but I yeah right I sent her a gift certificate for Procreate because she said well I you know
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:12.280]   I use brushes because that's the tool David Hawkney uses famous British artist and I said
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:16.720]   well that was the when the iPhone came out that was the tool why don't you try Procreate
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:22.240]   oh it's gonna be hard to use she downloaded and she's like crazy about it within two days
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:28.040]   like all my and so the good news is there are some apps that are really taking advantage
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:32.840]   of the iPad Pro you know I mean there there is some light in the in the app store it's
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:36.360]   it's there I just wish we were easier fine I think I agree it was it was I think it was
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:40.280]   still before we started recording the show they talked about how somebody called well
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:45.800]   on I'm or had this really a great article about not just a not a gift guide gifts that she
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:51.720]   bought herself including that really that really is a good idea and so she and so she
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:55.560]   talked about her favorite note taking out for the iPad Pro that I'd never heard of and
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:59.640]   so I didn't think too well called the app store and all this like search for this name
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:03.520]   I figured that well I haven't looked at all of the note taking apps I've I bet that if
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:07.240]   I just search for note taking apps or look through the cattle categories it will show
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:15.120]   up there somewhere and no way I had those one of those moments where Andy you must be
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:20.000]   an idiot you don't know how to navigate the app store because if it's popular enough that
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.680]   I'm or has written about this it can't be like page 41 of a 42 page app listing but
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:31.280]   the only way I managed to find it was eventually giving up clicking back at I'm or and just
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:35.360]   searching for the actual name of the app and if I were a developer and I were hearing that
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:40.640]   if I were the developer of that app I would feel absolutely heartbroken that as a matter
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:45.800]   of fact I could keep talking but I definitely want to give them a plug now because let's
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:50.680]   let's look at what is the what is the bad way to know if you misspell some of like if
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:54.760]   I write tweetbot without the second it just can't find it like this is basic when you
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:59.560]   are just widening yeah but I mean Google Google doesn't have to do it yeah fact Google
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:05.000]   fixes my spelling all the time all the basic they just need a complete search revamp from
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.200]   top to bottom and just incorporate these are solved problems yeah I'm not just so I
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.520]   understand like the debate stuff like the stuff that you can like there's stuff that
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:14.720]   you can have an honest disagreement about and say yes this is better for group egg but
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:19.600]   things like just basic search it's in arguable to me no I agree not just not just search but
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:24.720]   again I should be able to be clicking through productivity apps for the iPad and feel like
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:30.840]   I'm seeing every single productivity app for the iPad instead of feeling low no I believe
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:36.520]   that there's more than 30 productivity apps in the app store for for this device why is
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:42.320]   it that I have to what I feel like curators are only telling showing me only showing me
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:48.920]   a handful of them and the name the name of the app by the way is wink WHi and K and part
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:58.480]   of me thinks that that that it cool well and wink part of me thinks that what they really
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:03.320]   should do is have all the app store all the stores just go under angel errands because
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:07.480]   when she talks about I want to have the the the the store have this experience that competes
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:10.960]   with the iPhone I'm like I want the iPhone store to have competitive experience with
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:15.960]   the iPhone you know you know you know that's the I like wink but I think that uh you know
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:21.120]   wink easily distracted so this is a good but you know sketch is gone right so this is a
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:25.400]   good maybe sketch replacement for markup we were looking for something similar to this
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:30.280]   it's very expensive yeah a lot of the now now I've tried I really need to write it up
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:34.720]   because I've tried five or six them if this one isn't my favorite but only because there
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:39.400]   are so many particulars and how people want to use it I I'm looking for the one that I
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:45.840]   show me right now um says top image that's precious is premium free yeah I don't know
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:49.120]   that's one of the other challenges is that even if you make a great app and you're an independent
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:52.960]   developer there can be a company that has venture funding or some other revenue source
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:57.080]   that can do you know it's possibly good app for free you have to compete with yeah yeah
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:00.840]   like like Microsoft like they're they've got this is just one Microsoft word is just one
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.680]   part of their marketing strategy for this huge office platform and they have it they
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:09.000]   don't have to make money off of the iPad version of it they can just simply say if you buy
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.360]   access to Office 365 you will get this app for free and so that makes it really hard
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.120]   for anybody to try to do a really functional word processor for the iPad that's just not
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.640]   a marked up markdown editor plus couplex or features well and and that's the advantage
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.480]   Apple has with Apple music I mean if you look at what just happened with Taylor Swift I
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:30.920]   mean no one else can afford to to do whatever they cost them to watch taste of God's not
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:34.160]   I have not yet but I'm sure it's great I saw her banner in the Apple store I mean she got
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:37.640]   placement in Apple retail which I don't think I've seen well an exclusivity I mean it's
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:42.080]   a big it's a big caption I'm sure that they need that I bet you a bunch of people signed
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:50.240]   a bunch of you know 16 to 18 year old girls mostly um signed up for Apple music so they
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:54.920]   could watch that video you know so I think and if Apple does that once a week or once
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:58.280]   a month or whatever with different bands it's going to be very compelling and very hard
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:00.280]   to compete with.
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:07.960]   There's some that's that's kind of buzzed through a few stories and then we can get to
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:16.800]   our picks as well but first a word if in your ear about a great holiday gift I've told
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:21.720]   this story before every year when I was a kid my grandma gave us a subscription to
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:25.720]   National Geographic for Christmas I got old ones when I was when my great grandmother
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:32.960]   passed away I got them all in her basement yeah like 1927 and 1933 and then and then
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:38.920]   when the kids came along their grandpa did the same for them every year and now I'm
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:48.240]   thinking this is the way to do it this year texture.com/macbreak texture is kind of like
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:52.560]   Netflix for magazines you pay one monthly fee grandma you could take the monthly fee
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:58.360]   right and they get National Geographic but they also get the New Yorker they get wired
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:06.320]   they get all the best magazines for one price on their iPad or their iPhone and the beauty
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:11.040]   part of this is it's the full magazine not just the current issue on the newsstand but
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:15.480]   all the back issues too there's no clutter you know that was the problem with getting
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:19.560]   the National Geographic you know you put in a you don't want to throw it out because that
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.560]   would be wasteful.
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:21.960]   It's such a nice magazine.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.480]   So beautiful but where are you going to put it I mean this so this gets you everything by
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:31.480]   the way great selection of science and technology magazines including Mackerel PC world popular
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:36.440]   science sound and vision which is a great stereo magazine popular mechanics shutter
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:42.240]   bug for the and popular photography photographers PC and you can now you can now read it on
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.800]   the takeoff and landing.
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:48.040]   You can read it the whole time wired the Smith Sony in which I love.
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:52.080]   Problem is you know I every one of these magazines has at least one article I want to read every
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:57.680]   month or every week but that's one right and then and then you multiply it times 20 magazines
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:01.240]   and pretty soon it's out of control both cost and clutter.
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:06.280]   So here you go all the best magazines on your iPad you could download them before you get
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:10.360]   on the plane in fact you haven't downloaded automatically if you want and then you don't
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:15.960]   have to worry you could be offline they've got curated collections so you can find articles
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:22.760]   easier their editorial team will recommend stories based on your interests.
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:26.760]   Your magazines will have the same layout and pages as if you subscribed individually but
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:31.560]   there are hundreds of additional options bonus features even videos in many cases and it's
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.400]   a much better price.
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:37.520]   What a great gift unrestricted access to the world's best magazines from back issues to
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:44.080]   the one on the news stands today and for yourself in fact if you want to try it out right now
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:49.120]   go to texture T-E-X-T-U-R-E text it was this was the next issue we we've done ads for them
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:53.120]   for a long time it used to be next issue they've renamed themselves texture now it's kind
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:58.120]   of like texture brought to you by next issue texture.com/macbreak that's the website for

[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:12.320]   one and yes sometimes I read the gossip magazines I wanted to read about Kate's fresh start.

[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:23.000]   and all the stuff that you kind of be too embarrassed to buy but you if you got to keep
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.400]   up on what's going on.
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:28.880]   You know I was trying to figure out like how does this actually work but I remember talking
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.440]   to someone about magazines and the when you pay a subscription the primary goal of the
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:36.560]   subscription is the pay for the distribution of the magazine that's their favorite.
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:40.120]   Yeah that's the big expense they don't want to print a magazine if they don't have to
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:46.800]   right so that's why Mac wrote the top right so do yeah yeah exactly New Yorker now they
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:52.640]   just added the New Yorker which I'm really pleased about Newsweek New York magazine.
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:58.360]   I'm just parents you can go on and on outdoor life's meat issue is out on the news stands

[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:30.240]   the gift be a good one. Apple is expected to bid on Thursday night football right now
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:33.240]   Thursday night football is with that one of those weird things where CBS gets the first
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:36.880]   half of the season the NFL network gets the second half and they have to make a big deal
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:41.840]   we're moving to the NFL network this is apparently maybe the maybe Thursday nights cheaper than
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:46.720]   Monday night be smart though I mean if Apple's trying to build up this repertoire of unique
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:52.760]   exclusives I think I get smart I'd watch it well the crazy thing is Apple could afford
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:58.680]   to you know it would be not exclusive yeah non-exclusive.
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:03.600]   They could have a lot of football they wanted yeah well these but these are things you know
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:08.920]   the reason football is so expensive these are things that drive that you know they're
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:14.400]   fans right so that it drives traffic drives business same like Taylor Swift right like
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:17.920]   yeah I mean this is huge I mean being able to know why he has been missing things one
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:21.320]   of the few missing things for the Apple TV is being able to watch live football live
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:29.480]   with life although if you sign up for the CBS you know the CBS app or whatever you can
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:36.320]   now watch live CBS although the signing up part is really I finally gave up with go
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:41.000]   to this web page and then type in this code I went to the like why can't I just say just
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:46.600]   charge me I went to the com case to mess well also yeah I mean did you try I signed
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:50.160]   up for CBS all access when I realized how many hours a week I spent actually watching
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:56.560]   CBS and I stupidly signed up through the Apple TV but you can't actually start using
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:01.600]   it on other devices because there's no because there's there's no way to get the authorization
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:04.240]   transferred from one device to another.
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:05.240]   You have to have a cable?
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:09.640]   Well it says when you know the Apple TV it says you know go to this web page and type
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:13.480]   in this code but then when you go to that web page the input to type in the code never
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:18.280]   shows up so it's just right there so I had so I had to go to the web page sign up for
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:24.080]   it there and then find then then cancel it and from the Apple TV only realizing that
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:28.680]   the instructions for the web and how to cancel it from Apple TV reflect a version of the Apple
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:33.560]   TV app that has not been released yet so I have to I had to have a little bit of a wrestling
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:37.640]   mass to say yeah cancel me and give me my eight dollars back or six dollars back how
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:38.640]   much am I?
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:43.560]   The things like six bucks a month but if I so I'm already paying it for it on cable in
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:50.200]   effect can I just it's also free over the air but it's nice because it's you get live
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:57.200]   broadcast you also get back it's you basically get archives of every single show that's out
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:04.080]   there and so realizing that I watch I watch Colbert every night and I watch this big bang
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:09.000]   theory every week and I love the CBS news stuff it's like I don't like having this I
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.200]   don't want to have to spend six dollars for every single broadcast channel I'd like to
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:17.920]   get the shows of access to I decided to kout out of this one are they the only network
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:22.640]   doing that I could get it I heard she wrote back issues yeah they're there more while
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:28.960]   they're almost everybody else like ABC and NBC and Fox and the rest are Hulu right now
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:34.040]   CBS was the only holdout and so they have ads in the shows or is it without ads?
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:41.720]   Yes they have ads really I see and well also well the one I think oh no I'm sorry I was
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:48.160]   listening about sling.com but you do get the local station right is nice if it if the local
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:53.240]   station cooperates now now what you can do is you can have one thing playing on your old
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:56.800]   Apple TV and your new Apple TV is playing whatever you're actually watching and then you just switch
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:59.840]   inputs when you get to the ad and watch something else for the one.
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:09.200]   It's weird how these things work though I hesitated because sling.com has something kind
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:14.840]   of interesting where if you're watching through the sling app you can tell like if I'm watching
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:20.960]   Food Network through the sling app whether Sean Roku or whatever I get all that what
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:27.280]   appear to be all the commercials that are sold by that are sold by the Food Network but
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.880]   every time there's a local commercial about to come on the screen blanks for those 30
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:36.440]   seconds and I realize that all the commercials I hate that really offend me are all sold
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:42.240]   by the local cable company so I no longer get the video slip and fall don't worry we
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:45.200]   can get you money instead of going to with like the junkiest ones.
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:49.400]   Hey wait let me by the way watch 60 minutes because I have an ad blocker I'm like so I
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.680]   have to unblock CBS to watch it.
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:55.240]   The thing though is that you think about those those local ads you know because a lot of times
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:57.960]   they're bought really cheaply I mean you know you can buy because they're just getting
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:03.480]   you know you're kind of in a lottery but my brother actually got our golf courses
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:08.080]   ad into the you know got into the Super Bowl and he said you know you don't realize how
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:13.720]   powerful advertising on TV is until your ad shows up you know when everyone's watching
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:17.040]   and he said literally the phone would start ringing and you'd hang up and take an order
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:20.040]   and you'd hang up the phone and it would just ring again.
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:23.760]   Again they just kept on going like this it was you know it was like you know fishing in
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.520]   a school official.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.520]   So it is powerful.
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:31.200]   If you think that all the answers you'll local ad I just got Bay Area Audi dealers on the
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:36.480]   stream on the web so they're doing location and they're selling those locally.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:39.960]   Alright I don't think I'm going to pay for that because I already pay for exorbitant amount
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:41.560]   for cable so why would I?
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:47.200]   Yeah as a matter of fact I really did decide that I'm liking sling.com enough that I'm
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:51.320]   I really am going to audit my entire cable package I'm definitely canceling like premium
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:56.720]   movie channels because I can get for five dollars a much a package that does what I
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:03.080]   want premium channels premium movies channels to do for me on sling.com.
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:08.480]   I'm trying to figure out whether I should just cancel my TV package and just go down
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:14.720]   to the basic you know local broadcast plus Univision and that's and that's it because
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:19.440]   once once you start looking at your your TV viewing habits and you realize that I can't
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:25.880]   remember the last time that I actually needed my cable box for something and I was and realized
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:30.800]   that the reason why I subscribe to cable was so that my the apps on my Roku and my Apple
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:35.960]   TV would actually work and that's then we realize that if I have the ability to get all
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:42.560]   that stuff through sling for much less money you know I all I want are these 15 channels
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:45.600]   I don't need the four or eight hundred see I've been trying to figure out how I can get
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:48.960]   a sling box in Pittsburgh so that I can watch all the stealer games that's really all I
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:52.160]   care about is just I can't I can't watch the other games here but I couldn't even when I
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:55.840]   had cable so that doesn't mean meaning meaning anything to me.
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:02.000]   It's a sling but if the sling player app were better on on Apple TV and the excuse me on
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.680]   the old Apple TV and on Roku it's it's nice it's just that sometimes it freezes up and
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:11.320]   I have to restart the stream whereas when I'm using if I'm watching chopped on the Food
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:15.960]   Network app it never freezes it's always because it's the app that's actually contacting
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:21.180]   servers directly and getting the show it's not about the four point physics about four
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:26.120]   body physics of trying to make sure that the app on the phone is talking correctly to the
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:29.720]   box which is talking correctly to the to the network which is talking correctly to something
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:30.720]   else.
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:33.160]   It's funny because the Canadian networks don't have any Apple TV apps you have to use their
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:38.400]   iOS apps and one network says that there's just not licensed to have you watch it to use
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:42.240]   Airplay at all one says you have to use Airplay Marinks they can't let you use Airplay Media
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:45.640]   another lets you use Airplay Media but every time it's which is between their ad server
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:50.960]   and their content server either freezes restarts drops the signal or creates a network error
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:55.080]   and the end result is just it is it is so incredibly unpleasant to try to watch anything
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:59.040]   on any of their apps.
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:05.400]   Apple also apparently have maybe rumor has it will stream start streaming Beatles a little
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:08.880]   Christmas Eve present to you.
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:11.320]   Is it only Apple?
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:15.200]   Not just Apple I guess I don't know let's see because Apple already sells the Beatles
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:19.760]   the thing is streaming Apple doesn't have an exclusive on selling Beatles music right.
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:23.360]   I think so and nobody can stream the Beatles music.
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:34.640]   According to billboard there's a strong indication that fans will be able to hear hey Jude Thursday.
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:42.320]   There is chatter around a six month exclusive with one streaming service.
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:43.800]   Who do you bet?
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.800]   It's not going to be title.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:48.080]   I think it's going to be Apple.
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.080]   Anyway we'll find out.
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.200]   I mean they already have a deal don't they?
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:53.680]   I think they do yeah.
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:58.680]   And then Pandora does have Beatles because of how non-demand web radio is licensed.
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:01.160]   Non-demand meaning you don't get to choose the artist.
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:02.160]   Right.
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:03.360]   Their prices are going out.
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.600]   Spotify wouldn't comment.
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:06.920]   Rhapsody wouldn't comment.
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:09.880]   Apple title DZ or Enslacker did not return comment.
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:12.880]   RDO nobody answered the phone.
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:18.360]   So I'm hoping it'd be nice to be able to stream the Beatles Chris.
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.360]   I just keep buying their music hoping.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:25.880]   I don't have to buy it again one more time.
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:34.800]   Also coming soon to a Facebook near you if you're on iOS live photos.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:35.800]   Is that out yet?
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:40.560]   Well they're rolling it out globally to a small percentage of accounts and then they're
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:44.920]   going to keep adding a few more into the next year.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.600]   So I know a lot of people who do have it.
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:48.360]   Some people say they don't have it yet.
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:52.360]   There's really no way to know unless you try if you want to try upload something set
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:53.360]   it as private.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.960]   Just go up by accident.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:55.960]   Yeah.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:56.960]   But it's super tricky.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:59.720]   Like it's nice that they're doing it but I had to write a how to on it because it's
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:01.200]   just not obvious.
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:04.920]   The way it works is first you have to find a live photo and Apple doesn't indicate which
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:09.200]   one's live photos are so you have to know that it's a live photo and then Facebook there's
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:13.360]   a little tiny live photo button at the bottom right when you go to upload a picture and
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:17.160]   if you don't tap that it's only going to upload the JPEG and not the live photo.
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:19.720]   So by default it won't do what it's supposed to do.
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:23.560]   So you have to make sure you tap that and then upload it and then you can only view it in
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:26.560]   the Facebook for iOS app on an iOS 9 device.
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:27.560]   And what are you getting?
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.120]   Are you getting the actual live photo?
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:31.600]   Are you getting the lower quality video?
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:32.600]   What are you getting?
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:33.920]   It looks exactly like it does in the photos app.
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:38.400]   So you get the frame that is the JPEG and then if you if you force if you 3D touch it on
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:42.800]   an iPhone 6s or you long press it on another iOS 9 device it'll show you the movie.
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:46.640]   So that's why it's iOS only because it's probably using Apple's library to display
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:50.040]   live photos exactly as photos does.
[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:53.760]   I will admit that I completely thought that this was a total gimmick until I took a bunch
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:54.760]   of pictures of my kids.
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:58.000]   And then you're like okay it's really cool.
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.560]   Kids that really like it.
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:01.200]   Yeah yeah really really like it.
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:05.720]   And I did it by accident going by because I forgot that I wasn't even taking live photos.
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:08.120]   And yeah I've been using a workaround.
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:11.840]   I mean there are a number of live photo to GIF apps.
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.440]   There's one I like that works really well.
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:14.560]   There's one that works less well.
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:17.720]   But then you can have an animated GIF on.
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:19.000]   See I see it both ways.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000]   It's amazing.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000]   So using those.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000]   It's like animated GIFs.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000]   They just won't die.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.840]   The copuser is gone but not the GIF.
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:27.000]   I think the program I'm using is called Live to GIF.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.360]   I can't remember exactly.
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.720]   But it will automatically convert it.
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:36.280]   And then of course everything can see it because animated GIFs are always visible.
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:40.240]   It's funny as we're moving from Flash to HTML and now we're introducing live photos.
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:41.240]   Yeah yeah.
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:46.120]   Well that feature required a lot more love than it got.
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:48.920]   It just it demoed really great.
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:55.200]   But the difficulty it took to start sharing it the difficulty it was to take pictures that
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.080]   really really work that way.
[01:30:57.080 --> 01:31:00.720]   And now the confusion and just trying to post it on a Facebook.
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:08.160]   I mean you can compare it to I didn't know until fairly recently that Flickr just quietly
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:12.640]   introduced support for photo spheres in the actual viewer.
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:17.440]   So if you have I just happened to have synced a photo that was a photo sphere to my Flickr
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:19.880]   library because I had an auto upload turned on.
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:23.480]   It wasn't until like I was just going through my pictures I realized that wait I didn't
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:28.240]   take this picture of this doorway and I started scrolling oh my god that's that 360 degree
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:31.000]   view that I shot of the library.
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.080]   And you didn't have to do anything you just simply it just simply converted into the right
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:39.320]   format a viewer and controller actually just appeared in Flickr.
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:44.360]   And I just wish that Apple had been able to do something similar had to be able to create
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:48.680]   that file format such that it would be easy for Facebook and Flickr to just simply say
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:52.400]   oh this is a standard we already understand it's very easy for us to unpeal it and we
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:56.240]   don't have to talk to anybody in order to make this happen we can just simply say that
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:01.160]   anybody wants to upload these live photos can actually just do them and not care.
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:05.480]   But as we go to this next generation of photos whatever that is like I am I was in Japan
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:10.120]   and I hadn't get together and I posted I took a picture of the theta and then I uploaded
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:13.040]   it thinking it was going to be interactive and it just came out unwrapped.
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:17.800]   I don't quite understand why I can't do that so you know so the thing is I think that as
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:22.640]   we you know it's going to take another year or two before all these like new ways of having
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:26.280]   photos is totally integrated and I think probably Apple's problem was they don't want
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:30.360]   to tell anyone so then they put they wait until they goes out and then everyone has to
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:34.120]   start about how often does this happen where Apple invents something they don't want to
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:39.240]   say anything ahead of time so it launches like I beacons and then everybody maybe you'll
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:43.720]   adopt it but Apple in order to get everybody adopt it really has got to put their horses
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:49.560]   behind it and they don't that and then it fades away I beacons I books yeah I can do
[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:56.040]   the story is how do we feel about four-stutch 3d touch now are we all are we all still
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:59.880]   excited about that or is that one thing to away I just wrote about it on the weekend
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:05.160]   because I didn't realize how much I was using it until I started my mom has an iPhone 6
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:08.400]   and I was trying to do some stuff for her she was having some settings issues and I started
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:12.480]   just 3d touching and I couldn't like I go to Instagram now and I used to just like tap
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:17.200]   my like tap a photo swipe back tap a photo now I just 3d touch all in right through a
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:22.680]   whole collection of photos I realized the other last week that in Safari you can on your on
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:27.080]   the favorites or sorry the frequently visited sites you can just force press on those I
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:31.120]   sorry 3d getting my lingo messed up 3d press on those and they'll just pop up for you 3d
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:34.880]   press on bookmarks and you can very quickly because the problem with the iPhone always
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:38.960]   is it's a one column view the iPad was a two column view so you hit the master detail view
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:42.960]   go through the list and the content changes and you can very quickly scrub through vast
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:47.720]   amounts of things but the iPhone was always tap swipe back tap swipe back and it took
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:51.640]   out just to go through email to go through anything and now I'm anytime I see an avatar
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:55.920]   I press it and I get instant options for communications or I can peek at messages without tripping
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:59.600]   the read receipt there's so many things I didn't even realize I was doing until I was back on
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:03.280]   that older phone so I maybe I sort of go through and make a list of all the cool stuff that
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:08.040]   I can do with it even the trackpad mode on the iPhone 6s you press it you're in trackpad
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:11.520]   mode you move the cursor you press a little bit harder it selects the word a little bit
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:15.560]   harder selects the sentence and you just start typing again and you don't realize that you
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:22.440]   miss it until it's gone I have to remind myself to start using it I did it first to it took
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:28.480]   me a while maybe that's it because I don't use it I just I just I yeah I think I go back
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:32.520]   and forth between my old phone on the new phone so often that I'm kind of like if it's not
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:37.720]   constant you can't learn it it's just it's one of those things force yourself to use three
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:42.280]   touch and maybe you will that's the motto part of it that I had that I had to finally
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:49.680]   come so next week I'm finally cutting the cord with AT&T's my my infamous I must be
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:53.600]   nice oh you're giving up your unlimited data I've been up the unlimited I've talked to
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:35:01.160]   you what are you getting for a team of oh so the good choice I use T mobile with my iPhone
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:03.760]   success all you have to do is look at the bills when you send people all over the world
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:07.680]   so my bill versus everyone else that works for me that that gets the international whatever
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:11.280]   yeah and so I wouldn't say the team was you have to check to see if it works for you and
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:16.200]   your space wherever you live but but if you travel a lot in petal is great and Sam Rifel
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:21.320]   your live in Sam Rifel it's probably sucks it's better in urban areas yep it just depends
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:25.240]   that's the you're right exactly right over now international Ashley you land at the Delicore
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:30.640]   airport or yeah Norita or whatever and you just start using it it's quite a thing the
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:36.560]   Germans make great stuff I like this rumor don't know if it's true from Mac rumors apples
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:41.000]   once again rumored to be developing high res audio formats I would be very happy this
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:46.960]   seems like an obvious thing for them to do for for music Apple music I mean just that
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:54.920]   it is a the service provides that you know title does offer for $20 a month title title
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:58.520]   but nobody wants it I guess no one cares what I I don't know if this is true or not but
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:03.120]   a lot of the engineers that I spoke to said that we really can't hear the difference but
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:06.400]   the remastering process they go through to make music for this ends up making more of
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:10.400]   a difference to the average listener problem actual technology they use to deliver it probably
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:15.920]   the case we just get much better masters listening on crappy apple earbuds doesn't matter really
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:20.040]   no no no in fact in fact I don't pick my you know I don't think my earbuds are the best
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:26.600]   ones to listen to music on but they are the right compromise and set of compromises of
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:30.520]   clarity when I'm talking on the phone the good microphone when I'm talking and the music's
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:37.120]   relatively good in Cezetimotix I wouldn't say they're the best yeah I think I think
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:42.040]   most people are interested in increasing their convenience factors opposed to the sound quality
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:49.720]   yeah if someone that rest if some Apple offers lossless which gives you CD quality I bet
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:55.480]   no one uses it I mean I only like I only like to have when I buy music I like to have
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:59.720]   the best quality possible just so that I can remaster it so to speak in formats for the
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:03.480]   rest of my life that's why I still have all my CDs if you rip stuff do you rip it and
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:06.760]   Apple losses because that would give you that capability or flack would give you that no
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:12.240]   because I can't I just can't really tell the difference between I would much rather know
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:18.520]   that any player that I have on any platform is going to be able to handle an AC file or
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:23.560]   whatever mp3 or whatever sound file that I have then wondered does this is this one
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:27.880]   player that I like now about a couple of years behind the times and I can't it can't play this
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:33.160]   sort of format if I want to put something on the on a bluetooth device that's weird but
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:38.360]   do I have to worry about being able to play like I said I mean I think it's convenience more than
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:42.040]   more than sound quality or anything else at this point in life what is interesting though that if
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:45.960]   you are going to go up on stage and say that we're ditching the 3.5 millimeter headset jack and
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:49.880]   you can say instead that we're going to be doing all audio through lightning now because we can
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:54.760]   provide you with quote unquote high definition audio and make it sound like a feature then it's
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:59.000]   probably more palatable at least for the the time it takes people to start getting really angry about
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.960]   it I think they'd have to be really careful on how they say that they'd have they'd have to say that
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:11.720]   by the way not only is it better quality but there is absolutely no way in hell that you will not be
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:17.080]   able to tell the difference between these two because I know we're asking you to throw out every set
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:21.560]   of headphones and most of the audio adapters that you have in your house and car right now
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:26.360]   we are telling you that oh my god you will not well you will want to actually give it to the dog
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:31.080]   and have them take a big dump on it in the backyard and just leave it out there as a warning to other
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:36.120]   inferior technologies that do not ever consider having anything less than this wonderful new
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:41.480]   audio format and this wonderful new lightning unless they can really make that case everyone's
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:46.600]   going to say but I don't want to have to buy all new headphones why did you make this less compatible
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:51.960]   I don't think and and there are so few studies that well it's it's the I mean there's there's so
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:56.840]   few a/b tests in which people can simply can say that the lossless is a noticeable difference
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:02.280]   between that and just a really good nicely mastered mp3 well and I think that it's also people use
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:07.080]   that that head headphone jack for a variety of different things it's the analog hole to the
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:11.240]   to the to the phone where you don't have to go through the lightning registration and you know all
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:15.080]   the other things and I think when I think about you talking about this I just think about the
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:19.400]   ethernet jack that I still miss you know because you're like you're going to miss that ethernet
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:22.600]   jack when they take it out of that I went out of the out of the Mac Pro and I was like oh I
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:27.640]   knock no one's going to matter and I think about that every day when I put my adapter in and like
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:34.280]   I took to you know so so I think that I probably will miss the headphone jack I think I think if
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:39.160]   ever get into the art printer t-shirt business I think I'm going to have a basically craft an
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:46.600]   apple logo all out of dongles and it's going to be like ever you say yes finally someone
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:52.920]   understands my pain remember when erickson used to make phones I've heard of that remember them
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:58.920]   and then sony bottom and then I don't know what they do anymore well there was a little lawsuit
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:05.320]   battle tussle going back and forth between apple and erickson what's that that's your dongle bag
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:12.120]   oh my god tightly packed dongle bag too that's like sardines yeah that's uh every dongle ever
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:17.480]   made what is that it's like it's every dongle I need on a day-to-day basis for my own I got you
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:23.320]   as I got USB C you know you need to do is lightning add up the cost of all those dongles oh I don't
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:27.640]   want to cause it's like a thousand dollar bag rest what what you need is to make it look a
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:33.400]   Chewbacca bandelier for them really you use them every day dongle bandelier but if you're
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:37.400]   wondering though if you're looking for a thing to hold them in women's makeup bags turn out to be
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:40.680]   great it's nice because it's stretchy it feels like it's really tightly and they work really
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:46.360]   but when you buy them in a final shirt like this they look at you very oddly but but the um but
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:49.080]   the TSA likes it because they can look right through it yeah and I like them just like to
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:54.120]   look down very quickly and find out yeah I need an apple dongle bag yes also if you go if you go
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:58.840]   on you go on ebay there are a lot of like like like giving this to me giving it to you that will
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:06.200]   make a weird little weird little pouches I bought like one I'm sorry I'm just it all all my tears
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:12.920]   right now he just he just gave me an apple dongle bag of my very own and that one's even got a little
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:17.720]   loop I'm sorry go ahead Andy please no no I was I was just saying that I found these like
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:21.160]   for instance on ebay these little like leather pouches for like next enough and I bought like
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:25.400]   a half dozen of them and now every single one of my laptop bags has like one of these little
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:31.000]   emergency kits that has like many it has an emergency pair of headphones that's a good idea
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:38.280]   any charging cable and a like a USB 3. We do like a bag we need to do my bar bar bar bar bar bar
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:45.480]   no we can sell that but put a twit logo on that thing happily we call it Andy's dongle bag
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:56.120]   I will say I will say call it the pocket bug out kit pocket bug out kit I did I did this I
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:42:00.920]   I put the I decided to put those together and buy multiples of everything I needed when I got stuck
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:07.160]   like without this one little thing that I needed to charge my phone again and I'm like it nothing
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:12.600]   bad happened but I'm like I and I just bought like two of these and I said that's it I'm gonna put
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:15.960]   I'm gonna buy like a bunch of little bag I'm gonna find a bunch of little bags I'm gonna make
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:20.600]   sure there's like a whole set of these and every single bag a great but I do like the
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:24.120]   National Center like I'm gonna look into it this is how Michelle Fan makes millions of
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:28.120]   dollars on YouTube is selling little you know monthly makeup because you could have an Andy's
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:35.960]   dongle bag of the months I'm telling you Andy forget patreon this is the future I will be
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:40.440]   on but if if only there was there was some sort of service that will allow me to put together an LLC
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:45.240]   so I could launch this business but I can't I can't hire a lawyer well if they're uh I would be
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:51.640]   called legal zoom and unfortunately they don't have it anyway apple has reportedly agreed to pay
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:43:01.240]   erics and so erics and in 2012 took apple to court uh saying we want licensing for 2g3g and lte
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:07.080]   patents that we own apple agreed to pay for the use of patented technology but not enough
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:12.440]   apparently erics and went back to court this year saying or they want more money apple said it's
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:18.760]   too much money for a license there's a countersuit Swedish company up the stakes in February asking
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:25.960]   the international trade commission to block phones iPhones from the USA the itc said well
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:30.520]   we'll look into it but did not import impose the import ban so much for frand huh
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:36.440]   erics's next move was a sue apple in europe well they've settled their differences and now
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:43.320]   apple will reportedly according to nine five mac agreed to pay erics in point five percent of i
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:48.600]   pad and i phone revenues that's a lot of money i don't know the details of this but it's when you
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:52.760]   when you create enabling technologies and they're made part of a standard is understood that everyone
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:56.360]   has to use that standard frand so you agree to license them and you have free reasonable and
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:44:01.000]   non-discriminatory uh conditions and that means that apple should be paying the same thing that
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:06.280]   microsoft is paying that htc is paying that sam san is paying you you basically they allow your
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:09.400]   technology to be the standard in exchange for you making the licensing fair
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:14.600]   but too often recently frand patents have been brought in to generalize lawsuits yeah
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:18.280]   previously the EU was investigating it but i don't know if they're still doing that
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:23.800]   let's uh can somebody in the chat room do some math what is point five percent of i phone and i
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:29.720]   pad revenue what's the money it's pretty much i think i bet you it's a cash
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:35.480]   doesn't like apple could make their own version of 3g or 2g you know what we will
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:40.840]   use their phones i wonder if you could do a google search on point five percent of i phone and i
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:45.480]   pad for alpha brook from alpha would yeah be really you know and then that would come up
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:52.840]   well let's see q4 revenue was 51.5 billion dollars some of that was other stuff but
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:45:01.880]   um 51.5 billion that's a not a this is a good deal for irksen what else do they do now they don't
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:07.720]   do they still sell phones i don't think so it's enough to just relax enjoy the beach
[01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:14.840]   uh what else everybody wanted me to mention this in the chat room scooter x said why don't you
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:20.200]   mention that apple is raising concerns over the uk's draft surveillance bill
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:27.240]   there you go there's what there's the mention i don't you know i think it's close to between
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:32.440]   150 and 200 million a year no a quarter that was quarterly results quarter
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:40.600]   so they got a like a billion dollar operation for nice hanging out nice like they give apple a
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:46.760]   billion dollars to spend on gain rid of it so apparently there is a uk uh
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:54.200]   investigatory powers bill that would overhaul rules the way the authorities can access people's
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:59.960]   communications this probably would try to break encryption we don't know uh encryption the
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:03.960]   possibility of having to hack its own products in the precedent that it would set by agreeing to
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:08.120]   comply with uk issued warrants bbc's learned at michael's off facebook google yahoo and twitter
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:14.680]   have also complained but none of them will say exactly what they said the legislation
[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:18.520]   according to michael's off must avoid conflicts with the laws of other nations and blah blah blah
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:24.520]   um monday was the final deadline for written evidence the committee's expected report in february
[01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:28.920]   2016 this isn't even a bill yet this is just a committee but they're starting to talk about it
[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:32.600]   to make sure that they're trying to pour as much cold water on it as possible yes stop it now
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:38.840]   stop it now yeah i mean i think i agree with the general argument that when you leave a
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:44.040]   backdoor if we look at what happened to us juniper yeah oh yeah perfect example it is the
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:54.200]   example was using that bad encryption that the nsa had paid nist to suggest bad badly done
[01:46:54.200 --> 01:47:00.760]   encryption and juniper adopted it because nist said it was okay and now now as a result every bad
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:07.800]   guy can get into your uh router so yeah juniper is the whoops perfect example of why this isn't
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:12.520]   and is probably juniper may end up killing the whole juniper issue may end up killing all these
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:15.800]   encryption things because it's proven that the government can't even make you know stay safe
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:19.480]   from what they're what they're talking about doing you can bet we'll be talking about it in just a
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:23.880]   few minutes because uh security analysis around the corner ghost eve before we do though let's take
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:31.480]   a break and get your picks of the week gentlemen fire them up first a word from linda.com for all

[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:55.080]   start your trial today linda.com time for our picks of the week i'll start i don't ever start i'm
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:50:02.280]   gonna start because i read a very dramatic and very depressing article actually came out a year ago
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:06.440]   but i don't think anything has changed i'm sure steve gibson would agree with this it was
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:13.800]   maybe better if you don't read this story on public Wi-Fi published by a Dutch paper it's now
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:20.840]   available on medium and english and uh it tells a story of uh bringing a white hat hacker voodoo
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:27.400]   slutboom to a coffee shop he had a very small black device slightly larger than a pack of cigarettes
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:34.040]   with an antenna on it hit it beneath the menu connected to it and was able to sniff out lots
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:41.000]   of information that's basically public from everybody on the public Wi-Fi network including
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:49.640]   all of the access points you'd ever joined then he simulated the names of those access points so
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:53.880]   remember you may be smart you may say you know i'm not gonna you know i'm gonna be careful about the
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:51:00.200]   public Wi-Fi but you also have the name of the Wi-Fi access spot in your home and that's automatically
[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:07.160]   joined by your phone usually or your laptop so he would do that was able to capture huge amounts
[01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:14.120]   of information uh by a man in the middle attack at that point including breaking through some
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:20.040]   encryption and so forth it's a dramatic article and i immediately i read it last night and i
[01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:25.160]   immediately went online and bought this because we're about to spend a week on a boat with public
[01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:30.280]   Wi-Fi the only option right with five thousand other people one of whom may not be the nicest
[01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:35.800]   person in the world one could be that guy from Sweden could be that guy from uh uh holland so uh
[01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:41.000]   this uh this is a tiny fire hard hardware firewall and i had when i've lost it so i bought another
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:48.040]   one but they've gotten so much better this is free if you pay 91 bucks for a year subscription to the
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:54.520]   hotspot vpn uh so and what's nice is you don't have to do anything vpn like on your computer
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:59.080]   you basically use this to connect so this will connect to Wi-Fi or ethernet
[01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:04.600]   so you can bring it into a coffee shop it becomes a Wi-Fi access spot for four others
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:10.760]   through the firewall it has tor built into it which you could use as well as the firewall
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:17.160]   it's vpn encryption it doesn't have a power supply and so it's very light but you can plug it into
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:24.280]   any micro usb battery or just charge it off your laptop keep it running off your laptop and suddenly
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:31.160]   you're gonna have a hardware firewall that i'm frankly gonna after reading this terrifying article
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:36.600]   i'm gonna i'm never again using open Wi-Fi i'm gonna have this all the time now you you know i'm
[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:41.640]   sure with the any as with any vpn there's a little bit of a slowdown but i hope this comes before i
[01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:46.840]   get on the boat yeah i have to admit i use a Wi-Fi most of the time but this is great and there's
[01:52:46.840 --> 01:52:54.600]   another thing that this is useful for that i can see is uh we often want to um plug hard stuff that
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:59.640]   only has a hardware connection and we want to get it to the Wi-Fi right so you could plug this in you
[01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:05.160]   know and ethernet to ethernet mmm well but ethernet it could be well it could go Wi-Fi to ethernet yep and
[01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:09.800]   so we use our computers to do that we use Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi it could just way overkill for that this
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:15.720]   would be perfect yep and it's 91 bucks for a year uh a vpn service the hardware basically they
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:20.040]   give you the hardware because you know because you buy the year so they have a variety of these
[01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:25.080]   tiny hardware firewalls and i had an older one which was not nearly as flexible they've become
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:34.120]   very flexible and tiny and light um it so i think this is a really to me now i feel like okay i guess
[01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:39.480]   i better go with this and the nice thing is i can get one for the whole family because it'll support
[01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:44.840]   four Wi-Fi access points and just say kids here's what you do delete all other access points is
[01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:49.720]   it do Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi yeah so you can so it will connect to it will connect to starbucks or whatever
[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:55.880]   starbucks Wi-Fi and then i don't know how it does captured portals i presume there's some way for
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:54:05.080]   you to log into the captured portal and then from then on uh the device is logged in to the starbucks
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:11.080]   and then firewall vpn's you uh on your own and you don't have to have any software on these other
[01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:17.720]   devices so you use it with your phone you use it with your laptop i just uh you know uh you know
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:23.480]   and i checked of course because it's you know got a korean name but in fact uh it's uh it's good open
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:29.000]   source software on here in it's out there north it's probably an important question it'll block
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:35.720]   malware it'll block web ads uh it will uh also of course give you a vpn and i love it the
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:40.520]   it's big enough now and enough memory that it can do a tour as well automatically and you don't even
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:45.800]   have to see it you don't even know your your kids don't even know they're using it daddy why
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:51.560]   so why fiserv slow because it's a care shut up and the in our co by the way that's tiny hardware
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:58.680]   firewall dot com andy and not co uh got a little one and a and a hardware one uh first uh neil
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:04.360]   gamean read a christmas carol at the new york public library two years ago while dressed in full
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:09.560]   costume as charles dickens complete with the actual beard uh that was one of the nicest things
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:15.080]   i ever did on christmas i i was actually there uh and so the mp3 of that of that reading is available
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:20.280]   for free uh streaming or for download and that's it's become another part of my christmas traditions
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:25.720]   to put to listen to neil gamean reading a christmas carol because the think of how well
[01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:30.920]   he's a great writer exactly i've thought to say we have we've recommended his uh his audiobooks
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:35.480]   not just for how well he writes but also how well he reads them and so it is just a super super
[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:40.200]   treat it's better yeah you don't want you don't want the christmas carol to come from an accent
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:45.640]   like this and this is a suitable well maybe not completely fitting replacement for the
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:53.560]   david letterman christmas show i i did make sure that i copied the entire thing in hd off of my dvr
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:58.520]   it's it's sitting on my hard drive because that was i was and i was at that one last year so oh you
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:03.960]   went to it oh yeah no i got say i i've never asked i had friends who were producers on the show and
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:09.960]   i've never asked them for tickets before and then i said you know what i think if i think at this
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:13.880]   point after like being friends for like nine or ten years i have proven that i'm not just
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:20.280]   maintaining this friendship for access to for for first for tickets so please if if you got you know
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:25.960]   if you if you got them um the other thing i want to recommend though is uh the patagonia mini mass
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:31.960]   bag uh which i just got like last week uh and has been the solution to a bunch of problems that
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:37.960]   i've been dealing with uh because uh even if you're not only am i using like the ipad pro as my regular
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:43.000]   walk around like computer but even so like now i'm using lighter computers and all my bags are
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:51.160]   really designed for you know at best like 2005 2006 sort of stuff so not only it's available in a
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:57.080]   bunch of colors what i like about it is that it's got like this built-in like elasticized sleeve
[01:56:57.080 --> 01:57:03.080]   pocket uh that's perfect for an ipad air and it's also of course perfect for uh for an ipad pro
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:09.480]   and the rest of it is just not that it's it's big enough to be a substantial bag to handle
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:13.960]   everything that you're you're gonna want to have to carry uh throughout a day uh a day in the city
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:19.320]   but also enough a small enough to be compact but also big enough that you can carry some extras
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:26.280]   as well so i'm easily carrying an ipad pro plus a keyboard plus it has really nice organization
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:32.120]   inside here i don't know if you can see that but so i've got like my my laptop stand i've got
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:37.720]   my pencil i've got some actual writing instruments i've got like in this zippered pouch here i've got
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:43.640]   again my my little uh i'm a take it where emergency kit uh and there's still every i keep looking and
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:49.400]   there's other there continue to be like other little like emblems and pouches and sleeves for
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:56.520]   like phones and stuff and there's also this zipper here for like quick access to uh to your sunglasses
[01:57:56.520 --> 01:58:03.240]   and whatever and then the last two things i really love in a bag which is an integrated like water
[01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:09.080]   bottle pouch and also a like a magazine flap so when things you just want to you just want to
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:14.680]   have some papers or something you can have quick access to even if like a kindle or an ipad mini
[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:20.600]   or something like that uh not too expensive um i'm i'm an amaran of these 800 dollar cool leather
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:27.080]   briefcases but this is really the thing that i really need to have like i was my throwing from
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:31.400]   throwing some things into a bag so i'm going to be out of the office for 10 hours whether i'm at a
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:37.080]   conference or or just uh have a meeting in town uh pretty much the perfect size is very very
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:43.160]   also very very well thought out for how a modern person has their technology and it's flexible enough
[01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:47.480]   that you can you can you can slip an umbrella in there you can slip an extra jacket over the flap
[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:54.120]   and really really cool also the fact that fathis reflective uh if it saves me from getting killed
[01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:59.800]   just once uh then it'll have been worth the it's like it's 80 dollars i actually got it
[01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:05.800]   actually got it end up going out of business sale for 43 dollars that's even better excellent
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:15.160]   Alex do you want to fire away so uh two things one real quick i uh i had a nova that i hadn't
[01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:19.240]   really used very much and Andy inspired me over the Thanksgiving to start using it more and
[01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:25.320]   that thing is awesome which the sous vide thing that you stick into the sous vide amova sous vide
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:28.920]   now i have two because i i they have a sale going on i think right now or they're continuing
[01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:33.720]   extended so it was off and so i got the wireless i got the wi-fi one because i had the bluetooth one
[01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:38.920]   and the wi-fi one is just a school there's the anova and he actually carries it around and by
[01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:42.920]   having two of them oh because you you can actually because you can actually cook like at your desk
[01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:47.720]   you can have you have a pork for a sort of brisket going like what during a full work day well
[01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:51.720]   and the thing is is that the reason i wanted to was so that i could so that i can now i can do my
[01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:56.280]   chicken at one temperature and my beef at another temperature which was you know very important
[01:59:56.280 --> 02:00:01.960]   that's your answer so i was it but but now also i had recommended this something in the past um
[02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:07.080]   from this company but they have something new that i kind of got my accident and um pretty excited
[02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:12.920]   about it so um so i talked about a couple maybe i don't know half a year ago or something about
[02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:17.400]   d-san makes this thing called a perfect queue that we use they now have a small one called a micro
[02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:23.160]   and um this is a little geeky for people who do business presentations and stuff like that but
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:28.280]   it's a lot less expensive than the last one and um what is it what does it do what you do is you
[02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:33.080]   take this little antenna one of the things i love about uh your picks is i don't even understand
[02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:40.360]   what they're for it's like okay so you hook that up yeah then i hook this i hook this thing up to
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:45.640]   the enclose of camera going all right this up to that and then i plug it into my best
[02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:49.480]   picture of all three letter acronyms i've never heard before right d-san well do you know about
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:54.360]   a d-san don't you know d-san but it's always then well i don't know it's then you have this which is
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:01:00.440]   uh you know our business called the pickle that's a pickle no they got a pickle i guarantee almost
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:04.360]   every event that i work on there's a slight share of panicked call over comms going where's the pickle
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:09.160]   where's the pickle that's the slideshow advanced mechanism so this is forward and back now the
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:12.840]   thing is is that you know you probably go well i can go to radio shack and buy that little thing
[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:17.800]   that hooks into the thing or i can do bluetooth i can use my iphone this works 300 feet like 300
[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:22.680]   feet solid so this is the pickle base unit that's the base unit and here's the most important part
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:27.960]   is see it's got another usb on the other side yeah so that you can run two of the same presentation
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:31.560]   at the same time which gives you redundancy it's a double pickle something goes wrong it's like
[02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:36.920]   the double Dutch sandwich that is like a double Dutch iris and anyway so it's even green here
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:40.600]   but greens for go is this a cucumber and that's the pickle i don't know what that's called this
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:44.280]   is just called it they make bigger ones of this but this one's small enough now that i can just
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:49.160]   keep it in my bag because you never know what you need to pickle so so so so the um and there's even
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:54.280]   kind of if you if you lose connection there's a manual pickle yeah indicator well there's no it'll
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:58.440]   tell you read so you could see left is well saying go next the next one yeah so because what happens
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:02.920]   is sometimes oftentimes we try to disconnect the speaker from actually using these so right you
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:06.920]   want to know what they want to do but we don't want them to actually do it so because sometimes
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:10.680]   they accidentally pickle they actually put the pickle in their pocket and accidentally
[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:17.320]   yeah it's out of the next slide too early so we try to keep uh so anyway so this is so funny
[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:22.360]   and so this is but there is this this is the cue from like three hundred three hundred
[02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:29.560]   eighty five bucks so chief you guys see the one half of that the big one that i have the big one
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:34.040]   that but the thing is you're paying to get a good one you're paying for the Alex you're saying you
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:40.040]   have a big pickle price of success oh i have i have so many of these so anyway so but the bigger ones
[02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:44.040]   are much more expensive they're like eight hundred nine hundred dollars each whoa and they're big and
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:48.120]   they they do other things but if you're presenting you would find a problem so when someone clicks
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:53.160]   it you go you're this is you wouldn't buy this this is for the av squad to have for those of you
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:56.600]   yeah but i mean the thing is you're doing a lot of these here's the deal if you're doing a lot of
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:03:01.480]   the if you do a lot of these presentations i carry this around because i walk into i walk into a
[02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:06.360]   presentation place and they hand me one of those little bluetooth pieces of whatever and i go you
[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:11.080]   know what i'm just going to use my own so now you know like i'm just going to hand you this and
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:14.600]   it doesn't take you know i'm just like i i don't you know because i actually want my my slides to do
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:18.680]   what they're supposed to do when i want them to do that i have a bit of a conundrum now because i
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:22.760]   thought the show title was going to be Andy's dongle bag but it might be Alex's little pickle i don't
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:30.680]   know i can't decide it could be good be Andy's oh no this is a whole lot of this is going down here
[02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:34.520]   anyway so that's good that's from d san and pretty much they're the only ones that make ones that
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:40.440]   anyone really uses when they're doing anything professional awesome it's cool that's a mr
[02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:47.080]   rene richie i think you're the last one here i have i regret that i have no dongles nor pickles
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:51.800]   to offer you i have i have some things we we put the i'm more awards live this morning which is all
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:56.920]   our favorite app's accessories and devices from the year so it's what we think are the best of the
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:04:01.400]   best of the best stuff and there's a lot it was an interesting year because apple added two whole
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:06.520]   new platforms which means two whole new app stores two whole new devices so we pared down we only did
[02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:10.040]   we instead of doing every category we just did what we felt was the best of the best stuff so
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:18.920]   you have devices and features and apps and accessories across all of apple's product lines and this we
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:24.200]   try to skew towards independence towards things that are really innovative towards stuff that we
[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:28.600]   use every day so we want it to really be not just a retread of what itunes or someone else might
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:33.800]   show you but something that's really kind of serenity and and my opinion on what we sort of
[02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:38.600]   thought was transformative the most this year it's her scope the iphone app of the year i think
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:42.760]   that's a good choice i think you're not alone in fact in that no we thought about mr cat and yeah
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:46.200]   it's very similar to what kick was doing years ago but there's something about apple products that
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:50.520]   mainstream technology is to take them from niche nerdy kind of stuff and make some available to
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:54.760]   everybody in the power of twitter social network and making video streaming popular is hard to
[02:04:54.760 --> 02:05:00.520]   ignore oh love alto's adventure you two turn me on that for the game of the year 3d touch app of
[02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:04.280]   the year tweet bot this is good we have some advantages in that we don't have to just pick
[02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:08.120]   stuff that's in the app store we can pick stuff that's not available yeah store as well so like our
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:13.960]   mac app of the year was um audio hijack three by robed meba which isn't in the app store but is
[02:05:13.960 --> 02:05:17.560]   takes something that used to be really really hard and puts an interface interface on it that is
[02:05:17.560 --> 02:05:24.120]   really really good yeah so i just there was a ton of really really great stuff the apple link
[02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:29.240]   bracelet to i mean apple is brand new to watches and they did something in watch bands that all the
[02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:33.640]   incumbents were they were sort of complacent and apple came in with fresh eyes and made something
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:37.960]   you don't need a jewelry you don't need to take it you don't need tiny tools you can just pop links
[02:05:37.960 --> 02:05:42.040]   in and out and that's the kind of stuff that we really like because it makes an actual we're
[02:05:42.040 --> 02:05:46.200]   gonna see that everywhere so everyone's gonna be doing that with watch bands so that's sort of
[02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:52.360]   the kind of stuff that we like the most i'm more dot com the year's best the other thing i wanted
[02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:56.760]   to mention just quickly is app santa is back this year so it is they get some of the best
[02:05:56.760 --> 02:06:00.360]   developers in the world the most popular apps in the world and they get them to lower the prices
[02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:06.040]   for just a few days over the holidays and they go up to 80 off this year and it's both mac and ios
[02:06:06.040 --> 02:06:11.320]   apps and it's some big ones like calendar five tweet bot day one solver starwalk pdf expert
[02:06:11.320 --> 02:06:18.120]   deliveries v4 video a text expander clear launch center draft screens the list goes on and on and
[02:06:18.120 --> 02:06:22.200]   if you if you don't have them it's a great time to get them if you do have them it's a great time
[02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:28.040]   to gift them uh and the developers are all really really good and the apps are all phenomenal
[02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:34.520]   uh this is not the humble bundle this is not there's also a lot of people do this this is a
[02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:39.240]   app santa yeah and his apps that aren't usually included in bundles they're from people who are
[02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:43.240]   sometimes more reticent to join bundles and real mac does this and i love real the real mac
[02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:48.680]   yeah so this is good yeah yeah there's some good stuff in here most of whatever ever screens on the
[02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:52.680]   ipad pro is ridiculous you can basically have a windows or mac box on a 12-point line it's
[02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:57.640]   screen in front of you maintain your server room from poolside while sipping a cocktail beverage nice
[02:06:57.640 --> 02:07:04.760]   actually i had a caller was looking for exactly that uh he's a new teacher he has
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:10.920]   um he wants to stand up in front of the class with his ipad and be able to control a computer in the
[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:15.480]   back of the class and that screens would do that wouldn't it yeah and one of the problems
[02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:18.920]   previously had been that the controls aren't really i mean as touch friendly as microsoft says they
[02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:23.800]   are in the os 10 is not at all touch friendly that the size of the ipad pro makes it easier to hit
[02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:29.320]   those little tiny on-screen representations of the buttons yeah which is really nice i use screens
[02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:36.680]   i love it yeah 14 bucks but in this how much is the santa app because you're saving money by buying
[02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:40.600]   buying it all at once right isn't that the idea no it's not a bundle because you can't do it
[02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:45.480]   not a bundle store it's just the old reduce their prices at the same time i see i see i see so it's
[02:07:45.480 --> 02:07:53.480]   a 1399 yeah i get it i get it down from 20 bucks nice nice nice nice oh so i don't have to this is
[02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:58.200]   better because i don't have to buy them all nope some of them i haven't bought yet i gets it
[02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:02.920]   it's it's a good it's a good show like they're using the limitations of the
[02:08:02.920 --> 02:08:05.480]   outstore to their advantage yeah absanta dot co
