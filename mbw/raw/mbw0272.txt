[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.860]   with lots of the All Stars from the Macintosh firm
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.700]   event.
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.860]   From San Francisco, California, we have Chris Breen, the Guru,
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.340]   Puba, and other two syllable words of all things iOS.
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.740]   Chris, how is it going today?
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.700]   It is going very well today, Andy.
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.220]   As I mentioned, I have my iPad here with GarageBand on it
[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.060]   and I am taking requests from all our viewers.
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.100]   So if you're tuning in live, please feel free to tweet me
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.060]   your request and I will refuse to play it.
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.140]   Now, do you have the brandy snifter app for iPhone
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.940]   that allows people to PayPal single-
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.340]   - Well, I have here is the Ginsoke Dollar Bills.
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.060]   - Yeah, I have the iHealthy Helpdesk Cup.
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.780]   So feel free to throw in your PayPal gelt right here
[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.340]   into this cup.
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.180]   - Exactly.
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.180]   I know that we have a lot of newlyweds in the listenership
[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.060]   today.
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.140]   So please put a ring on it.
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.380]   That was great for the weddings,
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.700]   but I don't think the rest of the people here
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.820]   and the lounge want to really hear that.
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.500]   So by all means, make your requests,
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.580]   but make them judiciously.
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.540]   - All from the East Coast, we have John Gruber
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.460]   of daring fireball fame, justly so.
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.940]   How are things in the great Keystone State?
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.340]   - Well, it's two p.m.
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.460]   and thanks to our shift to standard time,
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.060]   the sun is setting.
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.860]   So I'm getting very dark.
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.700]   - Okay.
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.380]   You almost look like a good like Apple.com
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.580]   like corporate portrait right now.
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.820]   It's like just dark enough to be stylistic and mysterious.
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.340]   But with that stubble that says,
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.340]   I think about the future, not products
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.660]   and not about shaving every single day.
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.820]   - Exactly.
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:53.660]   Right.
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.940]   - I was just to take proper care of my hygiene.
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.140]   - Oh, hygiene is shaving if you do things.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.460]   - Grooming, let's edit that and change it to grooming.
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.300]   - Exactly.
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.260]   I myself haven't done the Sideburn Wax
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.180]   in about three months.
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.860]   It's really the talk of the town.
[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.620]   I'm really quite ashamed to leave the house,
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.340]   which is okay 'cause I rarely see the need to do so.
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.900]   And from somewhere in the middle of the state,
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.260]   of the country, actually upstate New York,
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.700]   but close enough, we have Tonya angst,
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.660]   web, excuse me, online digital publishing tycoon
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.500]   and head of the Take Control series of eBooks
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.780]   that we all know and love,
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.940]   especially when we have to write a long article
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.140]   about a technical topic.
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.580]   We're eight hours from deadline
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.220]   and we realize that we don't really understand
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.180]   how thinking really is supposed to work.
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.540]   Thank God we can download a Take Control book.
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.340]   (laughing)
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.420]   And contact the experts.
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.020]   Tonya, how you doing?
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.260]   - I'm doing great.
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.460]   The iCloud in my office keeps going on and off.
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.660]   All I've been doing for the last 36 hours
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.100]   is activating an iPad, turning on some service,
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.460]   some thinking service, in fact, seeing what happens,
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.620]   turning the whole thing off,
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.940]   wiping the whole thing again, starting again.
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.180]   My office is completely cluttered up.
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.500]   I've got like three iPads, two iPhones, a couple laptops.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.860]   I cleaned it up so what you see in the camera
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.700]   looks pretty good, but around me,
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.500]   it's the digital detritus mode of a person writing an e-book.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.780]   Well, also editing another e-book,
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.180]   but I'm so glad to be here
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.460]   because this is a really nice break
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.140]   and a chance to talk to other people who are not myself.
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.180]   - It's really a very, very positive thing
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.500]   to reconnect with the humans
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.660]   because the humans are less unpredictable
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.820]   and even less dangerous than an iOS device
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.820]   that has been configured properly for iCloud syncing.
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.780]   I've been actually wondering if there's some limit
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.820]   to how many times you can actually turn this stuff
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.460]   on and off before Apple freaks out and says,
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.980]   you've turned on and off iCloud 20 times less hour.
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.380]   What is with you?
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.340]   We're just gonna cut you off.
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.420]   - Do you wanna talk to somebody?
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.380]   You seem to be stressed out about something.
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.220]   Yes.
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.020]   (laughing)
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.260]   So yes, there's a certain road of pain
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.060]   that we're gonna be walking today with some of our topics.
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.020]   Actually, we're gonna start off by talking about the iPhone
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.980]   4S now that the initial honeymoon is over
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.300]   and we've pretty much exhausted the supply
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.500]   of weird and funny questions we can ask Siri
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.540]   so they can then do blog posts about them.
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.700]   Now we're finding out about battery problems
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.540]   and network outages.
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.860]   The first thing is something that Apple has actually
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.140]   acknowledged a lot of people,
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.540]   especially people who are participating
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.260]   on the iPhone 4S support boards.
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.180]   We're complaining about really, really weird battery drains
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.060]   where on top of the extra network activity
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.060]   that iCloud puts on it,
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.380]   you just, you put your phone in a sleep mode,
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.180]   you put it in your pocket,
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.780]   you take it out of your pocket an hour later
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.980]   and you've lost 25% of your battery.
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.220]   And it turns out this was not a mass dream
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.380]   or a mass delusion, but something that Apple has acknowledged
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.340]   is a problem and they're trying to fix.
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.580]   Chris, you were tweeting a lot about this problem earlier on
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.940]   when you were testing out the iPhone 4S,
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.180]   going all through crash logs.
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.540]   What did you find out about this?
[00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.780]   - Well, I was in Hawaii when this was happening
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.300]   and I received, my wife was nice enough to send me
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.060]   my iPhone 4S.
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.860]   And naturally, the first thing you do when you're in Hawaii
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.940]   with your iPhone 4S is you take it to the beach
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.220]   and you take pictures and movies of where you are
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.820]   and then you tweet them to other people who are not
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.420]   in Hawaii at the beach, just to make them feel envious.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.300]   - And thanks to the new image sensor,
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.980]   we do feel 73% more envious and hateful
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:32.820]   because of those things.
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.340]   - Exactly.
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.820]   So in between these bouts of bragging about where I was,
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.980]   I would go swimming and I would come out
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.100]   and I noticed that when I took the phone out of my pocket,
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.020]   it was really warm right about here.
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.620]   And it wasn't because of the outside temperature,
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.220]   but this was being generated from within.
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.620]   I flipped it on, I had the battery percentage meter on.
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.420]   I looked at it and I noticed that I thought,
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.820]   well, wait a minute, when I got here, it was about 95
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.620]   and now it's about 85 and I've only been gone
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.020]   about half an hour.
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.100]   And what's going on?
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.580]   Because supposedly it wasn't doing anything at all.
[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.340]   And I wasn't sure what was going on.
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.100]   I thought maybe perhaps this is a 3G problem.
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.860]   I took it back to where I was staying, where I was on WiFi
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.700]   and I continued to see these battery drops.
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.900]   I tweeted about it.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.140]   I got a lot of different answers back from people.
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.940]   Some people said, well, it's a Siri function
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.180]   where you put it up to your ear or it's location
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.780]   if you're using Find My Friends.
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.660]   And I don't have any friends in Hawaii, so it wasn't that.
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.180]   So there are any number of things that were thrown out there,
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.540]   but nobody seemed to have a good explanation
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.460]   of what was going on.
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.900]   When I returned, actually, John Gruber contacted me
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.700]   and he said, I've had this problem once, one night,
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.060]   do you have any more information on it?
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.060]   Which is basically a poke in the ribs with a sharp stick
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.860]   to say, get on it, Breen, find out what's really going on here.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.420]   So I did explore the reports on the phone
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.540]   to find out what was going on.
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.620]   I saw a series of crashes followed by information
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.740]   about some kind of contact problem.
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.620]   As it turns out, as I explored it, I was in a crashing loop.
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.220]   And what was going on is there was a problem
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:18.220]   with a contact crashing, then initiating a crash report
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.100]   and then contacts firing up again and crashing
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.180]   and so on and on and on.
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.220]   So I checked out a utility called System Activity Monitor,
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.460]   which is a 99 cent app.
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.860]   Look through that and discover that sure enough,
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:36.540]   every 10 seconds or so, there was a spike
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.860]   of about a 60% processor drain, which indicated
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.380]   that indeed this crashing loop was continuous
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.740]   and it was destroying the battery, not destroying it,
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.820]   but it was certainly draining it very quickly.
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.020]   I turned off contact sinking because again,
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.460]   as I was emailing John back and forth,
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.180]   he said, well, maybe it's a corrupt contact,
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.700]   zeroed in on that, stopped the iCloud sinking with contacts
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.060]   and sure enough, the problem was sort of solved.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.900]   I continued to have battery drains.
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.140]   I finally just reset the phone with all new data,
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.340]   synced it again and the problem seemed to clear up.
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.220]   So that was the way to troubleshoot the thing,
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.300]   but even after I did that and wrote a piece about it,
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.340]   I continued to get reports from other people saying,
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.620]   well, I've done that and that doesn't seem to be helping much.
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.820]   So what else could it be?
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.700]   Fortunately, Apple then jumped in and said, yes,
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.580]   a very small number of users are having
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.380]   this problem and I certainly didn't hear
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.340]   from everybody in the world.
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.100]   So it may be confined to a small number of people,
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.700]   but it does seem there's something going on
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.380]   and some of the settings, particularly those
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.180]   that have to do with location,
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.300]   seem to be a problem where the battery drains
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.140]   and it isn't just the iPhone 4S,
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.700]   but it's all iOS devices that are writing iOS 5.
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.180]   So location seems to be a prime suspect here,
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.820]   but we'll have to see what happens when Apple issues the update.
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.180]   There seem to be so many layers to it because
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.660]   I'm sure everybody here was getting emails and tweets
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.180]   and all sorts of stuff from all kinds of people you know,
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.620]   and you don't know, saying, why am I having these problems?
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.220]   And about every time you pat yourself on the back by saying,
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.260]   oh, well, do you have a location based reminder?
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260]   Oh, well, see, that's it, you know, because if you look
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.420]   in the top that status bar, there's that indicator that says
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.260]   that's keeping the GPS radioactive, that's burning power,
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.420]   turn that off, I'm sure the problem will go away.
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.460]   And then they come back a day later, say, nope, that wasn't it.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.220]   What else you got, scarched?
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.500]   I'm sorry.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.660]   I cloud syncing, I cloud syncing.
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.820]   You're unfortunately, it's re-syncing to it, and yeah,
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.620]   and it seems to be like at least three or four layers deep.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.220]   I was, when I was doing my initial testing of the 4S,
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.860]   I could not figure out how I could get the same battery life
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.140]   that Apple was promising.
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.260]   And usually, Apple's pretty conservative when they promised
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.900]   that an iPhone will last a certain while.
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.500]   So I figured that either I screwed something up or I was having
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.300]   more iCloud issues and fast forward to two weeks later.
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.540]   Now this week, I'm finally producing my 6,000 word iPhone 4S review.
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:05.420]   >> Well, yeah, that is, of course, because they're all our multiple layers.
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.300]   It isn't, clearly, there's some kind of bug here.
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.260]   At least there was for me, and there seems to be for some other people.
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:16.540]   But also, iOS 5 does demand more of the device that you are talking to the cloud
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.980]   much more than you were before.
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.540]   There are more location features that people want to use.
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.260]   So that's naturally going to drain the battery,
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.100]   or at least hit the processor a little harder.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.820]   So it is a hard problem to diagnose.
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:33.180]   >> Have people been having these problems with the 3GIS more than any other,
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.500]   more than as much as the 4S or the 4?
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.900]   >> I actually talked to somebody who found that he was very unhappy
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.340]   with this 3GIS performance.
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.340]   So it isn't necessarily the 4S, although because of Siri
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.580]   and some of the other things that the 4S does,
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.020]   you would think that would get hit harder, but it has a bigger battery.
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.300]   So hard to say.
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.500]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.420]   John, you had the 4S earlier than anybody else.
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.380]   Were you having problems with that during your early testing period?
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.820]   >> No, definitely not.
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:04.540]   I found, especially with the review unit I had, and what I did with that was,
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:11.740]   I used it in factory condition for about 24 hours, just set it up as a new iPhone.
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:17.100]   Just seem like a good way to start a review is, let's pretend I'm a new user,
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.380]   and I've never used it before.
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.740]   And it seemed like normal battery life.
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:30.140]   But then about one day in, I restored from a backup of my personal iPhone 4
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.340]   over iCloud, because I thought, "Hey, this is a good test of iCloud backups,
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.860]   because I'm in the developer program.
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:42.060]   I was using the betas and of iOS 5 on my personal phone.
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.820]   So I already had an iCloud backup of that phone,
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.940]   and I thought, "Well, this will be a nice field test of that."
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.220]   And that worked.
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:57.740]   So then my review unit 4S from Apple was a clone of my personal iPhone,
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.500]   and I did not see any.
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:05.900]   Battery life to me was about the same as what I'd been getting ever since 2007
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:06.620]   with my iPhone.
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:10.460]   Heavy use, we would drain like you'd expect,
[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.980]   but normal use, you get through the day and have plenty of despair.
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.660]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.540]   I will say this.
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:20.220]   The other thing is that then I bought my own iPhone 4S,
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:25.260]   and the second or third night I had it, I went to bed with a mostly full charge.
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:31.820]   And I woke up and it wasn't empty, but it was near the red zone.
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.980]   And I was like, "Whoa, I don't know what I did in the middle of the night
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.260]   while I was sleeping, but I don't think I was using the phone."
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.140]   But then it never happened again.
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.740]   So I don't know what that was.
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.980]   Yeah, that's weird.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.460]   That syncs up with stuff that I've been reading on the support forums,
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.180]   where people were saying that it was working fine for two or three days.
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.420]   And then all of a sudden they started having these problems,
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.660]   which makes you wonder where they're having this.
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:14:01.100]   The thing is with the 4S is that it has so many cool features that you
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.020]   play with out of the box before you start really putting your own stuff on it.
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.220]   So I think that people had sort of a honeymoon period before they started
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:12.300]   loading up whatever it was from their personal data that's going to cause some of these problems.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.220]   I do think just anecdotally following all this stuff,
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.660]   following Chris's write up.
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:23.740]   One of the reasons I encouraged him to write it up is I saw so many anecdotal reports of people
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.260]   saying they have very, very disappointing battery life with the 4S.
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.460]   And that's definitely not supposed to be like that.
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:35.260]   I mean, and the other thing too is I saw too many people saying things like,
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.820]   "Well, duh, you got to turn off, turn Siri off.
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.140]   You've got to turn off location reminders."
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.860]   Like you're supposed to be able to use all of these new things without draining your battery.
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:49.900]   And this reaction of, "Well, those features are cool, but I've turned them all off because they
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.940]   were draining my battery 15% an hour."
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.580]   And that is absolutely not supposed to happen.
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:15:03.740]   And I think Apple's statement this week where they use bugs plural is definitely the case.
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:11.180]   Like Chris's situation may well have exactly and only been something with contact sinking with iCloud.
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.780]   But there are absolutely, I'm convinced, there are other similar bugs
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:19.420]   that have the same effect that may have nothing to do with contacts, maybe have nothing to do with iCloud.
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:31.180]   And I'd also think importantly, I think it's clearly bugs in iOS 5, not necessarily anything in the
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.780]   iPhone 4S hardware.
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:38.540]   Like I think, assuming Apple can get on top of the bugs, everybody with a 4S should see
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.700]   as expected battery life.
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:44.700]   Yeah, and if this battery problem is also affecting people with the iPhone 4 in previous,
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.620]   at least we know it's not a baseband problem, which would have been pretty damn serious.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.420]   Right.
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.460]   Yeah, right.
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.700]   Yeah, but you have a point.
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:57.900]   I mean, I test a lot of 4G and LTE phones that run Android.
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.180]   And 4G is great.
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:15:59.900]   It runs fast.
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:05.340]   It's great for HD video when you're streaming, but it is that feature you have to turn off
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.980]   unless you really want to use it because it does blow through the battery so much.
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.820]   So that's pretty, pretty big stumble for Apple.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.500]   Nonetheless, that they have to at least promise that we're going to see an update sometime in the
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.300]   next two weeks.
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.340]   Developers have now now playing with the second version of the bug fix.
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:26.460]   I haven't heard any particular reports from anybody that have been published yet about how
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.660]   well it's working though.
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:33.420]   Has anybody heard about like how well the bug fix to 5.0 is working out for people in the field?
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.660]   I guess not.
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:43.260]   Oh, well, I would say there's one reader at Daring Fireball who's been in contact with me.
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:47.500]   I'm not going to, you know, he doesn't work at Apple, but he was he's one of the people who
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:54.060]   reported it and got contacted by Apple and has been exchanging emails with Apple and they,
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:58.860]   you know, as it's been reported on other news sites, you know, but that they've given him like
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:07.260]   a way to turn on performance logging that isn't on by default and access to the betas.
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:12.780]   He said that, you know, with after a couple of hours on whichever of the betas he tried that
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:19.500]   it did seem to be working, but you couldn't you can't be certain because he wasn't seeing it
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.340]   every single hour of every day.
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:25.020]   It would, you know, sometimes it would drain unnecessarily and other times not.
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:29.020]   So a few hours isn't isn't clear if that's that's enough to show that it's fixed.
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:34.860]   Yeah, it's kind of a reminder too of the first two or three weeks when any new product hits the
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:39.500]   store shelves, whether it's an iPhone, whether it's an iPad or Macbook Air, if you have any problems
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:44.060]   with it, you're that's a doubly good reason to take it back to Apple to the Genius Bar because
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:49.660]   I do know that the Genius Bar gets sort of hunting, hunting licenses directly from the
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:55.100]   mothership saying we're looking for if you if you can give us six examples of a screen that got
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.860]   cracked. If you've got five examples of a battery that's overheating, three examples of this,
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:03.260]   that and the other, because they really are looking to get back information about how well these
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:08.860]   designs are performing in the field. So if your battery was having battery problems, it probably
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:13.740]   wouldn't simply be a case of, oh, well, we'll reset the phone for you. It might even be a case of we
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:18.460]   want to swap this out because we want to send this malfunctioning unit back to Apple so they so the
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.780]   so the mothership engineers can actually get their hands on it.
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.380]   Tony, do you have a forest yet?
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:29.980]   I do have a forest. I got the white one. I really like it. I haven't had any battery problems or
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:38.460]   noticed Siri outages. I'm basically a really satisfied customer. I upgraded from a 3GS.
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:44.380]   It was actually my third 3GS because I kept breaking the antennas on the 3GS. So it's really a treat
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:52.060]   to have a new phone that works well. So I guess out of the four of us, Chris had a weird problem
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:57.420]   with his battery and it's still flaky. John had a problem one night, Andy, I don't know if you
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:04.220]   had a problem or not. I had a problem. I think we're just related to new iOS 5 features I
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.340]   weren't used to managing correctly. So I wasn't having that sort of desperate problem.
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:14.460]   So basically out of four people, I had no problem. You had a self-inflicted problem,
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:20.540]   but it wasn't one of the bugs. And Chris and John may have experienced bugs. And I think it's great
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:27.500]   that Apple characterized it as bugs plural because it's from what people are describing, it doesn't
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:32.460]   really seem like all the same problems. So I'm looking forward to the fix because I certainly
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:37.900]   don't want to experience reduced battery life. But yeah, I guess I'm the lucky one.
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:42.460]   Well, particularly, I'm surprised because you're an upstate in New York. Do you have really great
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.220]   cell coverage? Because I'm surprised that you haven't been having any problems like getting Siri
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:52.380]   to work consistently. You need a really good solid network connection to get Siri working at all.
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:57.980]   Well, we have crappy cell coverage here, but I have a lovely Wi-Fi network in my house.
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:01.980]   So it seems to be working pretty well. I use her for reminders.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:08.220]   Yeah. No, that's that's that I've never been the sort of guy who will just instinctively
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:13.100]   like pick up the phone and say, Oh, remember to get pop tarts the next time I'm at the supermarket.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.420]   But now I'm all the time saying, did you remember that that that that that that
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.380]   that that that battery that's been leaking and it's been the backseat of your car before they're
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:25.100]   cycling and get it before it burns a hole to the roof. But point. And and so when you when you're
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:29.900]   in a situation where there's a there seems to have been a system wide outage late last week,
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:35.260]   or at least for about 12 to 18 hours, a large number of people said they couldn't access Siri
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:42.060]   at all, even if they were like next to really, really good Wi-Fi. And this is a it's in one way,
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:46.300]   a lesser problem in one way, a bigger problem. It's lesser. It's a lesser problem because
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:52.140]   Apple put that magical word beta on the on the on the Siri service, which is which is which is
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.980]   as I said before, it's a lot like when you make a chess move and you make the and you make the
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.820]   move and the opponent says, Oh my God, he's just walking to chess mate. But you can say,
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:05.660]   I still got my finger on the piece. I can move it back. It doesn't count. But it's worse because
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:12.380]   Siri works so well for all the things that it does that when it doesn't work, you are just
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:16.380]   doubly disappointed. And because it's sort of a human interface, you feel as though,
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:21.660]   I'm sorry, Siri, was I curt with you? Whatever it is, I'm sorry. You know, I'm that I'm like that
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.900]   at the end of the day. You know, I switched the decaf and it does whatever it is. I'll fix it for
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:31.580]   you. Hey, who wants one of those fruit baskets that shaped like flowers? I can Siri order 1 800
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:39.580]   fruit basket flowers for yourself. But it was a very serious problem, wasn't it?
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:47.420]   The main reason it was it could be a problem is for people like me, I'm in one of those families
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:52.860]   where our online calendaring system has been completely destroyed by sort of being half
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:59.420]   upgraded to iCloud. So I'm now basically issuing almost panic reminders to myself with Siri.
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:03.500]   Like remember this, remember this, remember this, because it's not actually in my calendar.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:10.700]   So yeah, I think if if Siri were to go down, people need to have a backup plan. My backup plan
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:16.220]   before I learned about Siri for doing a lot of the things that Siri does on the iPhone,
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:21.500]   I was going to learn how to thumb type. I was all excited to like really, really, you know,
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:28.540]   put in the time and learned some type, get over it. But now is Siri. Oh, I also use Siri for
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:32.860]   text messaging. So now maybe I won't learn to some type.
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:38.460]   Yeah, well, the only time it's totally replaced thumb typing for me,
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.260]   except for those situations where I don't want to be able to say,
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:48.460]   hi, well, Dave, thanks for emailing me. I'm so sorry. I really am your best friend. And if I
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:53.180]   ever puke inside your aquarium ever again, I want you to remember. I want you to call me on that,
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:57.740]   even if I am drunk and you have to look around the people on the bus saying, I'm sorry. It's
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.940]   radio, I'm just doing it. It's just a radio play. I didn't really puke and it's a query.
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:08.940]   I made a shortcut in settings for the, for my iPhone so that I can put a little PS at the end
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:16.540]   of my email messages that say this message was stated and typed by Siri so that I can,
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:21.980]   I can talk my email, but it's not that good for really long email messages. Maybe I need more
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:27.660]   practice, but Siri seems to sometimes go off on a different tangent than what I had in my
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:35.100]   mind. Yeah, also you're, I'm more of a writer than a speaker when I'm sending emails. I'll get to
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:39.580]   the very, very end of the sentence realizing that, oh, you should actually have started the
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:45.900]   sentence with the word of course, comma, dang it. So it's, I don't, I don't much punctuation.
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:51.660]   Yeah, although it does, it does do smiley's and ellipses. I think I've improved my, my
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:57.180]   pronunciation of parentheses for all the times that I've said parentheses, of course, comma,
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:01.340]   if you really want to do this correctly, you should disconnect the terminals before you start
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:05.820]   and parentheses and then sign, it seems something very, very weird appear in the text input.
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:12.140]   It has occurred to me that as I use it more and I'm getting more and more used to
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:21.020]   pronouncing my punctuation mark, saying comma and period. I'm worried that if I get into it more,
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:25.340]   I'm going to start doing that when I'm just talking. You saw, you saw like one of those
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:35.500]   animations from the electric company on on a kid show. Chris, like, have you been using
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:42.300]   cereal? Like how well has it infested your brain? I have used it in pretty much the same way that
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:47.740]   other people here are using it in that in the past, it was really a pain to create a calendar
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:53.900]   event on an iOS device or sometimes write a little note to yourself. And I have found that I rely
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:25:00.620]   exclusively on Siri now when I need to set a calendar event to have to go back and do it manually
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:05.980]   on one of my other devices that doesn't have Siri. I just think it's prehistoric now. It's like,
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:10.780]   well, why can't I just say meet Andy for lunch on Thursday? And it says, well, you're meeting
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:17.100]   Bob, well, strike Bob and keep Andy in. Yes. Yeah. Okay. So you, I'm sorry, I can't,
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.180]   I can't pretend not to enjoy even a conjecture over I've read the overriding,
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:27.500]   somebody else's lunch appointment. There you go. Yeah, it's, it's great. The one problem I had
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:32.700]   with it is, is when I was going through all this battery diagnostic stuff, I turned Siri off just
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:36.700]   to see what would happen. And when you do that, apparently it takes all the Siri data that's on
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:42.060]   the servers and it gets rid of it, which is good because I, if I didn't want that information up
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:47.180]   there, I could wipe it out that easily. But when you then turn Siri back on again, it's,
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:53.740]   you know, it's like meeting Siri's twin who's never met you before. And so now,
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:58.860]   who are you and who's your brother and who's your, I don't know who your wife is. We have to go
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:03.660]   through all that again until it sinks up again. And then suddenly it's like, Oh, oh, that's right.
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:09.180]   You know, it's finally that's, it's brain has come back to it and it remembers all that stuff.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:14.460]   But for a while, Siri is really stupid. So that's one of the reason not to turn Siri off just
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:19.980]   because you feel like it. Exactly. It's sort of like when you, when the personal system you've
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:23.820]   had for two years and knows how you like your coffee and knows where the FedEx office is,
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:28.060]   goes away for two weeks and you get a temp in. Yeah, that's, that's a bad thing. Okay, we got to
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:32.140]   take a break right now. When we get back, we're going to be talking about iCloud. And in the
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:36.540]   show notes, I've, I sort of inadvertently put a lot of swear words next to iCloud. I'm sorry,
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:40.700]   there was a very swary sort of note. But we'll be talking about that a little bit later.
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:47.260]   Well, here's Leo to thank one of our wonderful sponsors. Thank you. Andy, may I interrupt briefly,
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:54.460]   briefly to talk about go to meeting and the brand new go to meeting for HD faces. Have you,
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:58.060]   have you, have you taken a look at this? Go to meeting.com is a place to go. If you want to find out,
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:05.980]   I'll do it right now. Go to meeting.com. And the HD faces product means that you've got video
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:09.580]   in addition to your screen sharing. So we've used go to meeting. We've been talking about it for
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:15.980]   several years now. I don't, I can't remember how I started to use it more than five years ago, I think.
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:23.100]   What it does is it lets you share your screen with anybody on a variety of devices. Great way to
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:27.740]   have a meeting be more visual, more active. If you've got a PowerPoint or a keynote presentation,
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:33.820]   because it works on Macs or PCs, you could absolutely share that with people over the internet. And
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:39.740]   you know, it's, it is almost as good as a face to face meeting. Well, now with HD faces,
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:45.660]   it is every bit as good as a face to face meeting because you can see their faces. You can see
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:50.060]   them frown if they don't like what you're talking about. Smile if they do. You can see their arms
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:57.500]   folded, the body language, it just makes a huge difference. You may pay 10, $20,000 for a dedicated
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.940]   telepresence conferencing system. You've ever been in those conference rooms with the big screens
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:07.340]   and all that hugely expensive or $49 a month for go to meeting. Now, because everybody these days
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:11.980]   has a camera on their laptop, you're going to get all of the benefits of video conferencing very
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:17.500]   affordably and still to screen sharing. The crisp clear picture, it's HD, it's just fantastic.

[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:06.140]   Now, let's increase the depression level by about 48 points and talk about iCloud.
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:12.700]   And iCloud's thinking. I'm not sure. First, just a quick, quick verbal show of hands
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:19.660]   of the four of us. Is there anybody who has not had any problems getting iCloud to work the way that
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:25.980]   you would, at any sane person, would expect iCloud to work? I haven't. Nope. I think I can
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:31.740]   raise my hand. I don't really. Yeah, I'm curious to hear what you guys have to say, but it's worked
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:37.100]   pretty well for me. The only thing I haven't really gotten into yet is my wife has an upgraded,
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:43.500]   done the upgrade to Lion. And so she's still on mobile me. So I think, just like Tanya said,
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:50.540]   we're running into family, calendaring, shared calendar, scheduling problems. Because I thought,
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:56.700]   you know, don't upgrade her until I know everything is okay because I'll be on the hook for it.
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:02.700]   But in terms of my own personal stuff, it's worked well. So I'm curious to hear what you
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:09.180]   guys have to say. Yeah, Tanya, you guys had at TIDBITS had a couple of really good articles on
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:13.980]   problems with, or at least difficulties in both attitude adjustment and understanding how iCloud
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:19.580]   works. And also just major failure points that iCloud has been having because I don't think I've
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:26.460]   ever been asked to sign back into iTunes and iCloud as an Apple service as often as I have over the
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:33.500]   past three weeks. I don't think that I've ever discovered new features and new tricks with a
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:39.500]   service in so many ways of just iCloud saying, oh, I'm sorry. I know that normally I'm supposed to
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.740]   sync your contacts, but you signed in in a non master account. You need to have the master
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:47.660]   icon. There is a master iCloud account. Why did you not tell me about this when you had to be
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:52.140]   signed up with iCloud? So what have you been going through and what's the name of your pain, Tanya?
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:59.580]   Well, all right. So personally, I have to say that iCloud has worked well for me. I have turned
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:09.740]   it on and off about 200 times, but it does seem to be working as advertised. But what I'm hearing
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:17.340]   from and actually also experiencing personally is a lot of people are upset because it's this huge
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:24.700]   jump, especially for certain things that you may wish to do, like find my iPhone back to my Mac,
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:32.700]   sharing calendars. These are things that you can't do until you kind of move your entire Macintosh
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:41.900]   and iOS universe over into the iCloud. So if you have a bunch of Macs and a bunch of iPhones and
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:46.620]   this and that and the other thing, you have to upgrade everything and everything has to be running
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:57.340]   Lion 10.7.2 or later and iOS 5. And so that leaves people either needing to upgrade a lot of hardware
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:04.220]   or needing to replace hardware, Mac and Tashes that are too old and actually older iPod touches
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:11.020]   and iPhones that are too old. So a lot of people are just grouchy about this. They want to be cool
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:16.780]   and kind of cutting edge and stick with Apple and try all this new stuff. But damn, there's the
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:25.020]   daughter who has the old iPhone and needs to share the calendar. And so now either daughter gets new
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:33.980]   iPhone or trying to explore alternatives, which can be a little crusty sometimes. So people are
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:41.580]   upset and it seems like there are sometimes little weird unintended consequences like,
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:47.660]   "Oh, back to my Mac under iCloud. That's that service where you can do file sharing
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:54.860]   or screen serving between Macs over the internet." Oh, well, the iCloud version only works with
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:33:02.060]   Lion. So yeah, that Mac of your mother's that you do screen sharing with, you know, the old one
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:06.540]   that's not going to work anymore. So you'll have to try a different form of screen sharing or.
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:13.260]   So people are having to try new things and upgrade new things and it is making them grumpy.
[00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:18.380]   Yeah. And I think Adam, was it Adam who wrote this piece last week that I really liked where he
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:23.900]   was acknowledging a bunch of problems that he was experiencing, but also that there's a subtle
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:30.220]   change in the syncing relationship between all of your computers now that were asked before iCloud,
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:34.780]   every one of your devices had its own version of the truth and the central syncing services job was
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:39.340]   just to reconcile all of those truths together. Whereas you have to sort of get into a mindset,
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:44.220]   or if I was understanding Adam's point of view, you have to get into sort of mindset. We understand
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:48.700]   that all the data that's on your individual devices doesn't mean anything. It's all about the stuff
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:53.260]   that's on iCloud. The iCloud is the only truth. The iCloud is the only wisdom, do not anger the
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:59.020]   iCloud. The iCloud is testy. The iCloud wants you to live in fear. He's an Old Testament form iCloud
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:03.740]   and just trust that everything is going to sort of sink down from the top correctly.
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:08.780]   And I think that it helped me because that's something I had learned, but not something I
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.860]   think was in the forefront of my mind. And I think the rails were a little bit greased
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:19.180]   after I suddenly accepted that, okay, it's not important to me that I force this MacBook to
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:25.020]   inflict all of its changes on every other device I own. So long as the conduit from the ground
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:29.420]   to iCloud between this device is okay, it'll all work out.
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:36.140]   Yeah, it's part and parcel of this whole shift to more cloud computing. And it's sort of
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:45.420]   all of us humans needing to rethink our relationship to our data. We might not really control our data
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:51.580]   at all anymore as with iCloud where it's really up in the virtual sky.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:59.660]   And of course, different applications that we use give us more or less local control.
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:05.820]   So we have to keep adjusting our brains for different amounts of local control or what
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:12.540]   does local control mean. And particularly with some of the iCloud services, like say the photo
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:19.420]   stream where photos that you add to your photo stream are in it and then they can appear on all
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:27.100]   different of your devices. There's no source where all your photos kind of start.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:35.660]   I mean, there could be, but there's no rule that there needs to be. So really the only truth,
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:40.940]   it's certainly not a truth database or anything, but the only centralized source of them is from
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:47.340]   Apple up in the iCloud. And it is a weird mental shift. It's sort of a giving up of control.
[00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:54.940]   And then sort of hoping that it does all work out. And honestly, I have heard a lot of people
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:59.500]   who are having trouble getting their heads around it. But I have not heard from people complaining
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:06.700]   that it's not working. Of course, it's always worrying that it might not work. And if it doesn't
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:13.020]   work, your options for fixing it become more limited when you don't have local control.
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.620]   But that's just the nature of what we're doing right now in technology, everything's all about
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.740]   what's in the cloud and putting it in the cloud and sharing it around.
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:24.860]   It occurred to me this morning. Now that we're about a week away from the release of the
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:30.060]   Kindle Amazon Kindle Fire that Amazon might have sort of a natural advantage in that.
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:34.380]   Technically, this is a seven inch Android tablet that can do pretty much anything an iPod touch
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:41.660]   can do or even an iPad can do. But the fact that Amazon is saying outright, this is a cloud radio
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:46.860]   device that does nothing but mirror off content that you've already purchased or loaded up on
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:52.380]   Amazon servers. Maybe if it sets that sort of level of expectation or that understanding
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.700]   right at the right at the first day of ownership, it'll make people a lot easier to understand. It'll
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:02.140]   help people understand how cloud syncing works on the Kindle in a way that the rest of us with
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:08.540]   our puny pre iOS 5 brains can't really understand why we're holding up an iPhone that's telling
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:12.300]   us that we can't I'm sorry, I can't sync to ICal because of an authentication issue or whatever.
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:17.420]   Chris, you're right. It's a whole different idea. Amazon is kind of the mothership.
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:23.420]   They put content onto your Kindle. You then can look at the content. It's much more straight.
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:29.340]   It's much more kind of understandable. Whereas with the iPad, Apple puts content on you,
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:34.140]   put content in all different apps, but content in it's much more of a mishmash.
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:40.940]   Chris, what do you think about this? Well, also with the iOS device and iPhones and these other
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.940]   devices we're using, there's legacy data that we've got. So we've been using this stuff and
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:48.700]   controlling it ourselves for years and years and years and it's been accumulating with something
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:54.060]   like the fire. You really get to start out at a ground level again and start building from there.
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:38:00.620]   So the expectation is different. In terms of the experiences I've had, as Tanya was describing,
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:05.500]   I'm kind of straddling two worlds here. My production machine is still on snow leopard,
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:11.260]   so I can't take advantage of some of this stuff. And I'm a disorganized person, honestly.
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:18.380]   And so as I can tell by the orderly shelves of albums that I'm guessing are alphabetized by
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:22.700]   band, year, and membership behind you, but continue booking by a bunch of people.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.980]   By genre and then alphabetized within the genre.
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:31.900]   And some sub genres in there. I didn't mean to undermine you, please continue.
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:36.940]   No, it's OK. That's the only area in my life where I have any organization. And it helps because I
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:42.460]   never ever touch those albums except to bring out a cover to put on Macbreak Weekly. And this week,
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:51.180]   by the way, we have Eskimo by the residents. I'm going to ask. Yes. So I have duplicate contacts
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:55.980]   here and there. And I have calendars that exist in one place and don't exist somewhere else.
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:39:02.300]   And I have bookmarks on this, but they're not on that. And so I pity poor iCloud when it's trying
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:07.020]   to bring some order to my life and I'm just sending up all this stuff to it. And then it goes,
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:12.700]   OK, I think this is the same, but I'm not quite sure. So I'm going to give you both. And oh,
[00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:19.580]   you want 17 contacts for yourself that all have different data. I'll try to merge them,
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:23.740]   but I'm still going to end up with about 12. That's what you want, right? And so,
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:30.780]   to an extent, it really, it's up to me to go back in. And this is a project for the next couple of
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:37.900]   weeks is take all my data, just get everything off iCloud, start over, wipe it so that I've got
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:43.580]   one backup of everything that I want exactly the way I want it, then send it to iCloud. And then I
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:48.460]   can make some judgment on how well it's working. At this point, it seems to be a mess. But I think
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:53.340]   I'm the one to blame for that and not iCloud. You think maybe that Apple could have made things
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:40:00.060]   a lot easier by introducing, just for 2011, an iCloud migration assistant that would basically
[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:04.940]   run on every one of your machines the first time it sinks, does that sort of real sweat-lodge
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:08.380]   style. I'm going to examine every contact you have. I'm going to make sure that every contact and
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:12.060]   appointment you have is correctly formed. Is it going to create a problem when we upload it to the
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:17.180]   crowd? I'm going to do this really big, complicated manual shuffling that lets you say that, look,
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:21.900]   this is what I think that your combined contact lists and your combined calendars are going to
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.980]   look like. Do you want me to do that for you right now? And then just simply throw away all the
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:32.620]   rest of the stuff you have in July on iCloud later on. It seems like I have sort of like the old
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:38.700]   my old-fashioned manual content style brain seems to have wanted to at least walk through that process,
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:42.780]   even if it did nothing, just so I could say, okay, at some point I clicked a button that said,
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:46.460]   here is what you're going to do and here's how life is going to change after you click this button.
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:53.180]   Provided it doesn't really touch your data so that all your data is in in violet.
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:41:00.780]   But if you've tried to search for duplicates in a dressbook or in iTunes, you know that Apple
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:05.580]   doesn't do a particularly good job of locating duplicates. It will certainly say this is a duplicate,
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:12.540]   but when you check things it's not really a duplicate. So yes, it would be great if Apple would sort of
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:17.900]   play the big daddy and hold my hand and just say, look, I'm going to clean up your life,
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:23.260]   push the button, just go away. You don't need to know this person anymore. They're not worthy of
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:31.340]   you, Chris. And then it's fixed. But I think that maybe they're airing on the on the side of safety,
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:37.740]   which is, look, if you want 17 contact cards for you, there must be a reason and we're not going
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:45.500]   to make that judgment. So here. One for each family you have across the globe. But sorry,
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:51.900]   sorry. But yeah, I mean, going back to Adam's article on tidbits, he really pointed out one of
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:56.940]   the scarier problems of iCloud where there was some sort of a problem that caused some,
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:02.220]   I might be misremembering things, but something that was able to propagate to every single,
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:06.620]   but when a problem occurred with one with the instance of the database on iCloud,
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:10.460]   obviously that propagated all the way back down to all every copy of the context,
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:14.460]   every copy of the calendars on every device, which meant that if not for the fact that Adam
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:19.820]   had backups just offsite that couldn't be touched by iCloud, he would have essentially lost everything.
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:25.580]   Is that true, Tonya? Well, I have to confess that although I live in the same house with Adam,
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:33.740]   I have not read his article. But it sounds, it sounds all too likely. And I think it's really
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:39.660]   important to have a backup. And for people who sort of hypothetically have backups or you,
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:47.020]   yes, there's a backup somewhere in Time Machine, something you can in a address book and IKAL on
[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:54.460]   your Mac, go to the File menu, choose Export and just export out the state of your context or calendar
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:43:00.460]   at a particular moment in time. And I think that's an excellent idea right before you
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:05.980]   switch to iCloud just in case you're unhappy with your results and you're not really
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:09.340]   also happy with digging them out of your backup system.
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:15.420]   I think getting back to what Andy was saying about maybe there should have been a migration
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:22.300]   assistant. I think another problem is that Apple, it's great. They introduced so many new
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:28.860]   features. They're keeping iOS very competitive. But I think from the standpoint of end users,
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:33.500]   there's a lot of features to get your HUD around and they don't all work in the same way.
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:41.340]   So for people who've been using iOS and doing a lot of sophisticated thinking and so forth,
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:48.620]   we all know that it's not very surprising that photos have an entirely different conceptual
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:54.940]   way that they're handled in iCloud than contacts do because contacts and photos have never been
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:44:02.060]   handled in the same way. But for someone who's more new to this, maybe they learn how the
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:09.580]   photo stream works, there's nothing to do with how the contacts work. So there's quite a number
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:15.420]   of new features, but learning one doesn't really help you learn the others very well.
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:22.140]   Certainly the re-downloading and automatic downloading of your media that you buy in the
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:28.220]   iTunes Store is another example of a whole chunk of features that don't work like the other features.
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:35.020]   And I think Apple might have been better served by rolling out the features over time,
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:39.660]   maybe in connection with new versions of the applications that they go with,
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:48.860]   instead of just throwing this huge administrative upgrade scenario at users to cope with all it
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:55.980]   once. Does that sound like a good idea to, they did that with Siri, where they took away
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:45:00.780]   a lot of the really cool features out of the third party app before it was acquired by Apple
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:06.460]   and just satisfy themselves with a core nucleus of features that they could really implement well.
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:11.020]   Could you imagine an iCloud that was sort of pared down to just a couple of features that
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:18.620]   would be easily understood, everybody? I think the problem with that is that they with
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:24.620]   Siri, it wasn't replacing anything, it's all new. Now, ignoring the fact that there are people
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:30.460]   who downloaded the standalone Siri app beforehand, but let's just say for the mainstream iOS users,
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:36.140]   they were starting with a brand new type of feature. Or maybe you could say it's replacing
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:42.140]   the voice control, but that was very, very unimpressive. Whereas iCloud needs to replace
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:49.100]   mobile me. That is really, really tough. They sort of painted themselves in a corner with
[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:56.220]   mobile me in hindsight, obviously, where it was not, they didn't just make, it's important to
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:46:01.580]   remember, they didn't just make mobile me free for everybody and say that's our solution for the
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:06.700]   cloud going forward. They said, mobile me wasn't good enough, we've got to do something new.
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:11.660]   But that means, because you're using, most people are using the same ID. So, I don't know that they
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:16.860]   could have done something that was more incremental while still, you kind of, I think they kind of
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:22.060]   needed people to say, when you're ready to switch for mobile me, you're switching. And it's all at
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:29.100]   once. Because I don't know how else they would keep the same ID for two different systems where
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:33.340]   the other, the old system could handle that. Here's the analogy I can think of. And I think it
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:38.700]   I think it applies to Apple, and I think it applies to us, the users. It's on the Pirates of the
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:43.580]   Caribbean ride. And you're going through and when you get to the part where the city is on fire,
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:51.100]   one of the Pirates has got like six hats on his head and all this stolen loot and a treasure
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:57.100]   chest. And he's got one foot on the dock and one in a boat that is, and he's sort of sitting there
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:04.380]   shifty. And it's impressive enough that he's got one foot on the boat. But it's still going to be
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:09.740]   quite a trick you can see for him to get the other foot off land and onto the boat while holding all
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:15.500]   of this loot. I think that's the transition. And I don't know that it could be done any easier.
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:20.460]   Six hats on our head and about to get very, very wet. If there's a better metaphor for the
[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:26.860]   iCloud transition, I don't think I'm capable of producing it. Coming where we go for another
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:31.420]   sponsor right now. But when we come back, we're going to be talking about why 2012 may or may not
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:37.660]   be like 2012, which is a bad joke to make because 2012 was that really, really bad 2009 disaster
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:42.140]   movie starring John Kuzak about the end of the world, which nobody saw, but I couldn't resist the
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:47.980]   why 1984 won't be like that. Well, we'll just skip right over that. Let's hear from Leo with
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:50.060]   news from another great sponsor. Thank you.
[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:54.380]   If I might interrupt one more time, folks, I want to talk a little about carbonite.com. We'll
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:58.780]   get right back to Andy and company in a bit Mac break weekly. But I do want to mention online
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:04.540]   backup. I get calls all the time from family members, from friends and on the radio from people
[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:12.380]   who don't have a backup. You are backing up, right? Right? See what they usually say is my dad said
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:17.900]   this the other day. Oh, I back up whenever I think of it. Once a year, that is not a backup.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:23.260]   It's not how much just thinking about the last time you backed up and how much you've done since
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:27.580]   then. That's what you would lose if your hard drive were to crash. If there were a disaster,
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:32.700]   your house sort of fall over. Do you want to lose that stuff? Those great pictures, the
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:37.420]   financial records, things you've been working on? No, you don't. That's why carbonite.com. Mac
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:42.300]   or PC works great with Lion, by the way. And here's the deal. You don't try it free for two
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:46.860]   weeks. You don't need a credit card. Just my name actually are named Mac break. Try it free for
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:51.260]   two weeks. And you'll see how this works. As soon as you install it, whenever you're online,
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:56.220]   at home, on the road, at Wi-Fi access spot, anywhere, it will be backing up. Just kind of
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:59.820]   continuous backup. So you don't have to remember it. You don't have to say, "When was the last time
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:03.820]   I backed up?" You will always are backed up. And once it does that initial backup, and two weeks
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:09.420]   usually is enough for that, it will keep you backed up forever after 128-bit SSL. So it's secure.
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:15.500]   You can further encrypt if you want total privacy. You're key, not theirs. I can go on and on. I just
[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:19.900]   think the best thing to do is to try this for two weeks. You know, it's also cloud storage.
[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:24.860]   So it's kind of like iCloud, except you have access to this anywhere, anytime on your iPad,
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:28.700]   on your iPhone, on any computer, you log onto your carbonate account, there's your stuff.
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:34.540]   Here's the best part. Price $49 a month for unlimited backup, everything on your internal drive.
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:41.260]   Unlimited. And if you use a Mac break when you sign up to buy it, you get 14 months with the price
[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:50.540]   of 12. Carbonite.com off-site automatic backup with cloud storage for $49. I'm sorry, $59,
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:55.980]   less than $5 a month. Such a good deal. Give it a try today. Carbonite.com, use the offer code
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:59.660]   MacBreak, if you will. Now back to MacBreak weekly.
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:06.460]   Yeah, just like in a good like a dictatorship, every single broadcast needs to begin at end with
[00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:11.020]   hail glorious leader, lover of us all, almost every tech podcast should begin it end with
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:15.820]   pack up your data. Please back up your data. Don't wind up like I did back up your data.
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:22.540]   I remember before switching iOS 5, it was like, it's sort of like when you've unplugged the
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:27.900]   toaster, you need to stick your the fork into the toaster to get out the bagel, but you see
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:31.980]   the unplugged toaster, but you're like, there's got to be a way I can still get electrocuted by this.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:36.940]   And so not only did I back, I must have done like two separate backups, one of which I put on a flash
[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:41.500]   drive and removed from the machine, because I've been using developer stuff for like months and
[00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:44.860]   months and months. And I knew that nothing could kill it if it was like the backup was on another
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:48.860]   file, but still I was like, how do we just have a flash drive with all our contacts that we've
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:52.220]   been building over the past eight or nine years? Would that make us happy? Yes, it would then.
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:58.460]   Let's do that. I remember you remember years ago, there was a I'm remembering this vaguely,
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:06.860]   but there was an amacos 10 installer bug that could do something to external drives that were
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:14.060]   plugged in, like FireWire USB. And I that had never occurred to me before that a bug might
[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:18.300]   affect that. So I remember I remembered, Oh my God, every time I've ever done any kind of upgrade,
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:23.820]   I've still had my backup drive plugged in to the computer. So now whenever I upgrade the OS,
[00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:28.460]   I make sure that the actual physical connection between the not just unmount it,
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:34.460]   don't just unmount it from the desktop. Take the plug in. Yeah, you see that you never you never
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:39.340]   know whether the God of the day is the New Testament God who loves you and wants to forgive you for
[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:44.220]   everything or the Old Testament God who just has this big wall of flood waters and just
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:49.820]   picking a target with this with this point and shoot interface. Speaking of biblical disasters,
[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:56.620]   2012, a lot of there's a lot of cool stuff happening. According to the all things D site,
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:52:01.660]   it is not too early to start speculating about two iPads being released in 2012.
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:05.660]   They're also speculating about not just the usual incremental updates to lots of different
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:11.100]   pieces of hardware, but also almost like a whole re-conception of the of the entire line.
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:17.020]   We also got two problems that I was at the MacTech conference in LA last week,
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:22.860]   and was talking to lots of developers about lots of things that in my puny little non developer
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:28.060]   mind didn't really understand about things like the new sandboxing rules that Apple's insisting
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:34.700]   for all app store content. Now every single every single app has to make sure that it's
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:40.540]   exists only in its own self controlled little memory box and can't really easily communicate or
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:46.380]   drop data or do a lot of things that developers take for granted. Also getting back to iCloud,
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:51.580]   I was talking to we still haven't seen third party developers who have really figured out
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:55.820]   how they want to implement iCloud in their third party apps, which is why we only see them
[00:52:55.820 --> 00:53:01.580]   in the Apple branded apps. I was entertained by horror story after horror story from developers
[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:07.020]   as they're trying to implement iCloud that usually these stories ended with, and that's how I lost
[00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:12.060]   every bit of test data that I ever had associated with this project and then had to start all over
[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:18.780]   again. So we all spend a lot of time worrying about not only what we're going to be writing
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:23.180]   about in 2012, but all the tech support we're going to have to do for all of our friends and
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:28.140]   family in 2012. Is anybody else really really worried about this? I think I want to start
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:32.460]   off with John because you usually have the right attitude about this sort of stuff.
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:40.540]   Yeah, I think so. And you know, I just continuing that metaphor of the pirate with one foot on the
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:45.020]   dock and the boat. And there's so many of these little things. It is so much moving at once. And
[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:51.980]   you know, so obviously, unsurprisingly, Apple's own apps are adopting some of this stuff first.
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:54:00.140]   Like the iWork apps on iOS do documents in the cloud now, and you don't, you know,
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:06.220]   doesn't seem like a lot of, I'm not aware of that many other apps that have the documents in the
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:11.100]   cloud thing set up. But the big hole in the picture, of course, is that the Mac versions
[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:16.780]   don't support it yet. Why not? That disappointed the hell out of me.
[00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:21.340]   The first time I was expecting because we're all, I think all of us had the developed,
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:25.180]   most of us had the developer code. And so we're just waiting for that moment that we were all
[00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:29.260]   sure was going to happen in August when Apple flips some sort of switch, and we can finally see
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:33.820]   the entire light show. And then when all the lights came up, it's oh, by the way, if you want to
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:37.180]   move documents in and out of your Mac OS device, you're going to have to use a web app.
[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:40.620]   Okay. That's not really what you're talking about a few months ago, was it?
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:45.100]   Right. It's absolutely, you know, it really does seem crazy where if you've started something on
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:49.660]   your iPad and then you want to keep working on it on your Mac, you're logging into iCloud.com
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:57.820]   and a web browser navigating to it and downloading a copy. But on the other hand, I realized I thought
[00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:03.260]   about this just with iWork is that the file formats are not exactly the same. You know,
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:07.980]   the iOS versions of those apps use a different file format than the Mac version. It's sort of
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:13.260]   like the iOS versions are a subset of the Mac feature sets for numbers and pages and keynote.
[00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:20.540]   Presumably with documents in the cloud, they're going to have to get in sync because it's no longer
[00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:27.180]   making copies and saving copies and a sort of networked base equivalent of the old sneaker net
[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:30.700]   where you would save copies to floppy disks and move them around from machine to machine.
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:35.340]   When the truth is in the cloud, it's got to be one or the other.
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:42.060]   So I have no idea what they're doing. They've been dead silent. I mean, I don't even see
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:47.500]   unsourced rumors on any of the sites saying what's going on with the Mac versions of iWork
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:55.260]   and documents in the cloud. But that's a friendly tech support situation I am absolutely not looking
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:56:01.580]   forward to. As somebody who says, "Well, I spent 17 hours working on my
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:07.820]   keynote slide deck. Where did it go?" Yeah, that was one of the worst case scenarios that I've
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:11.740]   been looking for the name. Unfortunately, I couldn't find it. Very nice, very nice
[00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:17.420]   prezo at MacTech last week where I will look that up and I will tweet this guy's name because he
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:22.140]   has an upcoming book on iOS development. And he was telling me about how easy it is to
[00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:30.780]   screw things up by just not being so diligent about keeping track of what versions of which
[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:37.740]   app created which document. So he outlined a scenario which, let's say you have a word processor,
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:43.260]   1.0, and then you've about a four or five months later, you release 1.5 and you've improved the file
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:49.980]   format a little bit for whatever reason. Now you've got a user who has a version 1.0 document
[00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:55.740]   on their iPhone, but they upgraded 1.5 on the iPad. It's iCloud enabled. And so when this person
[00:56:55.740 --> 00:57:03.900]   edits the same document on the iPad, iCloud now has the 1.5 version, the 1.0 edition on the iPhone
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:07.980]   says, "Oh, I should update this file," and now has a file on its hands that it doesn't know how to
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:12.140]   deal with. Not only that, but maybe it doesn't even know that it does know how to deal with and
[00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:17.260]   start spraying data in bad locations. It then sinks all the way back up to iCloud. And now this
[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:23.900]   absolutely corrupted and unopenable by any hand of man or God file now replaces every copy of this
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:30.140]   file in existence. And given that at the time I was about four hours away from delivering a
[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:34.940]   presentation that had taken me about seven hours to put together over over two weeks,
[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:38.540]   I could see myself being a very unhappy person and had that happen to me.
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:46.300]   So here's the way to think about that, I think, is, and talking about this shift and the way that
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:52.620]   a lot of us aren't really, we're just feeling like we're on an unsteady ground, is that traditionally
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:57.340]   native apps, whether they're running on your Mac, on your Windows machine, or your phone or
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:07.740]   whatever, native apps used local storage as the truth. And web apps, which were in a browser window,
[00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:16.540]   used the cloud, some kind of storage out there on a web server where you loaded the web page as the
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:24.060]   primary data storage. And where Apple is clearly going, and I think you could say Amazon is too
[00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:32.220]   with the Kindle in the fire, is to something where that association isn't true. You've got
[00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:39.420]   native apps, but they're using the cloud as the primary storage. But you see now, when you run
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:43.580]   into these things and you think about your scenario, you outlined as perfect example,
[00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:53.100]   of why the cloud came to us first through browser-based web apps, because then whoever's running it,
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:59.980]   like let's say in the case of Google Docs and a spreadsheet, if Google changes the format
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:06.860]   and it adds a new feature to what you can do in a Google Doc spreadsheet, every time you go to
[00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:13.900]   Google Docs, you're getting the app, again, because it's all coming down over the HTTP into your web
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:21.420]   browser each time. You can't have an old version of the software that's trying to read a new version
[00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:28.380]   of the data because they're sort of intermingled together inextricably. But that's definitely a
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:33.660]   problem that, and I'm not quite sure what the solution is, where if you've still got native apps
[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:37.100]   and you can have an old version of the app on one device and a new version on another,
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:44.860]   that seems like a dilemma. >> That's a big dilemma. I've been seeing this a lot. Actually,
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:51.660]   I have a 12-year-old son. He's in seventh grade, and this year, he gets extra credit if he submits
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:58.220]   his homework in Google Docs, and he's been doing quite a lot of assignments online, and for him,
[00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:02.540]   he never knows what computer he's going to use. It could be a computer at home,
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:07.100]   ideally not his, because his is the oldest, so he likes to use the newer ones. It could be a
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:11.740]   Windows machine at school. It could be a Mac at school. It could be at his grandparents' house.
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:17.020]   He doesn't even know. He has no control, in fact, over what computer he uses. But boy, he has to
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:23.740]   finish his homework. So for mobile people and for younger people who are being asked to do a lot
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:31.020]   more online, what John was describing, where the whole thing is in the cloud, makes a huge amount
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:38.940]   of sense. I do think that Apple has a dilemma with the versioning of the different programs,
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:46.780]   and also a dilemma with the features. So the whole thing with a say you're making a keynote
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:53.420]   presentation on your Mac, you don't want to just, when you open it up on your iPad, for instance,
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:01:00.140]   your fonts may change. That's not so great. Pages on the Mac has many more features than
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:09.020]   pages on your iPad. So they have the dilemma of either having one application with one feature set
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:14.700]   that runs on different devices with vastly different screen sizes and typing environments,
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:22.380]   or they have to figure out how to retain features and make a fluid experience for people moving
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:32.780]   around on different devices. This is very challenging, I think.
[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:36.860]   I finally found that the name, Richard Warren is a guy who gave that presentation. He has a
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:43.420]   really cool blog at FreelanceMedScience.com, and he talks about some of the stuff in his blog posts.
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:48.860]   But Chris, we haven't heard from you yet. Are you just so catatonic with fear that you've
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:51.820]   locked up, or are you a little bit more mellow about this?
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:57.020]   Well, actually, I wanted to speak to sandboxing because for me that's more of a concern.
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:02.060]   Because I have talked to some developers about it, and I'd like your take on that as well,
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:07.660]   that some who I've spoken to who've been dealing with the sandboxing issue have said,
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:13.340]   if we want to stay on the App Store, we're going to have to remove features from our applications
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:19.580]   to make this work to conform to Apple's requirements. And the other day, I tweeted, "Okay, well,
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:25.180]   if this is the case, what problem do you have leaving the Mac App Store?" And nothing but dollar
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:30.300]   signs came up. They said, "We make decent money from the Mac App Store, so we can't afford a
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:34.540]   belief, but in order to conform to their standards, we have to take out some of these features."
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:41.100]   Other developers I've spoken to said, "Look, we care more about the integrity of our application,
[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:45.020]   and we want all those features to be in there. So we are going to leave and we're going to go on
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:50.140]   and sell it via our website or perhaps think about doing it."
[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:55.340]   No, if I can shoot pause for a sec. What sort of features were they talking about?
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:03:02.140]   A lot of it was talking to other applications so that they could have some kind of communication
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:07.980]   from this app and be able to send data across. And they felt like we're not going to be able to
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:12.860]   access the tools in order to talk from one app to another because we're both living in our
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:18.380]   virtual world. I may have understood what misunderstood what he was telling me, at least as one specific
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:23.500]   developer. But I would like to hear what you guys have to think. If you've spoken to some
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:27.980]   developers who have expressed this fear, or perhaps this could have been one or two people who
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:34.940]   expectations were maybe a little bit out of line of what the general experience may be.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:41.980]   So it wasn't the author of Instapaper talking about problems where things like persistent local
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:46.860]   storage was going to be more difficult in a sandbox environment than in other environments.
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:49.260]   Or was he talking more about on the iOS platform?
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:58.700]   That was an iOS. I can think of two or three different conversations I've had with developers
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:06.140]   where they're trying to tell me about how I do part of my app requires that I'm able to read
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:10.780]   the state of a printer. So far, Apple hasn't provided me with an API for it. That would allow
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:15.820]   me to do it other than this way I'm doing it through the shell. And they don't understand how
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:20.780]   they could do it within the sandboxing rules. But a lot of it is so inside baseball, but
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:26.060]   everybody seems to be worried about it. Yeah. And I think it's that I think it's a death by a
[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:34.140]   thousand paper cuts type thing where there are thousands, I mean, maybe even more little tiny
[01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:43.660]   things that a Mac app could expect to do on Mac OS X pre-sandboxing that it can no longer do in
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:50.460]   sandboxing. And all the big ones and the obvious ones they're Apple has thought of and has the
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:58.140]   solution for and this is how you do it in a sandbox world. But it's so it's how do you get
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:02.460]   all of them now or all the ones you want to have. And I think the reason you hear a lot of it from
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:09.420]   independent developers is Apple tends to solve the big obvious things, right? You open up a brand
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:13.900]   new Mac and it comes with all sorts of great software, but it's all this universal stuff that
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:19.820]   everybody wants. There's address book where you keep context. Whereas the indie apps that we really
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:26.460]   love are the ones that do really, really obscure things and maybe only one in 10,000 Mac users
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:33.260]   would ever want to use it. But when there's 25, 30, 40 million Mac users, that's a market. And
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:41.180]   the little tiny tricks and utilities that people who listen to Mac break weekly use,
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:45.100]   you never know which of those are doing things that Apple never even thought of. Well, how would
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:52.060]   you do that in the sandbox world? Yeah. Let's go. I want to go to me to go to a break kind of soon,
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:57.980]   but let's at least dip our toe in the water about this fun, fun, irresponsible speculation about
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:05.340]   12 devices. I'm not sure what I feel about two iPads next year, probably the same way that I felt
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:13.820]   about two iPads this year. There's the famous legion of, you want to be part of the legion of
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:17.980]   anonymous, forget about political activism, talk about the people who are the unnamed Asian
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:22.700]   parts suppliers who will tell you about the new high definition iPad screen with two
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:27.180]   backlit illuminators, because the first samples that Apple received, they were they were they
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:31.660]   were fobbed off because they were not up to the exacting standards. The only thing that I've heard
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:35.900]   about that seems really, really like the cool and interesting idea and maybe even likely is the idea
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:43.020]   of a 15 inch MacBook Air, because I had to replace my air this year. Really, my old model was definitely
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:50.220]   end of life. But if I could have if I had if there were a MacBook Air style 15 where I got the full
[01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:55.180]   the full 15 inch screen, I've got enough storage space. I don't have to be in any way
[01:06:55.180 --> 01:07:00.380]   conservative about what what I'm what I'm putting on my on the device. That would have been a cool
[01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:05.980]   thing to own. And I think that Apple's definitely one of wants people to think that thin is now the
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:11.660]   the standard definition of a MacBook these days. What what's everybody else sort of hoping to see
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:20.140]   in 2012? Tonya, let's start with you. You're you're you're on top of everything else. You've got
[01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:24.940]   I'm sure that we all have we all have really interesting and and and intelligent kids.
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:30.300]   I know your kid a little bit better than I know that wrote else's kids. So I can't imagine like
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:34.860]   what you're hoping to see to keep this this this person occupied. So we doesn't like take out a
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:38.220]   soldering gun and start building something beautiful, elegant and incredibly destructive.
[01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:45.340]   Well, Tristan would really like it if there were some new Macintosh's coming into the house
[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:49.900]   because he gets the trickle down. You know, he gets he gets the old the old stuff.
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:08:05.820]   Personally, I I I am so full. I'm so full and so busy with what I've already got from Apple
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:10.620]   that it would be just as happy with me if Apple said, you know what, it's party year. We're not
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:17.260]   putting anything out next year. Everybody get used to what you've got. Enjoy it. Save your money.
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:23.260]   And you know, in December December 1st 2012, we're going to do stuff for you for Christmas.
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:29.500]   Sort of like that you like that year that Amish kids take off to like do the drinking do the
[01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:35.500]   tattooing before they're expected to come back to the brand new like circular glass ring and
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:41.580]   buckle down and create the iPad for right now. What Tristan would love is something along the
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:47.580]   lines of a MacBook Air very small, very light. It's got to be very cheap and he would like to
[01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:56.620]   take it to school because reportedly the Macs at school are slow, but the windows machines at school,
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:01.660]   you can't even start them up because they have to do all this error checking. He would really
[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:06.140]   appreciate something he could stick in his backpack and take to school and his school
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:11.820]   might even let him use it. They've changed their working on changing her policy so you can bring
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:16.780]   a mobile device to school and use it in class. And apparently kids can bring kindles to school
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:23.180]   now as long as they read books on them during English class. So that's what what Tristan like.
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:33.020]   I think we'll have some new iPads next year. Honestly, I'm in my 40s. So this whole thing
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:39.180]   with computers, at this point I feel like we're using miracles in small boxes. So I'm going to be
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:46.300]   prepared to be hopefully delighted by whatever comes out, but I cannot predict. It's all amazing.
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:55.660]   John, we come to expect new iPhone refresh to the iPod's new iPad refresh of the mobile devices,
[01:09:55.660 --> 01:10:00.940]   refreshed iMac. May or may not see a new Mac Pro. What do you think for 2012 or hardware?
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:06.860]   Well, I think that with the Mac books, I think that this is one of those rare cases where
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:12.380]   let's not overthink it. Apple actually told us exactly what they're going to do is when the
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:19.020]   current generations of the heirs were introduced, I think it was last year's back to the Mac event,
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:25.580]   but Steve Jobs literally said this is what we think is the future of laptop computers.
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:31.020]   And that don't overthink it. All the laptops are going to look like the air. It's just a matter
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:36.460]   of cost. And I think the biggest factor is the cost of SSD storage that it still is really,
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:43.100]   really expensive to get. Even the 256 gig ones are expensive and the 512 ones are really expensive.
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:48.620]   So as soon as the price on those comes down, then I think that the 15 inch MacBook goes air style.
[01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:57.740]   And if I knew that I wanted to use the current 15 inch MacBook Pro and not an air style one with
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:04.620]   maybe less storage, I would buy one today because I don't have any kind of rumors or anything that
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:11.180]   the air style one is coming in the months ahead. But it would shock me if we get to the end of 2012
[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:17.420]   and we don't have one. Apple certainly made a clear statement when they discontinued the
[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:26.060]   MacBook nothing. And essentially I told us that the new $999 Mac is the MacBook Air 11 inch.
[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:31.180]   If you want to spend $999 for a Mac, that's what it is. If you want the default Mac, the new
[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:35.900]   default Mac is the 13 inch MacBook Air. We also have the Pro models, but this really is,
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:40.540]   just as you say, this is the chewy nougat center of the entire MacBook line of the ears.
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:46.940]   Right. It makes very different trade offs. The MacBook Air is a laptop that has very different
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:54.620]   priorities than before. It prioritizes in this and weight and like iOS battery life.
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:12:00.860]   Yeah, I hate it. I mean, I hated to send back the 11 because I took two trips with it and just
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:05.660]   being able to travel with just this tiny little micro bag that has your Mac in it.
[01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:09.820]   After so many days of having to walk through New York after you check out your hotel,
[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:14.140]   but you still got eight hours of conference before you train home. I really wish that I could
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:18.060]   have settled for a MacBook Air, but you're right there. There's some things that are intrinsic to
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:22.620]   a MacBook where if you want more than a piddling amount of storage, you really got to go for a
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:25.340]   MacBook Pro. There's really no way around it for now anyway.
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:34.780]   So with the iPad, I am certain that they want to go retina display, meaning double the number of
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:39.900]   pixels on the exact same size screen. I have no idea though, when that's, I think it's the same
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:44.780]   thing with SSD storage. It's a matter of cost and production. Can they, because they need to,
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:48.860]   you know, it's not enough to be able to say it's possible to make it. They have to make,
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:55.580]   what, 20 million of them a quarter, and it has to be something that you can sell for $4.99.
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:13:02.300]   If it's intended to replace the iPad 2's display at the same price points, like there's no way that
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:07.180]   they can say, "Hey, the iPad 3 has a retina display and the new starting price is $1,500."
[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:17.580]   That doesn't fly. So I don't know. But the digit times, the people, they're the ones who always
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:22.620]   have the, like you said, these crazy Asian supplier sources. And the reports are like half like,
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:26.460]   "Well, that sounds totally credible. That sounds reasonable." And then they always include
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:31.260]   stuff that is like, "What? What are they talking about?" Like this report on the two iPads says
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:38.300]   that Apple is stockpiling millions of, plans to stockpile millions of next generation iPads by the
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:42.940]   end of this year, calendar year. Like by the end of December, they're going to have millions of them
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:49.740]   sitting in warehouses to go on sale in April. And to me, that is like, as an Apple, a follower of
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:53.980]   the company, it's like, "You've got to be kidding me." That, like having anything in a
[01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:59.500]   warehouse is to Tim Cook. That's like Kryptonite to Superman. Like this is the guy who got their
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:06.940]   inventory down to like two or three days. I'm sure that whatever it is, it's, they're going to need
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:13.260]   to have production ready to ramp at an incredible level. But there's no way they're stockpiling
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:19.820]   millions of next generation iPads in a warehouse. I was also wondering about just the idea of them
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:25.340]   locking down the hardware, let's call that. But let's say they started now, so that's
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:29.740]   November, December, January, February, March, April, locking down the hardware six months in advance.
[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:34.220]   Yeah, that doesn't seem right either. It seems to me like Apple tends to keep things
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:39.580]   as agile as possible until the last possible minute. I mean, famously, I mean, everybody
[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:45.260]   knows like with the iPod Touch from about three years ago, where it was supposed to have a camera.
[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:51.420]   And even when the iFixit guys opened it up, there was, behind the case, there's a little slot where
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:57.820]   the camera was supposed to go. For whatever reason, was it cost? Was it production? Was it an engineering
[01:14:57.820 --> 01:15:02.460]   problem? But at very close to the last minute, they said, "Okay, there won't be a camera and we'll
[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:07.580]   seal up the back where the whole for the camera to peek out is going to be." So yeah, I don't buy
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:13.580]   that at all. That's locking into decision six months in advance. Chris, let's hear from you.
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:22.380]   I'm mostly a me too guy on this stuff. What I would like to see personally is a Mac Pro update,
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:29.180]   and I'm not sure we ever will. Because I use one and I've had the same one for about four years now,
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:37.420]   and it's time for an update. And at work, we occasionally get to say, "We need a new computer over here."
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:43.100]   And what we generally do is, and I think this is what Apple's been pushing as well, is the iMac.
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:49.740]   And no, you don't need a Mac Pro anymore. Get an iMac. Well, I have four drives already inside this
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:56.620]   thing. Plus, I've got about another 17 dangling off the side using cables. And I like a big machine
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:16:01.260]   like that that has a lot of internal storage. And an iMac doesn't do that for me. Plus, I have a
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:08.620]   couple of monitors that I prefer to an iMac monitor. So I'm not the perfect person for the iMac.
[01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:13.100]   On the other hand, if we look at the trend that Apple has set the last several years, it really
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:19.900]   is going for that consumer who wants the all-in-one experience and lion is like that, and the iMac
[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:24.780]   has certainly liked that. And I don't know that they're all that enthusiastic about the Mac Pro anymore.
[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:29.340]   So I'd like to see it. I don't think they're going to do them any tower as much as some people would
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:35.740]   like it. I do think if they're going to do the big standalone machine, it's going to be a sizable
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:42.300]   computer. I hope that they do that. So the iPad, one model a year, I don't see why Apple would
[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:48.700]   suddenly do two. Not only do I not know that it's necessary, why couldn't they wait another three
[01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:54.300]   months to release a thing. But I think it would upset Apple's customers who've gone out and purchased,
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:17:01.260]   even if their iPad is five or $600, to have it in your hands for maybe four to six months,
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:05.340]   because you waited a bit. And then suddenly this brand new one with Retina display comes out.
[01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:09.260]   I think that there will be people at the gates with the burning torches and pitchforks.
[01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:14.780]   Yeah, absolutely. Okay, we're going to be back with our tips and picks of the week,
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:17.420]   right after another word from Leo about the Ford Sync.
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:22.940]   Yes, I'm not here. I know this is very confusing because here I am.
[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:30.620]   But I'm coming to you from the future to talk about the future of automotive technology
[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:37.020]   and our barbecues, which are coming up this Sunday, November 13th, and in December, December 4th
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:42.780]   for Ford. First of all, go to Ford.com/technology because there's a list of all the different
[01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:48.540]   technologies. Ford's putting into their new cars, including the app link, Ford Sync with app link.
[01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:52.700]   It's in the 2012 Fiesta. So you've heard me talking about sync before. Sync, you keep your
[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:55.340]   hands in the wheel, your eyes on the road, you press the button on the steering wheel, it goes,
[01:17:55.340 --> 01:18:00.060]   boom. And you can say things like set the cabin temperature to 73 degrees. Where's the nearest
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:07.740]   gas station? Take me home. What's the traffic like? You can also say things like play Bob Dylan.
[01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:12.940]   But now with app link, you can also talk to your smartphone. So I use my smartphone. It's already
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:18.380]   paired via Bluetooth A2DP on the stereo Bluetooth. So when I get in the car, for instance, the song
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:22.380]   I was playing when I got out of the car starts up again. But then you press the button and you
[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:28.540]   can say Pandora. And if you have Pandora on your phone, Android or iPhone, Pandora launch it,
[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:33.340]   Blackberry 2 with the latest OS, you could say play my classic rock station and play my Bob Dylan
[01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:38.380]   station. Thumbs up or thumbs down on songs. You can bookmark songs for purchase later.
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:42.860]   That's just Pandora. It also supports Stitcher. So you can listen to this show. You say,
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:49.020]   play Mac, break weekly 110 and it'll play it. Open beaks, it'll read you tweets and timelines,
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:53.980]   all that stuff. This is just the beginning because app developers are increasingly making their apps
[01:18:53.980 --> 01:19:00.860]   to work with Fort Stinc. I think this is the best way to add features to your car all the time.
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:05.100]   It's just one more way for it is really taking automotive technology into the 21st century.
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:09.740]   Ford.com/technology to find out more. Things like the MyKey for teenagers,
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:14.940]   the Wi-Fi access, all that stuff. And don't forget to go to twit.tv, click the barbeque link
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:18.940]   and sign up for our barbeque. I have a feeling Sunday is sold out, but check anyway.
[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:21.900]   We're going to have a tent. We're going to have the Ford vehicles. We're going to have great
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:25.980]   food. You can watch Twit. You can watch our new gaming show, Veronica and Brian of our gaming
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:30.780]   show will be there. So will Tom. I know Tom will be there. Eileen, you're going to cut. Of course
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:36.860]   you're there. You have to do Twit. I'll be there. Sarah says she's coming. So we're going to have
[01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:41.500]   a it's going to be a lot of fun. I ask cannot be there. Isn't that funny? He lives like a block
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:46.540]   from here. I think he's going out of town or something. Anyway, Ford.com/technology, sign up for the
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:53.340]   barbeque at twit.tv and we'll see you here Sunday or December 4th and make sure you thank Ford.
[01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:58.060]   When you see him, when you see Mr. Ford say thank you for supporting Mac Break Weekly. We really
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:05.180]   appreciate it. We now return you to Mac Break Weekly. Guys, I have been informed that federal
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:10.860]   regulators have shut down the barbeque. We have for oversubscription, there are the 50 people,
[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:15.740]   50 people have already signed up. So you're still welcome to barbecue that weekend, but you're going
[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:21.500]   to have to do that as an independent entity at your own home or place of worship. Another programming
[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:26.860]   note, I've decided that we usually have Leo pre-record the commercials because he's so much
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:31.180]   better at reading them than I am. But it makes me feel a little bit adequate that I'm hosting the
[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:35.740]   show and I don't have that huge like wing back leather thing behind me. So the next time I'm
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:40.060]   hosting, I'm definitely like building like some sort of a plywood like scrim or something. So I
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:45.980]   just drop that behind me. I feel as though it'll give me that level of authority that my personality
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:52.620]   by no way commands in and of itself. So let's get back into tips. Chris, do you have an iOS tip
[01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:58.300]   for us today? I do. And this is related to something else that I'm going to do a little bit later.
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:07.820]   And that is GarageBand 1.1 has just come out for iOS and it works on one of these things here.
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:12.860]   And so what are the features that you may not have heard about and I'll be talking about some of
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:21.180]   the others later is that you now have the ability in GarageBand 1.1 to import sound files to GarageBand.
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:27.900]   And the way you do this is you connect your device to your Mac or, well not PC.
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:34.700]   You bring it up and you select it in iTunes source list and then you choose apps and then
[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:39.260]   you go down to the list of apps that you can add files to when you find GarageBand there.
[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:45.260]   You select it. You can drag sound files a variety of types. So these can be AAC, MP3,
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:52.780]   AIFF, Wave, Apple Losses files. We'll go in there, CAF files. We'll go in. And once you do that and
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:59.660]   then sync the thing over that now you have within Apple's, when you choose a loop,
[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:04.460]   I think I could show it here. I'll go to my tracks window.
[01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:15.580]   Go into loops and you'll see that you have, let's see, I'm just reflecting the outside on our,
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:20.940]   all right, okay, well anyway, there it is, okay. So if you look over into the loops list,
[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:26.460]   you see that there are now two entries. So instead of just being Apple loops, you also have
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:33.180]   the loops that you've imported. So the usefulness of this is that in the past,
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:39.260]   GarageBand for iOS was a very cool application, but the loops that you were offered were pretty
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:43.900]   limited. Now there is no limitation to the loops you can bring in. So these ones, for example,
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:50.300]   came from a program called ACID and they have some terrific loops that I can easily import now
[01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:55.260]   and I can create my own on my Mac or somewhere else if I want my own drum loops, keyboard loops,
[01:22:55.260 --> 01:23:01.980]   vocal loops, if I like, I can then import those into GarageBand for iOS and use those to build
[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:06.220]   up compositions within the program. Again, not a feature that Apple's talking about very much,
[01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:10.220]   but incredibly powerful for musicians who want a broader palette to pick from.
[01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:17.260]   Coolness. We actually, I'm going to add one quick iOS tip that I kind of like. It was this via
[01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:23.660]   an email and I have, where is it? Okay, I don't know if I have the, I will thank the person who sent
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:28.220]   this basically with existential love because I'm afraid I don't have your name in front of me here,
[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:32.700]   but he's talking about how, everybody's from Michael. Thank you. Thank you, Michael.
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:38.540]   Eileen, was it's last name, Michael? I don't think we had a last name. I think it was email
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:45.100]   and then it's a dash, Michael. So like share, just Michael, just like the dude, he's the Michael.
[01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:51.580]   But he is the dude because he got up with a cool idea where everyone's familiar with like,
[01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:57.340]   if you lose your iOS device or for stolen use, you can use find my phone, find my pad to get it
[01:23:57.340 --> 01:24:04.140]   back. He's talking, he also suggests that you use restrictions via parental controls to make sure
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:09.500]   that you can't turn off, find my iPhone and some of these other like tracking features because if
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:14.460]   someone gets it and they're not, they're not just one of these people who, gosh, I'm going to spend
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:17.660]   two days trying to find this person, but if I can't find them in the next two hours, I'm definitely
[01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:21.340]   going to keep this for myself. They might start, well, you know what, people are going to try to find
[01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:24.700]   me with this. So I'm going to definitely turn off the find my iPhone feature. I'm also going to try
[01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:29.420]   to wipe all the data so I can sell it to someplace else. But if you turn on, go to the parental
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:34.700]   controls tab of preferences on your iOS device, you can actually set restrictions so that you
[01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:39.660]   can't actually turn those features off unless it's you yourself who does it. So that might buy you a
[01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:44.140]   little bit of extra time to track it down or at least make sure that this person doesn't try to
[01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:48.700]   fob it off on somebody else anytime soon. That was a really cool thing. Kind of obvious only to only
[01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:54.540]   when somebody points it out to you later on. So Michael, great, great tip. Tanya, do you have,
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:59.900]   oh, I'm sorry, Michael Ball is his name. Michael Ball, thank you, Michael Ball. Tanya, do you have a
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:09.020]   macOS tip for us? Yes, my macOS tip for today is dealing with the resume feature in Lion. So in
[01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:14.780]   Lion, if you're running Lion, you've probably noticed that when you close an application and then
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:22.300]   reopen it, whatever windows were open, they come right back and they're open again when you relaunch
[01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:28.220]   the app. So that's a great new feature. Hopefully it's convenient for you. You don't ever have to
[01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:33.980]   remember to close windows. They just come back. But if you don't like it, you can turn it off
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:40.300]   globally and that's in the system preferences in the general pane. But some people want a more
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:48.780]   nuanced option. They want to control it on a per app basis or a per launch basis. So the easy part
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:53.820]   of this tip is to remember that if you don't like the way you've set it up in system preferences,
[01:25:53.820 --> 01:26:00.860]   you can press option while you quit an app and that will reverse the normal behavior. So if you
[01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:07.980]   normally would have your windows all reopening, if you press option while you quit, the next time
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:14.700]   you open the app, they won't all reopen. So that's great. But if you want to go even further and get
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:20.780]   more complicated, there are actually third party utilities that you can download and then you can
[01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:27.100]   set whether an app resumes its windows or not on a per app basis. So I've been hearing very nice
[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:36.140]   things about a utility called Resuminator and also the sort of long time favorite funky Mac utility
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:41.020]   Tinker tool does this does this for you. There may be some other ones out there as well, but those
[01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:48.140]   are two that I can say I've heard from people who've had success with them. And that is my tip.
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:53.260]   Cool. Yeah, I think that for both professional and amateur IT people, someone asked you a question
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:56.940]   on how to do something. The default answer is, oh, you should download an app called Tinker
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:01.260]   tool. I believe it has that function because chances are you have no idea, but chances are it'll do
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:05.900]   whatever it is this person is asking to do. Yeah, or they'll get so distracted by all the other
[01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:11.020]   options. I forget what they're asking you about. Wow, there's a way to suspend sleep resume on my
[01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:17.260]   MacBook. Now I don't even care that my printer doesn't work anymore. Okay, now let's go to picks
[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:21.500]   of the week. Let's start off with Mr. Gruber, whether it is your pick of the week for iOS or
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:26.220]   macOS or hardware. I pick of the week. Look at I'm falling into darkness here. Exactly. You're
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:31.420]   you're sleeping into slumber. You're getting very dreamy and very sleepy. I need daylight savings
[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:39.900]   time. No, my pick of the week is a I believe $1.99 all whopping $2 an app for the iPhone called
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:50.140]   the amazing typewriter. And this app, an email from from the author, Mr. Devin Chalmers described
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:58.220]   it to me as as the most cutting edge typographical system currently available for any computer anywhere.
[01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:04.300]   And I have to concur with his assessment. This app completely recreates the experience of using a
[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:11.100]   manual typewriter typing on index cards. Even the carriage and even like the hammers hitting the
[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:17.660]   paper. Brad's sounds that's that's dedication. Right. And just one of my favorite little details
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:24.380]   of this, surely all of us have seen these sort of grungy typewriter fonts, where it isn't just looking
[01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:32.300]   like courier. It looks like it was printed on an old school crummy ribbon. But he goes so far,
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:37.100]   the app goes so far that if you type the same letter two times in a row, it doesn't look distressed
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:42.860]   in the same way. Like there's I don't know if it's completely dynamic or if there's just a whole
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:48.540]   bunch of alternate glyphs for each letter. But if you keep typing asterisk, asterisk, asterisk,
[01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:53.740]   you don't get the same exact looking glyph each time. It's just it looks real. It looks like you're
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:58.700]   getting a differently messed up font each time. You get to share your creations if you choose.
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:06.940]   You know, and you either see this type of app and you've already bought it or you're thinking,
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:10.620]   I'm nuts. Why would I want to buy this thing? But what I love about it is just the word that
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:17.420]   comes to mind is whimsy. And to me, it was always what's best about Apple's platforms. It's that
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:21.500]   the original Mac in the 80s was the computer where you could go to get a talking moose.
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:27.340]   The Mac was the computer where you could install something to get Oscar the grout to pop out of
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:34.300]   your trash can when you emptied the trash. And to me, the amazing typewriter is just like a modern
[01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:38.460]   equivalent of that sort of thing. And I'm embarrassed to admit how much time I've wasted.
[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:46.060]   Now I can only have one follow up question. And this is this is what will elevate this app from
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:52.300]   cool to super hyper cool. Does it have the number one on the keyboard? Or do you have to type a
[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:57.900]   lowercase L for it? I believe it has the number one on the keyboard. But that's still well,
[01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:01.820]   room for improvement. That's something it's good to leave yourself a little bit of a goal as a
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:06.060]   developer so that you can give a reward for earlier adopters when you give the free update later on.
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:09.420]   All right, that's a great that's a great suggestion.
[01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:15.100]   My dad's type I learned how to write on my dad's typewriter. And I never figured out, well,
[01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:20.940]   what's what's the big problem of having a number one? Is it where the manufacturing margins so slim
[01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:26.140]   that they said we can afford to have 38 keys, but 39 would absolutely bust the Royal typewriter company?
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:32.540]   I learned to type on a typewriter that had had no one. And as we learned to type on a very similar
[01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:39.420]   we were up with all the number one, then we liked it. That's for more information that's at
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:45.180]   type written dot dormouse dot com. Unfortunately, that's going to be the next $2 I spent because
[01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:49.660]   yeah, that is it looks like perfect execution. It's one thing just to have a typewriter font,
[01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:53.500]   but to have the carriage just going left and right, that's just too damn cool.
[01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:59.020]   Let's go ahead to Chris. What is your pick of the week as if you had not pre announced it already?
[01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:08.060]   Yes, I have pre announced it. It is the it's GarageBand 1.1. It's it looks a little like that.
[01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:15.980]   Not prior to the show, I said that I would be pointing people's requests in GarageBand.
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:20.140]   And but because of licensing issues, I can only play one note for me.
[01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:24.780]   So unfortunately, all of these songs have they have be flat in common. So
[01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:31.980]   there you go, folks. So that's that takes care of the 25 requests I had prior to that. Although
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:34.060]   somebody did want to hear some blues.
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:36.060]   So.
[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:52.300]   So I really am playing this.
[01:31:52.300 --> 01:32:00.620]   I mean, it's not do you. It's it's it's it's sickens me, Chris, because I've been like sort of a
[01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:04.860]   very, very amateur keyboard player almost my entire life. And it's sick as me that you just
[01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:08.540]   got to screw around sort of this keyboard for a demo. And that's better than anything I've
[01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:12.700]   ever been able to do with about 10 hours for the practice a week. That's then then again,
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:17.740]   I can't play the ukulele to save my life. So we all have our specific talent. So anyway,
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:24.060]   what's what's what's cool about this other than the fact that I could do that is as I showed
[01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:30.460]   before, it works now on the iPhone and the iPod touch. It also allows you to enter custom
[01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:35.420]   chord configurations. So if you're using an auto instrument, and this is where you could pull up
[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:41.900]   a guitar or a bass or a keyboard and you know nothing, all you want to do is get some kind of
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:46.540]   accompaniment. You can switch on these little audio accompaniment things and you can tap on them.
[01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:52.540]   But prior to this, they had a few musicians out there. They had just the diatonic chords of the scale
[01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:57.100]   with the flat seven, which most people are going, I have no idea what that means. But for musicians,
[01:32:57.100 --> 01:33:04.380]   you know, now if we want to use those fancy schmancy chords, so if we want a sharp 11, or you want a
[01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:10.140]   C major seven with a flat nine, you can do that. You can dial in custom chord configurations.
[01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:16.620]   And it also works across instruments. So if on the smart keyboard, I enter one of these chords,
[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:23.660]   and then I move to the guitar, that chord will appear on the guitar as well. So I can use better
[01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:28.620]   and more interesting chords. For normal people who aren't musicians, there's an advantage to this,
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:33.660]   that if you have a songbook, oftentimes you'll find chord headings at the top of the page.
[01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:38.620]   You can now enter those chords using this custom configuration and you can generate
[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:43.020]   an accompaniment that's very much like what you have in your songbook. And then with one finger,
[01:33:43.020 --> 01:33:48.300]   you can pick up the melody on whatever instrument you happen to play. It also supports three, four,
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:54.540]   and six, eight times signature. So three, four is for waltzes. Six, eight is more for that annoying
[01:33:54.540 --> 01:34:01.020]   Elizabethan kind of stuff that people played, you know, 40 years ago. Although those, that's not
[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:06.700]   reflected in the loop. So you do not get three, four on six, eight content in loops. That's only
[01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:13.980]   four, four still. There are new quantization settings, which means this is imposing a rhythmic grid on
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:18.860]   your music. So anything that's off gets sucked into that grid. So if you're a terrible drummer as I am,
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:27.660]   you get solid drumming plus if you then impose either triplet or swing quantization, it gets kind
[01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:34.700]   of that scooby-doo thing that you're so fond of. Also, you can send out uncompressed audio and
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:39.820]   if you're using one of these things, if you just record a track and it's no good and you don't like
[01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:48.140]   it, shake it and it undoes your recording. So don't dance while composing. It's backwards.
[01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:52.940]   That's all the stuff you're talking about. I mean, you're sort of used to this cheap little app
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:57.020]   being something you can sort of noodle around with. It's almost as if Apple thinks this is a real
[01:34:57.020 --> 01:35:03.020]   music tool. I thought I've always thought it was a real music tool. I think it's a fabulous
[01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:07.740]   recording device. The fact is I talked about in the hint that you can now bring in your own loops,
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:15.580]   makes this even more powerful. The one thing I regret is that on this device and on the iPod
[01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:21.660]   touch, you cannot plug in an external controller because it doesn't support the iPad camera connection
[01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:27.900]   kit. So you're really stuck with entering things on this. And it's not so bad if you're using the
[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:34.700]   bass of the guitar, but the keyboard is only one octave and it's pretty tiny. So you have to really,
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:40.940]   you know, get some serious grip sandpaper and file down your fingers to little points so that
[01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:46.140]   you can play a little more accurately on it. But for five bucks, I think this is the most impressive
[01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:52.300]   music app ever created. Just one more. I'm so fascinated by this. One more quick question.
[01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:56.380]   Why do you think they actually did such a full version of GarageBand for the iPhone? Because it's
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:36:04.060]   not the, an iPad, you can still sort of noodle things out. But that's my, not being a musician,
[01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:09.740]   my first reaction was this is Apple saying, here's what our phone can do. Can your Android phone do
[01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:15.580]   an app like this either? Didn't think so. $99 for the iPhone 4. Lineforms to the left.
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:21.660]   Yeah, I am so impressed by Apple's music team. These are the people that've created Logic and
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:28.300]   Logic Pro and GarageBand. I think they did it just because they are so enthusiastic about the kind
[01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:33.180]   of work they do that they said, you know, we can bring this power to people in their pocket. So
[01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:37.580]   when you're on a plane, yes, you can do this on an iPad, but not everybody has iPads and that's
[01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:43.100]   not always convenient to use it. But to pull out one of these things, plus this works on an iPod
[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:49.260]   Touch 3 on up and on the iPhone 3GS on up, to be able to noodle this thing out of your pocket and
[01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:53.660]   play with it is, is just so impressive. And I just have to think that they thought,
[01:36:53.660 --> 01:37:00.460]   let's give this to people and see just how awesome Apple is. And you would think it would be difficult
[01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:05.820]   to navigate, but it really isn't. They've replaced a lot of the functions with popover menus so that
[01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:12.620]   you can access things pretty easily. Again, I prefer the iPad implementation, but this is pretty darn
[01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:15.020]   good. And it's universal, so it works on both.
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:20.620]   Hello, Victory Lab for Apple iOS development. Tony, what's your pick?
[01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:29.580]   Hi, so to explain my pick, I want to go back way earlier in this show to say that when I said I
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:35.340]   was working on a book and I was resetting iCloud over and over, that was because I'm working on a
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:40.940]   book where I need to compare and contrast all the different ways of getting data onto an iPad.
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:50.220]   But my pick of the show is actually a book that exists now. It's an ebook. And it is,
[01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:56.300]   I'm going to have to get this lined up here better. It is Take Control of iCloud.
[01:37:56.300 --> 01:38:04.780]   And it's written by Joe Kistle, who writes from Paris. And it's just fun to think of someone
[01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:09.660]   writing a book while they're in Paris, eating their croissants and cheese and chocolate and wine.
[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:16.540]   And basically, this book certainly has brought a lot of feedback from people about their
[01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:22.460]   upsetness about how difficult it is to upgrade all your stuff to iCloud. But the book walks you
[01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:29.660]   through everything you need to have ready to go before you upgrade, what to expect when you
[01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:36.220]   upgrade, what to do about your Apple ID situation, in case you've got 27 different Apple IDs,
[01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:44.380]   how to use everything. And it gets really into a lot of how to actually use the iCloud
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:50.140]   web apps as they exist on the website and the features that are available up on the web. And
[01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:56.060]   it gives you a little bit of comparison with how the web apps differ from the iOS apps and the
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:39:04.380]   macOS 10 apps. And it's sort of the usual Joe Kistle, very informative, very detailed, very friendly
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:15.660]   book. And I myself edited it. We actually ended up doing kind of a 72 hour marathon to finish,
[01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:23.500]   where Joe was writing in Paris. I was editing in Upstate New York. And I had kind of a assistant
[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:31.500]   technical advisor person editing over in California. So the manuscript never slept, but we did.
[01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:39.980]   So the book's been out for about three weeks. And we have issued a 1.0.1 update. Since that
[01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:45.820]   update, it seems to be stable and working well for people. So if you feel like you want someone
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:50.060]   to hold your hand through this whole iCloud process, I feel that I can recommend the book.
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:56.860]   And they can get that from take control books or any other outlets. I always go to your regular
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:40:03.820]   website when I buy the stuff. They can go to www.takecontrolbooks.com. That's the best way to buy it,
[01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:08.140]   because then you go through our shopping cart. We know who you are. We can get you updates.
[01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:13.740]   You can get discounts on multiple book buys the whole deal. But the book is available in the
[01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:19.420]   iBook store. It's available through the O'Reilly store. If it's not available on the Kindle,
[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:29.020]   it will be any second now. And so you can shop at your store of choice. It comes in a PDF format,
[01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:34.540]   but we will give you. There's no problem. You can have an ePub or a Moby, so you can load it on
[01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:41.740]   whatever Eva greeter you want. Very, very cool. My pick of the week is, I mentioned earlier about
[01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:45.420]   this idea of something, an idea that's so obvious that someone has to do it before you recognize
[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:51.820]   how brilliant and obvious it is. So this is the MacBook power brick that you all know and love.
[01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:57.580]   You also know that this the spade plug has come off at the end so that you can either substitute
[01:40:57.580 --> 01:41:04.780]   a long cord or another international adapter. So the guys, people at a company called 12 South
[01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:13.740]   came up with this little product right here. This is a 10 watt iPad iPhone charger that has its own
[01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:21.660]   little USB connector and it snaps right onto the end of this. So now what you have is a unified
[01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:27.500]   there you go. What you now have is a unified MacBook
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:34.860]   iPad iPhone charger, two independent power supplies that can charge both of these things at the same
[01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:41.420]   time. But now you only have one thing in your bag. Also, it means that when you go for a trip or
[01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:45.260]   you just go off to the coffee shop, but you've forgotten to recharge your iPhone, it's not like
[01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:52.220]   you will have left your house without this charger. This is a you just see this on the on the charger
[01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:58.620]   and you realize that this is an exceptionally good idea. I also like the idea that it's red
[01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:03.020]   so that everybody else can see this power brick inside the charger and say goodness,
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:08.780]   great gravy. What a clever idea that is who is who I'd like the cut of the man's jib that decided to
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:16.140]   purchase this wonderful accessory. And it is $39.99, I believe you can get it from 12 South.com.
[01:42:16.140 --> 01:42:24.380]   And it's actually a little bit extra Apple connection. It's a guy Kawasaki has been working
[01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:28.380]   with the company. He was the guy who said, no, no, no, no, no, no, you can't make this thing
[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:34.060]   white. You have to make it red so everybody sees exactly how cool this is. So yeah, this is not
[01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:39.180]   this fight to say this has not been off of my charger since I got it last week. And yes, it
[01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:43.980]   does mean that almost every every place you go, if there's an opportunity to charge your iPad,
[01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:48.220]   you will. And so I've never been caught with 5% iPad charge on a plane ever again.
[01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:54.940]   So, okay, I guess that is Mac break weekly for this week. Let me go around the horn and thank
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:43:00.860]   all my friends who are nice enough to come in and do the show with me Chris Breen of Mac world.
[01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:08.540]   What would you like to plug? Oh, let's see. I just go with world peace, a piece on earth,
[01:43:08.540 --> 01:43:12.620]   love, life and happiness to everybody. Or if you want to plug a website, you can do that too.
[01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:19.020]   No, something that will make me money. So, Mac will come, of course. And then my lion essential
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:23.660]   training for from Linda.com came out a couple of weeks ago and people seem to like it.
[01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:29.180]   Excellent. You are just as a funcular and charming and witty and intelligent on Linda.com
[01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:33.660]   as you are on streaming media. So, I can definitely vouch that this could probably be a very, very
[01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:39.420]   good thing to have. John Greber, your middle name has almost been legally changed to John
[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:46.780]   daring fireball dot net Gruber. The essential reading. It's especially like if you had like
[01:43:46.780 --> 01:43:51.260]   one of those like gold and like diamond like sort of chain things around your neck,
[01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:56.940]   say just daring fireball. But essential reading not only for really good original analysis,
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:02.780]   but also exactly the right articles that everybody should have as part of their reading.
[01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:06.780]   Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? You're going to be talking about any place where
[01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:12.860]   people can see you soon? No, I have nothing else to plug. Oh, well, very good. I'm just happy to be
[01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:18.780]   here. Again, it's some days you're just happy to be indoors and talking to real life humans.
[01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:25.100]   Even if there is there, even if this we are, we are, we are, we are for people who again,
[01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:29.420]   basically work out of home offices. So, again, this is just, this is just
[01:44:29.420 --> 01:44:33.660]   gravy. I mean, I'm talking and looking at people and maybe maybe there's no actual human contact
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:40.620]   here, but there is virtual human contact. Tanya, you've already, there is always cool things to
[01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:44.940]   plug in your publishing ventures. You've already plugged one by all means plugged more. The website
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:50.140]   is take control books dot com. You also got tidbits dot com. Have I lost? Have I left out anything cool?
[01:44:51.500 --> 01:45:00.380]   Two websites, tidbits, free content, articles, analysis. Apparently, there's a really great
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:06.060]   article that my husband wrote up there right now. So, yeah, go take a look. That's all free.
[01:45:06.060 --> 01:45:11.660]   At the dinner table, do you sense that he's sort of fishing for, well, goodness, I certainly had
[01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:15.980]   some iCloud problems today waiting for you to say, yes, I read your article because I read
[01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:21.100]   everything that you write and post to the site. And then there's this pregnant pause, a plate of
[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:23.740]   beans just goes unpasked for the next five minutes.
[01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:31.020]   We have great dinner table conversations. We truly do. Usually, we're talking about,
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:35.900]   you know, people who write in and what their problem was, or, you know, if we can characterize
[01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:41.900]   people in some way. And the most fun that we're having lately is we sort of spy on people who
[01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:48.620]   write into us with a reported plug-in for Gmail, where you can see in the margin of someone's email,
[01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:52.460]   like their photo if it's on any social networking sites. And you can see the recent
[01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:57.100]   Twitter's and you can see all kinds of things about them. And we've been noticing a lot more
[01:45:57.100 --> 01:46:02.300]   young readers lately. And so, we've been talking about, well, did you see that picture of, you know,
[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:06.700]   Lisa who wrote in? It looks like she's about 18. You know, it's just exciting to have younger
[01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:12.540]   people say we have all kinds of conversations. I digress. Yes, we have tidbits, that's, you know,
[01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:18.460]   free stuff, more blog, magazine, newspaper style stuff. We have take control. That's the ebooks,
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:24.220]   we don't charge too much for them. They definitely help us stay in business. So we love it when you
[01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:30.460]   buy them. And we're having a good time with that. No need to add anything more right now.
[01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:35.580]   So, so if you ever have attempted to respond to one of these emails by saying, well, in response,
[01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:38.940]   you're correct. We did leave that out because we didn't have that information. However, you can
[01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:42.700]   here's a coach who can download a free updated version of that book. On a different note,
[01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:46.620]   if you keep posting photos of your of your teenage drinking to Facebook, your parents are definitely
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:49.580]   going to totally beg you and find out why the muckalo's been listening missing from the
[01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:53.260]   load of content. I'm a mom. I don't care, but I have to help you out here.
[01:46:53.260 --> 01:47:04.060]   So right. It's just that. Yeah, I know. Sometimes I don't want to pry into the social media postings
[01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:09.020]   of the people that I'm talking to because I might see something that might cause me to redefine
[01:47:09.020 --> 01:47:12.860]   something in that little ledger book. It's bad. It's bad enough that I have nieces and
[01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:17.660]   if you who are now in college, we have Facebook. They're very, very, very good girls and boys,
[01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:21.980]   but it's like, I'm always like, is this the time that they're not going to be talking about how well
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:25.420]   they did like an intramural sports? I'm going to find out a side to them that I've never even
[01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:29.660]   suspected before. Maybe this is the week. I don't know. Anyway, but that's nobody's business but mine.
[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:42.700]   Another Mac break is broke. Now get back to work, you gold bricks. See you later.
[01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:45.280]   (upbeat music)
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:47.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
