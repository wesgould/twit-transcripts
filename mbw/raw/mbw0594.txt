[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.160]   Suntimes great to see you Andrew hello great to be here like great to talk to you great to talk to
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.260]   That man that I'm not talking to for the next three and a half days. I know what you mean
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.360]   To my right Renee. I know Tim Cook Richie
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.360]   From i'm more calm. I like to think we all know Tim Cook
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.440]   Yes, but you really know Tim Cook. So I got to put the picture up here
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.200]   Renee was I guess you spent some time with the CEO of Apple
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.840]   Recently I'm brief amount of time. Yeah, so tell tell us tell us by the way
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.480]   This is his Instagram post the most inspirational CEO of our time so great watching the game with apples Tim Cook, which came
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.120]   So I was unaware of any of this going into it. So it was a huge surprise to me, but
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.800]   Tim Cook showed up in Canada to visit he just
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.760]   Yeah, our of code and Apple as far as I know never I don't think they generally
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.280]   Pronounce his travel anywhere some people pick up on it or they know when he shows up somewhere, but um
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:05.120]   Yeah, they just recently the board recently ordered Tim never ever ever take commercial airlines anymore because
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.040]   Well, frankly, he's a target and I'm glad he's a national treasure. Yeah, he's a national treasure. I'm glad they're protecting
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.040]   And also he's a few years I've been a lot of plane
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.520]   And whenever you take a position everyone who does not like that position suddenly does not like you. Yeah
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:24.560]   So I mean yeah, I mean for many many reasons and I think any CEO of a major company, of course, probably
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.120]   Also has secure
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.760]   Travel but uh, Tim Cook is the CEO of the most valuable company in the world and I believe son dar patri has an army of nineites that actually
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.040]   It probably does
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.920]   So uh, so is this in toronto?
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.360]   Yeah, so well, I was just reading I was just minding my own business reading the internet and I saw the globe of mail say that
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.040]   Tim cook showed up at the eating center apple store, which is a big eat the big apple store in toronto
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.240]   Eatens is like seers in the us. It's just a huge
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:01.280]   Canadian retail chain a beleaguered one right now busy shutting down everywhere but it's seers so the
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.480]   Yeah, so it still has it still has a center named after it
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.040]   So there's an apple store there really nice one and he showed up for the kids code thing and i'm just reading it
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.680]   I think if I'd known I would have done moved heaven and earth to be there. Okay
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.400]   Um, that's nice and then I like how long did he get there? Um
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.440]   Uh, but then unbeknownst to me
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.520]   Uh, he was in attendance at the hockey game later that night and I was there and then I got a call
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.320]   Saying can you walk over to this side? Oh, that's neat. So I just am a okay. So I had a big fantasy life
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.800]   That was completely wrong. I thought this was because we in america. We had these big football games on sunday
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.440]   I thought this was probably apple's box in philadelphia at the uh, at the big nfl
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.960]   Championship game and that you probably were eating giant shrimp with tim for four hours, but no
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.800]   No, that's not what was happening. This was canadian football which we call hockey where you get to actually use sticks
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.040]   And you can't tackle people but you can you can do all sorts of face. You can check them
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.800]   Yeah, and as far as I don't know if this was his I don't think it was his first hockey game
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.120]   You know, but but you know it was his first canadian hockey. How did you get so given the security?
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.200]   I mean, how did you get near him?
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.040]   Uh, I well, I mean
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:22.080]   That I mean, I'm assuming people interviewing them might be half on that part. So so they invited you to come
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.640]   Yeah, and they expected you
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.840]   And and I said hey rene. How you doing? Come on over tim wants to say hi
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.440]   Yeah, like I my expectation was just something like oh, we'll talk to you about how ira af code is being deployed across the canada
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.600]   Or we're doing it in french now in kebak or whatever like as often these things are just
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.960]   Uh, not fatigues. I don't want to I don't want to charge change on their super important things. They're they're they're pressivettes
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.320]   Yeah, they're expected and this yeah, and he had done his interview as far as I know he'd done all his interviews
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.640]   We actually ran one and i'm more from a gentleman who used to work
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.600]   Uh in the the the the real newspaper industry in canada, but is now a freelance journalist and he got to interview tim earlier in the day
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.680]   And um we managed to to get him on a freelance basis to do that interview for us
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.520]   So that was great. So I had zero expectations going in and then he was there which was which was really great
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.240]   I didn't want to take up too much of a time because he was super busy with all the apple people
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.560]   Yeah, so you didn't you didn't get an interview or anything. You just said did he did he know who you were
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.000]   You've talked about him previously. Yeah, I've met him previously
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.240]   I've seen him at the events and I've seen him at some of the launches before I never assumed that he's gonna remember me
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.760]   But I say hi. I'm rene. He goes. I know I know oh, that's nice. That's really nice
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.680]   Renee
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.040]   Yes one question
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.360]   Are you still wearing the same shirt today that you will be wore that you to meet you to meet?
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.480]   Tim cooking yesterday. Are you never gonna take off?
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.800]   Well, so
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.920]   Getting home the freezing rain was a bit of an ordeal that involved hours and hours and hours of travel
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.480]   And I didn't want to miss the show. So I literally drove straight here
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.600]   I
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:01.360]   That's so cool and and did you say can I get a picture?
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.280]   Uh, it was like sort of like there's this phenomenal
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.000]   I call him cookies because timmy's is already taken by tim warden's so like whenever you see tim cook
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.400]   Or I think almost any famous person now. There's a lineup of people's what happens. Yeah selfies
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.760]   Yeah, so I was I was you know, I wasn't alone with him. I was in a group of people
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.760]   So I just I and it couldn't like just I don't you not be the one person
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.120]   It says no no no I don't need a photo with you sir. This is this is replay. I'm not this
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.120]   This is replaced autographs now
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.400]   Yes, you pose for a picture. Yeah, it's the new autograph
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.400]   I got I got a serenade that that pixel xl2 takes amazing picture
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.320]   That the lighting of there was really crappy. I don't I do hope you use the iPhone 10
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.960]   Yes. Yeah, absolutely you can tell because we don't look like paper cutouts
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.720]   Yeah, not in portrait though. It's not in portrait mode. This is no. This is uh,
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:57.680]   This is a plain Jane photography. Nice job. Yeah, congratulations. That's that's lovely. That's a that's a that
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.600]   I'm really happy for you. That's such a cheerful nice photo. It's but it doesn't I actually
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:10.160]   I I certainly wouldn't have put it past you to like uh to have been invited to well
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.840]   Just you know sits. Hey, we're we're tears our temps there once you sit down
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.640]   Sit in the box and then have a have a a have a period with them
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:24.880]   And so but because that picture it's not the usual there are a group of people each getting about
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.600]   10 or 15 seconds to get a snapshot. That's a really good natural really good photo
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.280]   I
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.280]   Keeping it together very nicely
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.080]   I the last time I took a selfie accidentally turned the camera off
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.400]   So I've learned to hand off my camera to the next person
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.800]   So that they take the photo with me
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.800]   And he was actually sitting
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:49.120]   Lower down. I think he came up to the box at some point, but he was actually sitting lower down with
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.800]   I'm gonna totally mess up the name. So I'm gonna say it but there was there's hockey legends
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.840]   Oh wow
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.120]   Who work on sports?
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.120]   I I am terrible at the sports
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.760]   But and people are gonna be super angry about this
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.680]   But there isn't a someone who works in broadcast
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.480]   It was a former hockey player that he was sitting with that he mentioned in his tweet
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.720]   And I can't even remember the name now
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.920]   But he so that was what it probably begins with gordon. That would be my guess
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.320]   Or jock
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.400]   Gorg gorg jocky one of them. Yeah, you can tell you can tell by the hair
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:22.720]   They always they always keep the hockey here. We know Tim is a sports fan. He's a big Auburn college football fan
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:28.400]   But yeah, I'm not right. He must know he probably is hockey fan enough to know who the people he's sitting
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.840]   And I think Phil Schiller is a huge hockey fan. I'm sure several the other people are there huge hockey fans. How cool
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.680]   How cool is that?
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.360]   Yeah, it's very nice
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.960]   And it was actually it's so interesting it really was a story that Tim was in Toronto
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.280]   Like that's a that's a news news flash
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.000]   Canada has this thing where like we always want to say we're like we're a big grown-up city
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.440]   Or a big grown-up country now and it darling because you never see like New York City
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.600]   We're Los Angeles, you cook is in New York
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.680]   We're a real city now
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.680]   And no, you always were a real city stop it. You're just Canadian. You don't have to
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:07.760]   Toronto needs apologize to no one you got all the yelling and everything I noticed that
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.640]   TD Ameritrade
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.600]   Which is TD they don't ever say this stands for Toronto Dominion Bank
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:23.280]   And they call it Ameritrade. So you wouldn't think it's Canadian. It's not Canadian. It's not there's the t rbc is royal bank of Canada
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.800]   But they all move to their initials now. Yeah, they don't want you to know. It's fine
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.800]   I trust Canadian banks a little more than I trust america. Well, we only have like it's like provinces
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.480]   We only have a handful and they're run by federal and federal power. Yeah, exactly
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.000]   Uh, did you ask Tim? Hey, Tim, where's the home pod?
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:46.400]   No, I mean, I I don't ever want to be that person like if if it was a formal setting and I was told to come in and I could interview him and ask him questions
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:52.240]   Then I would you know, just not hesitate to ask any question, but this is more of like your social sort of casual thing
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.880]   So I don't want to be that guy who's like takes out the magnifying glass starts daring and gently it is for him
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:03.440]   I'll never forget Becky warley at one of the apple events streaming back to the studio. Tim cook comes up. She says Tim
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.400]   Was face time. Why isn't face time more open and she never got another interview again
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:14.880]   That was it. That was yeah, it's like it's like when you're when you're out like the press events
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.040]   It's like you know that if Tim is like trying to get from point a to point b
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.840]   And like and maybe maybe you can say hello and that's fine
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.920]   That's nice, but you see people that trying to ask substance of questions like
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:33.600]   What codec are you using for the new version of iMovie that will make it compatible with and you're like oh
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:39.440]   Honey sweet. It's adorable. This is your I know this is your first your first time here
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.440]   But he's not gonna answer that question
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.600]   So you remember that old cartoon do you remember that like that loony tunes cartoon where the the
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.720]   Sheepdog and the wolf come into work in the morning and they're best friends
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.440]   And then they punch the clock and then when you punch the clock out your best friend, you know like like there's a very
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:59.680]   Deliberate transition between off the record stuff and I kind of disagree with that
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.040]   I think you don't get you know, it's not like tim cook's doing press conferences
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.680]   If you can if you can ask him a I mean don't ask him to show off how much you know
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.080]   But if there's something like what you said you were gonna make face time open. Why isn't it?
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.680]   I think that that's completely appropriate. That's good. That's good. That's appropriate
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:22.240]   It depends like we don't have to be nice to tim cook. I'm sorry. No, no, no, but it's it's like rene said
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.440]   I mean if you're uh if he has in previous
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.560]   Events shown that you can ask him questions anywhere and he will answer the question
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.400]   Then that's one thing if you know for
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.200]   That's why I make the difference between someone who has been here once and someone who's been here 10 times
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.000]   You know that you I know that i'm not going to get anything substantive from this conversation
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.600]   Uh, and so there's really no reason for the bother you got to be real
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.320]   But but I but I agree with you if you if you are in that kind of a setting then yes
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.920]   If you've got a question then you should ask it. Yeah, but but again if you know
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:02.080]   But if you have been if you have been there 10 times and you know that he is not going this person in this situation
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.800]   Is not going to ask it answer a question and it's not something you need an answer to
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.320]   Write this second. Uh, then yeah, no, and in fact
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.560]   There's like I wanted to know if face time would be open. I like I know the guy that tim would ask. Yeah
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:20.320]   Better use this. Oh, yeah, no, and I rarely ask I really interview ceos for that reason
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:26.160]   You're never gonna get ceo to do anything but you know stick to point and stick to script unless he's a wild man occasion
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.920]   Although he was it depends rooming with malala. I mean like he was just so happy about all the malala fun stuff
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.640]   So great. Yeah, he was on cloud nine. Yeah, that's really how I read you asked him
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.360]   He might have said as a matter of fact Renee you'll be able to order home pod friday
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.200]   Or we might have said we have nothing to discuss about home pod in Canada or nay, so
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:52.160]   Only in the u.s. Australia. Yeah, and the u.k. Sorry, canada
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.440]   France and germany this spring that's almost canada
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:03.120]   Is it isn't great to have to have just for this one reason once again for other countries to wish they were american
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.920]   Because we've lost we used to come a lot of it now
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.680]   There are only a few areas and one of them is apple product availability
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:16.080]   So the home pod available for pre-order friday and we will arrive friday february 9th
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.000]   two weeks
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.120]   later
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.120]   I'll of course order one immediately
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.400]   Uh, we saw the rumor that there would be a million available initially in a total of
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:33.760]   Something like 12 million available for the year. I don't know how accurate that is you rene have heard the home pod. Yes
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.800]   And you said it sounds really good
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:43.760]   Compared to what was available when it was announced which was june of 2017 it sounded way better than both the sono
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.800]   Well, it sounded better than the sonos and way better than the echo
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.320]   But since then both companies have released new products. So i'm looking for
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.280]   Google yeah google max one oh one yeah the echo is it the echo two?
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:01.040]   Uh, yeah the second generation echo was supposed to be better and the echo home sounds pretty good
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.200]   I would that's probably the one i'll compare it with it is after all only seven inches tall
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.960]   It's hard to make a really good speaker system. That's compact like that
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:15.920]   Uh has a woofer that fires up which is interesting six microphone array seven tweeters around the base
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:23.520]   It has an a eight which is a pretty powerful chip for a speaker. We have made a mock up
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:30.560]   Of the speaker to give you uh some idea of its of its size and shape. I think this is a roll of toilet paper
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:37.920]   Inside here. I don't know and uh, and I apologize for the poor caricature of the apple logo. That's the silver not the space gray right? Yes
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.400]   This is the silver one
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.600]   so um
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:46.400]   I was going to order two. I think I may still order two, but the apple says that they the
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:54.560]   previously announced ability to uh do multi room play uh synchronized play and
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:16:01.040]   Pair up and become a stereo set when you have two of them in the same room will not come to later in the year
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:06.160]   So I mean the a lot of this deals with airplay too and airplay too
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.240]   I think it's just in the in the latest beta, but it was in previous betas and it was pulled
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.400]   And that's the feature that's going to enable multi room
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.120]   The stereo thing I think is a little bit confusing because
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:21.040]   The home pod does computational audio where it's bouncing things off the walls and figuring out where to play sounds
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.960]   in a room. So
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.600]   It sounds like it doesn't sound like stereo. I think it's completely the wrong terminology. I'm not sure why not
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:33.200]   It apples using it. It says if this is from the press release if there's more than one home pod set up in the same room
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:39.120]   The speakers can be set up as a stereo pair for even one which I'm confused about because originally like when I heard it
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.200]   It definitely sounded like full room audio
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.120]   It didn't sound like it was coming from one side
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.760]   And my understanding was you'd add extra ones to increase the volume
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.320]   Like if you had a really large room and you wanted to fill it
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:54.160]   You could put two three four in and they would understand that they were there and they would expand the scope of this
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.200]   Of this 360 audio. So I'm not I have to ask apple what they mean by stereo in this context
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:06.000]   I do have to say that this is something I'm gonna have to really follow closely because it's not the only it's not the only speaker that
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.960]   adapts its acoustics to
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.240]   fill
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.240]   To fit whatever space it's in
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:17.600]   Particularly other speakers particularly they want to be aware am I in is the speaker in a corner is this
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.320]   Speaker in the middle of uh in the middle of nowhere
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:24.960]   Uh, and I don't I'll I'll be very very pleased
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:30.480]   If it can deliver the sort of audio experience of two separate speakers
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.200]   I'm a little bit skeptical. I think that it will I think that it'll be excellent sound
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.680]   But I have spent like the past
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.520]   Several months
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.200]   Uh since the since home pod was uh was first first announced
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.640]   Intentionally trying to get in as many like three to four hundred dollar like two speaker systems
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:53.840]   In the office and comparing that to like a sonos comparing that to whatever good stuff
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:00.560]   I can get my hands on and none of them can really fill a room and make you feel like you're in the middle of an engineered sound space
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:06.320]   Like two separate speakers a distance apart placed somewhere sensible inside the room
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.640]   So we're gonna have to see how that works and not and it should also be mentioned that
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.840]   It's you really have to compare apples to apples to apples here
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.960]   Uh a single people people are used I think today people are using a single speaker
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:27.360]   Differently than someone who wants to have a two speaker set if they don't necessarily want that really rich
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:34.240]   Stereo environment. They just want you know this really weird bizarre L shaped room to have some good music in it
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.040]   And maybe they're not even going to be sitting in the sweet spot so to speak
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:41.360]   I mean they're gonna be they're gonna be laying in bed while this thing is like someplace off in the corner
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.920]   So it's not even necessary that it uh that it
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:49.440]   Replace that kind of stereo thing. I just think we should make sure that we have the correct expectations
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.600]   For what we're about to see. I think that good good sound is really all we can count on
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.360]   You're probably accurate that people don't listen that way and if you did
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.000]   And there are people who do who want to sit down on a sofa and have a stereo speakers
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.880]   You're not going to be doing it with a home pot anyway
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.440]   That that's this is a different use case
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.680]   It's possible. It could be like I am terrible at music
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.240]   Uh, I I I have a design background not an audio background
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.720]   I'm terrible at it, but it might just be cleaner because when you're throwing audio through a room from a single source
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.120]   Maybe it bleeds or I don't know what the right terms are. I really have I mean if you're an audio file
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.440]   you're adjusting, you know
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.440]   even even at a
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.520]   consumer range, you know most
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.640]   uh stereo systems most receivers
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:38.160]   Have uh something like odyssey is one technology that has a microphone that you place at the seating position and it tunes the speakers
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.920]   I mean this is not anything new and I sure if you're an audio file
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:48.240]   You you know exactly what you're doing and you're probably using a sound pressure meter and all sorts of stuff to you have 9.1
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.320]   You're not where any single speaker you have. Well, maybe you do
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.040]   You know, I think a lot of purists say no, let's let's do stereo. Let's not do surround sound
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.160]   Well, they have vinyl speakers, right? I mean, that's what I have vinyl speakers
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:02.160]   And he just bought a record player. So, you know, it just it just arrived today
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:07.120]   There's this good. Yeah, it's it's this is why audio is such an exciting category right now
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.320]   We're kind of redefining what what good audio means
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.800]   uh, where people people absolutely want the best quality sound if they have a chance to
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.920]   Test out like a sonos versus the the most versus the home pod and they like one better
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:25.440]   That's they're not going to simply say the sound quality doesn't matter. However, man. I'm so I myself. I'm surprised
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.720]   I don't have
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.240]   I don't have like all my audio stuff set up in the bedroom for instance yet
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.120]   So all I he really have is a google home speaker
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:38.720]   And i'm surprised at how much i'm enjoying just like as i'm reading in bed or something
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:44.880]   It's okay that i'm not getting the you know, the the buddha con like stone hinge like speakers
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.960]   room filling experience
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.080]   All I want is something it's it's okay for it to be a mono source
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:55.200]   But to be really good rich sound and this is coming from a speaker the size of a cantaloupe that costs
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:01.760]   $129 $150. So it's it's a it's a new metric and i'm really excited to see what apple's doing with home pods
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:07.600]   White in space gray usuk, australia pre-order friday
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.600]   Um
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.680]   At that price point, you know, I mean I think you're I think people put them in every room
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.680]   Is it is it rina? You think more about syri or more about music or both?
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:25.680]   So um, well one thing I I think apple really is positioning this as like if you look at um ear pod air pods
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.680]   Sorry, those are close band
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:33.760]   Um, they are they're a music first device, but they also put syri right, you know literally right into your ears
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.600]   And this is wide band like this is far far range
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:44.560]   This is being forming microphones. This is something the technology that echo has been using for a long time and google is put into google
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.280]   Home
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:51.680]   It's putting syri on a device that it can actually hear you if if we have music blaring and i'm standing next to andi and i say
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:58.960]   Hey schlomo do this schlomo can hear me even if andi necessarily can't distinguish what i'm saying and that requires this hardware
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.040]   But I think it's very similar right now to air pods where to andi's point
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.480]   For someone who really wants to go to the trouble of setting up adobe atmo system in 9.1 sound and have the perfect room
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:14.080]   That's fine, but many people can't or just don't want to have to go to the effort of of wiring all that up and they could put a single
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:20.080]   Easiest i mean you tap your iphone to set it up and it and it uses computational audio the way that
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.080]   um depth effect that portrait mode on a phone uses computational
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.320]   Photography yes, you can get the big dl
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.640]   Dessel and all the lenses and learn how to shoot and do all that and get a nice portrait photo
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.960]   Or you can use your iphone and get one that for most people is emotionally at least good enough
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.920]   And this will give really good, you know good enough audio
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:43.120]   But it sounds like apple is really tuning this as music first like they've invested heavily in syri
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.520]   But it's in building out syri's domain knowledge about music so that it is
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:52.800]   You can never say bulletproof with anything that server side, but that it really understands deep deep context
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.080]   um
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:58.160]   And metadata and information about music and it'll be really like a first class
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.920]   Musical assistant and they've added home kit functionality to it
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:07.760]   But I think that's sort of stage two and this is going to be as as is often the case with apple and iterative process where
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.400]   You know like apple watch version one lea we talked about this many many times compared to where it is now
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.760]   I think we'll see home pod as sort of apple's first step into this
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:20.720]   Do you see it's out to a range of bigger and smaller speakers is google and amazon have done
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:27.280]   I don't I don't know how much will do I think they'll bring something in underneath because I think there's a large umbrella
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.120]   Underneath 350 dollars for a speaker and there's room to have something there
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:38.240]   But I also think they'll iterate quickly on this and maybe we'll get series two and series one home pod next and the cheaper will be series one
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.960]   But also they'll like there's like the syri kit right now is
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:45.680]   Very bare bones like it'll do some things but it won't do ride sharing for example
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.360]   It'll do things like you can use messenger apps you can tell I can say what's app andy
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:56.000]   Blah blah blah and it'll do that for me fine so it'll integrate with all messaging apps, but it doesn't have a very wide range of integrations
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.080]   What is the support for this? This is this is the syri kit that uh, yes apple wants third parties to adopt
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.400]   What is what is the support for this look like? Are there a lot of syri kit apps now?
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:14.720]   Not so far so apple has a very different approach to amazon and they both have pros and cons amazon's let them do incredibly rapid deployment
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.400]   but uh
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:21.520]   Brian ramelli who's really good at voice first that had a good analogy said like if you got in first with pizza
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:30.560]   Too bad if your dominoes are pizza because that first developer owns pizza on a lexin and that's going to be something that amazon has effects eventually apple is building these things out very slowly
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:38.160]   um and doing a lot of uh contextual domain knowledge on them, but it's probably too slowly because as far as I know there's like there's todo's it'll
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:46.000]   I don't integrate with things like omni focus and things and there's uh messaging so it'll integrate with things like skype and what's app and
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.720]   You know all the different in addition to iMessage
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:55.520]   It says in their in their PR. It says syri kit messaging lists and notes and notes and that's it
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:00.400]   So that really needs music like you couldn't make a restaurant reservation. You couldn't
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:06.080]   Not yet. No. Yeah, it's going to be fairly limited. Although I suspect messaging lists and notes covers
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.040]   Mostly use cases even people with amazon echoes
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.840]   Uh, they said timers. I mean, that's what we saw the data and you can set a timer on this right? I mean
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.400]   Yeah, set timers play music all the basics of if you're an apple music user
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.640]   This is definitely the right choice for you because of the direct integration apple music
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.440]   Yeah, and there's some confusing language and they'll have to follow up on too about your iTunes library that i'm not clear
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.680]   That's just like iTunes in the cloud. So if you if you do pay for iTunes in the cloud
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.320]   I have to figure out exactly what they mean by that
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.320]   But if just from pure apple music context
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:41.120]   It's basically you ask syri for a song and if that song is in the apple and the nice thing about it
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.160]   So if I run uh apple's music match technology
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.360]   Would that mean that my entire library?
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.040]   That's not clear to me. I want to find that out
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.760]   But if you say for example play smooth criminal by by michael jacks or by alien ad farm or by glee
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:59.360]   You'll get whatever version the song you want and you can ask for it in different ways and based on you know top charts and
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:07.120]   A vast array of different uh metrics. Actually, i'm looking at the examples in the syri kit syri kit's much more capable
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.480]   Than the limited stuff. It's gonna allow the home pod to do you can make a voice call you can get rides
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.040]   But that does my heart to see that stuff's all coming is just
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:20.560]   To get here that's a that's a so don't be fooled by the stuff you can do with syri on the smartphone
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:25.600]   It's it isn't the same as on the home pod. It's not it's not that full syri kit integration
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:30.400]   From the problems that he you never know which platform syri can do what on and that has to be fixed because if you can't rely on a
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.240]   Technology to be there you won't use it
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:37.840]   That's that's why i think that apple is really making making their smart speaker perfect for apple
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.920]   Meaning that this is why they really not trying to identify it as a smart speaker
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.000]   They're trying to say a mat look how great
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.800]   Listen to how great this sound is and listen to how great this will be for listening to apple music on if they were trying to
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.440]   advertise it market at the way that
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:58.000]   Google advertises google home or amazon does ali osha
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:05.040]   They would it's sort of like the same reason why they didn't try to sell the ipad as a notebook because that makes people say
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.120]   Well, why isn't there a usb port? Why isn't there a keyboard? Why isn't there a printer port?
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:14.480]   Why isn't there a networking port if you say this is a really wonderful speaker that responds to voice commands
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:22.000]   They can then have people listen to an echo speaker next to this speaker and say wow this really kicks amazon's butt that way
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.400]   But that that would rene brought up is exactly what i was trying i've been trying to figure out over the past 24 hours
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.920]   like uh
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:36.080]   if uh, if uh, I have I do I do have an apple music account but pretty much just for research
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:41.520]   All my music is on a server or it's stuff that the stuff i'm using uh, iTunes match for
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:47.760]   This would really not be a this would be a lesser return on a 350 dollar investment
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.600]   If it's awesome
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:56.320]   If if the only way that it will do what I would expect it to do with voice commands and music is if i have a subscription to apple music
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:02.800]   If it can't if it can't you know give me uh tracks from this album, which is not on apple music at all
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.800]   uh, then
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.800]   It's not useless, but
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:13.840]   You you you you want you you're sort of asking me to ask you how come these other people that aren't
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.640]   You have as much money in the bank as you do apple configure this out, but somehow you can't
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:23.280]   So there's gonna be a lot of there's gonna be a lot of people on front of the the day that
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.200]   Homepods chip who are writing about this stuff who are just going to be
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:33.360]   Trying to find every piece of music they have that is not on apple music to see if they can do anything with it
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.840]   it'll it'll almost certainly work with airplay, but
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:42.000]   Then we get the problem. I'm if music has an airplay speaker. I can now buy google home x
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.840]   Uh speaker instead because that will still that will still chromecast
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.560]   It's hard to find stuff
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.120]   Music apple music has a pretty good
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:56.080]   Pretty but you know like the the andy and jim dal rumble problem is I have my like I want the third
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:01.840]   Oz life track that I but the new problem is that it's like the first something people asked is why doesn't it work with
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:07.680]   Spotify because a lot of people these day like some people they just don't have they never bought stuff on itunes
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.240]   They're not gonna start now. They never bought cd's not gonna start now
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:15.200]   Their entire life has been just streaming stuff, but they've already they already have a relationship with a specific service
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:20.000]   And they want that service and we don't have syri kit yet for podcasts
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.200]   Like it'll do apple podcast, but like if you prefer a different client like pocket cast or overcast or something
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.560]   I won't like
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.520]   Well, what's the audible support gonna be because I want to listen to those books
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:35.200]   Um, it's almost I can tell you like it's almost certainly it will not support
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:40.640]   But it I mean at some point syri kit has to be open to audio sources. It's just it's such a obvious
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.040]   You know google. I can't play my audiobooks either
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.680]   They've actually just opened their own audiobook store
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:51.040]   Right. Yeah, I suspect you and apple does sell audiobooks
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:55.680]   From audible on itunes, but that's different and just because you own it on
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.800]   Onable doesn't you can airplane it?
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.800]   So if you if you if you buy one of these and you really and you can like some people are worried about apple tv
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   This is a an airplane end point so you can point your apple tv at it too
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:10.320]   So if you're in a small environment or you just only want to buy one thing you can absolutely buy this one thing and airplay to it
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.600]   But then it's like before we had amazon prime video on the apple tv
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.680]   It's like you just don't feel like you're a first-class citizen
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.240]   Well, I
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:24.960]   Having purchased the expensive sonos one and finding out that it doesn't do the full amazon echo
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.520]   That it won't for instance read audiobooks
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:32.960]   Really is a bad experience for end users. That is very frustrating
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.280]   I suspect some people will have the same kind of frustration if it can't do everything syri can do on your phone
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.600]   It's not a full syri experience
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.120]   Did they say the Mac like the Mac won't do a home kit like why don't the Mac do home?
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:49.280]   I don't care. Well, also I mean just as much as I said that this is a great way for apple to promote this saying
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.600]   This is a great speaker now. You're you're also you're also sort of telling people to
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:31:01.360]   Think of this as a speaker meaning that it doesn't you're the speakers that i'm used to are not ones that are tied to one music service
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.480]   So that it's not even a case of being an audiophile
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.480]   Like i'm not i'm not on on jib dalryples level by any means
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:12.800]   But it's like even if it's as simple as that yes, but i i have been using
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:17.600]   I've been using spotify. That's where all of my playlists are. That's where all my collected libraries are
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:24.800]   And if you're telling me that not only do i have to start paying 10 bucks a month to apple music to get this that sort of functionality
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:32.080]   Through the speaker that i already paid 350 dollars for but i'm also going to have to convert all of my playlists and all my libraries to apple music
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.600]   That's you're you're not selling me a home
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:39.120]   You're not selling me a speaker you're selling me an add-on
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:45.440]   To a service that you're trying to sell me and that's it's not like it's it's kind of a step back from the from the apple
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.440]   Wifi apple high-fi
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:53.600]   High-five high-five so that's i mean that so this is it's just a speaker you plug it in and it plays music
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:59.520]   And i just hope that i just hope that the home pod at least within the first year has kind of that same
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:06.400]   Sort of approach to it. I don't want it just to be an accessory to apple music that would be such a shame such a way so good engineering
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.240]   Well, there's one thing it can do is read you news and in just a bit we'll demonstrate that because
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:18.320]   Oh ios 11 point what is it 2.5 just came out yep and uh
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:24.720]   Included in it at least according to the description compatibility with home pod and they've added that feature
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:32.320]   So we'll do a little test in just a little bit rene richy from i'm war.com close personal friend of the ceo of appleton cook
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:38.640]   A vleol report of leo report and not nearly as exciting and he's not talking to me for 3.5 days
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.240]   I'll be fine. I'll be fine after that. I'm not
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:47.280]   This says more about me than it does about you i'm acknowledging that
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.640]   And he and i come from the Chicago sun times
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:56.800]   Uh our show today brought to you by word press our sponsor and my blog host i've been a wordpress user seats
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:02.240]   Day one i think pretty much when matt melon mullen wig announced his new platform for bloggers
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:07.600]   I jumped right on it. I love wordpress for years. I ran at my own wordpress blog on my own servers
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:13.760]   Which was pretty expensive. We had soft layer servers. I had to buy the server and then time consuming because I was always
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.320]   Tweaking it and fiddling with it and updating it
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:22.240]   When I discovered wordpress.com and i'm ashamed to say it. I discovered it late in the day. I was
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:28.560]   So happy wordpress.com is the same platform that runs 29 percent of the internet now
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.360]   but easy they
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:36.640]   You and by the way le much more affordable than doing it myself. They run the hosting

[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.320]   So what should I so i've i've updated to
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.800]   11.2.5
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:20.560]   What else is in here besides home kit? I mean the home pod uh integrations or anything else. It's a point five
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:25.040]   So there's some minor updates, but the point three will be the next point. So what should I ask her?
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.560]   So the so those are members that
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:33.840]   Well, yeah, but you you want to you want to use hlomo for this because if you if you're looking at the screen
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:38.400]   It's gonna assume that you're looking at the screen and then it's gonna give you visual information. Oh, so put it down
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:44.560]   Looking at it that is gonna give you. Yeah, okay. Hey syri. What's the news?
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:56.720]   Here's the latest news from npr or if you prefer say hey syri switch to fox news switch to cnn or switch to wall
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:01.440]   That's nice integrations. So you can switch which you want to hear it's gonna play me npr
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.400]   Washington i'm lakshmi saying
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:10.480]   So that's pretty cool. I think that's pretty cool. Hey syri switch to fox news
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.440]   I guess I can switch to fox news
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:22.160]   And then and then also and I like this has this is really good for us has a button that says open podcasts
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.920]   Yeah
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.800]   Now playing you swipe up to access sleep timer. So there's more stuff underneath here and share
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:34.080]   So that is uh, that's fantastic. I think that's nice. You can just pull that down. It's to all the other podcasts
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:40.240]   So, ah looks like uh, ios today tech news today to it's elections. That's that's my shows
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:48.960]   That's not that's not series suggestions. That's really great syri knows you very well. Yeah, well, you must really like that leo guy
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:54.480]   So, um, that's really cool. I um, I like that. So that's what is this index?
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.400]   I love it that you can't be looking at it because we tried it on the
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:05.680]   Today and it was pulling up websites. Yeah, so there's it because for a long time like carplay has it's a different verbosity level for a series
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.240]   So if it knows that you're not looking to screen for example
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.800]   Uh for carplay, it's gonna assume you're not you know
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.720]   It's tearing at the screen because you should be driving it's gonna ramp up the verbosity and give you more vocal results
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:19.680]   If it thinks you are looking at the screen for example, you press the button then it's it's pretty sure and especially now with the newer
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:23.920]   iPhones they can read attention it's gonna give you visual results because it believes that's more efficient
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:30.720]   For you to parse the data. So it sort of goes through that scale now and it's uh the u the u. S the uk in australia
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:37.920]   I think so far for the news feature and you have a variety of channels that you can choose from in each of those regions cool cool
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:45.280]   Uh is is the battery stuff that tim cook alluded to the switch that can turn off the battery optimization?
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.520]   I believe that'll be at 11 point sorry 11 point three. So I don't I don't believe that's in this one
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.920]   I'm running the bait at least still in a slot in there. Okay
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:59.200]   Uh is it we've already mit mitigated for specter and meltdown. I think so it won't be and we dodged a bullet
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.760]   It turned out because apple did not use intel's microcode. It's enough believe that it could test or trust it
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:08.960]   So it's not applied it applied the web kit and safari mitigations instead
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:13.120]   And it turns out that was good because now intel has said wait wait no no
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:18.480]   We're killing older processors. Well not they're causing them to reboot. So they said please don't apply those and apple
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:22.400]   You believe it. We believe that cheese louise
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:31.120]   Unbelievable minus torvald was not happy. Yeah. Yeah, he hasn't been happy about this whole thing all along and then he's really mad that intel was pushing there
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.840]   I guess he called garbage
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.360]   updates
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:41.040]   Uh, I presume it also fixes the minor chaos or kayak chaos message bug
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:45.440]   The yeah complete and utter garbage. That's what line is called those patches
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:52.560]   Um that this is the was a github page that had some code that if you sent the link
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.720]   to uh
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.920]   iOS or or mac OS on messages, it would crash
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:04.960]   Messages, this is not the first time. I mean there's there is something really weird about uni code on a wide range of devices that parsing
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:08.880]   So always have like it was rushing for a while and then it was it was
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:13.120]   Emoji non-break spaces once and this like the third or fourth time we've seen
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:22.960]   Text parsing cause crash or freeze bugs. So I can show now the cheesecake UFO tweet because the link has been disabled
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.560]   But it was weird that you could literally just send
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:31.920]   A link a github link and that would freeze or crash the device
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.280]   Well, once it was a ravet characters once it was surrealic characters
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:40.400]   And it's just something about how it reparses those car it parses those characters that caused it to loop. Yeah
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.840]   Uh, okay, but fixed I presume an 11.2.5 apple said it would
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.000]   Do that
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.080]   Uh, do we do we I mean I know it just came out so you haven't had time to to look at it
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.640]   Well, my problem is I'm running the beta and I came here right from the airport
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:58.240]   So I only have one phone with me and I can't read the notes that they put on the release version
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:04.000]   Uh, let's see addresses an issue that could cause the iphone app to display incomplete information in the call list
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:10.160]   Fixes an issue that causes mail notifications from some exchange accounts to disappear from the lock screen
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:15.200]   Dresses an issue that could call its message conversations to temporarily but listed out of order
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:21.440]   Fixes an issue in car play where now playing controls become unresponsive after multiple track changes
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:28.400]   This is an interesting one adds ability for voiceover to announce playback destinations and air pod battery level
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:34.000]   So that's for that's an accessibility feature. It allows people absolutely to hear what's going on instead of see
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.400]   It's nice
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.520]   And uh, hey syri play the news is the new command
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   You can
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.840]   There it goes
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:47.120]   But what I like about syrian general is yeah, it absolutely is limited
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:51.760]   But it provides a variety of syntaxes so you don't have to specifically say the right words in the right orders
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:56.240]   Uh, you can say a variety of things like I send out as then now um
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:01.760]   Yeah, send and what's app what's app and like you can mix the words up and it'll still understand them
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:06.000]   So it won't work if I just press the button and say let's hear some technology news
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:13.200]   Sorry, I don't think it does technology yet. It doesn't do technology. No, it just that's here's some hockey news
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:18.880]   Does
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:25.280]   Cam so there you go
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.840]   Are they new can trust for hockey news?
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:33.360]   So syrian if you're looking for some source, I don't know of technology news. I'm just saying
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.240]   There there must be podcast somewhere
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:43.360]   Cat cam conners leola port they're both like stanley 1960s superhero civilian. They're a literative
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:50.160]   Just saying i'm not peter parker, but very very easy to code up as as hot words because they
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.640]   Lala
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:57.360]   I'm sorry. We don't have any technology news. All we could find is that stupid leola park guy
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:00.240]   No
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.440]   That's interesting. I can actually ask it for hockey news. That is really good
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:10.560]   And I love it that it's playing the podcast. I think that's really interesting and they added golf and tennis last week as well
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:12.880]   Nice not for news, but just for scores and
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:16.240]   a bunch of other stuff because this golf has scores
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.520]   Yeah
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:24.800]   You're a big golf game this weekend. Well, you know tiger woods is three under
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.480]   300
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:31.840]   Avengers shot shot 18 scored 18 double eagle bogey on the fourth hole and
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.800]   All right
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.920]   Um
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.560]   No spotify any plans to add spotify
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:42.800]   They don't typically announce stuff until they've done it, but it wouldn't surprise me
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.840]   I mean it again
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:48.000]   It's such an obvious thing to add hooks to the series everywhere for audio
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.920]   You wouldn't
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:56.320]   Would it be able to spotify to use it to do serie kit or they would provide the serie kit extension and then spotify what implemented on their side
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.200]   Yeah
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:03.520]   It's I don't I not even for spotify. I don't I'm not sure if they would add an implementation specifically for spotify when they could
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:09.520]   Take that much time in trouble to create an api so that you can put any audio hook onto it
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.320]   And basically shove the responsibility for how to implement it
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.640]   Of even further onto the service
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.600]   Just just the idea of you'll play the news
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:23.200]   How do you know that they're saying but I want to hear an NPR's newscast versus I want to hear a hui louis track
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.600]   and how do you want to even
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:33.840]   On google music versus apple music the same request will get different responses sometimes depending on quarks the database
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.840]   Hey serie listen to mac break weekly
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.960]   Let's see if it does that i'm not looking
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:43.520]   Sorry, I couldn't find mac break weekly
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:48.480]   I play that'll
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.640]   No, it got more stuff actually
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.760]   Okay, hey, i'm not gonna look at it. Hey serie
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.560]   listen to mac break weekly
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:04.480]   Nice so
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.720]   Yeah
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.200]   We don't need to do this. Oh, you can just have serie do it every now
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:13.680]   And now how do I stop it?
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:17.360]   Hey serie stop there's asking souls
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:21.440]   Stop
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.960]   Apple i feel good about apples
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:30.880]   Matureing of of home pod particularly they've been very very good about making sure they extend and embrace
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.480]   When they feel as though they can handle it or when they feel the time is right
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:39.040]   So i'm disappointed that it doesn't do excuse me as far as we know it doesn't do more
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:46.480]   Uh at launch, but i'm sure that in a year it'll be where we hope it to be and a year after that it will start to support
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.040]   More services and more platforms
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:52.320]   You can pair it to your phone right and use it as a speaker phone, right?
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:57.760]   Yep over airplay it does have a bluetooth radio, but there's no sign that it that apple is surface day 2d p
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:02.080]   Or i forget what the letters are for the new one. So how do you do airplay with a phone call?
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.240]   It's just an end point. Uh, it's
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.920]   Well speaker phone protocol has probably been established, but i get it
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:12.080]   So when you're in the call you press and you say yeah like you do with airpods. Yeah
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.040]   Airplay and airplay is very high quality right?
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:17.840]   Airplay one is
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.680]   Um, like it was never designed to be as far ranging as it was in eventually implemented
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:28.640]   So that is why airplay too is so important but for point to point stuff airplay especially for things like that
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.640]   It's better than bluetooth anyway
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:38.240]   It wouldn't be hard standing with favorites. Yeah, that's damning with fame and good news. You can mute the microphone
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.800]   Yes
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.400]   I will now be singing and I do not want the nsa to hear my voice. So please
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:50.640]   Is that with a physical switcher or is that with a command unclear? Um, you know the only reason both
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:56.320]   There are let's see apple details home pods gesture controls. All right. Let's see
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.200]   What this has to say about that
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:06.400]   Wow, I hate this when this happens. This is why kids you really shouldn't buy a windows machine
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:11.440]   This is uh, this is if you have epilepsy. Yeah
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:16.720]   Well, it's like the apple tv like I love the idea there's a physical switch that I have to push before it listens to me
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:20.880]   But every time I have to actually push that physical switch. I wish I did not the push physical switch. Yeah
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.160]   Uh, there are gestures. There we go
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.280]   Carson is going to show it to me
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.320]   What are the gestures? There's a plus and minus
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.000]   tap
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.400]   triple tap
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:37.200]   Tap and hold double tap touch and hold
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.840]   tap or
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.680]   hold minus
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.560]   Okay
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:52.480]   So triple tap is previous track single tap is play pause double tap is next track triple tap is previous
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:56.720]   I don't see the microphone off on thing. Uh, did there look like there was a button?
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:04.240]   Uh, this was someone went into the code there was new firmware landed and there was a bunch of um, icon icons for it
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:10.080]   Yeah, and there's an icon for it. So um, we'll have to see and the iconography was so interesting as someone pointed out
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.560]   It's the same. I think ben mayo from nine if i'm accent
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.720]   It's the same iconography that apple use in the home app
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:18.240]   But it's way more whimsical and fun than apple standard stuff
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:23.600]   It looks almost like the ww dc posters where it's looser and more freeform and more abstract
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:28.800]   And that must be intentional to sort of make home and home pod seem more welcoming
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.760]   But it just it did not look like traditional apple stuff to me
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:35.040]   very interesting
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:42.400]   Well, I think we've talked as much about home pod as we possibly possibly could accept leo silver or space. Hey, what are you getting?
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:48.480]   I like for devices like that. I kind of like them to be light colored not dark colored
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.360]   But we have a lot of dark
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:54.320]   Sonos stuff
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:55.120]   I'm i'm a true
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:58.480]   I'm a old fashioned high-fi guy in the sense that I
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:01.520]   All the speakers that like my parents always had
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:06.800]   Black cloth over them and I think that makes me prefer black girls on interesting
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.320]   Yeah
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:11.040]   They don't impede the sound quite as much
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:19.360]   Or perhaps maybe maybe it's even better for when you're playing the soundtrack to man of wamancha and the sound of music
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:23.520]   All right apple is uh
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:29.840]   Now I read somewhere that apple's required by the new tax law to repatriate their 260 billion
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:34.400]   Dollars held international understanding is that they're not required to repatriate it
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:40.000]   But they have to pay the tax whether they repatriated or not and once you have to pay the tax in a zero sense not to repatriate it
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.560]   38 billion dollars
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:46.000]   billion dollars in taxes great
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.800]   Apple on wednesday made a slew of announcements about it
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:56.240]   Oh, yeah, these are the this is so the number of announcements they're going to give every employee under the level of director
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:00.640]   $2,500 and restricted stock units. Thank you very much
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:08.240]   Uh, that's a that that's a $300 million gift because they have a hundred was a 20,000 employees
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:14.480]   Uh apple says they'll create 20,000 new jobs with the money and build a new campus
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:18.400]   Somebody told me it was going to be in Reno that can't be right
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:21.440]   Well, it's it's yeah
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.960]   It's it's mostly tech support and training so
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:31.520]   Anywhere also it's also it might likely be a place where there is a really really
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:39.600]   Broad employment pool and so people or people can live real makes sense. Yeah, yeah, and so they don't have to pay them
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:44.560]   I think I think apple will pay anybody better than any other company would but this not going to be a
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:47.760]   $90,000 a year job. So they're gonna want to live
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:51.120]   They're gonna want to put it someplace where people can live affordably
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:57.360]   They're gonna up the ante on the innovation fund which really is just money that they give to their partners
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:02.080]   But but maybe it helps innovation five billion instead of the one billion they announced last year
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:06.880]   Um, the job creation will include direct deployment, but also suppliers and
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:13.040]   I'm sorry to say they're gonna include app developers in this which they included in their number before they're too, you know
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.680]   And that's not really people that's baloney. Yeah
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:20.720]   Although app developers have been making money and there's no question about that
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:24.000]   But they'll still have hundreds of billions of dollars in cash
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:31.120]   And I thought that harris dedius article on a simko was probably at least for my untutered brain
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:35.840]   The best explanation of apple cash because it's the apple cash
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:43.680]   faq and what he says which I didn't really get before is actually this isn't apple's money in effect
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:50.720]   It's the shareholders money and they're there is pressure for apple to give it to the shareholders either is dividends
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:57.760]   But for tax reasons that's not the optimal way to do it or as buybacks and so I think what will happen apple has
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.640]   Uh a lot of loans on the books
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:06.240]   100 billion dollars in loans. That's the money they borrowed against the international funds
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.960]   Yes to buy back stock. They'll pay those off first
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.440]   I would imagine
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:16.080]   Maybe not it's all tax stuff, you know, and then at that point maybe buyback more shares
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:19.840]   But I didn't realize that actually is not an attempt to take it private
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:23.920]   That's good for shareholders because it increases the value of
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:28.000]   Existing shares produced as the pool of a bit. Yeah, right
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.200]   so
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.600]   And yeah, it's a q&a format
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:39.360]   Things like whoa, why would apple need to take out loans? Does it have problems with cash flow?
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.320]   Quite the contrary rights or us apples operating cash flow is eye watering
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:50.480]   Last year it generated 63 billion dollars
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.800]   That's where the be
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:57.680]   From operations the loans are not needed to operate they're used to pay shareholders
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:01.840]   Why does apple need to pay shareholders because it's their money their money
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:07.200]   Wait, I thought you said this was apple's cash apple is holding it for them
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:12.240]   But if it has more than it needs, it's obligated to return it. I didn't really realize this
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:15.920]   But then i'm no expert on corporate governance, but you're allowed
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:21.680]   You know most companies don't hold a lot of cash you're allowed to spend that cash to make more money
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:26.080]   You know to build assets do rnd and stuff like that
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:28.560]   But you can't just let it sit there
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:34.720]   You're you're supposed to uh, you're supposed it's it's considered a liability of all things on the on the balance sheet
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:37.440]   um, so
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.080]   They're well in effect. It's an asset and there has to be a liability that grows in proportion
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:46.800]   To offset the asset that liability is under shareholder equity
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:48.960]   in other words
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:55.200]   This belongs to the shareholders. So, um, that's that's what'll happen. Um, this is all complicated
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:58.000]   Tax stuff
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:04.240]   The other part further down about rnd I think is is super interesting and also how apple buys or doesn't buy
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:07.440]   Uh, or like makes acquisition acquisitions or does not make acquisition
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.920]   Very insightful. What about acquisitions? Why not buy other companies?
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:17.840]   Well, it buys companies but usually small ones which are essentially acquisitions of teams and their intellectual property
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:21.840]   This is the one that I think is such a good thing for us to to remember
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.200]   apple
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:30.160]   Does not buy business models or customers or cash flows and that's usually what you buy a company for the business model
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:34.000]   It's customers or it's cash flow apple doesn't need any of that
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:38.720]   Uh, also because apple has a strong culture and wishes to preserve it
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:43.360]   They're careful because acquisitions dilute culture when we talked about buying disney
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:47.440]   There's more disney employees than apple employees. That's gonna change
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:54.880]   The culture and he says this is why integrations, uh, often fail and that makes a lot of sense aol time winner
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:57.440]   hp compact
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:01.120]   Because if you get a big company that that's gonna change your company
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:07.520]   Statistically large acquisitions are valued destructive and the larger they are the more likely they are to fail
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:13.520]   Incidentally when a company is acquired with cash that hole in the balance sheet is filled with something called good will
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:20.960]   Which reflects some intangible value of the new asset if and when the acquisition is deemed to a fail you have to write off the good will
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:27.920]   And in other words rob shareholders of the cash they should have had so I thought as we were looking at like no
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:35.760]   He bought by microsoft or a well board by time. Sorry billion dollars in a write-off for microsoft because and in work
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:39.680]   Google buying Motorola. Yeah. Yeah, so let me let me find the rnd
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:44.800]   Stuff too because right above yeah, so why doesn't the company spend money on other things?
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.920]   You said they return what they can't use. Well, why can't they use it?
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:54.000]   Well, the company considers his mission to be very narrow add value. I love this. This is saurus
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:56:02.720]   You're great add value in specific areas where they can create tremendous value uniquely and under conditions they can control boy apple does that in spades, right?
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:06.720]   Many such products don't require capital
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:09.920]   manufacturing data centers apple stores
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:14.160]   require capital rnd and sales not so much
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:18.560]   Creating products is very cash efficient in other words apple's existing cash flow
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:21.360]   Is more than sufficient
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:26.640]   To plan their existing talent like the people who made the iPhone were drawn and like there were some new people like radio engineers
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.360]   And you know who were specific to the technology and to make a phone
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:34.320]   But most of them were people that were working on existing apple products from the industrial design
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.880]   Team to the hardware engineering team to the software team
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:41.520]   All those people were already employed by apple so the the our research and development required for iphone
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:46.720]   It was just a retasking of their time. Yeah, that's so that's often why you'll find that some lesser
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:54.640]   Second tier products are delayed because it became an all hands-on deck thing to get another product out the door or another piece of software at the door
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:57:01.920]   Or certain talent pool was robbed internally. They are biggest investment. I think is really in personnel and in talent because they feel as though
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:10.000]   Once they get once they get someone really into the apple system internally once they have an employee or an engineer who's really into the apple system
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:16.960]   A lot of them really want to stay in that system and that they they not only understand their area of engineering
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:20.960]   But they also understand how apple likes to articulate that kind of technology
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:28.960]   So that's where that's where they like to put their money at that's exactly what our us says is that the expensive developing something like the iphone is primarily salaries
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:32.560]   Paying the people you already have to do the job
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:37.360]   So this was I thought very very very useful
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.480]   And it's brilliant too because when you look at like a lot of times
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:44.960]   It's really easy to write a blog post saying apple should buy Netflix or nintendo or whatever
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:49.760]   Apple does make these purchases like authentic led to touch ID and prime sense
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:56.160]   And Siri and the purchases they made in the technology that gave and the differentiation they're able to bring to their product
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:58:03.760]   Which is what apple really wants they want differentiated experiences that they think will provide value to the customers or will increase the value of the current products
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:10.640]   Um, it's just those are the sort of flagship features you hear apple announce year after year and they come largely from those small acquisitions
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:12.160]   Yeah, absolutely
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:20.000]   We think back to the acquisition of beats and this what did not become a thing where beats were remained as the company that they were
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.480]   Uh only they're simply owned by apple. They didn't become like the makers of file maker
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:33.040]   Uh, they really it really was an acquisition of jimmy iovine dr. Dre getting apple music to from from zero to where it is today
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:38.480]   Which is a strong strong not only a strong financial competitor, but an influential competitor
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:45.760]   Uh, the beats brand of headphones. It was not allowed to contaminate anything that apple was doing while it also allowed apple to
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:51.120]   Uh add a very very compelling and important brand to the apple retail stores
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:56.720]   Which is far more important than whatever profits they're getting from the hardware itself and also being able to insert
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:05.440]   Apple technology into this most influential most important cultural brand. So yeah, all of this is really on the money. It's really it's
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:13.920]   It's the usual way of trying to wrap your head around how much of how much capital apple can throw around by trying to decide
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:21.600]   Now if we're trying if we're trying to the real estate of entire states road island definitely Delaware probably as well as deler
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:25.920]   But the but buying netflix buying disney buying these kind of properties
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:32.000]   Those aren't things those aren't things that apple would ever want to do unless it can solve a problem for apple as opposed to
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.560]   Allow them to be able to cover more
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:36.560]   Territories on that big risk
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:40.160]   Playboard they're really not interested in just simply covering more territories
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:46.480]   They're basically all all power is about the ability to determine your own future and your own destiny
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:54.400]   And everything apple does as a very very smart company is to make sure that everything they do allows them to continue to pursue their own destiny
[00:59:54.400 --> 01:00:01.040]   So I think that if they were to do any more acquisitions or any more infusions of talent would be to continue the idea of
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:07.040]   Let's try to build our own cpu's for everything and never have to take something off the shelf never be
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:15.120]   Uh, beholden to the schedule of intel or any other company never be beholden to the let's charager charitably call it
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:20.000]   functional quirks of a certain intel cpu's over the past 20 years or other makers
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.880]   I think that that's the sort of thing that apple would want to get into
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.320]   And it's really when you look at that list when it says like for example
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:31.840]   Uh business models apple already has a very good direct to consumer business model and they've been building the subscription model
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:39.360]   Enhanced by beats obviously but when you look at customers if you buy those companies or those customers already apple customers apple has a billion odd
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:45.200]   Customers already would really be getting new ones and the cash flow the opposite of the problem apple needs to solve
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:52.320]   Doesn't need to buy companies to make even more money or just to sort of get liquidity. So, um, it's unclear what value those things would bring
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.760]   Other than spend the money that they have
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:02.000]   I love uh, so if you wanted to you know, if you were wondering how good is apple
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.040]   Uh fortune magazine went out and queried thousands of executives
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.840]   Uh asked them to rate
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:17.600]   Enterprises in their own industry on investment value quality of management products social responsibility ability to attract talent
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:21.040]   Number one most admired company
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:25.120]   In the country in the world. Well, of course apple
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:32.960]   Then amazon alphabet bircher half the way starbucks walt disney microsoft south west airlines fed x and jp morgan chase
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.960]   So you don't have to trust us
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.080]   uh clearly, uh, clearly the biggest
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:42.400]   Executives in the country also agree apple is well run
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:49.440]   Um, let's take a break and when we come back. We will talk a little bit more about apple
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.000]   There's lots more to say i'm just posing for a picture you don't mind
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   So you're i thought you were placing a fine
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.080]   Fine
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:03.440]   Renee's meeting tim cook and leo so popular he has to take fan photos in the middle of the show
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.760]   I'm here with their leaving
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:09.280]   They're walking out on us. I'm wearing a cardboard
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.400]   Thank you guys have a great day
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:23.040]   It's funny karsten stayed on the screenshot as long as he could hoping to get
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:28.880]   Get them out of here before we but then I said, oh, let's do an ad it's nothing he could do about it
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.200]   He did it. You did your best karsten. I appreciate it to save us from ourselves. Yes
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.720]   Our show today brought to you by fresh books. I would take what I would pose for a selfie with these fresh books guys
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:43.200]   There are great. I've known them since I started using fresh books in 2004
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:48.160]   Now 10 million other people use fresh books because it's the best way
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.800]   To keep track of how your business is doing
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:55.440]   To send out it started by sending out invoices sending out professional looking invoices
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.880]   With that which is really nice big pay me button right on the invoice
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:03.200]   So you can without doing anything on your part except credit card payments from your clients
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.200]   That means they pay on average
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.440]   twice as fast
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.960]   But that's not the whole story because it turns out once you do
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:17.520]   Expenses and invoices through fresh books, you know your accounts receivable, you know your accounts paid
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:20.080]   You know your expenses, you know
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:26.640]   How your business is doing, you know your profit and you're ready for tax time fresh books essentially
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:31.920]   Is cloud accounting software, but don't say that out loud because people say, oh, I don't get to the cloud accounting
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:36.720]   No, you don't have to do anything just just just use fresh books to send out invoices
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.200]   And their intuitive dashboard will tell you
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:44.880]   You're spending you're outstanding balances your total profit all the balance sheets that you need
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:50.080]   You'll know how you're doing at any given moment as a freelancer. That was always a big question mark
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.400]   Am I making money at this?
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:57.440]   You just don't know until tax time now you'll know all year long and by the way
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.800]   The best way to to get your clients to pay no more chasing clients for payments
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:08.080]   You don't have to take a check to the bank and wait in line. You can get credit card payments right from the invoice
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:14.320]   You'll always know exactly which invoices have been sent which invoices have been paid which are unpaid and overdue
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:19.120]   And you even know which invoices have been viewed which is very handy
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:23.920]   They've always adding features. It's a it's a web app. So that means when you go to fresh books
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:30.000]   You're you're seeing all the new stuff automatically like for instance. They just added the ability to create proposals
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   in fresh books rich text content images customizable sections showcase the value you bring perspective clients
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.600]   Win more jobs and then boom they're already in the assistant when it comes time to send them the invoice
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:49.520]   Know what you did when you did it. You'll never leave money on the table again fresh books makes it easy to build for time
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:56.320]   They have a time and hours button right there in the website or on the app. They've great by the way iOS apps and uh android apps
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.320]   You could build by client. You could build by project have different rates for every service
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:04.800]   Put your business on autopilot from payment reminders to late fees
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:10.160]   Automate as much or a little as you'd like and get back to doing what you love fresh books

[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.960]   that com
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.200]   slash mac break
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:36.800]   This is very exciting news. I don't know if it's true or not
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.840]   Jeremy. Uh-oh
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:42.400]   Jeremy Horwitz writing adventure beat apple
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:46.960]   This is actually he's re-reporting from digit times
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:53.680]   Are you less excited now leo no they sometimes get it wrong but reportedly ordering
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:56.480]   touch panels
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.280]   For a new 13 inch entry level mac book
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:02.160]   Be still my beating heart
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.440]   You think this is incredible digit time says
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:11.920]   Taiwan's general interface solutions gis already supplies iphone 10 3d touch panels
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:16.560]   And became an lcd module supplier for the mac book laptop late last year
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:23.120]   They already shipped 300,000 laptop panels a month expect to double that number by the end of the year
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:26.800]   And thanks in part to new mac book orders
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:34.560]   It's a touch panel manufacturer. It doesn't mean that mac os will be a touchpad
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:40.000]   Uh, doesn't mean they ordered touch panels either. Yeah. I mean they ordered non touch already from them, right? Yeah
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:46.720]   Yeah, it's it's it's so many things. It's like I fell for it. Well, I mean, it's
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:52.160]   If if it renews the conversation about putting touch on mac os, that's interesting
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:55.360]   Me but it's it's so far in the future
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:03.920]   Today from anything that I can only speak for myself of anything that i'm aware of and I will so I will also protect that by saying that
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.840]   It's not as though i'm
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:09.760]   I'm you know attending hockey games for the ceo my my sources are not that good
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:14.320]   But if a project were far along that they're actually ordering in quantity
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:21.840]   I mean, this is the sort of thing where uh, where the next ww dc would all be about mac multi touch
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:28.080]   That's what the entire show would be about we would we would see that we would see the preview of the schedule
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:32.240]   And every single box would be like empty purple on the schedule
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:38.240]   To be topping to be announced to be announced. Yeah, that's when you that's when you know that multi touch is coming to the mac
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.680]   before then
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.680]   I mean, it would be it would be a
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:45.760]   If we if we play the game of assuming that this is actually good intel
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:51.760]   It would be an interesting move because I really don't think that the the touch bar has
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:59.200]   Made any kind of a cultural impact on the mac community to make sure that the the basic toyota turssel level
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:03.200]   Macbook has the touch bar would really would certainly
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:10.000]   Compel a lot of developers to think about ways to support it if only to make the mac book more fun and make their apps more interesting
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.280]   So I don't think that would be a silly idea for apple to pursue but I'll
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.160]   Even that I will believe it when I see it
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.440]   I love the conversation though
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:24.080]   I mean because there's so many possibilities here one like the the boring ackams razor ones that they still haven't managed to get the 12 inch macbook
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:28.400]   Price down to where they need it to be which is $99 apple has to have a $99 computer
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.560]   So this could just be the next $99 computer because macbook air 199
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:35.520]   Yes confusing 999
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:40.640]   I'm not talking about this special priceless for people who are friends with Tim
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:44.640]   Can we please stop talking about your relationship with Tim coat for one minute
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:50.880]   And no totally and I mean at the other opposite ends you have a macbook that could conceivably have
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:54.400]   Touch although how that would be implemented be interesting given how long it took
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:59.440]   Microsoft to retrofit touch onto windows and also apple as far as I know it's had macbook like
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:03.760]   We got the mac we got the ipad probe it could have just have easily been a clamshell
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:09.040]   So is it more interesting to add multi touch to the mac or to add trackpad support to iOS and have a clamshell
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:13.920]   iOS device is only like that's what I love about right now is that it's so it's far more easy that we can just
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.760]   Imagine yeah
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:21.760]   Well, I would love to see a new macbook. I don't know if it adding a touch bar would make a macbook more compelling for me
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:22.800]   but
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.800]   Okay
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:29.600]   A touch screen I do have touch ID or this face. Oh this face ID touch. I'd even be good or face ID
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.640]   Yeah
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:33.840]   I would like to see an updated macbook. I'd like to see a better keyboard
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.800]   The macbook is an is a really great product
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:42.240]   But we're never I don't think we're ever going to see a touch mac or
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.240]   That's that's that's
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:46.960]   I think
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.160]   Yeah
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:48.480]   I
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.480]   I find a lot easier to
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.720]   I to imagine apple
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:59.760]   Evolving the ipad into something that's more like a notebook with a touch with a with a trackpad with a clamshell design
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:03.120]   Like like Renee said then I imagine apple wanting to
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:10.960]   Reengineer the mac OS for for a multi touch when app when when Microsoft added multi touch to windows
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:16.000]   They did it brilliantly they did they they stumbled for maybe with the first iteration
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.200]   But they came out finally with a model that was wonderful
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.640]   And I think that is kind of an example of how well you can have a
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:28.400]   Single screen that will adapt to whatever use case that you personally want to want to do with it
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:33.680]   But that took so much time and so much money and that's the sort of thing you would do when your business is micro
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.600]   Is is a desktop operating system?
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:39.760]   I don't think apple sees himself in the desktop operating system business
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:43.360]   I think they would see it as here we found this way to make our
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:48.240]   Our steam trains run so much faster requires so much less coal
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:54.400]   I think they would see that as a dead end. I think they were more they would put they want to put more of their money into developing
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.160]   Their aircraft then into their steam trends right now
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:05.120]   And so that's why I see them evolving the iPad as opposed to bringing the mac into 2016
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.760]   I'm also interested before go ahead
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:12.800]   Was what we talked about before where like apple has these resources and they can move them around but it comes at a cost
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:17.920]   And if you were to task engineers to make mac OS touch friendly those engineers would come from somewhere
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:24.000]   You can't just there's the limit to how many engineers are willing to work in kupertino for what apple pays and like in that environment
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.600]   And all those things will have the technology the ability to do this kind of stuff well
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.160]   And quickly and apple like microsoft didn't really have a super successful mobile operating system
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:38.480]   Or maybe there would have been a very different game. Maybe they would have scaled that up too apple has a super successful touch first operating system
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:43.840]   So spending the the time and the money to make a second touch operating system
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:47.920]   It's probably not the best use of those resources, but exactly what Andy said instead of
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:54.080]   Like on the on the on the smaller end at least at first is really interesting to think about what an ipad pro would be
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:57.760]   If it wasn't a clamshell with a trackpad. I think and I think that would answer
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.480]   That would solve a lot of problems for a lot of people
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.800]   They've gotta be working on it. I'm sorry
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:11.440]   I'm sorry just quickly more more to the point. I think that apple can really strongly compete with windows notebooks if they make ipads that compete with them
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:16.320]   I don't think they can compete with windows notebooks the way that people buy windows notebooks
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.440]   By trying to make macbooks
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:23.200]   By that I by that I mean here's a thousand dollars. What can I buy?
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.840]   Can I buy a really well-built?
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.160]   practical functional
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.440]   durable
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:32.960]   And useful notebook with a lot of memory and a lot of storage for that well
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:39.280]   No, you can buy this you can buy the version without air conditioning or a or an mfm radio
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.840]   You and it will but it will run max software
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:47.600]   About but if you say here's a thousand dollars, it doesn't necessarily have to be a laptop computer. Oh my god
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.680]   Here is a really incredible
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:54.960]   Midsized ipad here is a wonderful keyboard cover plus an amazing bluetooth keyboard
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:59.600]   You can have for it and you can have a stylus with it and then it but it doesn't run windows
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:03.920]   Yes, but it will run many of your windows apps as iOS apps and they look lovely
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:08.480]   They'll maybe maybe there's something better than windows and then after a week people say well
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.880]   I guess there is something better than windows. It's called iOS
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:16.480]   And god it could run an ar it could run an apple a 12 processor instead of a core m processor, which I'm so over
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:20.000]   What uh, what do you think the new i
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.520]   Pat they'll be a new i they got to be working on a new ipad for this year, right?
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:27.280]   The ipad schedule is I mean like they did six months between the ipad 3 and the ipad 4
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:30.400]   Which granted I don't think that ever do again. That was just needed to replace that chip
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:35.840]   But they've also gone not you know 18 months between refreshes instead of 12 months. So
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:41.440]   I'm glad I'm glad to see that I think the I think the annual iphone refresh is kind of killing them
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:44.640]   Um, okay, that's that's obviously going too far
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:49.040]   I mean, I think that I think that it puts a lot of pressure on them that they don't need
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:53.040]   Uh, and I don't think it necessarily results in bad products
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:59.440]   But I think that it means that uh it results in things like a conversation I had with somebody just two days ago
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.560]   Uh, even the he she had bought an iphone
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:07.520]   iPhone x and she returned it within a week because she loved the face id
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:11.840]   But other than that she didn't feel as though it was such a big upgrade over there
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:16.000]   His her iphone 7 plus to justify a thousand bucks
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.440]   Whereas if you weren't if they weren't putting out something every single year every september like clockwork
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:24.080]   And if they weren't in this horrible toxic culture
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:28.320]   Where as soon as they announce that they're not coming out with a new iphone this year
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.080]   Everybody
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:31.840]   Okay, including me
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:35.280]   We'd be like, oh my god. What does this mean? They're not doing an iphone this year
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:40.400]   I think that if they were allowed to do this on an ipad schedule where they know exactly the
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:44.080]   What they they basically have a list of here's what the next level for each
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.800]   Each level of progress is going to be
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:50.080]   We think we can ship the next level of progress in 16 months
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:55.200]   As opposed to 12 months take 16 months and do it that way. I would love to see that happen
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:01.680]   I want a new i'm at i pad pro. I want one with
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:09.200]   Face recognition. I want to be the bezel this almost well. I guess you can't have it. Well, yeah, I got I got to tell you
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:13.840]   So this you know the thousand bucks I spent for my ipad pro at release
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:19.200]   The first generation that is one of the best investments i've ever made in terms of
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:24.560]   Using it every I still use it every single day and it still feels like a
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:29.360]   As fast and as wonderful as it did when I first bought it and it still does
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:34.320]   Really everything that anytime I come across a new piece of software that I want to use
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:39.200]   It does everything that that new piece of software could do. It's it's a really good
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:45.280]   Practical investment. It doesn't need I've never felt an incredible amount of envy over
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:50.800]   Over a ipad that came out two years after the one that i've bought
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:58.240]   Were asked that number of times where i've thought oh i'm really sorry about a phone this year because the new one has two cameras and they've oh good
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:02.160]   Oh, look at that. Oh, dammit. Why didn't i wait for those to do yeah
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:08.400]   Yeah, no, I think I said the whole the nfl by the sorry the nhl by the way the bench was using ipad pro
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.480]   I think the 12.91 blast by you
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:17.520]   Not hobbled by the nfl's deal to only use crappy microsoft surface tablets a
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:22.560]   Uh, yeah, I would rather have an ipad pro on my bench
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:30.480]   And some tin Hortons you buy the iMac pro the gift that keeps on giving robert morgan mad scientist at bear feets
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.600]   Has determined that
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:36.560]   it is first of all
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:40.880]   That it is possible to get an external thunderbolt three storage device
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:44.640]   That is as fast as the amazingly fast internal
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:50.240]   T3 he got roughly the same uh read and write speeds i was able to get on my iMac
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:54.720]   It's amazing three gigabit little more than three gigabytes per second
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:56.720]   write
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:01.840]   And same problem i had which is that the reads were two and a half gigabytes have we ever figured out why
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:07.440]   No, I don't understand. This is the only system i've ever heard of where
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:11.280]   As writing to their ssd is actually faster than reading it
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:15.280]   But at apple and significantly faster, but somehow apple's done it
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:18.960]   But one of the things that they determined trying to set this up
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:24.960]   Was that the uh the new iMac pro has dual thunderbolt control controllers for the four thunderbolt ports
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:27.600]   So you can this is crazy talk
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.680]   Use two of the ports each on a different controller to stripe
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:34.400]   different
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.400]   boxes
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:40.000]   And break the speed barrier to get to get this
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:47.040]   4.781 gigabyte per second reads
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.600]   How you like that lepott?
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:55.280]   What the what now it's gonna cost you but if you bought an iMac pro you don't care about yes, exactly
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:02.000]   Uh, there are a number only it's only a few alixes a number of units though. They were able to do this with a kiddio
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.840]   Makes uh these external thunderbolt three devices nodes
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:09.280]   They have but you have to buy two of them right and stripe them
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:13.520]   Or the other world computing's thunderblade v4s
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:18.800]   And again, you have to put them two of them on two different thunderbolt three boards
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:24.160]   How do they stripe? I don't I guess that's an apf s feature where you can have multiple discs striped
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:28.480]   On different. I don't know. I saw the numbers and my jaw drop. I didn't have time to read the article
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:29.520]   Yep
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:32.320]   Don't you love what these these benchmarks were you?
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:37.920]   You really I really do have to get out the spreadsheet and do the math and convert it to something I know about
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:42.720]   Figure out that numbers this big. I just look at the death of like am I really is a deathful point really where I think it is
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.600]   Right
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:53.280]   191 megabytes per second. That's four point and then try to translate that into like how many k video could that handle
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:19:00.560]   As a durable rights all of it all of it exactly. It's like it's like sun the the the street
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:03.120]   The view
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.120]   I just wanted to put that big
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.440]   on that
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:08.800]   See the throughput
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:15.600]   Okay, yeah, I believe what the performance of a machine like this will mark his brown league does it down and tries to make it cry
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:18.720]   If she puts the weapon with the red weapon on it
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:22.160]   Facebook live with
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:30.640]   We filled a room with popcorn with with styrofoam packaging peanuts and took put fans on it and shot 12k video of that
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.600]   And tried to compress it here's here's what happened
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:38.560]   The good news is the enclosure itself isn't that expensive the Akidio node
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:46.880]   Light is $269, but then you have to put you have to buy more stuff because you have to put fast drives in it, etc, etc
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:51.200]   But you know, I might I might pick one of these up. That's nice pc. I
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.680]   Yeah
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:55.680]   Couple of Alex's not so bad
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:20:00.080]   I have to say
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:03.840]   You know, I I just the internal drive is so damn fast
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:10.000]   Yeah, it's mind-boggling the fact that you could get something faster even faster externally on a thunderbolt three is
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.120]   Well, just crazy
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:14.080]   Yep
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:18.080]   Yeah, I can't I really I actually can't wait for WWDC
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:24.160]   I hope that the first 10 minute slot in the keynote is just going to be here's how people are using the iMac Pro
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:31.360]   And I they need it. I really want them to come up with tactical examples of here is exactly how people are you?
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:37.040]   We thought in the engineers thought there's no way people are ever going to be able to max out these processors
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:44.640]   Here's how people are maxing out these processors and I really want to see practical demos of that because I imagine it's going to be jaw dropping
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:48.240]   It would be a 10 minute segment that they finish in one minute because it's so fast
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:55.840]   Uh, just just incredible just incredible hair force one done done done. I mean
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:03.040]   It's I mean the the more I the more I learn about the iMac Pro week after week as people who have specific knowledge in
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:07.280]   Memory channels infrastructure and in data path infrastructure
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:13.680]   As more as these people have have now had a few weeks of really tear it apart and see what it can do and explain it to people like me
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:15.680]   Who are not experts in that kind of engineering?
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:19.040]   The more you learn about the iMac Pro the more impressed you get with it
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:21.040]   This is one hell of a machine
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:29.520]   And I'm kind of left wondering what happens when they build a boring metal box where they don't have to constrain things for air flow around a crt
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:32.880]   Crt, sorry a video panel and other things like that
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:38.400]   What if it just when it what if it just becomes here is a here is the box that my new pair of like timbre
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:43.680]   Of a timbre line boots boots came in you are to fill this with as much
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:50.240]   Hammer of god processing power as you can I want I want to be able to shift this thing
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:56.560]   10 seconds back in time with the amount of processing power in this and money is no object
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:01.360]   Our our users have proven money is no object when it comes to really fast max go to it
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:07.040]   I feel as though we are going to bring in the destruction of the human race. This is going to be so good
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:11.920]   I love john groobers takedown of the news week article
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:20.400]   Announcing that iphone x such a poor seller that apple's about to cancel it
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:28.000]   So we said half a day on that as well. Oh, it's such a great thank you john groober for the line
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.040]   Throw in some poor reading comprehension skills and sensationalist
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:40.720]   Mandacity and you get Anthony kuthpersons report for the publication that today operates under the once respected name news week
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:44.240]   Saying that the iphone tens of flop. It's not
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:47.200]   It started with a report from
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:55.280]   Ming qo at kji securities that apple and again rumor rumor rumor that apple will probably not
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:58.320]   Keep the iphone 10 around after this year
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:03.440]   We'll be there was an example that we could look at have they ever done that before yeah
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:10.160]   Yeah, I mean if only like maybe the iphone five that was retired after a year because the five s came out and the five c was
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:15.760]   So much easier to manufacture and targeted a very specific market that apple wanted to test out
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:22.320]   Could it be that the iphone 10 is is expensive to manufacture and use a scarce oled resources
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:27.840]   And apple's going to save the oled for their their flagship devices and they're going to go to led
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.920]   For this and maybe make it a little bit bigger
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:34.960]   So it's more appealing to the chinese market and it'll be like an iphone five c but like not really but I mean
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:39.040]   It'll be sort of that mentality. I mean if all the only past could ever be prologue. We will
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:41.600]   Also, we forget that
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:42.720]   Another
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:46.720]   So many of things that a company can do that are really brilliant have nothing to do with engineering
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:50.640]   They just simply have an idea of putting something a product in the proper context
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:57.600]   Like with the iphone 10 they did not make that the iphone 8 they said here's something extra iphone 8
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.240]   This is something above the iphone 8. This is something special
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:06.320]   We are not pretending that the best that we're not pretending that a mainstream phone from us is going to cost a thousand dollars
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:07.920]   We are going
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:13.360]   Design riffic with this one. We're putting so many really cool ideas. We wanted to put into phones into this thing
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:17.680]   This is not this is not the phone of 2017. This is the phone of 2020
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:22.240]   And so if you think that it's a silly thing that's fine. You still have the iphone 8
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:24.960]   Which is a wonderful incremental upgrade over the iphone 7
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:29.280]   It also gives them the ability to if someone is silly enough to call the iphone
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:32.000]   Assuming they take they stop making the iphone 10
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:38.640]   In september they also gives them the very credible way to say look we didn't this is not necessarily going to be
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:44.000]   The new upgrade path for the iphone and guess what we have the iphone 9 which has face recognition
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:50.000]   Which has ole ole d that doesn't have the ears on it and now costs only 800 dollars and it cost a thousand dollars
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.320]   Plus they've already sold what a how many
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.960]   18 million was it the
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:25:00.960]   Quarter yes, right. Yeah, it's like so tell me tell me how this can in any way be explained to be a failure
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.720]   Unless it's i've i've been there. It's monday
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:08.800]   You're you'd all you all you got to do is file something at the end of the day
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:14.480]   You got the thing the brilliant thing you're spending three weeks of three weeks on has has totally failed to pan out
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:18.640]   You got to file something or else you're going to miss dinner with your kids. I get it
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:25.200]   And I think we uh have all agreed that this iphone 10 is the best iphone ever, right?
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:28.080]   Yeah, it's one of those other samples ever made
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:32.160]   I I well okay rene and I love the iphone 10
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:36.400]   Andy, what do you think the best iphone is you prefer an eight maybe or
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:42.880]   Um, I don't the only way the only reason why I don't think it's necessarily the best thing they've ever made is because
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:49.120]   Of the price. I don't think the price is criminal. I just think that well that's a good point. Yeah, one of the what it's it's
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:56.160]   My again. This is just my opinion and my opinion is biased and uh in flawed just like everybody else's is
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:02.160]   Um, my when I think about technology I think of the one the one of the ways you remove the level of difficulty
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.800]   Is to say well screw it. We're going to charge 200 bucks more
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:09.600]   We're going to charge 25 more for this product than they did we did for our previous top product
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:13.920]   That doesn't mean that product is bad. It just means that you made things easier for yourself
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:17.840]   I'm more I'm more impressed with uh, loresbury pie where they said
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:23.520]   Here is a brilliant 35 dollar computer that has changed the world in ways that
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.320]   You we have to compare it to the iphone the way it's can change the world and for their follow up
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:32.960]   They said we've decided that 35 dollars is too much to disbend
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:38.800]   On a on a computer that runs a desktop operating system that could run a microsoft office compatible suite
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:44.320]   We come up with a six dollar version of it. That is incredible. That blows my mind
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:47.680]   So I I really love the iphone 10. It's kind of made me
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:54.320]   As much as I might have said about how I react to a thousand dollar iphone in the lead up to the iphone 10
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:57.760]   I kind of would like to see if they would say let's we're going to make a 14
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:59.920]   We're going to always have
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:05.040]   Again an iphone edition just like the apple watch edition where we are not even pretending
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:08.960]   This is a practical phone for most people. We are just simply saying here's what we could
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:12.400]   We're just saying to ourselves as we we are a design company first
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:18.000]   We love the idea of if we could all the times we said we can't put this component in or we can't put in this feature
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:23.200]   Or we can't use this style of manufacturing or this style of or this this material for the case
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:28.640]   Because it would drive the price up to $4,200. Well, we've discovered that we can sell 18 million units if we
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:34.640]   $4,000 can we sell 12 million units of something that is absolutely the most gobs
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:39.680]   Smackingly beautiful object you have ever put it in your hands inside a shopping mall in your life
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.800]   I'm interested to see how what apple would do that. There are very few companies
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.960]   I would be interested to see what they would do with it
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:48.880]   But apple is such an amazing design firm that I would love to see what they would do
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:51.280]   I would never be able to afford it, but I'd love to see what they would do with it
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.760]   Well, it's just a daily user of the iphone
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:56.160]   10 I have to say I
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:01.360]   I couldn't be happier with it. They're there are not it's not perfect if face ID doesn't work every time
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:05.360]   I wish it did but I can always enter a six digit code. It's aspirational though
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:09.200]   That's the thing I like about why I like the nexus one so much that it felt like it was the future
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.800]   Yeah of phones
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:15.200]   And I think this is like the palm pre was like that for the first time I saw it and then the nexus one
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:18.800]   And then there've been a few phones since then, but this is one of those phones where like I look at and I go
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:21.520]   You know, okay. I can see the phone. I'm using next year in the year after that
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:23.360]   You know a break with the past has happened
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:29.440]   And it's and it's we're looking for it and that now and I think if you don't make the leap that kath person made for
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:34.880]   Linkbait reasons in newsweek, uh, you could you could trust I think Ming Chi Quo's
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:40.320]   Again understanding it's very early in the year. We're talking about what's gonna happen nine months from now
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:46.560]   But you could I think given that he has his finger on the supply chain probably this discussions are happening already
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:51.200]   He knows the what like he's he's he's good and people debate the fv ethics of what he does
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:53.200]   But he's very good at getting
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.280]   Supply chain information
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:29:00.240]   Uh, he's very good at the what he is often not great at the why because he's extrapolating
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.880]   Right and that's true with a lot of apple rumors like people will hear something
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:06.880]   And then they'll make up a narrative because it either sounds good to them or something else
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:11.200]   But it has nothing to do with the with the actual decisions going on behind that product
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:20.400]   He's predicting two iPhones at the end of the year two. I whatever we'll call them new iPhones one lower cost 6.1 inch
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:26.640]   Uh, iPhone based on the iPhone 10 it'll have the notch but it will be aluminum not stainless steel
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:33.760]   Uh, there'll be other, you know compromises made to get it down below well below the current $1,000 price point
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:40.640]   He's saying seven or eight hundred dollars and then they'll be a large which is surprisingly large high-end six and a half inch
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:48.480]   Uh, oled version so that it's like the plus again. It's bringing back the plus. Yeah. Yeah, I think that that's that's a common complaint
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:53.280]   I've been hearing but with people that when I talked to people who bought an iPhone 10 and then returned it
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:57.840]   They didn't hate it. They just said that didn't feel as big as my old plus
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:03.680]   Uh, and you can go into well, let's compare exactly how much real estate you had for that
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:08.800]   It just didn't give them whatever they were looking to get out of a large-sized phone emotionally. They weren't responding to it
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:14.560]   I actually love the size of this and I understand it's smaller than the plus usable real estate
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:19.280]   Yeah, but I will miss it. It doesn't look like if this is the road map. It's a good middle ground
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:24.720]   This fun. It's a good middle ground and plus as now that we would it's one of the great things about apple products
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:28.560]   Is when they do these changes like the touch bar and like the screen that has the ears to it
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:32.240]   That there's only so much that can show you in the launch demo
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:39.040]   It's gonna take like three months until three months after the thing is released when all the developers actually have actual hardware in their hands
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:40.960]   Not simulators but hardware in their hands
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:46.960]   And now we're seeing people who are really using the ears and very interesting ways to make it look like we have this
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:51.040]   We have these two special extra tiny oled displays. It feels like yes
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:54.640]   I'm gonna that I'm going to put like a histogram level for a camera
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:58.720]   Which it seems like the most natural place to put a histogram level on a camera
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:01.360]   And so it's whereas
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:05.040]   This is one of the things that really prejudices
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:10.240]   My evaluation of of something new that apple or near the company puts in a product
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:14.640]   It is is now a year year and a half since the touch bar came out. I have yet to see
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:20.560]   Any ground swell of apps that are using it effectively whereas they're every single week brings another app
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:25.520]   I'm thinking that same thing. Well, not well, not not only that but the the ears aren't you big?
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:32.400]   What I see either but the my perception is that it gave the developers an idea of well, you know what
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:40.480]   The histogram is something that it doesn't it really has to be easy to see but I can't it can't be covering up the the live area of the screen
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:42.160]   That's where I'll put that or yours
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:43.920]   We're gonna put like just a little bit of a pip
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:49.040]   Just a little bit of a queue for someone to know that there's something happening in our app that we want you to take a look at
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:55.120]   Whereas it developers are really really creative and really really self-driven
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:32:03.040]   They're not necessary if they if you all developers buy whatever it is that apple has it's brand new that has hardware that they're going to
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:08.720]   Want to think about supporting and when you see a developer who says I don't care if this increases my unit sales
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:11.920]   I think it would be a really awesome idea to use the touch bar this way
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:15.600]   They'll put it in and then that would be a good demonstration of what it can do
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:22.000]   I rarely see anything like that. I don't think the touch bars inspiring developers the way that the ears have been inspiring developers
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:28.320]   Yeah, I like I think that's really important too because some people labeled it a notch right away and a notch feels like something taken away from you
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:31.280]   But when you look at all these these quote unquote edge-to-edge displays
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:36.160]   All of them have some kind of bezel at the top and what this does is cut away the two sides of the bezel
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:39.280]   Which is why I like ears or I do the horns for kreg federiki
[01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:43.920]   Because it is giving you something extra it's almost like the extra space you have for complications
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:46.640]   Or in the sides of the display it's like peripheral information
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:52.800]   And some people put volume indicators there or sliders there are all these things that just they get them out of the main part of the
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:56.400]   Interface and you don't have to stare at them, but they're there instantly when you need them
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.640]   And I think that's the sort of creative thing that's really great about them
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:03.280]   I'll be better if we didn't have it of course, but we do have a sector space. I'll put it to use
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:07.200]   We should actually we didn't really talk about the malala fund. We should probably
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:16.960]   Talk a little bit about that you have a good article and I I'm more Renee apple becomes malala funds first laureate partner helps increase support for girls education
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:20.080]   Uh, this is why tim cook was in uh, canada, right?
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:26.080]   Well, so he was flying back he was in lebanon to meet with her and to discuss what apple's doing with the fun which is making it
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:30.080]   Uh, they're giving them enough money to be able to expand it to a
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:33.680]   Many many multiple many more people
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:39.280]   And then on his way back from flying he stopped off in in toronto for the code thing because he's super passionate about
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:42.880]   And he actually revealed in a different interview that he didn't have the opportunity to learn
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:47.200]   You know because of his generation he didn't have the opportunity to learn code until he went to college
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:50.400]   And he thinks that it's just so important for people to get access to that early on
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:55.920]   Which is why apple's doing all these labs for kids and introducing them to swift playgrounds and to other uh
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:59.840]   To other things but the malala fund is amazing because it's gonna
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:06.080]   It's just about giving the opportunity for education to people who have historically been denied access to it
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:11.360]   Uh, either any education at all or education beyond uh, k through six
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:16.400]   And just making sure that everyone has the opportunity to have a free and a safe and a secure
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:19.920]   Um education so they get off to the best possible start that they can
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:24.160]   Uh cook was speaking at harlow college and s six
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:29.840]   Uh, this was as kind of there talking about there everyone can code curriculum
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:35.120]   And uh, he was asked if he believes there should be limits to the use of technology in schools
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:40.480]   I don't believe in overuse. I'm not a person that says we've achieved success if you're using it all the time
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:43.760]   I don't subscribe to that at all. I kind of agree with you tim
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:49.360]   Uh, even in computer aided courses like graphics design technology should not dominate
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:53.520]   There are still concepts you want to talk about and understand of course on literature
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:56.720]   Do I think you should use technology a lot probably not?
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:02.240]   He says I don't have a kid, but I have a nephew that I put some boundaries on there are some things I won't allow
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:05.840]   I don't want them on a social network. Is he raising his nephew?
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:12.240]   No, but I think he like it's sort of like me with my godkids where you spend a lot of time with them and you have to make sure that you're consistent
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:16.800]   With what you want you with how they're being raised like you can have a separate set of rules from their parents
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:19.360]   Yeah, and it's really uncle Tim that runs out
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:25.360]   Kid conceivably uncle Tim. You should Johnny be on a social network. No, I think that
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:28.960]   Those of us without kids but who have nieces and nephews
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:37.120]   Uncling is a very powerful and very very responsible verb. It's like I realize that I get to parent this person for four to six hours
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:44.240]   One day every two or three weeks and I want to make sure that they I want to make sure that whatever they experienced
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:50.080]   While I'm babysitting them while they're in my office playing with one of my max while I'm working on the on another desk
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:57.200]   You you do want to give them something to chew on during the two weeks that they have to deal with life
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:01.280]   And so I that's I absolutely understood what he was talking about there
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:03.840]   He did say if I think if you had to make a choice
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:06.480]   It's more important to learn coding
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:11.680]   Than a foreign language. I know people who disagree with me on that and let's hope you don't have to make the choice
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:18.720]   You could learn both but coding is a global language. He's true about that and it's the way you can converse with seven billion people
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:21.440]   No, I think I learned both
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:24.800]   And no, I think I I don't think he said anything scandalous here
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.720]   So it's something that makes me upset or angry
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:29.360]   But I would say that you don't converse through code
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.840]   You converse through apps that are built with code
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:38.320]   And then that's when you're gonna oh, I would say that if if I had to choose one or the other to that
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:43.920]   Again, let's say let's say my my niece or my nephew who's nine years old said that my school
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:51.360]   We can choose between one period one of our period classes can either be a programming course or we can learn american sign language
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:53.360]   I would say take the sign language course
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:58.320]   You will a not only not only will it be interesting for you to understand that there are different ways that people
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:00.400]   People communicate with each other
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:05.520]   But it also means that you will be of help in an environment where very few people speak a language
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:08.640]   So yes, definitely you can you can learn c++
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:14.000]   You'll have you'll have all of your teenage years for pain until then brought yourself. Yes
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:21.280]   They asked him about the paradise papers, of course the revelation that many companies and pandan individuals where you're as
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:24.560]   Storing money offshore
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:29.360]   He said I probably haven't read everything that's been written so I wouldn't want to pass judgment on the paradise papers
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:33.760]   But he does say the right way to address multinational national tax
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:39.200]   Is a worldwide thing because if not it becomes a tug of war between countries saying I want this
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:42.400]   I want that you know apple took advantage of
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:48.480]   Look completely legally of tax laws the united states, but i'm glad to see them repatriating the money
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:53.280]   He said we have a deep sense of responsibility to give back to our country and the people who make our success
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:57.440]   Possibly said that in england so i'm thinking i think he means it
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:06.400]   While surrounded by all the suitcases of cash he's gonna be charging fit me to always a bag for yes taking back with him
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:10.720]   uh apple is launching a new internal fitness challenge for employees
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:15.280]   Oh, I love this you get a unique apple watch band
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:19.840]   They do health challenges frequently. I think every year if not multiple times a year
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:23.360]   But the apple watch band is is a nice life to expand are you gonna be
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:29.280]   Wouldn't it be awesome if the if the as part of the apple health app when you meet fitness challenges
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:32.480]   It basically deposits a little token in your iTunes account
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:36.880]   So that when you go to the when you go to the apple store or go to the online apple store
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:42.000]   There are bands you can only buy just like like boy scout patches or girl scout patches
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.480]   If you have earned the right to buy this band
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:49.120]   So i'd say um, it's a one of the one of the hook-in loops right the hickin loopers
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:53.280]   A woven nine long band. Oh, no, it's got a it's got a one nylon. Yeah, okay
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:58.160]   It's solid black, but and I love this has an accent loop in a dark pink red
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:04.080]   Uh with lime green and light blue the three colors of course that represent the activity rings
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:07.680]   Yep, and the way you get it. You have to reach a gold level
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:13.200]   Uh, it's not clear exactly how you get the gold level of the activity rings certain
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:18.160]   You have to fill your rings to a set number of days. I guess you just have to outrace jabelonic. It's super simple
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:25.680]   Hey, I follow rene richy on the activity and he fills those rings in pretty pretty consistent
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:30.880]   I managed to do it last I was just always joking because jabelonic reminds me of steve of captain america in the
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:37.520]   The winter soldier movie where on your left on your left. I just imagine james has half his day doing laps around apple park
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:42.880]   That's that you good way to get gold. I think this is I think this is a great idea
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:47.760]   To you know encourage employees it's a minor thing, but it's kind of a badge of honor
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:50.240]   encourage employees to stay fit. This is great
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:55.120]   And do you think do you think that the design of the apple campus is going to cause like pronation problems
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:59.920]   Because it's because it's like nascar where they're only ever making left turn sideways
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:04.720]   There they're at least going to have to like alternate them just to have the wear on the heels of their shoes
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:12.000]   Will be the same walk from the from visitor center to campus so to the to the ring so I mean they've got lots of room to work there
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.200]   so
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.240]   No word whether they'll ever sell us in public, but that would be pretty cool. They did give away
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:27.440]   For pride in 2016 they gave rainbow colored apple watch bands to employees, which is
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:32.160]   Also, they had a version of that that was available to the public eventually. They sold that yeah, yeah
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:38.640]   I would rather see it though in the hook and loop. I like the velcro. I really do those. That's the most comfortable watch band
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:40.640]   It's a sweatpants of apple. It's sweatpants
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:44.320]   And but it doesn't look so it doesn't look like sweatpants, right?
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:50.240]   Well, also it doesn't like you in the winter months when you suddenly use it doesn't it doesn't make it quite so obvious that wait a minute
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:57.360]   I'm using like one one notch further on my watch band. I'm actually getting I'm getting weight in my wrist because it's winter
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:59.920]   And I can't I don't want to run in 12 degree weather dammit
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:05.920]   There is uh, let's see here. This is from business insider. Thank you scooter x
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:10.880]   These are the bikes apple designed for the apple uh campus
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:19.280]   Silver silver bullet silver, you know, google's our rainbow color. They don't look that much different. Yeah, there's the google
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:24.640]   uh ones, but yeah, I just make one really
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:30.080]   Horrible wise guy comment. It's like it's a bicycle
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:37.200]   Yet you're out there having fun in part like reliving your childhood, but no we can't it must be gray
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:41.360]   It cannot have any cheerful colors. No, we will not even let you have a bell on it
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.600]   Bell is that is a joyful thing not even any brands on it
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:49.600]   There's no logos on the tires or anything most apple office buildings
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:55.040]   So I mean in some ways it's a problem for them because anything any building with an apple logo is immediately where you go to get your iphone
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:42:00.560]   Right fixed even if it's an office building right and any bicycle with an apple logo is immediately something everyone throws in their truck the minute
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:04.480]   They see it because now I've stolen an apple bicycle. Yeah, that's a that's actually good
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:07.360]   Even google it's not it's not just that but google is having a problem
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:11.760]   Losing their own google bikes not only because like they're kind of cool bikes
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:15.520]   But also because the community and mountain view feels as though
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:19.600]   We're part of the google community. Yeah, even the mayor
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:25.520]   They're like the shopping carts where you got groceries and you're just gonna like walk a mile or two home
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:30.000]   And then maybe it'll be a couple of weeks before you bother singing it back or maybe you'll just toss it into a ravine
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.400]   So I can't imagine how how long it's gonna take before some of these apple bikes
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:38.720]   Arrive on ebay because there are people who will want to add an apple bike to their collection
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:45.360]   Let's take a break and get your picks of the week in just a moment any an anaco for chicago sun times from i'm where dot com
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:49.040]   Renee richy tim cooks new best friend and
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:55.360]   Our picks of the week coming up in just again in three and a half days. We will stop giving you crap for this
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:59.920]   We should we shouldn't be giving you any crap at all. We've got we just got some jealousy issues to work out
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:01.760]   That's all there is
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:08.160]   It is jealousy. It's just it makes it makes us look very ugly. Well, we just have to get through it to get there. It's always beautiful to me Andy
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:12.640]   Hey, I was just I was just looking at my molecule air
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:18.640]   Purifier on my smartphone and then I just thought wait a minute. I've got one here. I could show you
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:21.520]   This is it. This is the molecule
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:26.880]   We actually got one for the studio because the studio has problems with fumes, you know when they tarred the roof
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.960]   It was really hard to breathe in here
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:34.240]   Um, you know the the fires in northern, California made it very smoky in here
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:38.880]   They painted and the v o sees in the air made it hard to breathe and uh and uh
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:45.360]   Fertilizer season and pet luma's coming up real soon and well you just don't want to be here
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.840]   That's happening. That's why we got a molecule. In fact, I've ordered another molecule for our house
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:54.560]   We've had one in our bedroom lisa and i for some months in fact lisa says she had allergies
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:56.800]   She would wake up every morning
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:58.960]   We've just did with a headache ever since we got the molecule
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:05.760]   Never it didn't happen one day. I accidentally turned off the molecule. She said what you do. I got a headache. I said oh
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:15.360]   So I got I got anecdotal proof positive the molecule works. You've probably heard of air purifiers that use HEPA filters, right?
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:17.280]   Uh
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:19.520]   50 years ago that was the greatest thing ever
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:24.240]   Developed in the 40s there haven't been any innovations since well until that until now
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:30.080]   molecule uses pico technology photo electro chemical oxidation
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:36.320]   That does a lot more than any HEPA filter does see HEPA filters are just
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:38.960]   Fithers their sieves
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:42.800]   The the the the pico filter does a whole lot more first of all
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:47.600]   It can capture pollutants 1000 times smaller than a HEPA filter
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:50.800]   It also can eliminate allergens mold
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:52.960]   bacteria
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:56.560]   Viruses and even VOCs and air other airborne chemicals
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:59.440]   so your air
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:03.600]   Is great to breathe funded originally by the EPA
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:07.360]   Extensively tested by real people verified
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:12.080]   in university labs like the university of southern florida center for biological defense
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:15.520]   And the university of minnesota's particle calibration lab
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:21.200]   I love our molecule you can take parrot to the internet control it from your phone
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:26.480]   But you can also control it just as you would any filter just from the top they've got a button on the top
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:33.200]   It has a silent mode, which is great for the bedroom at night. Although I have to say even when it's on loud
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:37.760]   It's kind of a nice white noise. It's very soothing. Uh, I like how it masks noise
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:42.480]   They also have a light that is the is breaking down
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:45.840]   These chemicals you could turn that off at night
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:50.000]   But you want to turn it on again in the morning because it actually it's cleaning the air
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:53.920]   I thought I said, oh, that's just a light to let you know it's working. They said no, no, no
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:58.720]   That's the that's the the the um, it must be ultraviolet light that's breaking down
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:04.320]   the chemicals so it has a um a filter that is actually uh
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:07.280]   capturing
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:09.280]   these impurities
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:11.440]   kind of like a magnet
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:14.480]   Uh, and then the light is breaking them down
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:17.360]   It's basically it's the apple of air purifiers
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:20.880]   Connected to your Wi-Fi network control it remotely from your smartphone
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:25.600]   You can also turn off the bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities not required
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:29.840]   It is awesome. Oh the reason I do like to use the Wi-Fi
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:33.840]   Is because it will keep track of and you can see it on the app
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:37.760]   How much of your filter there are two filters in it how much of them have been used
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:41.920]   And it will auto order new filters when you get down to 10%

[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.600]   If if you're in as many are an office building that's sealed, you know, you've got that sick air syndrome
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:03.520]   This is a must it's great for our studio because we can't leave the doors open. We don't have any windows in here
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:06.080]   The air is so much better
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:12.560]   Molecular replaces 50 years of antiquated air purification technology. It's not a HEPA filter. It's a pico filter
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:17.920]   And it goes way beyond it if you're worried about mold black mold things like that
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:22.960]   It is the only filter that actually captures it traps it and then destroys it
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:25.680]   viruses bacteria
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:27.040]   VOCs

[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:43.520]   Now we got one. I just ordered one for michaels room. We're gonna set it up tonight
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:46.000]   We've had the one in the studio now for a month or two
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.640]   This is a great product molecule

[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:56.080]   Time for that's my pick of the week time for our picks of the week and the anacos
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:58.000]   What are you using these days that you like a lot?
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.480]   I got two picks that are kind of related
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:05.200]   Uh, the cd just came in today. I heard you listening to it
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:09.520]   Oh god, this is 50 years at Lincoln center a gala celebration last year
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:14.880]   the metropolitan opera house at the Lincoln center 50th anniversary of that facility
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:20.960]   And they basically had a three or four hour gala, which they assembled pretty much every
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:27.520]   Every amazing voice you that that is that has been performing at the Met for the past 10 or 20 years
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:35.120]   Uh, and a program of just it's just amazing the cd plus no domingo rene Fleming
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:42.000]   Uh, diana domra one of my favorite soprano is joist de de natto another one my favorite soprano's victorio greguot
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:48.800]   I so only on cheva on and on and on and on some names you'll recognize some you won't but all these are just the
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:52.880]   one the greatest singers ever singing all of the
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:59.040]   It's basically the greatest the best opera greatest hits cd you can possibly get
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:02.400]   Uh, people I have I've heard from a lot of people who think i'm an expert on opera
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:07.680]   I'm not i'm just a person who buys cd's and a person who occasionally gets to go to the Met when they're when i'm in town
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:15.600]   A business, uh, but I mean if you want of one cd that costs 25 bucks that will give you an idea of how beautiful opera can be
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:18.480]   It's three and a half hours of live performance
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:22.720]   By the pea not only people who are amongst the best in the world at what they what they do
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:30.000]   But also really excited to be at this gala and kind of wanting to show off and be the show off their best in front of everybody else
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:33.920]   In the industry, uh, so it's I was list I just started listening to it
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:36.960]   I was like I was just picking and choosing some of my best stuff
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:41.280]   So my favorite performers, but I mean I can't recommend this highlamp
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:45.520]   I'm so excited about this, uh, and that leads to my second pick of the pick of the week
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:48.000]   Uh, I liked it. I was so excited about it
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:53.600]   I almost dropped this just into the cd player instead of ripping them into my my music library first
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:59.120]   Uh, and so I got to but I did hold off just long enough, uh, and so uh,
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:06.000]   first time I tried a alternative to itunes, uh, it's a uh app called db power amp
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:13.040]   Uh, it's uh a really it is a heavy duty tool itunes does a million things it does
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:17.360]   Lost list rips of cd's very very well. It's very very easy to use
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:21.040]   I really don't have any real complaints about how it works as a as a cd ripper
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:26.800]   However, if you want to rip it into let's say flak format, uh, which is more compatible
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:29.680]   It's also a lossless format meaning it's still compressed
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:34.800]   But instead of making it the most uh tightly compressed and efficient, uh compression system
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:39.760]   It's this it's a smaller version that doesn't throw away any quality whatsoever
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:46.400]   So it means that if later on you want to convert that into another format you won't lose any, uh, any uh,
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:54.080]   Any quality in the transition, uh, and it's also will let you do things like let's say that the track listings are not the way you like them
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:56.560]   You could customize pretty much everything it really is
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:02.640]   It shows the legacy of being a 10 year old app that was written by a developer who wanted to solve a problem that he or she
[01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:06.480]   Was having personally so it's not as slick. It's not as easy to use as itunes
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:11.200]   But it will solve more problems. The other cool thing it does is it is super super fast
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:18.320]   Uh, when I re-ripped all of my cd's over the last year, uh, I was using itunes because it's fast as clean and sufficient
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:22.880]   Uh, and uh, but I was reading them all into apple loss apple lossless format
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:27.920]   So again not throwing anything away, but I found that my plex server for instance when I want to move
[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:33.200]   Uh, so an album onto my phone or onto my tablet. It doesn't play
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:38.800]   Uh apple lossless on this phone so it has to transcode it which is a long long step
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:42.000]   So I want to I'm in the process of converting my entire library to flak
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:47.360]   This is such a fast converter. It uses every single core. Uh, I actually wanted
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:50.720]   I want to correct myself actually try this on my iMac pro
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:56.800]   Yeah, oh my god, let me let me give let me give an example. I I took I ripped this into itunes
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:00.320]   Into a lack because I was dumb and I was too excited
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:07.040]   I'm sorry apple lossless using itunes. So then I just simply dragged it into tv power amp
[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:15.200]   32 tracks three and a half hours of music you can act it will actually show you as it's converting these to flak a compressed
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:17.440]   Uh, uh, last lossless format
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:26.000]   Every single every single core that's available on your mac and individually what track is being converted on what for it converted
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.280]   32 tracks in 29 seconds
[01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:32.560]   Uh, and it is just as easy to take the
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:40.720]   Yeah to take my entire like hundreds and hundreds of uh cd selections on my on my uh on my server
[01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:42.880]   And the next time i'm going to be leaving for the day
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:47.120]   I will just simply point this app at that entire directory and say convert it all
[01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:51.520]   And i'm sure that by the time I've I got my coat and finished washing my hands and brushing my teeth
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:54.560]   It'll be three quarters of the way done. It's not cheap. It's about
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:56.560]   $58
[01:52:56.560 --> 01:53:03.680]   Uh for not only that but also a utility that will tidy up your your library doing things like looking for missing art
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:08.080]   Looking for duplicates and letting you know that this one is high quality
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:10.320]   This one is low quality might want to throw out the low quality one
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:16.960]   But if you are like me if you don't if you didn't build your library based on apple music or spotify
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:22.080]   It really is you've really made the decision that you want files on a server or files on a hard drive
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:25.280]   Especially if you have not been a really good curator of it
[01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:31.280]   58 bucks will solve a year's worth of problems in about one afternoon of using this app
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:36.160]   So, uh, I'm I have not bought it yet. They have they have a trial mode that gives you nearly all the features
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:42.160]   Uh, but as soon as I as soon as I pick up that day to fix my entire library, I'm going to be giving them their $58
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:45.360]   I think it's worth it. I think I bought this ages ago, but they've gotten
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:52.320]   It's it's it's no one since then. Yeah. Yeah, the lace update was just about actually a couple weeks ago to the windows version of the product
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:57.440]   I will have I will have to download and and upgrade this this is a great tool
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:59.600]   Absolutely, and I just love to see all
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:02.080]   10 cores 20 threads
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:03.360]   That's again
[01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:07.600]   If you just want to if you just want to point out to somebody that doesn't that is not impressed
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:09.680]   You spent $7,000 on a new iMac
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:12.800]   Well, here is the CD here is here is the entire
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:19.200]   Catalog i'm going to convert it to mp3 then to a ac and then back to mp3 again
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:25.280]   Hey, by the way, you said it was a mistake to rip to apple lossless, but you can just convert that to flak without any loss
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:32.000]   Right exactly. I wasn't a mistake per se. It's just that I found I was wondering why it was taking so long for plex to copy something
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:38.720]   From the server to my phone. I didn't know there was I thought that it supported apple lossless because it used to be proprietary
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:42.480]   Apple decided to open it up, but the apparently plex has not updated itself
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:49.360]   And I don't know when they're going to do that, but that's the hope that that goes back to that's why when I decided to take that time to re-wrap all my CDs
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:52.320]   I made sure I re-ripped it into a lossless format
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:57.360]   It doesn't it when it's it must convert it to from apple lossless to flak
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:02.000]   It will still be compressed, but it will be the exact same quality as that original CD right
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:08.480]   Uh, yeah in fact, that's one good reason to to rip your CDs is flak or apple lossless
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:14.720]   Then you can throw the CDs out if you make sure you have good backups and you can recreate the CD at any time exactly
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:16.800]   Identically to the original
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:19.760]   Well, you're on so fastly. Oh, you can rip it before you get the CD
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:23.920]   I've gotten rid of most of my CDs. I do have the two
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:28.880]   The full beetles thing in the new sergeant pepper and I probably should re-rip those that would probably be
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:30.880]   See it's weird. I feel as though
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:35.840]   I'm entitled to have these rips along as I still have possession of the original CDs
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:38.800]   So that's and that's that's why when I was doing my move
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:43.680]   I wound up getting for the first time putting all my CDs like in one box
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:45.920]   From where they've been straying around side of the house
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:49.440]   And that's the that's the time I spent like 30 or 40 dollars for the amazon basics
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:55.920]   Like cd like binder and just throughout all the all the plastic cases most of the booklets
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:00.240]   And so I now just have these big big milk crates full of binders full of nothing
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:04.080]   But this I don't I don't know that I have to do that, but I feel as though
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:08.400]   I'm entitled to be arrogant about ripping CDs and DVDs
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:13.440]   So long as I can say aha, but I bought the DVD and I still own the c the DVD. I didn't donate it
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:16.800]   You crumb yes
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:21.200]   Yeah, I know as long as I don't sell them. I wouldn't sell them to a second answer
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:25.280]   I don't I don't feel like I need to keep the physical plastic although
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:29.040]   It's the world the earth is going to keep it no matter what I do with it
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:36.400]   Exactly somebody told me I was so depressing. You know every plastic toothbrush ever made is still in existence
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:41.280]   Got a half-life like uranium. Yeah, that's depressing
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:44.160]   Mr. Rene
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:49.120]   On the other hand I went to a coffee shop the other day and the guy said hey be careful those are compostable lids
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:50.960]   They start composting the minute we put the
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:56.160]   Fragrant
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:59.520]   Rene Richie you're pick of the week
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:02.000]   So um as I we've been talking about for a while
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:06.400]   I'm moving and I'm taking the opportunity to move as I move to retrofit
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:12.720]   I feel like I'm bringing the enterprise in and making the enterprise a to retrofit a lot of home kit into my life because I just I really
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:17.360]   Like the technology and last time I spoke about some of the cool new hue lights that I was trying out this time
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:21.760]   I know we I believe we've picked it previously, but I got the august smart lock
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:23.840]   I've not had an august smart lock before
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:27.600]   Because at my old place it had one of those lever doors that was not compatible with it
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:30.480]   But my new place had a lock that did work with it
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:35.360]   So I I bought it I put it in and it's got the um the pro version
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:37.840]   Which gives you a little hub that you can put on your network as well
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:42.160]   And it works like basically any other smart lock will and I have it set up with home kit as well
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:46.640]   You don't necessarily have to use home kit. You can use the app. You can use home kit. You can use other services
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:52.640]   I just find it easy too. I just love the idea of saying, you know, siri opened the door that kind of thing
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:55.680]   And apple does require authentication when you do this
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:58:00.560]   They don't want someone to be able to for example stick their head in your window and say schlomo open the door
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:02.720]   And it just opens and then they rush into your house
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:04.560]   So you do how do they solve that?
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:06.960]   You have to use touch ID or face ID to authenticate
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:09.280]   When you do it and it'll do it as part of the process
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:13.760]   Like I can say it and it'll say your iphone has to be and then it has a saying unlocked my face ID is working
[01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:17.120]   That's where you're talking because somebody asked me the other day. Well, what if somebody sticks their head in your windows?
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:20.640]   Yeah
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:25.840]   Anything that requires a lock anything security based garage doors locks alarms all of that requires
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:31.200]   Biometric or passcode authentication before it will trigger. You do it remotely though. Could you have it unlocked for somebody?
[01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:37.200]   You you absolutely so the way I have it set up is still needs but so I could be and in fact
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:43.280]   I had to run out last night unexpectedly and I had contractors and they'd gone out and I had to let them back in
[01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:45.680]   So I just told them that I'm not there right now
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:50.720]   But as soon as they get there let me know and I said hey slo mo unlocked my door and slo mo
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:57.520]   Perfectly content that I wasn't there unlocked my door and let me let them in and I got a home kit notification saying your front door is unlocked
[01:58:57.520 --> 01:59:04.400]   And it's got a little door sensor. So I know if it's a jar or closed or open and I can lock it again. Oh, that's nice
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:10.560]   Absolutely and it and you can choose you don't have to put it on the internet if you don't want to know some people are concerned about
[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:15.440]   um attack vectors or secure just in general about putting their their home automation
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:20.080]   On the internet the the little box that you plug into the wall is an extra you don't have to use it
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:24.800]   I just found it convenient because I'm going to be traveling and I need to do some sort of remote access stuff
[01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:27.600]   But you can use the app itself. You can select friends
[01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:31.040]   It makes it has a picture of you and when you when you create a friend's account
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:34.160]   Gets a picture of them so you can see who's asking for access
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:39.920]   And you can do various automation things like you could say if it has if the door is unlocked wait two minutes and then automatically
[01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:43.360]   Unlock it where some people like because it lessens the chance of them
[01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:47.600]   Forgetting to lock it. I personally it increases the chance of me locking myself out
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:50.560]   So i'm on the fence about whether i'm going to use that or not
[01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:54.720]   Um, but it's really good and when you start to get into home kit
[01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:56.960]   It has a lot of flexibility
[01:59:56.960 --> 02:00:01.920]   I think it has more flexibility than people imagine and more than some other systems too because you can have the room setup
[02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:06.240]   But you can also have sets of accessories inside of rooms setup
[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:10.560]   And so for example, I have a hallway and I have a set called entrance that's in the hallway
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:15.840]   Um, and you can set up these good night routines or good morning routines and you could say just like good night
[02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:18.960]   Or I like to use the wet like crash the crash the west wing
[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:23.760]   Uh, and then everything just goes into lockdown and the lights turn red, but you know, I don't use that that often
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:28.640]   Um, but it's really cool and you can you can i've let people in now without having to get up
[02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:30.720]   And that's the laziest most
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:35.120]   Rediculous thing ever, but I want to test it out. You can just let someone in they'll come in
[02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:37.600]   Hey, how are you and it's not that you've left your door open
[02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:41.920]   It's that you knew they were on their way in and you just timed it to unlock so so far
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:44.640]   And from the outside you cannot tell that you have a smart door
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:50.240]   I know some some of them uh like slag has a version where you have a keypad and it's obviously a home kit lock
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:55.120]   And some people don't like it because they think that it tells people you have a smart lock and then it invites people to try to hack it
[02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:59.120]   This from the outside looks it is it is doesn't look like your lock. It is your lock
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:01.200]   It's only the inside part
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:06.240]   That changes and it's still manual you can turn the giant knob if you want to to manually lock it or unlock it
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:09.680]   And you still get a notification of someone is manually locking it or unlocking it
[02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:11.840]   So I've been very impressed with it so far
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:15.200]   Is it particularly satisfying when you turn the giant knob
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:18.720]   It's it's almost like you're in an airlock leo and you're just like shh
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:18.800]   Shh
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:18.800]   Shh
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:18.800]   Shh
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:24.640]   And then it closes and it goes green it goes really when it's open and it goes red and goes to room when it's closed
[02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:28.320]   Uh, and it makes you like it's not like a star trek or star where a sliding door
[02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:35.200]   But it's the closest i'm going to come in in the in the foreseeable future. So i'm i'm happy you had me a sliding door
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:42.400]   I'm going to get the door help. I've avoided you know, we have just regular normal keys and locks in our house, but this might be
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:46.720]   This might be the way to go you still have the lock is from the outside
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:49.680]   It's the same lock so you can still use a key to lock it or unlock it if you want
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:54.000]   Like you can go battle star galac if if the silence take over and still have manual access
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:02.720]   But it's just there and it works with apple watch and you don't need to do the authentication because apple watch is already authenticated based on staying on your wrist and reading your pulse
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:06.800]   So a lot of times I can just say schlomo on my apple watch and it'll just well actually all the time now
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:09.280]   It just opens and closes. I don't have to reach from my phone
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:13.120]   Which is great if i'm carrying a box or or something and I don't want to have to actually stop
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:16.000]   Over your existing knob. Yeah
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.200]   It doesn't go over it if you pull out the back of the dead
[02:02:19.200 --> 02:02:21.840]   And you put this on instead of the back of the dead ball. Oh
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:29.520]   That's the black so it only modifies the back the front is the same. It's still the keys. Oh, wow. What a good idea
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:34.320]   Yeah, I really like it's not one. It's not janky. It actually it works pretty well and all that
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:39.040]   Yep. No. Yeah. No, it's so far. It's so good and you can get I believe there's two colors
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:43.040]   There's like silver and black and I had brass before so I got the black one because I figured yeah
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:45.280]   It would do it much better. Yeah, we have uh
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:50.160]   Yeah, that hand rubbed bronze or whatever the hell they call it. Nothing matches
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:53.200]   Yeah, it's a collectically. We call that a collective
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:03:00.960]   August calm very nice. I think this is the one stacy also as rec they do have keypads and they do have other versions too
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:04.080]   If you any do have a new doorbell, which doesn't all actually look like a doorbell
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:07.360]   So it might be confusing for some people but there is doorbell like technology there
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:10.960]   You see that thing that's not a doorbell, but it is a doorbell. Press that
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:14.800]   Uh cool cool
[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:20.560]   Which one do you have the smart lock smart like pro the smart lock pro and like you press the front of it that panel pops off
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:22.560]   There's two batteries in there because it is battery powered
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:26.960]   And it's got the home kit tags. You can just scan it and add it right to your home kit environment neat
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:32.160]   Very good. Thanks for the recommendation both of you. Thank you for being here today
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:34.320]   You find Andy
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:41.760]   At cw ob.com. That's his website of course on the chicago suntimes at i h n a t k o on the twitter

[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:54.960]   Can I mention something else? Plug your plug your show or whatever else. Yes. Yeah, no, I just uh, I've been doing occasional like tech segments for
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:58.560]   uh wgbh public radio here in boston
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:03.600]   And my next one is on friday and as of there, I know an official the official tech
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:05.120]   contributor to
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:06.640]   Nice
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:10.720]   So basically it's still very little changes except for now
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:15.840]   I get to have the 1974 style like blazer jacket with a patch for the you know, whatever
[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:22.880]   But yeah, but so basically every couple of weeks depends on our schedules. I come on and I talk for about half hour
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:27.120]   Uh about whenever topics are kind of interesting the expone is on friday
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:34.400]   The other cool thing is that these usually happen at the wgbh public radio studios inside the boston public library
[02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:38.400]   So if you see me tweet out an announcement about my next appearance
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:43.120]   Go to the go to the cafe. There's a cafe. You can get coffee. You can get a cookie
[02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:50.320]   And you can listen to me blather on and see how how many notes I actually have in front of me when i'm pretending to be speaking
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:54.880]   Extemporaneously, I grew up listening to wgbh. I'm a huge fan
[02:04:54.880 --> 02:05:00.560]   Every time I just I'm just tickled bank. That's where I first heard the hitchhiker's guide of the galaxy and I still
[02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:03.440]   I still hear from wgbh in boston
[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:08.800]   And I never forget it. So it's really that's kind of that's pretty darn cool
[02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:13.920]   So i'm gonna i'm gonna call you wgbh contributor and the anaco from now. Yes, exactly
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:18.160]   I'm very i'm very very proud of that. Yeah, and I just I just also wanted to just praise
[02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:20.000]   the people there
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000]   uh jim and marjorie, uh, it's like
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:22.400]   I
[02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:25.440]   And you know, I bet rene has had this experience as well
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:30.400]   Sometimes you get the you get called to be invited to be on tv or on the radio
[02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:35.360]   And they really do want to talk about the well, wow they're gonna cancel the iphone 10
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:39.120]   Wow, it's a really big failure or like when I was doing stuff for cbs
[02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:43.920]   It was wonderful, but they really just wanted me to bring some gadgets every month and show off gadgets
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:48.320]   And I would really work hard to try to what if what if we were to there's a really good issue
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:53.280]   We could talk about and they're okay. Just to go. Okay, fine. Here's our robot dog. We're as they love
[02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:59.440]   Every every time I suggest like the we we talk about the we discuss the topics beforehand
[02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:02.000]   But and every time I send them my list and my breakdowns
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:05.840]   It's like three of them will be like policy issues and i'll see that on their list
[02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:11.040]   They already had three of those on there. So I really enjoy coming in and talking about them
