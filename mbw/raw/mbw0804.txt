[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly on back. Thanks to Michael Sargent for doing it last week.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.160]   Now Alex Lindsey is out, but we do have Renee Ritchie and Andy Enoco.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.160]   We will talk about the rumors. March 8th is the magic date.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.200]   Apple quarterly results. I get to weigh in a little bit on that one.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.120]   And of course Apple's response to the Dutch dating apps.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.000]   It's all coming up. And by the way, before I get into the show,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.520]   I just want to ask you to help us out just a little bit by indulging in our annual survey.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.200]   We do this every year as a way to get to know you better.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.160]   It helps us sell advertising, but it also helps us plan programming.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.720]   So we can make your experience even better.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.280]   We'll just take a few minutes. We do it once a year.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.520]   Of course it's completely voluntary, but it would be much appreciated.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.760]   Go to twit.tv/survey22 to take it.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.840]   And thanks in advance. Now, all about the show.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.680]   Podcasts you love.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.680]   From people you trust.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.120]   This is twit.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:16.840]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 804, recorded Tuesday, February 8th, 2022.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.760]   Canadian magic.

[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.200]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.480]   Alex Lindsay has the day off heading to LA for something probably has to do with a Super Bowl, my guess.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.360]   But we've got Renee Ritchie here from youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.360]   Hello, youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.240]   Hello, Leo LaPolter.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.280]   It's wonderful, wonderful to have you back.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.960]   Good to see you.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.440]   Oh, yes.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.360]   Thank you, Micah, for filling in for me last week.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.800]   I really appreciate it.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.440]   Lisa and I...
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.440]   We love Micah, but we miss you.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.920]   Lisa and I took a day off, basically, a couple of days off.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.200]   And went down to Carmel by the sea, which I'm happy to report is in fact by the sea.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.000]   Andy and I coz also hear W.G.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.280]   B.H. Bolsom.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.520]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.040]   Hello.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.040]   I am also by the sea.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.040]   I can confirm that we...
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.040]   By the sea.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.040]   So basically, that's part of the service that we offer.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.040]   Occasionally, we will send a representative about to make sure that the west coast is anchored
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.440]   and the east coast is anchored by water.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.520]   We are holding them down on each end.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.400]   With our big fat geek butts.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.880]   Andy, actually, are you...
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.880]   Did the snow melt?
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.960]   Did you get a second storm?
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.560]   What's the situation there?
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.560]   New England.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.120]   Very light.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.200]   It's like the last week or so we got the big storm.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.480]   Over here, it settled down to about 16 inches.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.360]   Not far away, we got like 22, something like that.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.760]   But of course, because this is 2022 and not like 1982 and the climate is what it is,
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.760]   there is nothing.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.760]   We used to melt it.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.760]   Yeah, again, I hate to be one of those nostalgic folks but it used to be that there would be
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.760]   a shipment of snow that would last you through the rest of the winter through March and now
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.480]   it's like, no, it's a lease program.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.960]   They brought it in for a photo shoot for about four or five days.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.640]   You get to shoot your next Christmas card.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.600]   You get a few good Instagram posts.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.680]   But then, boom.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.680]   It's a circle.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.880]   I asked because my mom is near you and I always want to know.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.440]   I talked to mom, of course, but I was wanting to know how she's doing and how's the weather
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.440]   and all that stuff.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.840]   No, but it wasn't bad.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.360]   We didn't even lose power.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.320]   It was, I bought all kinds of baking stuff just for almost for no reason whatsoever.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.360]   I thought the wall, in case we get snowed in for a couple of days, I'll have cookies.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.360]   It's a cake.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.360]   I'll have cakes.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.880]   It'll be a festival and unfortunately it won't.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.880]   So unfortunately, they have to.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.880]   It's all been inevitable, murder.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.920]   Also with us, no, no, that's it.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.920]   That's the two of you.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.760]   It's the three of us today.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.760]   That makes it easy.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.680]   That makes it easy.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.680]   Big announcement.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.960]   A couple of big announcements.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.360]   Apple empowers businesses to accept contactless payments through tap to pay on the iPhone.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.680]   You now have an iPhone payment device.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.480]   Cash register in your hand, Leo.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.480]   That's pretty cool.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.480]   That's interesting.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.240]   It's not simple person to person payment.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.480]   It's not as though you could simply walk up to somebody and then exchange money just
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.320]   by doing a tap advice.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.680]   What they're doing is they're eliminating all of these like Stripe devices where it is
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.680]   a Stripe device.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.680]   It's a device plugged in.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.680]   Well, that's the funny thing.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.680]   They're going to use Stripe as the back end.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.080]   By the way, Stripe is a sponsor.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.880]   The big, well, actually it's broader than that.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:14.440]   Basically, they're saying that approved transactors like again, like Stripe.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.040]   You can have access to just use the hardware directly from one iOS device to another iOS
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.040]   device.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:27.400]   If you already have an account with Stripe and you just bump into somebody in the village
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.920]   who says, "Oh, wow, that's right.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.800]   Can you come buy and redo my deck?"
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.560]   Got a couple of broken steps.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.560]   Great.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.200]   Just to hear, I'll go down to Home Depot.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.400]   Just give me $400 or whatever for lumber.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.400]   Just do the payment like a phone to phone right there.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.720]   So they're encouraging this as a sort of a more casual business relationship.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.520]   Again, not a personal person to person transfer stuff.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.840]   It's not going to be like how Apple Pay or like how PayPal's sometimes used.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.440]   Yeah, they already have Apple Pay.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.440]   So you can do that.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.440]   Yeah, it's a cash register.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.280]   I just say my hair cutter with Apple Pay.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.920]   And it's more like a farmer's market.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.920]   You're there.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.920]   You're selling your zucchini.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.920]   Here's your picture.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.920]   You don't have a whole cash register.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.760]   But see, this is what's cool.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.480]   And I suspect that's who's going to use it is people who would be using Square or Stripe
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.440]   or some other, you know, if you have Square, you have to have an iPad and there's a whole
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.960]   process and they tap their watch.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.840]   Although now they just don't need the Square dongle.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.840]   I think it's still use Square.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.120]   Like it might benefit Square if not having to make all that hardware.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.920]   They can just be the transaction process.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.160]   It doesn't require Stripe.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.680]   Stripe's the first to say we're going to be supporting.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.440]   In fact, I think they're already taking signups for the, because it's not out yet, but it'll
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.440]   be out sometimes.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.920]   Does this mean that Apple's going to magically start adding NFC to the future iPads?
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.560]   Because right now it's iPhone only.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.560]   Oh, interesting.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.040]   I think a lot of people would love to have iPads.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.600]   What's interesting also to me is Apple could have done this at any time.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.200]   I mean, the hardware was there.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.000]   It's been there for several generations, right?
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Yes.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.840]   There was nothing stopping them from doing this.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.840]   The hardware was there.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.920]   Maybe just the infrastructure wasn't there.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:09.120]   I mean, this isn't just an iPhone to iPhone payment system.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.360]   And this isn't important enough to them that they actually have a news release on newsroom.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.880]   This is just something that you're just finding out as a part of a developer update.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.880]   And part of the package that they're sending out is, hey, look, here's somebody at the
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.880]   farmer's market.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.200]   Like I said, with an actual just tap to pay MasterCard.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.440]   It's not just a phone to phone sort of thing.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.520]   So I can't imagine what had to be done at the back end to make sure that this is actually
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.120]   going to work and that people are going to actually consider this to be trustworthy.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.920]   Is there a, yeah, that's the other question.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.560]   Is there a security?
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.600]   Well, not a concern, but they built it.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.600]   They've baked it right into everything.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.560]   So the transact is the same way that Apple paid us.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.280]   So through the secure element and Apple doesn't get any access to any of your transactions.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.280]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.720]   And yeah, the other thing that's interesting to me is like the way that Apple's rolling
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.440]   is that it's not through Apple.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.520]   It's through whoever the payment processor like Stripe that you're using.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.400]   It's also using the hardware channel.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.440]   It works with Shopify's point of sale app as well.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.960]   So Apple gets no, they don't get a cut and they don't get any visibility into it.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.960]   That's interesting.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.320]   No, but I think that's calculated.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.360]   I think that in several jurisdictions, Apple is fighting over whether they have proprietary
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.000]   control over NFC.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.840]   And that's something that some people are looking to regulate because there's no, you
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.240]   can't get like Samsung pay on your iPhone.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.120]   And a lot of developers didn't have access to NFC the way they do on Android, but also
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.440]   Apple has got Apple cash and they've got Apple pay in the US only.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.120]   And this is US only as well.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.160]   But having that sort of relationship, like Apple could do this themselves.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.520]   But I think they're starting to be a little bit more tactical and strategic about how they
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.480]   see ownership of core technologies on iOS.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.680]   And the financial one seems to be the one that they're doing that with first.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.040]   Very interesting.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.480]   Once tap to pay iPhone becomes on iPhone becomes available, it says.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.360]   So that's 15.2.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.360]   What is it for?
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.440]   Today's beta.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.440]   It's in today's beta.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.440]   Yeah, point two.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.440]   Okay, good.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.360]   Merchants will be able to unlock contactless payment acceptance through supporting iOS app
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.560]   on an iPhone 10s or later.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.880]   So it really has been around the capability.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.200]   Anyway, the hardware capability has been around for some time.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.920]   At checkout, the merchant will simply prompt the customer to hold their iPhone or Apple
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.120]   watch to pay with Apple pay.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.360]   Apple pays had a big, a big boost from COVID hasn't it?
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.000]   I use touchless now all the time.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.840]   That's something you want to see in the US.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.400]   Nobody wants money.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.320]   They don't touch me, man.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.320]   Yep.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.320]   Just go.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.040]   You've become Europe in Canada, Leo.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.760]   Do you not have it?
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.680]   No, we've been like that for like 20 years.
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.160]   Oh, I see with your credit cards.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.400]   20 years and so is Europe.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.080]   And with Apple pay, like, I remember they had Singleton once and I picked up a bunch of
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.720]   Apple people from the airport and brought them there and I tapped to pay for gas on the
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.720]   way and they're like, what is that?
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.720]   Canadian magic?
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.640]   No, this is how the rest of the world.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.640]   Canadian magic.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.640]   That's what we call it.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.120]   And it's still weird because like you go to the US and you put out your credit card and
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.640]   they take it and they leave with it.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.640]   What is happening?
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.640]   Oh, I know.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:06.520]   But Apple says it's already accepted at more than 90% of US retailers.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.360]   That's incredible penetration.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:14.560]   And that's about contactless payments as a whole.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.640]   Yeah, usually you get Apple pay and Android pay.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:25.040]   You realize that the historically funny thing is that banks in the United States have always
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:31.000]   had the have always been running the numbers and said that whatever fraud, whatever fraud
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.560]   retailers suffer as a result of insecure mag swipes and just handing over the card, it
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.240]   costs us a lot less than actually having to update all the terminals, update all the software,
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.760]   also do all the retraining we need to do for all of our customers in order to make that
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.760]   work.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.240]   And they've always been just simply willing to pay the fees.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.920]   And also, I saw another report that said that they're actually making more money off
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:11:00.240]   of the fees that they were charging retailers to cover losses actually exceeded the amount
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.040]   of losses that they were suffering due to fraud.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.520]   So there are a couple of reasons why there wasn't a whole lot of incentive for banks to
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.840]   switch all of their payment platforms over to contactless payments.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:17.840]   But really, it's one of those things where I'm sure all of you have the same thing.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:24.120]   Like the first time that oftentimes we got contactless payment devices before the people
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.960]   behind the registers did.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.160]   And like you see the little symbol on the new key on the new terminal that got installed
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.160]   on the wall screens.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.160]   What did you just do?
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.160]   Like I just paid with my phone.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.160]   How does that work?
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:40.800]   I was like, oh, I want to my best experiences as I walked into.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.800]   I forget what it was.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.520]   It was at the airport and I went and I just tapped my watch and they're like, what is
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.520]   that?
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.520]   And the thing went beat, but it worked.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.280]   I said, I paid with my watch.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.080]   And then the next time I came through the same moment I was speaking to held up her watch
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.160]   with like this giant smile on her face.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.160]   Yes.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.040]   So I would guess by now everybody knows and it's no longer magic.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.160]   Canadian magic will also work with credit cards.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.160]   However, Apple says, yeah, tap to pay on iPhone, which I'm going to call TTPOI from now
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.160]   on.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.160]   No, I'm not.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.160]   Well, no, I'm not.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.080]   We'll work with contactless credit and debit cards, including Amex Discover Mastercard
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.080]   of Visa.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.620]   Is that if I have a chip, chip card, is that contactless or is there something special
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:19.620]   addition?
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:20.620]   Yeah.
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.620]   Well, I think you need a little symbol, the little Wi-Fi.
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.600]   Oh, I wanted a Canadian magic symbol.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.600]   Yes.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.600]   Now I have.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.880]   I wonder if it'll work with Android devices that can project payments as though they're
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.520]   a credit card because it's sort of has to, right?
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.520]   I don't think there's any way.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.520]   Samsung, that's a Samsung thing where it acts like a mag stripe.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.520]   Right?
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.080]   No, this wouldn't be a mag reader, but it would be a, it would be like a credit card
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.080]   projector.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.080]   Apple's own card does not have any magic symbols on it.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.400]   No, it doesn't have any symbols on it, Leo.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.400]   It's an apple card.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.400]   You stick it with work.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.840]   Oh, I love that sound.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.640]   Can you contact us pay with an apple card?
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.400]   I don't know.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.400]   They don't have that in case.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.400]   See, it's really interesting that the US is a credit card.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.960]   It's all over the studio.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.240]   It's such a competitive banking environment that they can find banks and institutions
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.640]   that will do all of this with them, where other countries have oligopolies that they
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.840]   want nothing to do with Apple.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.320]   They don't need premium cards.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.960]   They don't feel like they have to offer us anything.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.240]   So in most of the world, none of these things exist.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:19.360]   Look, this MX card, you can't see the number.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.360]   You can't see the number.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.360]   Don't show the number.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.360]   No, go ahead, John.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.360]   You can't see the number.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.240]   I'm covering the only number you could see, but it has a little, it looks like a Wi-Fi
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.240]   thing.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.640]   That's the, there it is.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.400]   That's the touch to pay, huh?
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.920]   I'm covering up the only number that's on the front.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:42.800]   But the fact that I have been a customer since 1980, which just basically says, this has...
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.880]   And you're known as LG LaPods.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.880]   You're known as well.
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.880]   My is well.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:46.880]   My is well, B80 years.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.300]   Your first pay, your first purpose was a Bay City rollers album.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.300]   Hey, hey.
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.300]   Do Larop.
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.300]   Do Larop.
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.300]   Hey, hey.
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.000]   LG Laport, your author name?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   I don't know why American Express decided to call me LG Laport.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   I think that was a...
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.480]   That's LG Laport.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.960]   He's visiting from the channels.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.640]   My Visa signature card does not have that.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.960]   But my business card does, so that's good.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.960]   So my cards have it.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.760]   Well, of course, because you have Canadian magic on your side.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.760]   Magic, that's true.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.800]   We here in America, do things the old-fashioned one.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.800]   America.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.040]   We got those things where you go, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, and they get put there.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.240]   Oh, but you have these, like you have Apple Card, you have Apple Cash, you have all these
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.640]   things the rest of the world does not.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.200]   You don't have an Apple Card?
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.040]   I'm not bitter.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.040]   You have all the banking in the market.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.040]   You have all the banking in the market.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.040]   You have all the banking in the market.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.040]   So it's okay.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.880]   No, we only have the queue, we only have the queue and the...
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.520]   And the supremacy truckers.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.920]   You've got the coo-coo truckers.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.880]   You can't have them back.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.680]   You can't hear them all the way in Montreal, right?
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.680]   You can have...
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.680]   They tried.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.680]   They got confused by the lack of input code signs on their way.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.040]   Well, this is froster.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.880]   I'm LG Laport of the Providence Laports.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.880]   That's right.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.880]   The Providence.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.280]   The Providence.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.280]   The Newport Laports.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:04.720]   Anyway, that's... it's interesting that Apple has had this capability since '10 at the
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.800]   '10s.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.360]   It took them...
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.360]   What does that mean?
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.680]   It took them three or four years to do this, but they did it and did it.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.800]   That's exciting.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.120]   Now if you're in the Netherlands, it's not so exciting.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.120]   And it's really interesting.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.120]   It's really interesting.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.240]   Before you go on, maybe it's what you said.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.760]   Maybe it is COVID that has increased the demand for contactless payment and Apple saw an
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.760]   opportunity.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.760]   Oh, really?
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.760]   The most recent years.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:34.680]   In fact, if you really want to globalize, it's the best thing that ever happened to technology.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:40.240]   All the tech companies have vastly increased in value thanks to quarantine.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.400]   It's been a very good thing for the tech sector.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.400]   Not so much so much.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.400]   That's for our psychology, good for technology.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.400]   For us.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.080]   Or restaurants.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.960]   I can't believe the number of restaurants and small businesses that are just gone, just
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.280]   gone, blasted off.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.440]   We lost a franchise as we got a bunch of mom and pops that I'm really happy about because
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.680]   they're all cooking authentic food.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.480]   It's not just another burger coming off the shelf.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.480]   Good.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.480]   A couple of the big franchises are suffering here.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.480]   In the United States.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:11.080]   Like the world famous Apple bees where everything's microwaved whether you want it or not.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.080]   We lost Taco Bell.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.080]   They just they quit the moment.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.080]   What?
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.080]   Last month.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.080]   Yep.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.080]   Oh, no, that's not that's not okay.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.120]   Jeff Jarvis is never going to go to Canada then.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.720]   But we have but we have real Taco Bell.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.120]   We have real Mexican restaurants now, which we didn't have before.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.920]   It's like three of them opened.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.920]   Actually, isn't that that is so funny.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.880]   Here we are in California where you would think obviously no one's going to go to Taco
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.880]   Bell.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:40.040]   In fact, the best taco truck in town is right across the street from Taco Bell.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:46.400]   And nevertheless, there's a long line around the block to get Doritos tacos or something,
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.400]   whatever it is.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.360]   Play made with crack.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.360]   Something.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.360]   Super sent pure.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:58.800]   My usual Wednesday morning diner with a couple of friends like closed down unfortunately.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.800]   So sad.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.800]   You love that diner.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.400]   Was that the one you always talk about?
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.440]   The good news is that after some months on the market, it got bought and fortunately
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:18.560]   because this is like a really authentic like 1960s diner like a gleaming metal beautiful
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.560]   inside.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.520]   My fear was that there was someone's just going to knock it down and put something boring
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.520]   there.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.760]   And so it's no longer a diner diner.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.960]   It's like a come in, get a cup of coffee, get a pastry, leave sort of place.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.560]   But again, Anatinevica, nothing gold can stay.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:36.560]   Bye.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.560]   Touch dating apps.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.560]   Okay.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.560]   Touch dating apps.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.560]   You brought it up.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.560]   It's not my fault.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.560]   Wow.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.960]   There is some salt in the air over this whole thing.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.960]   Oh, God.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.920]   So the Dutch just to case you, it's the Mr. Burns of law departments.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:59.720]   In case you missed the previously on Mac break weekly, Apple was instructed by Netherlands
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:06.560]   regulators to offer alternative payment systems to Dutch dating apps.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.560]   We're still only dating apps.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:16.800]   And Apple, you know, had given no alternative, although I think they were fined.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:18.800]   Okay.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.800]   Five million euros.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.800]   Five million euros.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.160]   Cash change for not for violating it.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.160]   Pocket change.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.160]   Pocket change.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:32.560]   So Apple did respond in a way that not only must have irritated Dutch regulators, although
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.040]   they haven't said anything yet, it seems to have irritated people like Stephen Trout
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:42.520]   and Smith and Marco Arment who flipped them the digital bird on Twitter over this.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.520]   Wait a minute.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.520]   Is it Twitter the digital bird?
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.520]   Digital bird.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.640]   It was flipped, the done bin flipped.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.320]   Apple said, okay, fine.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.280]   And I think they said it just like that.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.280]   Fine.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.280]   Fine.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.280]   Fine.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.280]   We're going to, here's what you're going to do.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:02.280]   We're going to give you a 3% discount because that's, it turns out, roughly the amount of
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.440]   money the credit card fees would be.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.800]   So you only pay 27% will be billing you for that, of course.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.640]   And for Apple, not for developers, by the way, Apple gets a good deal on those process.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.240]   So in fact, this may end up costing developers more because if they want to put their own
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:23.240]   store in and have to pay credit card fees to other companies, it could be 4% or 5%.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.600]   Anyway, so it act and there's so many, it's so onerous.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.680]   You have to create a separate app just for that.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:35.240]   And there's a, you have to request a store kit external purchase entitlement or the store
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.320]   kit external purchase link entitlement.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.160]   After we're an embarrassing hack.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.240]   You have to wear funny hat.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.240]   Really?
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.120]   And blah, blah, blah.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:50.360]   Anyway, so Apple responded, but it's like paying your bill, your utility bill with pennies.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.600]   It's one of those kind of like, up yours.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.680]   Well, we saw this with the Korean place too.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.560]   Like Google offered 4% off in Korea.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.960]   Apple's offering 3%.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.520]   And it feels like there's an utter desperation to make sure that they understand that they
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.120]   ascribe zero value to the credit card transaction processing and that everything else that they
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.760]   provide in their environment, that is the 27 or 12%.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.760]   Thank you very much.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.760]   Alex Lindsey were here.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.280]   I will channel him.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.080]   He would say they're right.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.800]   But you know, that's all you need to know about that.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.600]   Stephen Troughton Smith, absolutely, this is tweet, absolutely vile.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.960]   This says everything about Tim Cook's apple and what it thinks of developers.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.240]   I hope the company gets exactly what it deserves.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.560]   Everybody on their executive team should be ashamed.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.000]   Some of them should not be here when it's all over.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.560]   We all see you.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.560]   Wow.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:50.600]   Marco Arment wrote, "You can just feel how much they despise having to do any of this."
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:58.360]   And I'm not sure I would, I think Stephen may be a little strong, but Marco is factual.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.160]   You can feel how much they despise doing this.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:07.560]   I don't know what the Dutch regulators' response is going to be.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.560]   Another 5 million.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.360]   Another 5 million euros, I guess.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:17.680]   They were very upset after the original judgment of two weeks ago.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:24.680]   They said that, "Well, Apple claimed to the government that, 'Oh, we are complying with
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.680]   this order.'"
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.520]   And they said, "No, you just said that you're figuring out how you're going to do it.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.520]   That is not equating.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.760]   That's not the same thing as actually doing it.
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:39.880]   That's what precipitated this incredibly mature and even handed."
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.600]   They're going to get their 5 million euros in pennies.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.080]   I could tell you right now.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.080]   No, exactly.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.280]   It's like, this is kind of the dumbest.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:52.680]   This is like asking a 6-year-old child, "Did you brush your teeth?"
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.680]   And they said, "Yes."
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.480]   And he said, "Okay, I can smell your breath."
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.440]   And he said, "Oh, well, you didn't see I did I brush my teeth tonight?"
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.600]   He was like, "Oh, God."
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.400]   Do I really have to do this?
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:06.760]   Marco says, "After you take your roughly 3% payment processor, Apple's 27% commission
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.520]   takes you right back up to 30%.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.520]   Glorious.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.200]   Come on," Marco says.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.720]   This is comedy.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.880]   Amazing, ridiculous comedy.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:18.120]   I'd be surprised if a single app ever took them up on this and that's exactly what I
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.120]   did.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.120]   That's the whole point though.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.120]   That's the point.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.520]   But the other thing is that the Dutch Regulator said that Apple had to let them have both
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.400]   options and Apple's answer was, "Well, they can choose one or the other and that just goes.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.800]   We have a very different understanding of the word both."
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.800]   Both.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.800]   Right.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.800]   So 5 million euros and other...
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.800]   This is the third week now.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:38.480]   They're going to be paying the 5 million euros, which again, given Apple's spectacular
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.440]   revenue, we're going to get to that.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.440]   Isn't really...
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.680]   It just seems so odd because Apple is usually really good at understanding markets and
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.400]   understanding what a minimal, delightful product is on a market.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.120]   And obviously that's not their intention.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.120]   But just think that...
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.200]   You look at South Korea, you look at Japan, you look at...
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.720]   This is a global problem and it is stupefying to me that they have not gotten out ahead
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.120]   of this, that they're not only so far behind it, but they're dragging their feet like a
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.720]   dead corpse along the way.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.840]   It just doesn't seem like good strategy.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.360]   I absolutely agree.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:13.960]   If they think that this is just someone little freakish government with this weird dictator
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:18.400]   that's just making this off the top of their head demand that no one else is...
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.520]   That's not a problem in any place else and they can just simply fight this out, this
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.520]   is something...
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.800]   They're going to have to change how they do business worldwide.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.800]   They're going to...
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.600]   Not only that, but they will not...
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.720]   They will not be able to continue to do business worldwide.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:35.320]   They're going to have to do business individually with individual countries adapting to individual
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.320]   laws.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.320]   And states.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.320]   Exactly.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:42.440]   To say nothing of state regulators, if federal legislation in the United States doesn't come
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.440]   aboard.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:48.560]   And this is why I get really, really upset/disappointed with Apple.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:55.040]   It's how disingenuous and how casually disingenuous they are that when it comes down to, "Hi,
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:02.160]   Apple, I noticed that you pulled down all apps in this country that will give the users
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:07.680]   of iPhones in that country some defense over inhumane and onerous surveillance by the
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.680]   government that allows the government to control their lives."
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.680]   I was like, "Oh, gosh.
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:13.680]   What can we do?
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.800]   We have to comply with every single law in all the countries in which our app stores.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.760]   We can't do anything about it.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.760]   We're just...
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:22.760]   We can't do anything.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.680]   But you ask them to do something that affects their bottom line that is fundamentally something
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.280]   they don't want to do.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.000]   And they will just basically flip the bird at this government.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.720]   They will just simply say, "Great.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.720]   Make us.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.800]   We can continue to find us five or six year-old a week.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:42.120]   See how long our work chest for fighting this lasts against your government's ability
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.600]   to keep the appeals process going."
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.600]   All right.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.520]   I'm going to channel Alex Blinsey briefly.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.200]   Hold on.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:57.200]   Apple doesn't care what Dutch regulators or developers of Dutch dating apps or whatever
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:02.200]   think, Apple cares what the users want and their...
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.200]   Sorry.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.920]   Now I know why Alex is mad at you.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.480]   See, I promised Alex I wouldn't do that.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.840]   I didn't promise you that we'd do that.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:13.840]   Okay.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:14.840]   Well, but okay.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:20.560]   I'm going to channel Rumsleg here and say, "This is for the benefit of the users and
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.560]   Apple really..."
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.360]   And you know what?
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.360]   There's some merit in that.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.280]   You shouldn't really care that much.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.760]   Developers are still getting a good deal compared to what Ingram Microcharged when you
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.000]   had to shrink wrap software.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.480]   And you know, Apple wants to make the users happy and users...
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.480]   I would argue...
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.600]   It's easier for users just to go through Apple.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.880]   I would argue that it's ultimately not a successful strike.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.280]   It's not a strategy that can win for them.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.440]   And what's going to happen is all these laws are going to pop up like Andy was saying on
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.640]   a state-by-state, region-by-region basis.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.280]   It's going to be a nightmare not just for Apple, but for end users.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.560]   Right now there's a unified store that when you travel, when you go...
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.600]   When you live in different places, it doesn't matter.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.600]   Everything just works the way it works.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.360]   Except it is already broken because Apple doesn't let you make in-app transactions for
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.320]   digital goods via the web.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.120]   So you still got to do that stupid dance, which is not in the benefit of users going
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.920]   to websites and things like that.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.840]   And Apple has an opportunity here because things are changing so rapidly in a global
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:23.800]   stage to be ahead of it, to think of a solution that's not rooted in 2008 when this was all
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.280]   brand new and they could make an app console.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.520]   And that really was for the best.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.760]   They have a chance here to really modernize how all of this works.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.520]   And it just seems like they're not seizing that opportunity, that they're protecting
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:40.400]   services revenue and the control of the app store in spite of both themselves and the
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.400]   customer.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.480]   And not even mind developers.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.880]   Developers are always third or fourth on the list, but just in spite of themselves and the
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:46.880]   customers.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:52.400]   So the point is, well taken, that customers don't.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.080]   They don't really care about this.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:58.520]   The Apple users are big for another way to pay.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:04.080]   I would just quickly say that making the customer happy is another area in which Apple
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:10.160]   is not always but often disingenuous in which, again, ask them to make a choice that helps
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:15.360]   the customers, but again, affects their bottom line or will affect their strategy going forward
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:20.320]   as a company and will see exactly how much they actually care about the customer.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:24.720]   I just don't think that's a good catch all for to justify what they do.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:33.160]   I mean, there's, I do, my basic argument has always been that if Apple wants to say that
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:38.600]   the way that they run the app store without really any challenge whatsoever is best for
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.560]   the customers, best for the developers, best for the industry, that's fine.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.920]   But it's absolutely appropriate for a government agency or an independent agency to say, great,
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.760]   prove it, give us the numbers, explain why this is so.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:53.320]   Don't just simply say, we are two or three trillion company.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.800]   We don't have to do anything we don't want to and therefore we're not going to.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.160]   This is why I encourage the sort of thing.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.000]   I think this is a positive thing.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.240]   And we have seen in the past three or four years changes in the app store that wouldn't
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:09.440]   have come if it had not been for this sort of external pressure.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:15.800]   Well, I'm going to take a Doritos Loco and a Baja Blast break right now and we will come
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:21.040]   back and it was a very good quarter for Apple.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:26.800]   We'll talk about those numbers and, you know, we're not here buying stocks or, you know,
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.800]   financial gurus.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:32.400]   We're here to take a look at those numbers and say what it means for Apple and Apple.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.960]   It was good for Apple, Google and not Facebook.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.360]   And I'd say poor Facebook.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:43.760]   Now they're saying to European regulators, this maybe Apple should do this.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.760]   You know what?
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.760]   You keep pushing us.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:46.760]   We're going to get it.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.680]   We're going to take our ball and go home.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.680]   Let's data repaintation.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.480]   That's like a whole, that's a whole, see it.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.200]   And then the, that's a lot of the kettle words.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.240]   And then the EU parliamentarians say, well, that would be a good thing.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.960]   We don't like Facebook either.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.960]   Can you take a group of them on the walk with you?
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:05.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:10.720]   Do you really want the whole, the whole statement that they were making during their quarterly
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.440]   report is that we're, we're, we're fighting for people's attention.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.800]   There's so much competition, not only when social media, we're trying to fight against
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.800]   TikTok.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.800]   Oh, great.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.480]   So why don't you pull out of all these markets?
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:26.720]   See, see if you leave behind any sort of a vacuum that's not going to be immediately filled
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.440]   and you're going to lose this completely.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.440]   Go ahead.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.440]   Go some try.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.440]   We love it.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.440]   Like Google and China.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.440]   That'll be fun.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.960]   All of this is making you feel a little bit anxious.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.080]   Can I recommend our sponsor better help?
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:48.960]   I love this sponsor because they are helping people feel better.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:56.440]   And gosh knows there couldn't be a more challenging time than our own modern times.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.640]   If something's preventing you from achieving your goals or frustrating you or interfering
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.960]   with your happiness, better help.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:08.240]   Be T T E R H E L P dot com slash Mac break.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.240]   What is it?
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:13.160]   Well, better help will help assess your needs and then match you with your own licensed
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.080]   professional therapist.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.880]   You can connect in a safe private online environment.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.880]   It's so convenient.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.920]   You can get started within 48 hours, which is nice.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.440]   It's not a crisis line.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.880]   One emphasize that, you know, that that's not, you know, there are other places to go
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.880]   for that.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:36.720]   This is for the kind of thing that many of us include myself really think is a valuable
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.320]   thing to do.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.640]   It's not self help.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.200]   It's not crisis help.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:46.240]   It's professional counseling done online and done securely and done in a way that that
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.840]   fits your needs.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.400]   So for instance, you don't want video.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.400]   You don't have to have video.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.120]   It could just be phone sessions.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.440]   You don't the counselor.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.720]   You're not clicking.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.720]   No problem.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:01.200]   It's very easy for you to keep going until you find somebody you like.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.720]   They understand that that's an important part to make it easy and free to change counselors
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.160]   as needed.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.600]   Sometimes what happens is you, you know, spend a few weeks with one person.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   You got a lot out of it.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.240]   Now you want to try a different approach.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.360]   Sometimes it's just not a click.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.920]   You got to find it's always been the case of the right counselor for you and they make
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.520]   that very easy.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:26.040]   Although I have to say my experience has been, you can also may get that click right away.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.400]   It's much more affordable than traditional offline counseling.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:33.400]   They even have financial aid and it's global worldwide.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:39.360]   So you don't have to limit yourself to the three counselors down the block.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.680]   You can find the expertise you need in a whole bunch of different areas.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.160]   You could, what I love about it, it's not just weekly appointments.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.240]   You can send a message to your counselor anytime.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.440]   You get timely and thoughtful responses.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.520]   You can of course have weekly sessions.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.400]   Never have to sit in a waiting room.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:02.160]   Never have to, you know, if it's uncomfortable for you to tell people you're doing this,
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.600]   it's totally private, which is nice.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:10.200]   You'll find licensed professional counselors specializing in pretty much every area of
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.720]   mental problems, this depression, stress, anxiety.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.800]   And by the way, no shame in feeling these.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.440]   We're all feeling this, especially right now.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:24.040]   Relationship help, sleeping, trauma, anger, family conflicts.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:28.360]   Yes, they have experts in LGBTQ matters in grief.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:33.320]   Look, if you're suffering from the loss of a loved one, even if it was years ago, there's
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.920]   no reason to suffer.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:41.240]   It's not an abandonment of their memory or their, you just, it just helps you process
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.240]   it.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.240]   It's important.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.960]   Self-esteem, a lot of people, a lot of us have self-esteem issues.

[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.240]   These are tough times.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.280]   It's okay to acknowledge that.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.480]   How was, how were the Doritos local?
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.480]   Were they good?
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.480]   The Bob Black?
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.480]   I'm crunchy.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.480]   Do you have Taco Bell in the camera?
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.480]   I'm not in a food coma.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.480]   We do.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.720]   They're just closing here in Quebec.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.720]   They were here for...
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:17.720]   Oh, that's what he said.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.160]   They were in the back of Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:23.880]   Every KFC got a Taco Bell in the back for a while.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.880]   Wow.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:25.880]   That's right.
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:26.880]   They're both owned by Pepsi.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.240]   Yeah, I believe Pepsi and cocoa and everything.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.240]   There's only two companies.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.240]   There's only two companies.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:35.640]   And in fact, this may be a disappointment to some of you, but there's really only two
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.360]   big fat pipes.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.040]   It's all made out of the same stuff.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.040]   Just comes out.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.040]   Yes.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.040]   One just gets branded, cocoa and gets blown out.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.040]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.040]   Pepsi one has more salt one has more sugar.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.040]   That's about it.
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.040]   That's about it.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.040]   Thank you, Jason Stell.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.040]   You know, we should have had Jason on today.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.040]   Come to think of it.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:56.040]   I guess we didn't have time to get Jason lined up, but he does this every year.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:58.360]   I love it every quarter, but he's...
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:04.440]   This is now the annual report, I guess, because Apple has now reported in with its quarterly
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:09.280]   results for the past quarter, and that makes it for the year.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.760]   Here's his 2021 Apple report card.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.360]   Now, this is not from the financial numbers.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.800]   This is by querying Apple watchers.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:21.600]   I bet Renee, you're one of them he queries.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.800]   I was, but I missed the email this year.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.800]   Oh, God.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.800]   Oh, bear.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:26.800]   My email became...
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.680]   After I left mobile nations, my email got completely annihilated, and I missed...
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.680]   I missed it.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:31.680]   I missed it.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:32.680]   I apologize to Jason.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.680]   I can help you.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.680]   No, he does everything right.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:35.680]   It's just me.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:37.680]   I was a failure point.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.680]   He never asked me, but that's all right.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.440]   He does everything wrong, but now the nuts.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.360]   He never asked me.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.040]   Apple report card average scores, Mac number one.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:54.880]   And I think you'd have to say in the M1 era, in the Apple Silicon era, Apple, Macs are amazing.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:36:00.960]   Hardware reliability, number two, iPhone number three, wearables, number four, which is ironic.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:04.920]   That's more looking ahead, I guess, because all the wearables are right now, or I guess
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:09.680]   watches and iPods count, AirPods count.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:17.160]   iPad, mostly watch has its own category, services, software quality, not quite as good as hardware
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.200]   reliability, environmental and social impact.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.200]   It's interesting how low that's ranked.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.120]   Well, hardware got the post-butterfly boost, Leo.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:26.120]   Yes.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:30.760]   Post-butterfly, post-track touchpad thing.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.840]   Apple TV kind of down there, dev relations, definitely suffering.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:38.680]   But the most neglected item on the Apple report card, home kit.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.720]   Whatever happened to that?
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:44.720]   Let's see.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:49.480]   Let me, did he do his quarterly results report card too?
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.320]   I'm going to have to see if I can find that.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.320]   The color charts.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.320]   Because I love those color charts.
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.880]   His amazing set of scripts.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.200]   Every time we praise him for doing this, it's just a set of scripts.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.560]   It takes like nine minutes.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.560]   Okay.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.840]   You know, wait, that's more impressive, right?
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.640]   How many of us think, oh gosh, I really, I do this all the time.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:13.640]   I really should, you know, automate it and never do.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.760]   And so the fact that he did is awesome.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.040]   Six colors, charts.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.360]   Apple did have its quarterly results last week.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.360]   Am I not wrong?
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.360]   A couple of shows of the 20 weeks.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.360]   Before I said, come on, come on.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.120]   Did you guys already do this?
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.120]   You already did.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.600]   We did the Apple results, but not the SNL results.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.400]   Well, here's the SNL results.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.400]   Good.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.400]   All right.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.400]   Good.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.400]   So there's something left for me.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.400]   It was a good quarter.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.800]   81 billion dollars, right?
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:43.000]   iPhone, almost half, but not quite, which is interesting.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Services really big.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.120]   I have to say though, there should be an asterisk on services because, yes, a significant
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:52.200]   portion of that is a check from Google, which I don't.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.200]   And the App Store.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.200]   Well, App Store, I think that counts, right?
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.360]   But, well, it's like when Apple says they have so many subscribers, that includes like
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.360]   App Store subscribers.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.360]   Right.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.520]   It's like the whole App Store is a big distortion.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.240]   Everybody who has an app, an iPhone has the App Store, right?
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.240]   Or a Mac?
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.240]   Apple revenue.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:16.640]   It looked pretty good in Q3, 81 billion dollars, but should it be higher?
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.960]   Well, they're one of those.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:24.760]   Isn't this the big selling quarter, the big new iPhone quarter?
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.760]   We were talking about it.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:26.760]   A holiday quarter?
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:29.760]   Well, it's like a profit.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.320]   21 billion.
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.680]   That's nice too.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.680]   And they're turning so much.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:35.680]   Oh, I see.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.240]   The big thing is the yearly result.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.240]   Okay.
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:42.040]   So I shouldn't, that's that big, big chunk there.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.400]   They should, because these are all quarterly, so it's apples to apples.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.160]   The black line is what really matters.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:52.040]   That's the four quarter average and obviously Apple is revenue through the roof going.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:55.120]   And services are throwing margins through the roof too, because software and services
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.520]   revenues are so much higher.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.120]   They're, they're total margin, right?
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:04.320]   Revenue up 36% for the quarter.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:09.520]   There, there's that server, that purple services thing in there.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:13.640]   Just for those of you listening, we're just looking at six colors.com.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:14.640]   Jason said, "Shark."
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.640]   Very beautiful graphs.
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.640]   This is the wrong quarter.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:20.640]   Gosh darn it.
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:21.640]   All right.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.640]   Just erase everything you just heard.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.640]   I forget it.
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.480]   I hate myself.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:31.680]   I take one day off, one lousy day off and I'm...
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.600]   One lousy show and...
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.600]   I'm shot the hell.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.600]   I guess he has not done...
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.360]   It was a good quarter.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.360]   They made...
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.360]   It was good.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.360]   Again, they made more money to get everything you just heard.
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.360]   I forget everything you just heard.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.360]   Over fossil fuel resources.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.960]   I guess he hasn't done the charts yet.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.960]   Maybe not.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:46.960]   Maybe it was two weeks ago.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:51.040]   So 123 billion and almost under 24 billion in revenue.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.040]   Sorry.
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:55.400]   That's why that explains to me, because yeah, an iPhone was a huge part of that.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.760]   I got the whole thing wrong.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.840]   Editors, just take that whole chunk out.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:02.240]   Hey, here are Jason Snell's.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:07.800]   Literally, I guess my brain just rotted while I was gone.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   You already did all this.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.800]   I didn't know the difference either.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.080]   It's just so much money at this point.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.160]   It's all blurry, isn't it?
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.160]   We know it, care.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.400]   There's the big bar I expected.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.720]   123 billion dollars in revenue.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.720]   All the money.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.720]   Highest ever.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:22.720]   Profit.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.720]   Whoa!
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:26.960]   34 billion in profit.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.520]   Eww.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:29.520]   That's nice.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.520]   There's bigger...
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.920]   I have so much RAM now as for Tim Cook's pivot tables.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:33.920]   Really?
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:36.920]   Anything.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:37.920]   But again, this is money.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:38.920]   We don't care about money.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.160]   We care about products and services.
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:44.560]   Anything to be gleaned from this was a good year for iPhone.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.600]   It was probably a good year for services.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.320]   It's just that they're still feeling...
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:53.120]   Where Apple is feeling the crunches and the legacy nodes, which are the large process nodes,
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.120]   they're still...
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.360]   Everything they're making themselves with TSMC is going fine, but they're starting to
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.480]   have to pick and choose what parts go to iPhones, what parts go to iPad minis.
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.360]   So there are shortages on the less popular...
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:07.800]   Well, less popular comparatively products than Apple would like, but it looks like they're...
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.720]   They're not getting a handle on it, but they're able to move stuff around as needed to fulfill
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.320]   most of the demand, which will probably last another two years or so.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.680]   So you already talked about all of this, and I apologize.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:20.320]   I forgot that I was even gone last week, so...
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:24.680]   Honestly, if you take a couple of days off and you're right back in the thick of it,
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.680]   when you come back, did you really leave it all?
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:27.920]   That's a good point.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.380]   I should be foggy.
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.320]   I should say, "What are we talking about?
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.320]   What's going on?"
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.320]   The fog of vacation.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.240]   Micah was smart.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.520]   He left it out of the rundown.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.000]   I'm the one who went out and said, "Oh, we should look at this."
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   Sorry about that.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Sorry.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   But there are a couple of...
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.840]   One thing that I don't think we hit upon is that if we talked about the money, of course,
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.640]   because many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, but one of the other
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:56.500]   nice things, especially compared to the failure of the class of Facebook, one of Facebook's
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.960]   biggest downers was that a number of active...
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:04.400]   The number of actors, users actually went down, meaning which implies that they have
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.560]   found everybody that they're ever going to sign up for Facebook.
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:11.600]   They have found all the customers they can, and you compare and contrast this to Apple,
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:16.840]   where the numbers and the guidance they were offering in this document and the Q&A afterward,
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:21.600]   was speaking about how we are continuing to make gains.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:27.500]   We have the countries in which Apple products and services are doing exceptionally well.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:32.220]   We continue to actually gain in markets that we started focusing full attention on five
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:38.220]   or six or seven years ago, meaning that there is still more sources of revenue yet to come.
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:45.140]   For me, the most fun part is always the Q&A when the analysts actually ask questions,
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:51.340]   because this is one of the few times in which a CEO and an executive team is legally required
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:56.040]   by the SEC not to lie.
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:01.880]   Tim Cook was asked directly about the metaverse, and he parried nicely just by saying, "Oh,
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:05.440]   well, we've got 14,000 AR apps in the App Store.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.480]   We continue to look at this, and we're investing accordingly."
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:15.420]   He's thinking he was hiding his real interest, because he's been saying AR, AR, AR, but that
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:22.640]   sounds like he's saying, "Oh, the apps, we did it," and that's not what anybody's thinking.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:29.840]   I'm wondering if he was trying to not give heat to Meta, to Facebook about this.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:36.060]   I think he wants to do AR/VR the way that Apple wants to do it, and not necessarily be
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:42.480]   seen as not hitch their wagon to a pipe dream that might be delivered in five or ten years,
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:47.180]   or might just simply be bought out as part of Facebook's assets when the company's liquidated.
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:51.260]   Speaking of Facebook, I think there's two other quick things about that.
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:55.220]   One is that to Andy's point, I don't think Apple wants to be seen as following Facebook
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:56.220]   in any way, shape, or form.
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:59.700]   They don't want to give them any mind, share, control over this.
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:00.700]   They don't even want the word meta.
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:04.140]   They don't say cyberspace or information superhighway.
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:07.500]   They don't want to play any of those games, but also they have a fundamental disagreement
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:11.880]   with how that future is going to unfold, where Facebook wants that helmet on our heads
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.740]   so that they can own our lives.
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:18.660]   He loves Ready Player One, doesn't understand that he's the bad guy, and that Facebook,
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:23.020]   and he really thinks that he's just an app in a browser, just a web page in a browser,
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:24.620]   just an app on a phone, and he doesn't want that.
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:28.320]   He wants to be the world that we live in, where Apple looks at it like, "We don't want
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.320]   you to live in this stuff.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.320]   We think that would be super bad.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:34.980]   We just want you to come in, watch a movie, play a game, look at maps, do that kind of
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:36.660]   stuff, and then go on about your life."
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.740]   We're fine selling you that shiny headset.
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:42.080]   You don't need to buy our toilet paper above your kid's school.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.280]   That's just a different game from us.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.400]   Yeah, well, they don't need it because they don't need the revenue, but on the other hand,
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:50.360]   they do everything they can to make sure that you live LaVita Apple.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.360]   You know, locking...
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:54.400]   People are going crazy now over this...
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:58.400]   I can never remember the name of the handoff continuity where you move the mouse.
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.400]   Oh, universal control.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.400]   universal control.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:03.960]   Because you need an iPad and an AME.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.120]   You don't need a mask.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.720]   Face recognition if you've got an Apple watch.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:13.540]   And Apple's doing everything they can to keep you living in the ecosystem.
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:14.940]   But there's a difference between...
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:18.460]   They want you to live in the world, but always have an Apple product and your hand while
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:19.460]   you do so.
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:20.460]   Right.
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.780]   And also, they're such a really business model.
[00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:25.700]   They're monies made selling out there.
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:26.700]   Exactly.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:27.700]   And also, Apple...
[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:28.700]   I don't think Apple is ever...
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:33.380]   Not since the Newton message pad has Apple ever done the sort of thing where we think that
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:35.060]   this is an interesting idea.
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:39.360]   We're going to put this out there and hope that it becomes like a money magnet that people
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.720]   just simply see it, realize, "Oh my God, where is this thing existed in my life?"
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.680]   Until this point.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:48.340]   They wait to make sure that people actually want this thing, that there is a future for
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:51.240]   this thing, and then they actually release this thing.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.240]   That's interesting.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.240]   That's what they're doing.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:54.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.240]   That's an interesting point.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.340]   There's also a fundamental difference in the relationship.
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:01.340]   Like Apple feels like, "We walk into this place.
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:02.340]   I give you money.
[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:03.340]   You give me a thing.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:04.740]   You know, we're kind of settled."
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.940]   The Google is like, "I walk into this place.
[00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:08.340]   I can have this thing."
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:12.500]   And then they might glare at me a little bit, but the relationship is more or less under
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:13.500]   my control.
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.300]   I can give them back whatever I want.
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:16.740]   Facebook feels like you walk into this place.
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:20.780]   They'll give you an unlimited buffet, but you got to eat it naked while being examined.
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:22.940]   And that's like a completely different relationship.
[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:23.940]   Wow.
[00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:24.940]   And the other too.
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:27.180]   So, but it's true though, like they're upset.
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:30.700]   Well, we were talking about Facebook's warning about the EU.
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:34.460]   And the reason that they're doing that warning is because the EU is increasingly about data
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:36.740]   repatriation, similar to what China wants.
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.420]   But we have different political dynamics with them.
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:41.100]   They want Facebook's data to stay in the EU.
[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:44.220]   And they don't want Facebook in the US to operate on that data.
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:47.500]   And Facebook is saying, "But operating on that data is our rezondetra."
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.740]   To put it in like a hierarchy in language that you'll understand.
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:51.740]   Yeah.
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:55.740]   And that is literally like, again, Google will give you a lobster dinner and they'll
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:56.740]   leer at you.
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.900]   But you get to make your own decisions.
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.580]   Facebook really wants you naked and being examined while you're in that lobster.
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:02.580]   What I agree with an allergy.
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:08.380]   But that also brings up an interesting point that in these guidance reports, they're also
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:11.020]   supposed to talk about headwinds.
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:12.980]   That's why Facebook just tanks so badly.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.860]   Because they were talking about nothing but headwinds.
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:22.860]   And even Google only slightly glanced at how they might find themselves having some difficulties
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:27.500]   in the future dealing with new regulations and also existing regulations.
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:35.140]   I mean, the GDPR is having such huge, huge effects even a time later.
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:44.020]   Just recently, they handed out a finding that Google fonts on websites violates GDPR because
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:50.420]   when a visitor opens a website and this font, free font is downloaded from Google to display
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:54.060]   the webpage correctly, that is transmitting information about the viewer of that webpage
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.260]   back to Google.
[00:47:55.260 --> 00:48:01.540]   And so I wonder at what point this is going to become so onerous that just as Tim Cook
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:07.900]   was talking time and time again about chip constraints, chip constraints, chip constraints
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:12.620]   during the entire call, they're going to have to talk about we don't know how we can do.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:14.620]   We're going to have to revamp our payment system here.
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:17.540]   We're going to have to revamp our app store here.
[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:23.380]   We're going to have to figure out how we can actually run our transparency service because
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:29.540]   we have built it so that we can prove to ourselves and to our users that we're protecting users'
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:30.540]   privacy.
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:35.540]   We did not build it so that we can prove to the UK or to France or to Australia that
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:37.220]   we're protecting users' privacy.
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:40.740]   This is going to become a bigger, bigger issue as we go along.
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:43.820]   Speaking of Facebook, they blamed Apple.
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:46.820]   Apple are the headwinds.
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:52.700]   They said Apple's IDFA checkbox on the iPhone is going to, they say, anticipate cost them
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:55.420]   $10 billion for next quarter.
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:57.300]   I'm going to call it Apple.
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:00.180]   It's not users choosing to deny them that data.
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:06.500]   Honestly, I'm going to call foul on that because I think Facebook doesn't.
[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:13.980]   We've seen many studies that show that Facebook has plenty of other ways to get that information.
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:17.220]   All that checkbox does is say you can't have the IDFA.
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:20.860]   There's lots of other things you Facebook could do to finger-
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:24.180]   The fundamental difference in viewing the universe.
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:27.860]   Facebook really believes that it's their data, that it's not our data, that we're doing things
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:31.380]   on the internet and that doesn't belong to us, that belongs to them.
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:32.380]   They've gone so far.
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:37.500]   They bought WhatsApp based on spying on iOS and Android users' other activities.
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:41.220]   They bought that VPN and deployed it with an enterprise certificate based on the idea
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:45.100]   that they deserve to know that everything we were doing on the device, they truly don't
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:48.460]   believe that we have the right to determine who we share our data with.
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:52.900]   Their entire business is built around that philosophy, which they're being told a hard
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:56.780]   note to now increasingly from other companies and regulators.
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:00.380]   They might absolutely, they could get this stuff in other ways.
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:01.980]   I don't think they thought that they should.
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:06.660]   I think that they have real massive entitlement issues they're dealing with right now.
[00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:11.060]   They also actually addressed this and they said that they didn't say that, "Oh my God,
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:12.060]   we don't know what to do."
[00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:16.500]   They said that we're rewriting basically how we do tracking and that's going to take
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:19.740]   us a couple of years to figure out.
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:24.060]   Actually the more sensational thing they said was that they were complaining that they felt
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.940]   as though they were being singled out unfairly because that means that the Facebook app can
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:32.700]   get access to because it's an app that runs on iOS, can't get access to the stuff.
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:36.700]   However, they're also mentioning that, "Well, but Google is not facing the same problems
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:41.340]   because they've got the sweetheart deal with Apple."
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:43.140]   I forget the exact language they use.
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:48.380]   They said, "Until this favoritism ends, we're going to be dealing with this problem when
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.020]   Google is not."
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:55.380]   It's a little bit whiny though.
[00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:57.420]   Do you really think that it hurt them that much?
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:58.340]   They made a choice.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:50:59.340]   I heard them that much.
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.620]   I just, they made a choice unlike Google.
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:03.580]   Google is so smart compared to Facebook.
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:06.900]   They are so ingenious because they had this feeling.
[00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:11.220]   They grew up when Microsoft owned the internet and part of the whole debacle around IE and
[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:15.180]   Chrome was it, and with Android and iOS was that they didn't want to leave their hands.
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:19.700]   The control of mobile search to Microsoft, but they didn't just complain about it.
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:21.660]   They went out, they made a mobile operating system.
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:23.020]   They made a browser.
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:27.020]   Now even if a lot of stuff gets turned off, they still have access to that via the operating
[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:29.140]   system and via the browser.
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:33.780]   Where Zuckerberg hired the same people, he poached the second in charge of Android Eric
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:36.540]   saying he did all it, but then he kept like, "Maybe we'll do it.
[00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:37.540]   I don't know.
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:38.540]   We'll partner.
[00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:40.140]   We'll make a cha-cha with HTC."
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:43.700]   They never did anything, so now they're in this point of complete dependency.
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.780]   I think that's why they're so desperate for metaverse because that would give them the
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:48.300]   ownership that Google already has.
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:51.500]   See, I don't take it quite as face value.
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.980]   I think that Mark's saying, "Gert, we can pretend we don't know anything about them
[00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:55.980]   because of Apple.
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.820]   Oh, what was me?"
[00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:01.980]   Meanwhile, continue to collect all the data we're collecting anyway.
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:05.980]   Snap pulled the curtain aside because they had their first profit ever.
[00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:08.140]   They said, "Yeah, Apple's privacy didn't.
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:10.620]   You figured out a way around it."
[00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:12.860]   They said, "Well, it will take time to fully adapt."
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:20.820]   I honestly think these companies are using it, to be honest with you, more than really
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:21.820]   hurt by it.
[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:23.980]   I think they don't want to admit how much they already know.
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:28.780]   Facebook tracks you all the time everywhere you go, thanks to like buttons.
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:31.380]   I just feel like they don't deal with data brokers.
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:32.380]   Deals with data brokers.
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:34.060]   They've got plenty of information.
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.060]   They're so good at it.
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.900]   We think that they're listening to us on the microphone, even though all evidence of the
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:39.500]   contrary, they are so good at it.
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:40.700]   Everyone believes that.
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:41.700]   Yeah.
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:45.140]   You're those Instagram ads, but I was talking about Goldfish just the other day, and all
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:49.420]   of a sudden I'm getting Goldfish ads.
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:52.940]   I think this is really a magician's trick.
[00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:55.140]   It's saying, "Oh, yeah, they're killing us.
[00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:56.140]   They're killing us."
[00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:58.300]   Meanwhile, keep giving us that data, boys.
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.580]   Keep giving us that data.
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:01.180]   I don't buy it, but anyway.
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:02.700]   No, you're absolutely right.
[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.620]   They were in profit.
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:11.060]   The thing is, this is a nice smokescreen for the larger industry, where Amazon had their
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:15.060]   results and, "Oh my God, they're making so many billions of dollars off their ad network."
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:19.500]   It's just getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:23.260]   It's one thing to be able to say that, "Well, gosh, this person searched for this item here
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:26.940]   after reading this article there that went to this store there."
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:31.460]   It's another thing to have a list of, "Here's what people were searching for in a store.
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:34.100]   Here's what they looked at before they looked at this other thing."
[00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:38.380]   Here's what they looked at before they actually made the purchase.
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:43.140]   Google even knows, if you just use a credit card, they buy them with data back and they
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:44.940]   know that you use the credit card.
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:45.940]   They even said this.
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:46.940]   They offered to advertisers.
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:48.000]   We could buy it in a tire-
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   It ties to a physical address.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   Because you place an order.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   Right.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.180]   I think Apple's doing a lot to protect privacy.
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:59.500]   I'm glad they are, including anonymizing Apple Pay payments.
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:04.300]   But I'm not going to weep a tear, shed a tear for Facebook or Google or anybody else because
[00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:05.300]   of it.
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.460]   I think they're finding ways around it perfectly well.
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:09.420]   They would like to pretend they're not.
[00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:10.420]   Oh dear.
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:12.660]   By the way, it gives them a little ammunition against Apple.
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:14.180]   I'm sure they're not that funny.
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:15.180]   Yep.
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:16.180]   Apple, either.
[00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:19.740]   Well, remember they were, Zuckerberg was getting the Federal Trade Commission to investigate
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:23.820]   Apple because they were blocking his spyware on it.
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:28.700]   And if anything else, if it forces these people to try to figure out how to deliver
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:38.540]   something that in a way users understand that content has to be paid for somehow and
[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:42.900]   that ads are a really, really friction-free way for them to pay for content without having
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:45.140]   to actually pay for content.
[00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:48.780]   And they want those ads to be relevant to what they're interested in, what they're
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:50.220]   looking at.
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.700]   People who purchase ads want those ads to be effective.
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:55.780]   They want to be able to figure out how effective those ads are.
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:55:01.100]   So we basically have two industries or two groups of people that there should be a way
[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:03.540]   to compromise between these two.
[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:07.660]   And I think it's a good thing that this wild wild west idea that, no, no, take any data
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:11.660]   you want, track anybody anywhere by whatever data you want.
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:15.300]   Use it however you want, connect it to each other to fill in whatever gaps you think you
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:16.300]   need.
[00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:19.260]   I think it's a good idea that now we're starting to tamp down on this and that at least the
[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:23.860]   easy ways of getting access to that data, a company like Apple saying, no, you don't
[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:26.580]   have that data, you don't have access to that, you're going to have to figure it out some
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:27.740]   other way.
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:32.500]   And if it leads, this is the only way that's going to lead to new technologies that come
[00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:38.820]   to that kind of a compromise technology where, yes, it's perfectly fine if you understand
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:43.900]   that I'm actually in the middle, I'm actually trying to buy, trying to replace like a heating
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:47.380]   system and I don't know what I'm going to go, but I'm doing a lot of research into what
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:51.260]   I need to get, what I can do myself, what technology is going to work the best.
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:55.060]   If there's a way that that kind of information simply drops in my lap in a way that helps
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:57.020]   me solve a problem, I'm interested in that.
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:01.500]   I just don't want you to look at, okay, so the last time he bought Twinkies was three
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:07.180]   months ago, however, he crossed against the light in this situation but doesn't do it
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:08.540]   when he's in Boston.
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:12.100]   So therefore we're going to see that that's when you get creepy and that's when you like
[00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:16.980]   find a way to do that without without violating my trust and my privacy.
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:17.980]   Yeah.
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:18.980]   Yeah.
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:23.980]   So we'll take, then we'll talk about why March 8th is an important day in the future.
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.460]   But first a word from our sponsor, Andy Anacos.
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:27.860]   Renee Ritchie, it's great to have you.
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:29.620]   Alex Lizzie has a day off.
[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:31.380]   Our show today brought to you by New Relic.
[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:35.520]   That's a name that should make if you're a software engineer or a assistant man, should
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:38.060]   make your heart go pittapat.
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:46.000]   I know we love it and I know many, many, many companies love New Relic because of the 9
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.820]   PM phone call.
[00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:51.340]   You know that feeling, you know, you're relaxing.
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:54.100]   Maybe you have a little adult beverage, you got your feet up.
[00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:58.180]   Maybe you're ready to go to bed and all of a sudden the beeper goes off the bone buzzes.
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:00.260]   Something's broken.
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:01.260]   And guess who?
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:03.100]   That's to fix it.
[00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:04.100]   And your mind's already gone.
[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:05.100]   Oh my God.
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:06.100]   What's wrong?
[00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:07.100]   Is it the backhand?
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:08.100]   Is it the front end?
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:09.100]   Is it global?
[00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:10.100]   Is it the server?
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:11.100]   Is it the network?
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:12.100]   Is it the cloud provider?
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:13.340]   Did I introduce a bug in my last deploy?
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:14.980]   Oh my God.
[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:17.540]   Now you got not just you but the whole team scrambling.
[00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:19.580]   It's nine in the evening.
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:22.340]   Almost it's going to be midnight and miss everybody's going.
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:23.940]   What's going on?
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:27.780]   And unfortunately there's still a lot of companies where that happens.
[00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:29.900]   New Relic did a study.
[00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:37.140]   Only half of all organizations have implemented some form of observability for the networks
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:38.140]   and systems.
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:42.140]   That means there's half out there who just are in the fog.
[00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:46.180]   They have no idea and you just have to kind of try everything.
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:50.100]   It's really important to maintain network observability and there is no better way to
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.340]   do it than new Relic.
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:55.940]   You got to get new Relic to avoid that.
[00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:59.420]   Then when you've got new Relic you get the 9 p.m. call.
[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:01.540]   You look at the monitoring and you go, "Oh yeah.
[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:02.540]   Whoops.
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:04.020]   Let's roll that one back."
[00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:05.660]   And you're done.
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:11.380]   New Relic has 16 different monitoring products that you normally go out and get separately.
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:15.660]   So you can see the entire software stack in one place.
[00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:21.540]   There's application monitoring, APM, unified monitoring for your apps and your microservices.
[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:24.020]   There's PIXI for Kubernetes.
[00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:26.940]   You probably, I'm sure if you use Kubernetes you know about PIXI, right?
[00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:27.940]   There's distributed tracing.
[00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:32.420]   You can see all your traces without management headaches so you can find and fix issues fast.
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:34.820]   There's network performance monitoring.
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:37.460]   So you'll know exactly where performance issues start.
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:43.100]   You could ditch those data silos for a system wide correlated view.
[00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:44.100]   New Relic's amazing.
[00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:46.740]   There's four of the 16.
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:51.140]   And when you have an issue, by the way, I love this APM because you can pinpoint issues
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:52.740]   down the line of code.
[00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:53.740]   It's got the symbol table.
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:55.980]   It knows exactly why the problem happened.
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:58.340]   It could say line 43.
[00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:01.860]   You got a null pointer and you can fix it quickly.
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:05.460]   Or if you're blocking in your database you could find it right away.
[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:12.700]   That's why devs and op teams at DoorDash and GitHub and Epic Games and so many more rely
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:14.060]   on new Relic.
[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:20.060]   14,000 companies use new Relic, new Relic to debug and improve their software.
[00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:23.740]   Whether you run a cloud native startup, a Fortune 500 company, it'll take you just a
[00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:27.500]   few minutes to set up new Relic in your environment and get ready for this.
[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.620]   It's free.
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:35.260]   The whole new Relic platform plus 100 gigabytes of data a month, free forever.
[00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:37.860]   You don't even need to give them a credit card.
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:40.180]   New Relic.com/Macbreak.
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:42.300]   Any W-R-E-L-I-C.
[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:44.500]   I know you know the name.
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:49.740]   But do you know what a life-changing experience is going to be?
[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:51.380]   Honestly, why are you waiting?
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:54.700]   That next 9 p.m. call is just out there waiting.
[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:57.060]   Get new Relic before it does.
[00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:59.020]   New Relic.com/Macbreak.
[00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:06.980]   We thank you so much for supporting Macbreak Weekly and supporting all you DevOps, Sysidmins.
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:08.060]   Get it solved.
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:10.900]   New Relic.com/Macbreak.
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:15.140]   Thank you, New Relic.
[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:22.780]   There's a kind of convergence of the rumor mongers on March 8th.
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:25.660]   Rene, I know you're a close observer of all this.
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:26.660]   Is that credible?
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:29.060]   I think that's the date.
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:35.340]   I think right now in the decades of 2020s, these things can shift.
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:38.260]   It's a prerecorded virtual presentation.
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.620]   If anything changes, Apple hasn't announced it.
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:45.580]   So until we get the ads, until we get the invitations, the emails, those sorts of things,
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:46.580]   then it's locked.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.140]   I think it's early.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:51.100]   Typically, Apple holds them later in March or June.
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:55.460]   The March event moves around so much and there's not always a March event.
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:56.460]   It's a wild card to me.
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:01.100]   Yeah, it absolutely could be March 8th, but it could be any week that Apple chooses to
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:02.100]   hold it.
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:05.060]   In other words, they could be right and it could be changed.
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.060]   Yes.
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:07.060]   Yes.
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:08.060]   So...
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:09.060]   Logistics are different.
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:10.060]   They're rent a building.
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.220]   So much of that has other rental people.
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:13.220]   Yeah.
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:14.220]   Like, your Bubwenna or...
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:18.220]   This is why they built the campus, really, and the Steve Jobs.
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.540]   Sort of, but they built it and then they didn't always use it.
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:23.500]   They built it and then they went to Chicago and then they went to Brooklyn and then they
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.500]   went to Italy.
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:25.500]   Yeah.
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.140]   Well, now here's the question.
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:33.620]   Bloomberg, sorry, Mark Gurman and others, I think, are all saying and I think this is
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:44.140]   probably pretty obvious, a new iPhone SE with 5G and the A15 processor, a new iPad Air.
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:45.140]   We're due.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:50.740]   It'll look kind of like the iPad Pros, like the iPad Mini.
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.740]   Anything else is what...
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:53.740]   It looked identical.
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:59.820]   Like the iPad Air got its big redesign at the end of 2020, but then the Mini got the same
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:03.700]   redesign last year but got the better processor and I think this is just about leveling that
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:04.700]   playing field again.
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:08.340]   So you'll get the A15 and you'll get slightly better camera.
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:12.340]   So it'll be just like the Apple's version of a spec bump, basically.
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:15.180]   And then the third rumor is for a Mac.
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:18.740]   It sounds like the iMac Pro has been delayed a little while or I hate saying delayed for
[01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:19.860]   a product that doesn't exist.
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:24.100]   It feels like that that's that Vulcan law, like nothing unreal can exist.
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:25.620]   It feels like that's not ready yet.
[01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:27.260]   So it'll do my money.
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:29.780]   My hopes, my dreams are pinned on a Mac Mini Pro.
[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:30.780]   At this point.
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:32.740]   That's what my hopes are pinned on too.
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:38.740]   Do you think it's reasonable though or I mean why June seems like a more likely target date?
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:42.900]   I think June might be the Mac Pro preview and maybe they don't want to overlap that maybe.
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.500]   Okay, that's interesting.
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:45.500]   They could.
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.020]   I mean, I just I need a new Mac in my life.
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:51.860]   Leo, I just yeah, that's the thing we can't be driven by our desires, Renee.
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:57.540]   Well, Mark had a good newsletter on Sunday where he sort of laid out what he thought
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.260]   was reasonable for the Mac roadmap.
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:01.540]   And I think he's pretty he's pretty good at that.
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:05.580]   And that was like a new Mac maybe at this event and that sounds like that would be the
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:06.580]   Mac Mini.
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:07.580]   But not a Mac.
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:14.500]   Okay, because because digit times 60.8% accurate, according to Apple Tracker, digitize randomly
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:15.500]   accurate randomly.
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:21.300]   In other words, a little better than 50 50 says it's going to be an M2 based MacBook
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:26.940]   Pro like which would be a low end, which is by the way, you've explained this many times
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.500]   it's confusing.
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:33.300]   The M1 will continue to be the high end as they add more cores, more GPUs.
[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:36.060]   The M2 more dies even more dies, right?
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:40.300]   You could have like four M one processors.
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:46.900]   But the M2 is going to be low end initially, yeah, because it's based on the A15.
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:51.020]   So it'll just be an a it'll be a, uh, won't be a spec bump.
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:52.780]   It'll be a capability.
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:54.280]   Faster single core.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.200]   That's more of power efficient because it's just, it's a cooler chip in general, which
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:01.660]   is great for like, but Mark put the MacBook, Mark put the M2 is the MacBook Air MacBook
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:08.160]   Pro, M2 Mac Mini and the M2 iMac towards the end of the year.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:11.440]   And it starts to get fuzzy whether that would be an A15 M2 or an A6.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.640]   Like this is such a deep Robbo we could get into.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:18.080]   Well, and this is confusing that if you introduce an M2, people are going to think it's
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.080]   better.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.080]   It's one better.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.080]   It'll be.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.080]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.080]   But it like so it's always been that way.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:27.480]   They put out the A13 iPhone and then they put out the A12Z iPad pro.
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:30.040]   Yeah, but we, and that caused the same confusion.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.040]   Yeah, but we weren't so aware.
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:35.880]   Most people weren't so aware of the designations A13 X and all that.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:39.200]   But I think M1 and M2 are really big brands.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.280]   And they should change the branding.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:44.040]   They should call it like junior or like air, like I should call it M2 air or M2 mini.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.360]   So that people understand it's like a lower end, lower power architecture.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:52.680]   And then for people like you, they could say, well, it's an A15, you know what that means.
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.680]   Uh huh.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.680]   Uh huh.
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:05:02.120]   Uh, so Mark says, uh, at least one new Mac on March 8th, but he, even he isn't sure
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:07.200]   which it'll be high end Mac mini, which Renee and I are voting for.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.440]   Not that we have, which is weird, right?
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:09.440]   Because it's been decided.
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.440]   Like they know which one is ready.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.440]   It's not like that's a mystery.
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:14.440]   So how come people like it's always weird when someone doesn't know something when it's
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.240]   about to happen?
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:22.640]   Uh, or, or he says Apple has at least four new max power by M2.
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:26.440]   Cheaps, but he thinks those will be later in the year, as you said, MacBook Air, that
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:28.320]   low end MacBook Pro.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:32.600]   It's basically a successor to the original M1 13 inch W and M2.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:37.000]   Well, so it's, it's the new enclosure, the new 14, supposedly it's the new 14 inch enclosure,
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.600]   both an M2 and instead of an M1 X or sorry, an M1.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.520]   So we'll go on M13, not 13.
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.160]   And they might take a port away from us just to be petulant.
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.160]   Looks that's what they do.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:50.240]   No, but for you, 24 inch I Mac is successor to the colorful IMAX of last year.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:55.080]   I shouldn't say petulant, it's got the, if it follows true to form, there's three USB
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.440]   and three Thunderbolt controllers on the pro and Macs.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.160]   It's the issue is the only two of each.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.120]   The chip's controllers is really the issue.
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:04.400]   It's the capability of the, of the die.
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:07.080]   Um, all right.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.480]   I guess what we'll have to do is wait.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:09.480]   It's only a couple more.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:10.480]   It's a month.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:12.480]   I made a video on this yesterday with an animated timeline.
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:13.760]   It was so confusing to me.
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.560]   I actually, and I don't do animation a lot.
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:19.920]   I made a little timeline moving across dropping other dropping little Macs onto it as it
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.160]   went because I needed to figure this out.
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.160]   I got that way.
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.160]   All right.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.160]   I'm going to pull this now.
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:30.600]   This is the event links one or the, uh, no, the recent one, the M two wrote M two Macs
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:36.320]   leaks super super fake renders.
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.320]   Okay.
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.920]   Yeah, I like making my own super fake renders.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:46.680]   Um, but so yes, a little timeline is going to pop up, but because like it seems like to
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.080]   me, well, it should be up in a second.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.080]   Oh, okay.
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:51.160]   That's, that's my, that's my version of Mark typing.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.320]   That's what I thought Mark.
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:55.400]   Is that stock footage or do you shoot that?
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:58.160]   Oh, no, they wouldn't let me shoot Mark typing on a blue.
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.480]   So it's sort of making little timeline.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.720]   Oh, here's the timeline and the different products are.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:02.720]   Oh, look at this.
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:03.720]   This is cute.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:04.720]   I love it.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.720]   Smash the subscribe button, man.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.720]   I love you.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.720]   You're getting better and better.
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.920]   I tell you these stuff is so good.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:15.520]   It's taking me longer to edit now, but I'm getting more, a lot more work into it.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.520]   Yeah.
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:19.280]   I guess that's the way of the world, right?
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:22.600]   But it seems like they might want to get the M one pro and M one max out of, like not out
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.000]   of the way, but they want, they're going to want to release those before they get into
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   M two.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.880]   Cause I think it will be even more confusing if M two starts coming out and M one pro and
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.000]   M one max haven't finished coming out.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   Maybe it doesn't matter.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.280]   Maybe I'm overthinking that.
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:38.960]   Oh, no, I think this is, this is all we have is overthinking.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:43.200]   You, you're not like Intel, like the Intel transition, all those chips existed.
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:45.520]   Like Apple just had to go through and choose any other Apple.
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:48.120]   So they're like, we want this and that, but all those chips were done.
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:52.400]   Apple has to build not just, and scaling a chip is hard, like taking an M one and making
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:53.760]   an M one max.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:57.640]   That's a lot of work in like just getting the universal memory in the fabric and the memory
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.600]   bandwidth and doing like quad die is going to take work too.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.920]   Cause those guys have to talk to each other in a way that preserves everything that's
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:07.120]   good about universal memory and massive bandwidth to begin with.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:10.800]   So it is a non trivial amount of work, but then once that's all done, incrementing them,
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:16.520]   I think is just, it's more of a, of a marathon and less of a sprint.
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.880]   Andy, any thoughts?
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:21.200]   Are you, what are you voting for as if our vote matters?
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.680]   Yeah, I know.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:28.800]   And I, I, I kind of, I kind of imagine this is being kind of a low key event.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:35.320]   Um, like let's, let's, let's, let's fill in, let's improve what's already there, particularly
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:36.560]   in the iPad range.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:41.040]   But what are people going to need to be buying in bulk, like in March and April and usually
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:45.400]   you think about people who are buying things and in readiness for September and October.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:47.720]   So you're talking about both purchases for education.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:52.040]   So that really points very heavily to, to, to a lot of iPad updates.
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:57.920]   I'm still very mystified as to like where Apple is going to go, like in the pro line.
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.720]   I mean, I don't mean in the pro chips.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.640]   I mean that the traditional line of here is the pro max.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.840]   We're the ones that are, we're trying to get as much performance as possible out of this
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:09.040]   thing and do a little bit of a flex.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:12.480]   If we can, if we can, for people who have $10,000, we will make sure that you have a
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:19.960]   very, very happy and very, very, very well ducted fan experience that are they going
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:23.720]   to, are they going to try to find the limits of what they can do with the iPad mini case
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:30.520]   and have that be sort of like the aspirational mid level Mac, meaning that you can buy one
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.240]   for as little as 600 bucks.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:36.200]   That's very, very strategically kitted out.
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:40.880]   But if you wanted to check off all the boxes on the website, you can buy a three to $4,000
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:41.880]   build.
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.520]   That is just an absolute screamer.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.680]   Or are they going to want to, are they going to want to start to steer those people towards
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.800]   an actual Mac pro?
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:56.760]   And there was some rumors, very rumors, borderline speculation last year about like a Mac pro
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:57.760]   mini.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:02.280]   I don't know whether people were talking about that who feels they'd access information.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:07.440]   We're talking about a high spec Mac mini or actually let's to let's take a Mac pro huge,
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:13.520]   huge, like $900 caster wheels Mac pro, but also make a smaller diversion, a smaller cut
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:19.600]   version of this that is more affordable, more, more portable, more accessible.
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.320]   I don't know where they're going to go with this.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:27.440]   I wouldn't, I wouldn't have even bet money on them doing an iMac pro given that the original
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:34.880]   one was kind of a stop gap when they saw how much of a failure the cylindrical, the cylindrical
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:39.280]   Mac pro was where they had to get something out that would actually work that developers
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:41.960]   would actually be able to use for their work.
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:47.240]   So I always thought that the iMac pro is a stop gap that may or may not even survive
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.600]   the apple silicon transition.
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:49.600]   Interesting.
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:54.920]   I have the iMac pro $5,000 and it's really aged poorly.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:59.160]   That's not some people still love it, but like the my understanding is that the iMac pro
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:04.760]   isn't like a successor to the original iMac pro just that whatever they put the M1 pro
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:09.160]   and M1 Mac chip in is going to get pro in the name like Mac book, Mac book pro, iMac,
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.520]   iMac pro, Mac mini, Mac mini pro.
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:16.360]   It'll be like a unification of branding more than like a spiritual success or something
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:19.800]   where panicking going, I want a bigger iMac, but I don't want a pro and like that'll be
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:20.800]   fine.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:21.800]   You'll be okay.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:27.520]   So even if it has an M1 Mac, then it'll still be a pro.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:28.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:29.520]   Can you imagine iMac max?
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.520]   Like if they can't say Mac Macs.
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.520]   If they can't say Mac Macs.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.520]   I just can't do the max.
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:34.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:36.040]   How much max can you max out of max of a max max max?
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:40.600]   It's just so a pro or a max is a max is a pro.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:41.600]   Yeah.
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:46.480]   That would be that would be new if they decided that I like the logic of that kind of nomenclature,
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:50.040]   but that would be a new extension of the of the brand.
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.760]   So you've never had a Mac mini has always been a Mac mini.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.200]   Maybe you can afford to fill it up with lots of money.
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:58.800]   Maybe you could just simply get the case with as little functional stuff as you can,
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:02.440]   you know, AM radio, no factory air, roll up windows.
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:05.640]   The idea of having a Mac mini pro, that's tantalizing.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:08.200]   Like would they have to create a new tooling for a case?
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:12.040]   Would they have to simply say, we're going to make a we're going to make a few design,
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:16.720]   we're going to make a Mac mini nothing that is even smaller, even more compact, even easier
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:20.480]   to hide on a desk or mount on the back of a back of a screen.
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:24.520]   But when we make the Mac mini pro, we're going to make that twice as thick so that you couldn't
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:28.760]   you can't pop off the top and add add new SSD storage.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:33.320]   You can do make modifications to it as you need as long as we're speaking, you know,
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:38.720]   it'll be colors and it'll be colorful for the regulars and then black and white.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:44.200]   I also think that because Apple now makes a display again, the XDR and maybe more maybe
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:51.960]   making more maybe they'll see the iMac as more for the style conscious consumer and
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:57.480]   and not agree with you, maybe Andy, that the pro was a stopgap and not a planned future.
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:04.560]   And that assume the pro is going to want a Mac, Mac Pro or a Mac mini pro.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.400]   The problem is if they do the shrunken iMac Pro though, if they do the shrunken Mac Pro
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:14.240]   is some of rumored, which is awfully cute, it'll verge into mini territory, won't it?
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:20.080]   So it's less shrunken and it's mostly just taking out those giant Xeon and giant RM&A
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.080]   cards.
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:23.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.160]   Those that reduces the size immensely.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:28.240]   So I think like when people talk about it being smaller, it's just smaller because it doesn't
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.920]   have those two shield heli carriers.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:31.000]   They could be a lot smaller.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.200]   Those things are those things are massive.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.200]   Massive.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.200]   When you look at the open picture, it's like one third the size.
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.200]   Yeah.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:42.920]   You really kind of might say the same because you could put four like in a 300 watt enclosure.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.520]   You could well, that's my other question.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.760]   Like you could put four M1 maxes in there and still not fill up that thermal envelope.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:52.640]   But the interesting thing is like an iMac Pro with an M1 max would have 64 gigabytes
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:53.640]   of storage.
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:56.840]   But the previous iMac Pro had 256 gigabytes.
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:00.840]   The Mac Pro was 1.5 terabytes of storage max.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:03.080]   So like how does Apple scale any of that?
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:06.200]   And like to your point, how do they address BCIE expansion slots?
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.360]   But that's never been a thing with Apple Silicon.
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:11.800]   Well, now that you don't have to do graphics cards, you're not going to have RAM slots
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.400]   because they're all on die.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.920]   I think it did not exist.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.960]   But what are you going to put in there?
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:22.080]   Some of these high-wise had off-package RAM.
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:27.200]   Like I think the iPad, some of the I put the X chips, the extended chips did have off-package
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.200]   RAM.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:32.400]   So does Apple have like an ugly or a brilliant interface that lets you put in off-package
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:35.280]   RAM if you need it for like a giant project?
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:39.040]   And then do you have like a RAID card that you can put in there that interfaces with?
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.560]   Okay, that makes it so look in.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:44.240]   There are, I mean, I'm thinking of what kinds of pro applications and there certainly are
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:49.440]   machine learning applications require giant amounts of RAM.
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.840]   And you might want to be willing to do off-board RAM.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:55.240]   But that's such a specialized thing you wouldn't necessarily want to manufacture.
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.640]   Well, some studio is like some of the higher end 3D stuff.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.840]   A lot of high end stuff.
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:00.840]   Yeah.
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:01.840]   Alex's photogrammetry.
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:02.840]   Yeah.
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:08.120]   And scientists and analysts are doing like massive, massive data sets.
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:09.120]   Yeah.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:14.000]   It's, my hope for transition for the product line has always been, I think that there's
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.520]   like, my ideal would be that there would be a desktop Mac Pro where the difference between
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:26.680]   the two is that one has PCIe slots, one does not, but it has like M.2 for SSDs and you
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:28.760]   can have a couple of SSDs in there.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:31.160]   The world has changed a lot.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.360]   It's a lot of great ability since the Mac Pro.
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:36.120]   But you don't have to put in as SATA drives.
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:41.000]   You don't, I mean, so you really could still be fairly compact and fairly expandable.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.760]   And I wonder if pros are willing to hang stuff off a Thunderbolt 4.
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:45.760]   Like that's pretty fast.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:51.760]   Well, I mean, there also could be a Xeon and Navi 3 Mac Pro that tied us over for another
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.600]   year while I was getting a Sultra high end.
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:54.600]   Really?
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:55.600]   There's been rumors of that too.
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.920]   There's been rumors that the very, they're going to keep an Intel one around for another
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:58.920]   two years.
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:01.040]   Remember like the people on production pipelines work slowly.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.360]   Like Pixar and ILM work in the different schedule.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:07.400]   They don't care and they don't, they don't, they probably don't want to have to recompile
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.960]   for ARM.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:12.640]   But how would that affect their, didn't they do a hard promise that we're going to have
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:15.760]   the Apple Silicon transition complete by the end of 2022?
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:20.240]   So you get the M1 Mac's Mac Pro, but then there'd still also be an updated, like they
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:26.240]   make it just a press release that says now the other, the old Mac Pro comes with the latest
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:28.240]   Xeon and Navi 3 chips.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.040]   I think you're right.
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:32.520]   I think they will do that because this certainly is a market for that.
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.320]   I mean, Pro Tools is still working.
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:37.360]   Give some some breathing room to get like the really, really high power Apple.
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.360]   So like the really crazy high power is looking at it.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.920]   I think that may very well be.
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:47.920]   I still, my head still spins when I think about imagine Apple Silicon that requires massive
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:48.920]   cooling.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.760]   Like I imagine they said, screw it.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:53.640]   We're going to, we're going to have like water cooled systems.
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:56.080]   We're going to have, we're going to have like this guy net like power.
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:00.560]   Well, they were rumors about a vapor chamber for A16 because like the A15 with the fifth
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:05.040]   GPU core inside an iPhone Pro does, does ramp down really fast.
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.880]   If you put it under load, not many things put it under load, but if you do like your
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:11.040]   Genshin impact branch benchmarks, it will throttle down.
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.040]   Sure.
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:14.520]   But that's a package the size of a Hershey bar.
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:15.520]   Yes.
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.520]   Yes.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:17.520]   Wow.
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:18.520]   You know, it's really interesting.
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:22.000]   We get really engaged when we talk about Macs.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.800]   And I know that Mac is a fraction of Apple's business and revenue, but we do call the show
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:28.800]   Mac break weekly.
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.080]   And us old timers, we love our Macs.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:37.560]   And it's not, you know, I mean, I guess we can say, oh, let's see, iPad rumor, OLED LG
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:41.560]   seems to be ramping up production for OLED screens for the iPad.
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:42.560]   Yeah.
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:46.880]   It's hard because like a lot of the publications that put us out those rumors are industry
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:52.040]   rags in Korea that really do manipulate, not manipulate, that's the wrong word for it,
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:55.520]   but they're like advocacy for Samsung and LG and they do a lot of the backroom dealings
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.520]   in public.
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:57.840]   Like posturing is not the right word for it.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:01.600]   They do a lot of posturing on behalf of the, of the local OLED industry.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:06.120]   I think they might transition, but many Ali Apple likes to make things fight, like almost
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:07.720]   like gladiatorial combat.
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:09.600]   And they're going to let many, many LED has problems.
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:10.940]   OLED has problems.
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:14.840]   Right now, many LED doesn't have as many problems on a larger display because the OLED
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:19.000]   processes are so different, like from TV set to phone to tablet.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000]   Phones are handled.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.960]   Like there's so many mitigations you need to make OLED non terrible, but when you do
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.960]   them, OLED is fantastic.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:28.520]   It's just when you go to tablet size, it's harder yield, it's more expensive and it gets
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.520]   blotchy because the highlights don't stay consistent.
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:33.920]   But if they could solve for that, they'll be better than many LED again.
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:36.200]   And I think Apple's more that like they don't care.
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.200]   They just want the best display.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.880]   So they're happy to let them fight it out.
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:39.880]   Yeah.
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:44.720]   That's why these rumors make more, are more impressive when they come from a display supply
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:47.080]   chain analyst as opposed to an industry group.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:52.600]   Because as Renee says, it's very, very positive to make, not even just to know that, to put
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:57.640]   out the rumor that, oh, this factory is manufacturing, is going to get a big contract from Apple,
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:00.920]   but even though this country is going to get this big contract for Apple.
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:03.560]   So there's a lot of wink, wink, nudge there.
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:11.400]   A little bit of concern over an Apple patent published last week showing that Apple's
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:14.560]   working on touch controls for the AirPods Max.
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:19.080]   Patton Lee Apple has the patent, but a lot of folks love that little, and I do too, and
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:23.960]   I'm one of the few who actually spent $550 on this headphones.
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:24.960]   But I do that.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:25.960]   That was a workaround to begin with.
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.800]   That was because they couldn't get other stuff working.
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.720]   So they went to that the winding stem.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:30.720]   This isn't new.
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:33.040]   Yeah, they borrowed from the Apple Watch.
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:34.040]   I love it.
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:37.640]   You tap it, you turn it smooth, it feels good.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.160]   But I guess touch makes more sense.
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:40.160]   It's probably easier to manufacture.
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:42.840]   They didn't want to patent it regardless.
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:46.040]   I think touch was the original idea for it, and then it wasn't going to work the way they
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:47.040]   wanted it to.
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.640]   So they went to this, but the people working on it are still working on it.
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:53.200]   They're going to patent everything that they can for reasons Andy explained well last time.
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.440]   It's just like that's a war chest.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:56.280]   But sometimes a workaround is the right thing.
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:58.280]   I like the dial.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:03.760]   Yeah, especially on headphones, because one of the problems I've always had with true wireless
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:10.120]   earbuds is that they're so small that even when you just, I'm just walking, I just feel
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.480]   like getting a little bit loose.
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:13.320]   So I just want to reseed a little bit.
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:16.000]   And then unfortunately I'm just activated the assistant.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.600]   So and I realized that there's on a tiny earbud, there are very little choices you have to
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:22.600]   design.
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:26.000]   But when you come to the larger ones, I like the ability to be able to do this without
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.760]   having to pause something without having to change the volume.
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:33.960]   And there's something, and when it's something that you can't actually see, when you're
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:37.920]   actually looking at it, there is something to that tactile thing where I feel around
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:39.200]   until I feel this bump.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:43.000]   I know that I feel the neural grip and I know that if I twist it this way, this is going
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000]   to happen.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   If I twist it that way, it's going to happen.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.480]   If I push it until I feel a click, that's going to happen.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.920]   It's a it's a it's a non obvious solution.
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:55.400]   I do I have to admit though, because I wear I mostly wear those headphones during conference
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.400]   calls.
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:59.320]   There it's I don't know why, but I just like the noise canceling.
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:01.400]   And people laugh because I have pink ones.
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:08.720]   So it lightens the room up, but I have to say I think they're throwing me right to say
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:12.360]   tapping that digital crown will hang up the phone call in many cases.
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.840]   And I often inadvertently do that.
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:19.600]   I'm kind of famous at the company now for just disappearing from phone calls.
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:20.680]   And that's why.
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:23.680]   So and you forgot to say, Oh, I'm going into a tunnel.
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:24.680]   We might be just coming.
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:25.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:27.960]   But you have the Hello Kitty ears on the top.
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:28.960]   I should.
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:29.960]   But the Hello Kitty.
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:32.600]   We got those when they were the all the rage we got them for Michael.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:37.360]   He was too embarrassed to wear them even in private.
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.360]   Good news for Apple.
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:44.160]   The Academy Award nominations came out this morning and actually it's good news for streaming
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:46.640]   in general.
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:51.520]   Huge number of streaming nominations.
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:56.040]   I think this is for the first time ever, but Apple has for the first time ever received
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:22:05.160]   a best picture nomination for Coda, which is the Marley Maitonlin movie about a predominantly
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:08.600]   deaf family with one hearing kid.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:15.200]   I haven't seen it yet, but best supporting actor nomination for Troy Cotser.
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:18.600]   First time a deaf male actor has got an Oscar nomination.
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:25.400]   Marley Maiton obviously has hers and has one best screenwriter Joel Cohen's tragedy of
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:30.360]   Beth three nominations best cinematography, best production design and Denzel Washington
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:35.000]   got a best actor nomination.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:42.040]   I wonder if all the streaming nominations have more to do with COVID and the fact that movie
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:49.560]   theaters are kind of closed and if all revert back to something else or if this is a trend.
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.760]   It's just a meritocracy.
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.880]   I don't think that's true, but I'd love for that to be the case.
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:54.880]   It's so cool.
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:57.000]   Yeah, because the matter is just the quality of accounts.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.320]   These are all really great.
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:04.840]   I saw Power the Dog and I told Lisa, I said, Lisa, this is going to get a ton of
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:05.840]   nominations.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:10.600]   Both of us were kind of scratching our heads at the end, but because it's Jane Campion,
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:14.560]   yes, 12 nominations, 12 categories.
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:20.640]   But let's talk about streaming Netflix, 27 nominations, combining with Apple TV plus
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:27.000]   an Amazon for a total of 40 streamer nominations.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:32.920]   Don't look up, which is the Netflix movie nominated for Best Picture.
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:40.200]   So a really change of Pace Dune got nominated, King Richard, both from HBO, were on HBO Max,
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:43.640]   but did go to movie theaters as well.
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:48.600]   The streaming channels are at a competitive advantage, believe it or not, simply because
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:56.280]   the sort of movies that get awards tend to not to be the $300, $400 million blockbusters.
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:01.840]   They are the quiet movies that cost less than $100 million to make that attract screenwriters,
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:04.040]   attract directors, attract actors.
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:11.480]   And before COVID, before streaming really got that next leap forward, it became the news
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:15.320]   on lots of different industry sites was that it's just almost impossible.
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:18.360]   It's easy to make a movie for less than $20 million.
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:20.880]   It's easy to make a movie for more than $200 million.
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:24.080]   It's these dramatic movies in the middle that have a problem.
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:28.000]   And these are the exactly the sort of things that Apple and Netflix and the rest like to
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000]   fund.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.280]   So I'd love to see if the next quarterly, if some sort of future quarterly statement,
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:39.400]   Apple actually talks about how much money they spend on Oscar and awards campaigns.
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:44.400]   Because this is not, you don't just simply release the movie and then hope that you get
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.720]   recognized in February.
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.640]   This is like an expensive campaign.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:53.120]   Oftentimes in the contracts with these creators and these actors, it is contractually, it's
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.720]   part of their contract that you will support.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:58.760]   You will bankroll an Oscar campaign to try to get this nominated.
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:02.680]   And if it's nominated, you will also support the campaign to get to get a win.
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:06.840]   So it's interesting to, it's interesting to figure out that these, the same building
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:10.920]   that houses people, they're trying to figure out how to make the next generation of 5G
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:14.320]   and 10i work in this tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny device.
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:17.880]   There's also an office where this is trying to figure out how to convince somebody that,
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:22.160]   okay, yeah, this is, I know that he was on Saturday live three seasons ago and he got
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.160]   fired for drugs.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.680]   But I'm telling you, his supporting actor performance,
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.880]   and this is, you'll never believe it.
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:33.440]   And I'm sure Micah wants me to mention that Queen Bee got her first Oscar nomination
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:34.720]   pay on sale.
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:37.920]   It'll, no, I didn't realize this.
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:40.560]   Egot, Egot, Egot, Egot, Egot.
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:45.680]   I didn't know this, but apparently no streaming only movie has ever won a best picture, but
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:51.280]   there are a great many in this list of nominees.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:53.920]   It'd be interesting if this year is the first year as a streaming.
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:57.680]   The Academy just out of bias says, no, we shall not, we shall not vote for those filthy
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:58.680]   streams.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:03.080]   Remember, Steven Spielberg said no streaming movie should ever be nominated for an Oscar.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:07.360]   Movies mean theaters, but that's really changed in the last two years.
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:11.800]   Part of his justification was also that a streaming movie has an advantage in that every
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:16.960]   single Academy voter has access to it from day one and can see it on demand from day
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:20.760]   one, whereas they, they're going to have to wait for a two week period in which they're
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:24.840]   actually made available or send out a send out a DVD, send out a Blu-ray, send out a
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:26.560]   streaming code and hope that they watch it.
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:27.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:28.960]   Power, they watch it and hate it.
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:30.520]   Power of the dog was Netflix only.
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:33.720]   So, and probably the front runner.
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:35.160]   So it'd be very interesting.
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.960]   Twelve categories, including best picture.
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:41.360]   But could go on Apple getting its first best picture nomination with Coda?
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:42.920]   Now I have to watch it.
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:43.920]   Yeah.
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:46.520]   Anyhas, have either of you seen it?
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:47.520]   No.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:49.080]   I haven't seen Coda, but yeah, it was on my list.
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:50.080]   Well, I've seen Coda, yes.
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:51.080]   Oh, you have?
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.080]   Was it good?
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.080]   Yeah, Coda's excellent.
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:54.080]   I guess it's amazing.
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.080]   Right?
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.080]   Remarkable, yeah.
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:57.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:58.080]   I'm glad Dune won some nominations too.
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:59.080]   I thought Dune was quite good.
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.080]   Yes, me too.
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:04.080]   Although Denis Villeneuve did not get a nod for Best Director, which is something-
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:05.080]   I'm like Canadian.
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:06.080]   Some thought.
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:07.600]   Yes, some thought was inappropriate.
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:12.640]   I think they need a new category for Best Fake Italian Accent because then Jared Leto
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:16.600]   and Lady Gaga could in fact get their nomination for House of Gucci.
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.600]   They were not nominated surprisingly.
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:20.600]   Good.
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:22.320]   Best Gucci production is not a category.
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:23.320]   Oh my God.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:27.320]   They sounded like a D, so the whole of time it was a series of me.
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.320]   It's a movie.
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.320]   It's a movie.
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:30.320]   It's a movie.
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.040]   It was hysterical.
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:34.280]   It's like I've never seen anything quite like it.
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:40.400]   Plus Leto's wearing a 40 pound fat suit, so he deserves definitely.
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.960]   And he goes from that to Mobius.
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:43.120]   That bands torturing himself.
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:45.120]   By the way, they did not have that term.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:48.120]   Best makeup, so that's kind of appropriate.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:54.960]   All right, I think that's- There's your Hollywood does, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:58.120]   I used to be such a big fan of the Academy Awards.
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:59.120]   Me too.
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:02.120]   And it's kind of lost its luster, I think.
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:07.440]   Yeah, I mean when I was like in my 20s and 30s, I would just like write 10,000 words.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:08.440]   We had parties.
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:12.720]   What I thought- Well, not me, but just like what I thought about each movie, what I thought
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:18.080]   about their chances, what I thought about like, and half- I know it's 80% because it's
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:19.840]   oh, well, that was a silly thing to have done.
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:21.160]   It's just simply a movie.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:24.320]   But there was- But it used to be a more of a- No, it's a great art form.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.320]   What are you talking about?
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:26.320]   No, no, no, no.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.320]   I'm gonna say this again.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:31.560]   It's the original virtual reality because you really get- Even though you're in a darkened
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:35.560]   theater with music and other people and there's a screen, you know, we're in a helmet, you
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:37.400]   are transported by these things.
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:40.400]   I think they cared more about concession rather than you then they cared about experience.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.400]   Oh, that's true.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:46.840]   I'm talking more about like that serious, not about the movies, but about the Oscars.
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:50.640]   Yeah, no, I was always super serious about the movies.
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:51.640]   And so I would talk about it.
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:52.640]   They never nominated a chance.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:53.640]   It was a big chance.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:56.640]   Why it had this kind of- It was a big chance.
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:59.800]   It's funny, it used to be one of the big events of the year.
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:03.960]   We'd have a party, we'd have people over, we'd have food, we'd have Oscar ballots.
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:05.440]   It was your Super Bowl.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:06.440]   It was.
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:07.440]   It was a Super Bowl kind of.
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.280]   And it's just lost its luster.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:13.240]   And then the Golden Globes, which was also great fun because everybody was smashed, didn't
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:15.080]   even bother this year.
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:16.360]   Yeah, it turned out.
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.600]   It turned out that turned- Well, problematic real fast.
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.560]   You could have guessed.
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:24.200]   I still haven't gotten over Julia Benoj beating Lauren Bacall.
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:25.200]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:27.400]   Oh, well, I mean, that was really a opportunity.
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:28.400]   Okay, you win.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:32.400]   You should have used the computer chess program to help her win.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.920]   All right, little break, then we are going to get your picks of the week.
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:41.800]   So I don't know what it is that you'd have to do for a pick of the week.
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:42.800]   Warm them up.
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:45.520]   Gentlemen, start your engines.
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:46.520]   Take your weeks.
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:49.520]   Get those tires heated up.
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:52.760]   Get the down force.
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:53.760]   I said, good.
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:54.760]   No, I love it.
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:58.360]   I watched the F1 and they get to go and do the zigzag in the warm up lap.
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:29:59.360]   I love that.
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:01.520]   It's hysterical just to get the tires on.
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:07.200]   Let's kick off our picks of the week this week with Rene Richie.
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:13.960]   So it brings me great joy to make this pick because there was a lot of stress and anxiety
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:16.880]   over apps increasingly going subscription.
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:20.320]   And some people felt like it was just subscription fatigue or endless.
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:23.480]   And I just chose very carefully which apps I want to support and which ones I thought
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:25.320]   would provide ongoing value.
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:30.560]   And so the new fantastical update, which I believe landed today is exactly the kind
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:34.640]   of thing that I thought is the best result of going to subscription because now you have
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:40.600]   really talented, really creative, really adept, smart, considerate people who have like the
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:44.360]   ability to sustain their apps but also to keep working on their apps.
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:48.960]   And they just announced a new feature for fantastical where it's not new.
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:51.520]   People have been able to do appointment matching for a while.
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:54.480]   So basically you could say Leo Andy, we need to have a talk.
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:57.800]   These are the times that I am available, which one suits you best and everybody can figure
[01:30:57.800 --> 01:30:59.120]   out a time that works for them.
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:03.560]   I mean, it was just the result of a huge sarcastic threat on Twitter a couple weeks ago about
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:06.160]   whether you're important enough to have a calendar or something.
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.120]   But this is really so well thought out.
[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:09.120]   It's localized.
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:10.120]   It's not cloud.
[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:11.120]   It lives on your device.
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:13.560]   It lives in your fantastical install.
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:18.040]   But it's shared through fantastical service so that you know what you're, if you want
[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:21.240]   to, you can choose to share your availability.
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:25.080]   And then people who want to have meetings with you can go in and choose that availability
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:27.360]   and populate sort of those meetings.
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:31.520]   And you can come very quickly to a time that suits, suits everybody.
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:36.760]   And it's done with typical sort of stylistic artistic flair like Fantastical does.
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:39.600]   And they've got a bunch of other little quality of life improvements there.
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:44.800]   You can look at quarterly views, you know, just, and if there's, if you're trying to
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:47.920]   look at a specific date and there's nothing there, it'll tell you there's nothing there.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.520]   But then automatically collapse that down.
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:52.280]   So you're not scrolling through endlessly no event days.
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:56.800]   So it's just, it's a really thoughtful, really good update and just another one in the long
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:00.960]   series of updates that I think personally, Fantastical is providing ongoing value to
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:01.960]   me.
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:02.960]   So I'm really, I'm really happy about that.
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:06.920]   Well, it did just come out today because as soon as you started talking about it, I checked
[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:09.720]   and I just got it, I just downloaded it.
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:13.640]   You don't have to have, so I could send a meeting invitation to somebody.
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:15.160]   They don't have to have Fantastical.
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:16.440]   No, yeah.
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:22.560]   All they have to do is say, here's my available times and, and that Fantastical will mediate
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:24.320]   that just like Calendly does and others.
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:28.640]   And then they'll get an invite and whatever software they're using will handle that advice.
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:32.120]   So a lot of exclamation marks in the change log.
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:34.920]   That's Michael Simmons.
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:37.920]   He says, "What we were talking about is the openings feature."
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:38.920]   Yeah.
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.560]   You have to enable it, so I'm going to do that.
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:43.400]   And then you go to hub.flexibits.com.
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.700]   So do you have to have a subscription account for this?
[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:46.700]   I guess so.
[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:47.700]   This is one of the features.
[01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:48.700]   For this feature, yeah.
[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:49.700]   Yeah.
[01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:53.300]   There's also proposals which lets you what propose to your loved ones.
[01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:54.300]   The Just Time to Be a Wife?
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:55.300]   No, suggest time to things.
[01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:56.300]   No, suggest time to things.
[01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:57.300]   Okay.
[01:32:57.300 --> 01:32:58.300]   Suggest times.
[01:32:58.300 --> 01:32:59.300]   Okay.
[01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:01.440]   Although you could suggest that we get married on Thursday.
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:02.440]   Yeah.
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:04.520]   That would be a very romantic way of doing it.
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:05.520]   Do you have an open thing?
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:09.020]   It's Mac iPad iPhone as well, which is a nice thing too, is that they're rolling all these
[01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:11.720]   features across all the devices at once.
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:14.880]   And then now they've added something which is kind of interesting, which is a quarter
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:15.960]   view.
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:17.800]   So they had day, week, month.
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.520]   You should see my quarter view.
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:21.400]   It's a little busy.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:22.400]   It's quite a lot.
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:25.040]   It's quite a quad I got planned here.
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:26.040]   But that's kind of cool.
[01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:29.140]   It's my nickel and dime view.
[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:32.240]   You could see three months at a time.
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:34.400]   And then there's some enhancements to list for you.
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:36.080]   Good job, Fantastical.
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:39.040]   I like you have chosen to support FlexiBits.
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:45.400]   I love their work and I'm very happy to subscribe to this, which I've always had a paid version,
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:48.440]   but I'm very happy to subscribe to it.
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:51.840]   Fantastical 3.6 available now.
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:56.360]   Mac as well, iPad as well and iPhone.
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:58.320]   Yes, iPhone as well yet.
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:00.840]   Mr. Andy and our Copic of the week.
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:05.760]   I don't know if you were paying attention to social media, but apparently people are
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:09.160]   upset with Spotify over one of their creators.
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:12.480]   One of the bad apples was really bad.
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:16.360]   But if you're switching from Spotify to Apple music or really any music service to any other
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:21.960]   music service or even if like me, like you can't really pick one service and you kind
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:26.280]   of maintain a couple, it's a pain in the butt to take all of your favorite albums, all of
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:30.680]   your playlists, all of your likes and everything and transfer them from one service to another.
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:37.400]   So I was using Song Shift, which is an app that you install on your iPhone or iPad.
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:40.600]   It costs five bucks a month or 20 bucks a year.
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:42.880]   Excuse me, that can't be right.
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:47.440]   There's a pro plan and there's a free plan and it's good for, yeah, actually, there you
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:52.560]   go, but 20 bucks a month or five bucks for one month, which is what you would use if
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:56.880]   you're just saying I'm leaving Spotify behind forever and moving to Apple music, I'm committing
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:57.880]   completely.
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:00.600]   Because you probably wouldn't use this over and over again or would you?
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:06.320]   Well, you would if, again, I kind of want to have a couple of different services for
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:07.720]   silly reasons.
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:13.160]   And it does have neat features where it's not just one shoot, transfer everything from
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:14.240]   one place to another.
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:17.560]   You can also just simply say, take this one playlist and keep it synchronized from one
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:18.560]   service to another.
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:20.520]   And it will routinely check and go.
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:26.160]   One of the things I do like about it as opposed to some of these other services is that it
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:30.200]   doesn't necessarily trust that it's making the right selections.
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:34.760]   So when it does a song match, you can actually review what it thinks it's matched from Spotify
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:39.280]   to Apple music or to Amazon music or to YouTube or to Deezer or whatever.
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:43.200]   And it will make sure that it'll get your verification before you go ahead.
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:48.960]   And so it's one of the, this is one of the biggest pain points of streaming music services.
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:53.800]   I think a lot of people will stick with Spotify just because it's, this is like far five, six,
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:59.480]   seven, 10 years worth of acquired experience and knowledge that you've basically embedded
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:01.200]   inside this one service.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:05.520]   And the idea of starting all over again and trying to rebuild your music library someplace
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:09.960]   else is you'd have to, you'd have to be a lot more offensive than Joe Rogan get a lot
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:12.000]   of people to like make that switch.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.800]   But an app like this makes it really, really easy.
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:17.880]   So you really are free to decide that why am I, why am I sticking with Spotify when I
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:19.200]   don't get high resolution music?
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:21.080]   I don't get 3D music.
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:26.080]   I don't get parts of this library that Apple just acquired.
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:28.000]   It makes it frictionless.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.160]   You understand why we're talking about regulations internationally across the world.
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:36.880]   Why data portability is a big part of the digital bill of rights that a lot of countries
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.160]   are trying to promote.
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:42.880]   That the idea that you can't, you can't kind of trick people into keeping paying for your
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:46.960]   service just because you're making it so difficult for them to move to competitors.
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:50.760]   And this is, it sucks that you have to spend five bucks to get this thing that you should
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:53.200]   probably be able to have built in for free.
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:55.040]   But nonetheless, it is a solution and it'll work great.
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:59.240]   So if you just want to transfer, sign up for five bucks a month and cancel after you've
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:03.000]   done the thing you want to do, but for 20 bucks a month, you might want to, if you want
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.200]   a year, 20 bucks a year, sorry, 20 bucks a year, you might want to keep it going just
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:10.640]   to see just a sample other services and see which one you settle into.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:11.640]   Yeah.
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:15.960]   In fact, I'm adding all my services right now because I immediately signed up and I'm
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:21.840]   going to pay for 40 bucks for the one time only because I have so many, I foolishly run
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:23.320]   many, many services.
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:24.320]   It's nice.
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:28.480]   It actually works with Pandora too, where I have a lot of a lot of data.
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:33.400]   They added a new service, a new feature kind of recently where if you want to share a playlist
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:38.040]   with somebody else, you don't necessarily have to anticipate that they've used the exact
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:39.320]   same service you do.
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:44.280]   Even if you don't subscribe to Spotify, but you want a Spotify friend to use this playlist
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:49.320]   you made in Apple Music, you can basically, it's called Songshare, meaning it will figure
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:54.640]   out what the Spotify plays would be and then send a link to that to your friend.
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:55.880]   I just bought that too.
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:58.200]   Buck 99, that seems fair.
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:37:59.200]   That's really cool.
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:00.200]   Yeah.
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:08.120]   So, I guess these services must have an API unless they're figured out how to scrape it.
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:09.120]   That's interesting.
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:10.120]   Yeah.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.120]   It's hard to know.
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:16.520]   When you start looking into these things, you see a lot of things that are like, okay,
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:22.160]   first of all, open Spotify on the web, open developer pane, paste the following JavaScript
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:24.160]   code into the...
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:27.400]   And there's a lot of stuff that you can fix by doing that, but a lot of this is super
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:28.400]   sketchy.
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:32.240]   And as you say, if they change the API or if they change anything, it's going to stop working
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:34.800]   or worse do things you don't anticipate it to do.
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:40.240]   So I don't know exactly how it does what it does, but I've been using it for a while now
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:43.480]   and it's a very good consumer level.
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:45.120]   It just push a button.
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:46.120]   Do you tell it what to do?
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:48.120]   It'll do it exactly as you expected it to do.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:51.560]   I am signing into all of the dozens of...
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:55.280]   Well, but that's a professional hazard, right?
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:58.760]   Because I have to kind of check out all these different services.
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:38:59.760]   Lime wire, napsure.
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:00.760]   Yeah.
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:01.760]   Yeah.
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:02.960]   A lot of stuff's on here.
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:03.960]   Not interestingly...
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:08.640]   Well, I guess everything I want is on here.
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:11.000]   There are some oddball services that might not be.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.120]   But there's also some oddball services that are like Cobas and Hype Machine and Discogs.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:23.520]   The only thing I wish it that it doesn't have that I wish it had was support for Plex because
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:26.000]   I would love it if I could just simply create...
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:30.440]   If I could have a playlist of music that I actually own as files and it could simply
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:35.720]   replicate that on Apple Music without my having to do this, all this stuff manually.
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:42.080]   I have yet to find a really, really good solution for doing track matching.
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:46.760]   If you have a physical media, physical files that are on a server that you control, but
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:50.480]   you also want to have the ability to simply stream it elsewhere without having to keep
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:53.960]   a copy of your entire music database in the cloud somewhere.
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:55.120]   I'm signing into...
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:58.200]   It's taken me forever, but I'm signing into all these services.
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:39:59.800]   A lot of fingerprint touches.
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:00.800]   Holy cow.
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:02.600]   Yeah, there's a lot of face and ID going on here.
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:08.440]   Hey, I wanted to mention this is such a sweet story, but if you were a fan of Joe Danger,
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:17.600]   which was one of the early runner games on iOS, Joe Danger has been relaunched and the
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:18.600]   story is great.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.640]   This is from 9 to 5 Mac.
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:27.480]   So Sean Murray, who did No Man's Sky, which is an amazing game, is relaunching something
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:30.000]   he did earlier called Joe Danger.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.280]   He made the announcement on Twitter, Joe Danger is relaunching on iOS today.
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:38.280]   A secret shame of ours is that the success of No Man's Sky left our first game, Joe Danger
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:39.280]   Unloved.
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:45.080]   Sadly, since iOS called older games, it no longer worked on the latest Apple devices.
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:49.680]   And then he refers to a male he received that broke our hearts and made this one a set
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:50.920]   things right.
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:53.560]   Hello, the email goes.
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:54.800]   My name is redacted.
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:56.560]   I'm redacted from redacted.
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:59.520]   And I'm writing this letter on behalf of my son, Jack.
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:03.640]   Jack's eight years old is about the sweetest kid on the planet and has been diagnosed with
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:04.640]   autism.
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:07.640]   As you probably know, children with autism deal with a great many struggles.
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:10.920]   Chief among them are a great difficulty with social interactions.
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:16.360]   However, one of the things that has enabled Jack and us to bond is our shared love of
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:18.840]   video games, specifically Joe Danger.
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:19.840]   Jack loves Joe.
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.160]   He loves everything about him.
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:24.160]   He has a collection of toy motorcycles that are his Joe Danger.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:26.720]   Every motorcycle we see on the street is Joe Danger.
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:29.280]   One of the first things I hear every day when I walk in the door after a long day of work
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:32.640]   is, come on, Daddy, let's go play Joe Danger.
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:38.360]   Just being able to say that sentence is a massive deal for a child with autism.
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:43.040]   Joe Danger has allowed Jack to interact and have funds with friends and family alike.
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:44.680]   Now is the part where we ask for help.
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:46.480]   Not only has Joe Danger helped Jack with friends.
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:52.760]   It's become an important coping mechanism, but the iPhone version of Joe Danger, since
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:57.160]   iOS was updated, hasn't worked with the newer versions, and one isn't even able to find
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:59.440]   in the app store anymore.
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:02.840]   It's a longer letter, which I highly recommend.
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:04.840]   John Gruber discovered.
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:05.840]   I'm not crying.
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:06.840]   You're crying.
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:07.840]   I know.
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:08.840]   It's beautiful.
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:13.400]   But what's even more beautiful is that Joe Danger is back.
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:15.720]   And I hope both the kid.
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:16.720]   One may be right.
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:17.720]   Yeah, long may he write.
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:19.320]   It's actually, I downloaded.
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:23.960]   There's a two pack where you can get both Joe Danger games, and I downloaded them both
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:26.880]   Joe Danger and Joe Infinity.
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:28.120]   And they're really a lot of fun.
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:29.560]   It's a great little game.
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:35.040]   So I think it might be a good thing for everybody to go out and support the work of this company,
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:36.040]   bringing it back.
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:38.080]   And you'll enjoy it, I think.
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:40.480]   That's part of the shame of the way the games are distributed right now.
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:46.760]   If you can imagine a movie that's a classic movie that has just been groundbreaking for
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:50.720]   its artistry and its innovation, but it was made in a special format that can only be
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:56.200]   played in a special projector that was made between 1944 and 1948.
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:01.560]   And now it just simply doesn't exist anymore except for in our imagination because it just
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:03.040]   simply doesn't exist anymore.
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:04.040]   And that's what we're dealing with.
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:08.680]   We're having generations of kids or having experiences with online games that they can
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:12.440]   have long conversations about that are they would love to tell their kids about it sometime
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:13.440]   in the future.
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:16.880]   Because it was a server based game and because they pulled the plug in that server, it just
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:18.560]   doesn't exist anymore.
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:23.040]   So it's actually the closest we have our TV shows with rights issues that just can't
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:24.920]   be published on DVD or streaming.
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:27.200]   I remember them and I want to see them again.
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:32.240]   And that's why I actually kind of I don't support piracy, but I think that you have to
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:37.200]   acknowledge that there is a role that private that piracy actually provides.
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:41.400]   You think you think about how it sounds silly to think about a hundred years in the future,
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:48.040]   but Americans in a hundred years are entitled to have free copies of the Mandalorian.
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:52.760]   They're entitled to be able to see all of the stuff, share it, create their own version
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:56.200]   of the Mandalorian remix it because that's when copyright expires.
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:00.000]   And the deal that the government makes is that you don't you get protection from the
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.840]   government for a period of time, but then you give it away.
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:06.240]   And what's going to happen if Disney says, Oh, well, gee, we'll to do that.
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:11.040]   We would have to actually remove it from our protected servers and actually release it.
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.400]   That sounds like something that we don't want to do.
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:15.120]   And so we're just not going to want to do it.
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:19.200]   And that's when but they can't they can't step us that way because they're people who
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:24.000]   they're brave patriots who are pirating the Mandalorian and making sure that's on.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.280]   It's on it's on usenets and other cycles so that when the time comes, there will be copies
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:30.520]   of this available.
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:32.000]   Just Hey, just.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.080]   Well, if you want to support it because I really think that this is very important.
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:43.760]   Internet Archive at archive.org is taking that stand saying, look, we're preserving stuff,
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:47.600]   even if it's still in copyright, but stuff that is no longer playable, you can boot an
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:51.240]   old Mac on here and play and do hypercard and all sorts of things.
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:55.200]   And I think a lot of people know about the way back machine, but archive the Internet
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:56.440]   Archive is much more than that.
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:58.160]   And they games console games.
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:44:59.560]   They're all they're all being protected.
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:00.560]   They're preserving.
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:05.440]   I'm going to say very, very quickly that the only way that you can see the original version,
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:10.200]   the original release version of Star Wars Episode four, a new hope before all the changes
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:14.840]   and upgrades were made to it and see it in 4k and a 4k and a really good print is to
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:19.280]   get a pirated version of it because maybe for the whole bunch of people decided that
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:24.000]   chief we get a whole bunch of these like illegal release prints that were toward the country
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.680]   a million times and all scratched up.
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:29.520]   If we get like nine or 10 of these together, we could composite each friend together to
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:33.560]   make a perfect 4k frame to all the color correction to all the fixing.
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.560]   And it's gorgeous.
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:36.880]   It is like the most beautiful thing ever.
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:40.520]   It is 10 times better than whatever you might have seen in the late 70s.
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:45.440]   And until like Disney slash Lucasfilm figures out what they want to do, there's such a long,
[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:50.000]   long story about whether or not that's even legally possible for them to do.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.240]   At least this thing still exists.
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:55.880]   And that's a 100 in 2077.
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:57.920]   I will be able to like leave.
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:01.920]   I will be able to leave a video to like my great, great, great, great nieces say, now
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:04.120]   I want you to watch this movie.
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:05.120]   It was really awesome.
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:10.200]   And then I wanted to wear a Han Solo vest because it was so cool.
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:12.000]   Han shot first.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.280]   Don't believe the lies.
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:15.280]   I can prove it.
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:17.960]   I've got the film.
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:18.960]   Archive.org.
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:22.000]   Absolutely a great place to go to find all of this stuff.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.320]   And I think that there's there's surviving any legal challenges, but they certainly accept
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:30.840]   donations because it's not an expensive project.
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:35.080]   It's seriously some of the best some of the most fun you will have is going through those
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:38.520]   archives because you will never believe the stuff that you find there.
[01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:42.960]   Again, if there's a preponderance of doubt as to whether or not maybe this maybe this
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:44.680]   right rights have not been claimed.
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:46.440]   So we're going to assume it's okay.
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:49.520]   They actually I think they actually have a carve out saying that they're not going to
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:55.000]   get sued into oblivion for assuming that something is archivable and making it available.
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000]   I have to look up.
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.800]   You have to follow up on that.
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:01.760]   Yeah, it's weird like, wait a minute, but that's an actual movie that really, really
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:03.480]   was released in 1982.
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:04.920]   How can they put that up there?
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:09.440]   They're well because nobody claimed it and nobody wants it and it's not on DVD and someone
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:11.760]   had a VHS and decided, guess what?
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:15.120]   You get to see the Tonight Show for for the for the for the for these three months.
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:16.120]   Okay.
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:21.360]   I'll take credit to a Brewster Kale to who sold who sold his company to AOL made a lot
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:26.440]   of money and could have gone on and become you know a Mark Cuban, but instead decided
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:32.200]   to plow that money into the Internet Archive and to do everything he could to save the
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:39.720]   Internet and he's now got 99 petabytes of data, 625 billion web pages, 38 million books
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:42.200]   and texts, 14 million audio recordings.
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:45.240]   It has become like Wikipedia.
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:50.240]   It's one of the great jewels of the Internet and yeah, it reminds me that I've got a up
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:54.560]   my monthly contribution to them because they're really great.
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:58.600]   We are out of time, but it was a lot of fun boys and girls.
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:47:59.600]   There's no girls here.
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.360]   There's a lot of fun boys.
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:04.240]   Andy and I go, when are you going to be on GBH next?
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:08.640]   I'm off this week, but I'm on next week at the usual time Friday at 12 30 p.m. Eastern
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:09.640]   time.

[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:25.520]   Heidi Hose kids.
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:28.280]   I keep working on GBH there.
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:32.200]   I've encountered some resistance, but I persevere.
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:33.200]   You need a tray.
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:34.200]   Everybody needs a trademark.
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:39.640]   Heidi, Heidi, I just want the jingle time for Andy and not goes.
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:41.640]   I deal.

[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:50.400]   Now with animation animated timelines.
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:52.520]   What are you working on next?
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:56.200]   I'm working on, I've been doing a series of things about the future of technology is the
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:59.800]   things that Apple could do to go beyond Bluetooth or to go beyond lightning.
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:05.800]   I'm working on one about going beyond active biometric authentication into a more passive
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:09.240]   ambient ambient is a right term form of authentication.
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:11.080]   I'm working on that for tomorrow I hope.
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:12.080]   Very nice.
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:14.640]   Well, thank you gentlemen.
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:18.560]   We do Mac break weekly of a Tuesday 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern.
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:19.880]   That's 1900 UTC.
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:24.120]   I say the time so you can watch it live if you want to at live.twit.tv.
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:28.320]   If you're watching live chat with us live you can either use the free IRC chat rom IR

[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:44.440]   That has become an important revenue source for us during covid and I think going forward
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:51.560]   it's also allowed us to do new shows in audio that we would maybe not have done as a podcast
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:57.760]   like the ultimate or I'm sorry untitled although it is the ultimate show it's untitled.
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:05.000]   We have a new show that is debuting on the club feed this week in space with Rod Pyle.

[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:06.240]   than 17 years but I don't know it seems like an awful long time.
