[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Was that from last week too?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   We've got a lot of special effects that you guys built in for last week's Mac Break Weekly.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Thank you, Micah, for filling in for me last week.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Next time, please don't do such a good job.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   It's really tough for me to come back.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   When I see all these tweets, "Oh, it was such a good sh..."
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   It's like, "Oh, man.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Hey, Laurie Gill, how are you?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Good to see you.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I'm good to see you.

[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Were you on Twitter this week or was last week?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   It was last week.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   It was really nice having you on Twitter as well.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Thank you.

[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Yes.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I did pop for the lights that Laurie recommended a couple of weeks ago and they are the bomb.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I usually buy everything Laurie talks about.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   For some reason, I was able to just by the skin of my teeth avoid buying that one.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I don't know why.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I need to work on my force.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   You will buy.

[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I have the face for radio, so let's do this.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I did say iMoor.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Of course, you are still ready for iMoor, but mostly you're doing your own YouTube thing at youtube.com.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   So it's Renee Richie.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Try and do it.

[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   It's been a bit too long.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   So my experience, I only had a few experiences
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   with running higher, heavier tasks.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   We have a motion.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   We actually use it for benchmarking.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   We have a motion video that rendering
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   takes a lot of time, takes a lot of processor power.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Actually, we have two of them.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   One of them, the MacBook Pro with M1
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   was faster than the 16 MacBook 16
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   with Intel by about 40%.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   It was a lot faster.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   The other one, it was oddly slower.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   It took two and a half.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   There's one with motion blur that took
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   two and a half hours.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   It was also a little bit slower.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   The 16 is faster in some things.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   The fan never, I never heard the fan
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   even when it was rendering it to
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   and it had to get warm.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   It did get warm, but it never got hot.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   It got warm in the same places
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   that your other MacBooks do,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   which is here above the touch bar and on the back.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   The only thing I should caution
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   is a lot of especially, I think,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   PC reviewers are getting this wrong
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   because it is complicated.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   A lot of the benchmarks we're seeing
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   aren't actually M1 MacBook versus Intel MacBook.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   No, they're testing against the T2 chip.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   - No, that's ridiculous.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   - Because the T2 chip will do H.265, H.264.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   If you're not careful what exactly you're throwing at it,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   you are showing that, yes,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Apple is now four generations ahead
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   of their media and code IP, which is great,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   but you're not showing any difference
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   between M1 and Intel.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   - Yeah, so, it's, I mean,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   that's why I don't do the benchmarking thing.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Everybody's also already done it.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   So, I think I'm more interested in, you know,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   real world kind of what it feels like.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   - Time to complete it work.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   - And time to complete it work is important.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   And if you're using motion, I think, you know,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   it's kind of a mixed bag
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   because in some things,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   a 16 inch MacBook Pro would be faster.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Certainly an iMac Pro would be faster across the board
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   within T2.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   - But I do have to say--
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   - The last thing the question is impressive though,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   because the 16 inch should just kill it.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Like there should be no discussion.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   - Yeah, should kill it.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   - No question.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   So the fact that it's interesting, I think, is interesting.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   - Yeah.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   One of the quick thing that I'm seeing in a lot of the testing videos
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   and the post up and seeing is that a lot of it is running,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   that they're doing, even when they're doing real world benchmarks,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   they're benchmarking, we click the start button on this build
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   with Final Cut, we click the start button on the build
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   on this other Final Cut, or if they use something like DaVinci Resolve,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   which is multi-platform, they're doing it on equivalent hardware,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   but just one thing at a time.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   And a lot of people are getting the impression that,
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   "Wow, I can't believe that some people have spent like $15,000 on a Mac Pro."
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   And the benchmarks say that this $800 Mac Mini is almost as fast.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   They must be going out of their minds.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   But then when you do, like you say, a more real world test,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   where, "Okay, so you know, but you're in your editing suite
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   or you're at your desk, you know that this thing is going to take
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   about 40 minutes to render."
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   So in the meantime, you're going to go into the background
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   and you're going to check something else and you're going to work on
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   something on another document.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   So you're going to add another thread, another thread, another thread.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   That's the area in which when you, that's why you spend the $10,000 to $15,000 on the Mac Pro,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   because it can do things faster than not only can it do that one thing faster than a Mac Mini
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   that costs like $150 as much, but it also means that you don't just have to sit there,
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   you know, playing Rubik's Cube while you're waiting for this thing to stop.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   It can continue to be a very, very powerful computer
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   while you're doing powerful things in the background.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Yeah, the RAM pressure is so much less on those machines.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Yeah, it's kind of interesting, too, because I was able to get it to swap
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   in some cases with the motion and I'm using I-Step menus, which is Apple is universal,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   but there are some strange things about it.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   For instance, it only sees one temperature sensor and that's for the SSD on my iMac Pro.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   It sees like 500.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   So I feel like that might be not working.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   And then--
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   It was my pick of the week last week and I've been bugging Mark about it
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   and they're working on it because it's just something completely new for them.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I also-- Yeah, and I understand, look, this is brand new.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   I'm not--
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   It's weeks when it turns around.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Yeah, we should be very clear that in every case, the fact that so much works is amazing
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   and that companies like Bajango, the creators of i-Step menus,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   actually took the trouble of making it ARM compatible is great.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   But yeah, and also for some reason, when I look at the battery,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   it's telling me battery life.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   By the way, it is outstanding.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   But it says that my condition is the health is 2% and I need to service the battery.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Now, obviously, it's a brand new battery.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   That's not the case.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Did you see what they're doing with Intel Leo to get some of the performance on Rosetta 2?
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   No.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   So ARM is much less strict about the way that it handles instructions.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Oh, I did see that.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Intel is not-- Yeah.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   So there-- Apple is figuring out where the differences are between the two instruction sets
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   and then enabling specific Intel compatibility IP inside the chipset
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   to do things in a way that Intel instructions expect them to be done
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   so you don't get anywhere near the performance hit.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   And it's funny because back when they did the original Rosetta,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   there was no way they could tell Intel, like, yeah, just simulate PowerPZ for us.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Just build all that into your chipset.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   But now that they're doing their own, they're like, yeah, so what's the difference?
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Can we fix that?
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Oh, we can, yes.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Historically, the biggest difference is Big Andy and Little Little Andy
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   and Little Little Andy, right?
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   I think that ARM is--
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Intel's aware now.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   I think the latest generation Intel has--
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   well, they're going to call it now Big.Little, but yes, the same thing.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   And so that was historically a big slowdown in emulation.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Yet it reverse-- Big Andy and Little Andy means that the higher--
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   the most significant bit is on the other end.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And so you have to reverse the contents of registers.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   And that would-- I would imagine slowing you down quite a bit.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   It's so deck-alpha-leo.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Yeah, so apparently Apple's even handling that kind of internally,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   which is very interesting.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   So in a way, they're bowing to Intel and saying, okay,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   but when you're running Intel code, we'll do it this way.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   That's fine.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   We'll be Big Andy and no big deal.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   So that's kind of interesting, too.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   There are a lot of tricks in here, and we're going to learn more, I suspect, over time.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   I may not be as sensitive as a lot of people are to snappiness.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   A lot of the subjective opinions about these new processors is that's really snappy.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   It's fast.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   And one to no bounces to launch an app and things like that.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   I never felt like the older stuff was slow.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Have a beach ball, though?
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   I haven't been--
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   I mean, beach balled.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   That's a good point.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   It's life without beach balls, Leo.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   It's like this beautiful dream that they promised us and we never thought would be real.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   It's life without beach balls so far.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Well, how do they do that, I wonder?
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   I just don't think there's the-- I think the latency is so much lower.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   They can just act on things so much quicker that the system is-- they build a system with
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   the CPU, GPU, and the memory bandwidth are all balanced.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   And so I think they don't have the same bottlenecks that they had when they had sort of like,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   "I made this joke in my video.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   I apologize."
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   It's like the old architecture was a Shakuta Reboard, and you had to go reach for everything.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   And now it's a sandwich.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   It's just like an SOC sandwich, and everything is right next to a pool of shared memory, so a lot of the bottlenecks are gone.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Okay, let me launch, for instance, this is a universal app cable sasser at Panic.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Has been very responsive and very-- in fact, they received and featured in Apple's promo video.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   I'm going to launch Nova, which is their new editor app, and this is M1 Native.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   And yeah, it launches really fast.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   I mean, pretty fast and fast, right?
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   But it's not so much faster than I go, "Oh my God, I can't believe it.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   I'm so happy."
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Maybe I just was used to the fact that, "Yeah, wait a second more, and then it's going to be there."
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   You're getting your life back, Lee, and you're getting slices of your life back.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   You want to say--
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   You just want to say seconds at a time.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   And it may just be that I'm insensitive to this kind of thing.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Yes, it's faster.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   But a lot of what's faster is not a major quality of life issue.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   It's snappier.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   That's nice.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   If I live all day in Final Cut, it makes a difference to me.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   It's like, just every time I don't have to wait those few seconds.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   That's where it's going to make more of a difference.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   So things like rendering, things where you are doing hard core stuff, it's faster.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   You're going to notice it more.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   But for most people who are just using a computer normally with kind of standard apps--
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Electron apps, you could say it's OK.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Well, Electron now, by the way, has a native version, although it's not yet incorporated into most Electron apps,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   but that's going to happen.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   I don't think-- before it came out, I was saying, oh, wait.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   It's going to be a big change.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   You're going to want it.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Don't delay.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Now I'm going, yeah.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   It's fine.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   It's nice.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   It's not earth shattering yet.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   And I think it will be.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   And there are some people who should not go.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   So all the YouTube stars are showing video editing and things like that.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Sorry, YouTube star.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   They're getting their regrets now.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   From the point of view of a developer, there are some issues.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   There are some gaps that make this maybe a wait six months kind of thing.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   And by the way, it doesn't hurt to wait six months because then you're going to get the M1X or the M2.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   And this is clear.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   I mean, nobody's disputing the fact this is a really exciting new platform.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   And it's going to-- it's just amazing.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   And it's going to take Apple to places that no one else can go.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   I'm not disputing that.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   But for today, especially if you're a developer, I think you might find there are some things that are showstoppers.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   If you-- homebrew now can be with some little manipulations told to do stuff for ARM architecture.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   But not every formula will work by any means.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   I switched to Mac ports hoping it would be a little easier to use because supposedly it built a lot of stuff from scratch.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   That's not the case.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   So Mac ports is running in emulation in Rosetta.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   And I could install EMAX.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   EMAX just wasn't working.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   But EMAX, the development version does and is native.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   So it's taking-- there's taking some time.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   There's some-- not-- there really some showstoppers for me.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   If you're a Haskell user, I think you're going to have-- this is my blog post.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   I'm just taking notes as I go.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   And if you're a Haskell user, it's going to be a little challenging for you.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   If you're a Lisp user, it's going to be a little challenging.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   And it's really going to come down to who-- you know, the Lisp I use, SteelBank Common Lisp,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   is SteelBank paying attention?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Do they consider this an important market?
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Do they care?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Maybe, maybe not.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   So it's going to really depend.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Then there are additional issues.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   And I think Renee, I really want you to address this because you're probably up on this.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   The security on this is much higher now.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   They've really locked it down.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   And there are, I think, some showstoppers for some of these development tools.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   They've changed the rules on just in time, for instance.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   A lot of this stuff is so much more locked down that developers who say,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   "Well, I can recompile for ARM no problem," are still stopped because a lot of libraries
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   won't work with the new security controls.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   And just the compressiveness of who they're giving the entitlements to.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   I forget which it was, but it was a developer saying, "I make this app which is renowned
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   for its security.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   I can't get this entitlement, but this Clean Your Directory app got it."
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   I don't understand what's happening, which is always the case with the App Store.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   So maybe I'm being winey because every year I do this really fun competition called the
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   advent of code.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   It's an advent calendar for coders.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   There's 25 problem sets.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Actually, there's two problems per day for 25 days.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And I love doing it.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   It's really fun.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   I was really looking forward to this.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   It started today.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   And the software tool that I like to use, which is Racket, doesn't work.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Now, the Racket developers are very aware of this and they're working hard on it, but
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   it doesn't work.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   And it's like, "Aww."
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Because that's how I've done it in years past, and I can't use it.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   I had to actually pull out my Dell XPS and run it on Linux.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   So that I could do.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   There's going to be a year of pain where they lock this all down and they thought, "We
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   know what the exceptions are."
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   And if you really want to, you can go in and turn this off.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.400]   And yes, you'll give up the ability to run iOS apps, but you'll gain a regular hobbyist
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.880]   Mac platform yet.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.000]   But there are so much has changed that there are going to be so many outlier, not even
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.040]   outlier, just so many things they didn't have time to address or fix or think about or
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.800]   recurve them.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.360]   And they're going to have to spend the next year listening very carefully to people who
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:52.840]   want to do exactly what you want to do to figure out how they can make that Konami code
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.680]   so that you enter it and forget it.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.120]   I am opting out of your iOS-like environment.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.720]   I recognize that for my grandparents and my kids, it's wonderful, but I don't want any
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.720]   of it.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.600]   I'm putting in my Konami code now you leave me be, and they've got to just live up to
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.320]   that promise.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.480]   And then there's a surprising and large amount of stuff that works.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.760]   Eye term is native.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.320]   Fish shell is native.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.320]   Apple, because they-
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.120]   Some of the Windows emulation stuff, which is nuts.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.120]   Yeah, it's weird.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.600]   A Docker doesn't work.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.600]   That's a showstopper for a lot of people, I think.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:29.360]   It's a little bit curl, nano bash, Z shell, Vim, said, grep, ock, python and pearl, all
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.800]   our Apple provided, all our native.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:37.240]   So there's an insider's beta, a VS code that's native, but a lot of the extensions and packages
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.440]   don't work.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.480]   Rust can work sort of natively.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:46.680]   So there are- And Google, by the way, within a couple of days, put out a version of Chrome
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:52.000]   that's native, which means you can run Stadia on this, which is kind of probably the reason
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   they did that.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.400]   Because gaming is going to be a challenge.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.400]   I guess people have gotten-
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.760]   Probably the enthusiast eyeballs.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.640]   They want those enthusiast eyeballs on Chrome.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.920]   They don't want them trying Safari, trying Firefox.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.960]   Gotta keep those enthusiast eyeballs on Chrome.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.920]   Well, Firefox is running an emulation.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.920]   Safari runs beautifully.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.720]   In fact, this is a good reason to go back to Safari because it's obviously the best-
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:12.720]   At this point, the best browser.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.320]   They also put JavaScript accelerable.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.480]   They didn't put the A14 had phenomenal.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.480]   I mean, even DHA was-
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.880]   Oh, yeah, it's beating everybody.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.880]   And now you've got that on the Mac, too.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.880]   It's even 1.3 times faster than what Safari already was on the Mac.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:31.960]   So I guess I would say that you really should check what tools you need, you want, you have
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:36.120]   to have before you do the upgrade and see what their status is.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.520]   Because this is going to be a bumpy road for a while.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.520]   What do you think?
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.520]   A month?
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.520]   Six months a year?
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.520]   I can't use it yet either.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.040]   I can't use it from my main machine just because the codec that I use for this camera
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:51.080]   is running under Rosetta and it just doesn't perform well at all on these Macs yet.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.560]   Like the screen would be too small for me anyway.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.320]   I really want the 16-inch because I need all that space.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.960]   So that would be a showstopper.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:02.040]   But on top of that, if you're running production, I'm not upgrading to Big Sur on a production
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.560]   machine for months, let alone an entire platform architecture.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.320]   So it's always like when I see people in enterprise, like there are certain people on
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.960]   enterprise who just are complaining that their ActiveX website isn't working.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.120]   And I'm just like, you have an IT department.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.600]   You're just doing this to complain.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.840]   They're not letting you upgrade to Big Sur for a year.
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.840]   You'll be lucky to get it until Mac.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.720]   Unless your Amazon cloud service is, they're running Intel Macs.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.120]   Nobody in enterprise is using this stuff yet.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.160]   So play with it for fun for now.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.960]   But if it's not for you, don't force yourself into it.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.320]   Don't wear the wrong size shoe just because they're the latest shoes.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.880]   Wait until your size shoe is out.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.960]   But when you're, when the things that you want are out, especially if they're, Rosetta
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.240]   works fine by the way.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:47.400]   Last pass or sponsor, it runs under Rosetta and it's beautiful.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.000]   I would argue it might even be better under Rosetta.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.920]   It's much better than on Intel, which is really funny too.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.960]   So there are a lot of things running in emulation.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:03.920]   Sync thing and a lot of my tools, Mailmate, which is the email I run great under Rosetta.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.680]   So that works.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.440]   They've done a good job on that.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:12.160]   So I wouldn't say don't, I would just say there's some that are just don't work at all.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:17.360]   And you need to make sure that anything you have to have works, even if it's under Rosetta.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.800]   It would run under M1 native.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.000]   They're, I'm amazing is put out a tool, which is really great that you can use to figure
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.640]   out if your apps, it actually collects all the apps, it tells you what architecture they're
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.640]   using.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.920]   But you can also do it straight out of the system report.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:38.960]   If you do about this Mac and do a system report, when you click on applications under software,
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.560]   it will tell you, it's gone through them now, but it'll tell you what kind over in this
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.320]   right hand corner, what kind they are.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:54.320]   So it's pretty easy to tell, you know, like the chess app is universal, the clock app is
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.320]   universal.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:00.600]   I think is everything Apple does, did they recompile everything to be universal?
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.360]   How does anything that they didn't yet?
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.800]   So I think it's a very good thing to do.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.440]   I think it's a very good thing to do.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.400]   I think it's a very good thing to do.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.640]   They recompile everything to be universal.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.280]   Have you seen anything that they didn't yet?
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.280]   Well, yeah.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:25.040]   So if you're willing to stick with Apple stuff, Microsoft Office is available now in the insiders
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.280]   program in the beta.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.520]   Although Photoshop is in beta.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:34.080]   I'll have to say here, let me just show you a launch word.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.360]   And it takes a few bounces.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:40.440]   It's not even those native Microsoft folks.
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.880]   It's not going to jump off at you.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.040]   But, you know, good for Microsoft.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:49.080]   At least you're complaining about Word and not using Word perfectly.
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.640]   After all these decades, they finally won.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.640]   They finally won.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.640]   I'm sad.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.640]   I loved Word perfect on the Mac.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.640]   What was that?
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.640]   You do?
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.640]   5.0.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.640]   Corel owns it now, right?
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:58.640]   I think Corel owns it now.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.640]   I don't know if they still make it for the Mac.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.000]   That was the best Mac Word processor for one brief, shiny moment.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.960]   iOS apps.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.360]   We did a whole thing on iOS today.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.440]   If you want to see our experience, clearly if the developer is taking the time to use
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.080]   catalyst, it's great.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.000]   But it's surprisingly large number of iOS apps just run.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.280]   I use it as an example, Bill Atkinson's photo card.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.240]   Because I know Bill's abandoned this basically.
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.200]   He's done with it.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.200]   This is two years old.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.760]   He doesn't want to do it anymore.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:31.960]   But the funny thing is, so obviously he never, he wrote this long before Apple was doing
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.240]   a silica.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.960]   It goes full screen.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.160]   It works.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.160]   You can do everything.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.400]   The whole thing works.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:47.460]   So I'll be my guess that if anybody is writing correctly for iOS, it's Bill Atkinson, the
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:51.400]   creator of Mac Paint and HyperCard.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:58.240]   Probably because he wrote it right for iOS, it actually runs beautifully on an M1 Mac.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:02.840]   But there are a lot of developers' Netflix that just say they're checking the box.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:06.120]   You have to proactively say, "No, please don't let anybody install this on a Mac."
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.960]   That's what Netflix has done.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.800]   There's others like HBO app Macs where it runs, but it runs in a window.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.160]   You can't go full screen as far as I could tell you can't airplay.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.840]   But there's some that you can Chromecast.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.840]   That was Chromecasting.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.200]   And it worked fine.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.880]   So it's a very mixed bag.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.640]   And there isn't one spot you can go at this point to figure out.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.200]   There is a website is Apple Silicon Ready.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.000]   But it's a good site, but it's not complete.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.080]   They say the complete guide.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:42.280]   It's far from complete because there's just too many apps in the world.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.280]   So...
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.200]   So I'm confused as to...
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:54.240]   I just thought that Rosetta was supposed to solve the problem of any app that isn't
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:31:01.320]   native to M1, but there are apps, there's programs out there that Rosetta won't translate.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.000]   I don't understand why that's even a thing.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.640]   That's the case.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.640]   And I agree with you.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.480]   That's why I'm bringing it up.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.440]   So do you...
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.920]   And maybe Renee, maybe you know a little bit more about how Rosetta works.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:22.560]   Like, why would they not work if Rosetta is supposed to translate all apps into supported?
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.560]   Or I mean, that...
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.560]   It's just a case of...
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:30.880]   Yeah, I think it's just a case of the depending on the age and the creativity that was used
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.680]   in developing it, there are just cases that they don't...
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.080]   That just are failing.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.000]   And it's probably just, you know, there are things that they didn't test or try because
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.240]   you know...
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:44.200]   No amount of internal QUI ever matches a million users suddenly hitting your system.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.000]   So it might just be tweaks that they need to do on the Intel site and recompile their
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   binaries where Apple might need to tweak a few things in Rosetta.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.360]   There's a lot of developer and command line stuff that doesn't work at all.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.520]   And I think that that...
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:00.560]   Again, I think that's more because security model has changed.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.360]   And it's much more locked down than it used to be.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.600]   I think that's part of it.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:08.120]   That in itself is my biggest concern moving forward.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.760]   That it's wonderful that I can...
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:13.720]   This is an extreme example, but I was able to buy a MacBook for...
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:20.840]   Untested for $10, the MIT flea market, and either run Mac OS 10.4 on it or just simply
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.240]   turn it into a Linux machine.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.640]   And I was perfectly free to turn it into a Linux machine.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:31.960]   That's how extreme control you have when you actually have the ability to access an unlocked,
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.360]   unprotected, unsecured by Apple's standards computer.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:42.280]   So it would bum me out to know limits if this machine that I've just spent $1,500, $1,600
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:47.000]   for will only be a working computer as long as Apple decides that it's okay for me to
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.280]   continue to use it.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.320]   And that's one of the things that's very, very possible.
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.480]   To say nothing of...
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:57.560]   One of my favorite pieces of software is make MKV, which is the tool that I use to rip DVDs
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.320]   and Blu-rays into video files I can put on my server.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:07.960]   Maybe Apple doesn't think that it's important for this app to be compatible with Apple Silicon.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:11.280]   And so they have the ability to say, "Oh, well, we don't really trust this app and so
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.680]   we're for your own protection.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.880]   We're not going to let you run it."
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.840]   So that is always my concern when Apple makes this huge, huge, huge change for the entire
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.040]   platform.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:28.360]   I also think Apple's getting more like an appliance computer.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:32.760]   And so I think the reason that a lot of the command line apps don't work is because I
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:41.680]   think that Apple's moving away from that it's BSD under the hood, it's a Unix computer.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.120]   They really want...
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.760]   And there's good reasons for them to do this primarily security.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:53.080]   But I feel like this is moving down that path of becoming an appliance computer.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:56.680]   That was the thing Andy, you and I were always worried about.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.960]   Yeah, and I keep coming back to the...
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:04.640]   One of the first things that an Apple engineer ever told me about OS X at the time was if
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.640]   you go...
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:09.200]   If you are not looking for the Unix command line and you find it, we will have made a
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.280]   big mistake.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.680]   If you go looking for the Unix command line and you can't find it, we will also have made
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.600]   a huge mistake because it's...
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:20.920]   These are the sort of excuses that you can make about, "Oh, we just want this machine
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:24.120]   to be as secure as possible to make sure that our customers have the best experience
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.560]   we can possibly provide them."
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:29.960]   You can make those excuses when it comes to a phone or a tablet.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:35.160]   When you're claiming that this is a desktop computer, that this is a powerful functioning
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.560]   workstation, you don't get to do that.
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.560]   That really is...
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.880]   I will come out and say it.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.680]   That is taking the easy way out.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:46.120]   That is saying there are a whole bunch of problems that we don't want to have to solve.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:53.320]   If we just simply remove the ability of customers to create problems that we find inconvenient,
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.560]   from our point of view, we've solved the problem, haven't we?
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:02.280]   This would make the Mac platformer to something lesser than as opposed to a real powerhouse
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.440]   competitor to Linux and Windows.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.880]   There's a blog...
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:15.200]   The chatroom just gave me at oliverx.link where he's keeping an updated tally of apps.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.800]   This will give you some idea...
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.040]   I don't know how complete this is, but it'll give you some idea of how quickly this scene
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.040]   is changing.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:24.600]   Today, Telegram suddenly was updated to be native.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:29.520]   Yesterday, Blackmagic Speed Test, a night sky, an insta paper and keep it the day before.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:34.720]   You can see that it's happening slowly, but it's happening.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.520]   They're enthusiastic.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:42.600]   Well, that's the positive thing about Apple's stranglehold on its market.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:47.920]   When they say we're committed to this change, not only can they arm twist the entire developer
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:52.680]   convenient to doing things, but also the developers have the confidence that, no, no,
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:59.080]   this is not going to be like Microsoft's transition into ARM where, okay, maybe we think it's
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.080]   a good idea.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.200]   We're certainly going to put some machines out there, but we're not going to guarantee
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:07.440]   you that all the work you're going to have to put into make your windows app ARM compatible
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:12.680]   is going to pay off in terms of a large portion of your user base actually working on ARM
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:17.720]   machines, whereas Apple is absolutely stuck there, neck out in this thing, saying that
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:24.280]   we are going to transition the entire platform to this new CPU, and you can either be part
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:30.400]   of an nostalgia act playing the old pre-2020 Mac software hits over and over again, or
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:34.120]   you can be part of the future, which bus do you want to get on?
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:38.600]   That's one of the advantages that Apple has of being both the software maker and the hardware
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.720]   maker of its products because it controls everything.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:49.400]   So just like you're saying, Andy, when Apple says all of the Macs are going to be M1 someday,
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.400]   that's that.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:57.360]   It's not just a software tweak that some Macs will have M1, some won't.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:03.640]   The company is saying, if you want your apps to work on a Mac, at some point you're going
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.720]   to have to make them work with M1 because at some point that's the only computer we're
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:08.880]   going to sell.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.360]   But that's the thing is there are developers out there.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:18.800]   EMACs is a good example where the people who are on the team, it's open source software,
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.240]   they may or may not care.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:26.920]   Now if you're a commercial app, there's some incentive, but if you're on the E-Macs contributors
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:33.360]   list, probably half of them are going, we'll screw them.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:38.080]   And the other hand, a lot of those command line programs are actually fairly trivial to
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:41.480]   convert because EMACs, I'm sure, had an ARM architecture.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:44.800]   A lot of these have an ARM architecture, you just have to make it work on the Mac.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.400]   Yeah, and also this is probably going to do it for them.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.400]   Maybe.
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:53.200]   Or that whole list I gave of, you know, set-off, the Apple, I'm sure did that.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.360]   That's part of the ExCO discrimination.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:01.560]   All I want to say is that if you think that this is just all about command line jockeys,
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:06.480]   a lot of really, really popular utilities are basically front ends to open source.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.480]   That's right.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.640]   Command line frameworks.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:15.440]   Like I was just talking, a lot of the video apps you use are based on FFmpeg or the equivalent.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:21.520]   So if these open source Unix windows, every platform thing, don't support M1, you might
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:28.600]   find that your beautiful, colorful written to every spec of a modern Mac app that you
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.880]   possibly can imagine, that will stop working as well.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.680]   So it could be a very, very pernicious problem.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.560]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.440]   Mike Bombich at Carbon Copy Cloner, I think we talked about this last week, initially
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:46.040]   was concerned that he wasn't going to make a bootable carbon copy because of Apple's,
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.440]   this is a security restriction issue.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.840]   I think he did solve that, but I think it requires installing Big Sur on the bootable
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:55.000]   copy.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.440]   Same thing, SuperDuber used to make bootable copies and until it's updated, it can't.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:03.080]   That's not a Silicon, Apple Silicon issue.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.080]   That's a security issue.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.720]   Apple's really started to lock stuff down.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:06.720]   It's a big sur issue.
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.120]   They started to lock stuff down.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:14.680]   I would say when we usually when we say, "Oh, it's a security issue," the implication is,
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:19.720]   "Oh, well, this app is introducing insecurity and some weaknesses into the system."
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.360]   And that's certainly not the impression that we want to give.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:27.240]   These are some of the super duper is one of the carbon copy cloner.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:34.080]   It's one of the stalwarts of the Mac experience and a key utility that helps people to get
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:38.440]   going again after a hardware failure almost instantaneously.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:44.600]   And if Apple certainly is aware of the existence of both of these apps, if they're not going
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:51.560]   to find a way to make these two apps work, that in itself, I think, points to a deep,
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:56.120]   deep problem with Apple and how it designs, "Well, no, we're not going to let you have
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:00.400]   a third party piece of backup software because we just simply don't press someone who's been
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:06.120]   in this business for 15 years and has suffered through every single OS update that Apple
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:09.000]   has inflicted upon them to keep their utilities up and running."
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   Right.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.280]   Here's to answer your question, Andy.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:16.000]   I tried to install FFmpeg using Mac ports.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.720]   And while there is an ARM64 architecture version, it can't install because it's dependent on
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.080]   a library that only supports x86.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.120]   And despite Rosetta, to answer your question, Lori, it's not going to work.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.800]   It's not going to install.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:34.720]   So Rosetta solves the problem for, I guess, for GUI apps.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:39.160]   There are a lot of, and the problem is FFmpeg is the backend for a lot of tools.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:43.560]   Handbrake uses FFmpeg, and Handbrake does have a silica, Apple Silicon version.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.880]   All of our Milton tools use FFmpeg, I think, still to me.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:52.880]   In fact, as far as I know, Carmen Clopie, Cloner, probably, I would guess uses Arsink as it's
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.880]   back in.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:54.880]   I'm not sure.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.520]   Arsink, I think, is Apple native.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.320]   Let me see.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.320]   Lipo.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.720]   It's going to be several months.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.720]   It's not a year of pain, but it's a transition.
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:04.720]   So, yeah.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.080]   Stay away if you don't want it.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.600]   Just stay on your Intel machines.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.040]   No, Tim Cook did not come to your house and hit them with a baseball bat.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.800]   They're still working.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.800]   Hold.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:20.160]   As usual, I think that when we recommend the new iPhone or the new piece of Mac hardware,
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:24.840]   oftentimes the most important thing to couch it in terms of is, well, how old is your current
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:25.840]   Mac?
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:30.400]   If you have a two-year-old MacBook, yeah, it's going to work great.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:34.520]   It's going to work great for at least however long it's going to take for next-generation
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:38.720]   Apple Silicon to come into a 13-inch MacBook or a 16-inch MacBook.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.880]   Maybe you want to hold off.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:48.880]   If, like me, you have a 2015 MacBook Pro, you will see a very significant increase, particularly
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:54.080]   because there are things I need to do over the next year that my current 2015 MacBook
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:57.360]   Pro cannot do, but the M1 MacBook Pro can do.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:04.040]   So the older, the more of a cheapskate you are about upgrading, the more valuable each
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.040]   upgrade is going to be.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:08.160]   This is going to be a very valuable upgrade for people who haven't upgraded in a while.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.600]   And the second piece of it is, keep the MacBook Pro 15.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.600]   Yes.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.680]   Because there will be some apps that you need that you will only run on that.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.480]   And don't upgrade it to big cert while you're away exactly.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:22.200]   Just make sure you have a Catalina or even an earlier version of the OS that you can rely
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.800]   on until everything gets in.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:24.800]   The dust settles.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:29.800]   If I did not have another computer, if this was my only computer, I would be a little
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:34.640]   bit aggrieved because at this point I wouldn't be doing the advent of code.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.360]   I'd be sitting on a phone.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:41.400]   And so that's really important, Lori, because I think the Apple did give the impression,
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.160]   "Oh, thanks to Rosetta, too.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.920]   Everything's going to run."
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.920]   And it's not the case.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:46.920]   Right.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:47.920]   It seems to be edge cases.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.240]   It's weird stuff.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:58.200]   Yeah, well, I just got the impression that Rosetta, too, is somehow this magical thing
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:04.160]   that no matter what, it was like a babblefish, whatever goes into it, it translates it no
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.160]   matter what it is.
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.400]   And that's clearly not the case.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:11.360]   They actually had to do human work, which meant that there were some things that just
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.560]   weren't going to be supported.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:17.800]   I think for me, one of the biggest things that I think is unusual that isn't currently
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.800]   working right now are virtual machines.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:26.200]   So like Windows Emulators, I haven't found one that works on M1 Mac yet.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.880]   I don't know, Leo, maybe you found one that does, but--
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:29.880]   No.
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.440]   I've seen Legend has it.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:38.960]   There are people who've gotten the hypervisor, Apple hypervisor, which is in there to work
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.560]   with emulation.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.920]   I think the Docker folks are working on it.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:46.800]   There's some crossover style stuff that's up and running.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:48.800]   And that's why I'm not ported over.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:56.680]   But the folks at Parallels, the folks at VMware, do Infusion, say, "We're going to do it."
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.240]   But it's interesting because they've been trying probably since they were showed off
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:04.320]   at WWC in June, and they still don't have it.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.320]   Also, Microsoft won't license Windows for ARM yet.
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.320]   You literally can't--
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.800]   Yeah, but I would run Linux then, but you still can't.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.520]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:16.040]   It's not just for Windows, you know.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:22.360]   So the fact that they've known since June, they've had development kits then, and they
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.160]   still haven't got it out.
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.840]   Now would be the time to get it out, right?
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.520]   People would be buying it up like crazy.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.000]   And they'd tell me there's-- it's a little more than just pressing a button in Xcode
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.400]   to get this thing to working.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.400]   There's some issues.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.400]   And the fact that there's a work at all.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.320]   I'll just show you real quickly.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:42.840]   You can-- this is the command LIPO, and our sync is a universal.
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.240]   It's a fat binary.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:49.000]   So you get both X86 and ARM64E in the single binary.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.680]   So it will run native, which is kind of cool.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.760]   Anyway, sorry, go ahead, Laurie.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:45:00.880]   Just the fact that-- again, what I was talking about before, the fact that parallel-- like
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:06.960]   you can download parallels, for example, hoping to actually even just open the app,
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.800]   even if you're not going to run Windows.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:12.440]   You get a message that says, "Nope, you can't."
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:16.640]   And that was a big surprise to me because of the way I understood Rosetta.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:18.320]   I didn't think that would ever happen.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:23.120]   I expected there to be some apps that were going to be laggy and glitchy, but not just
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.320]   an absolute-- this won't work on this Mac.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.560]   You can't install it.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.120]   That was a surprise to me.
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:34.160]   So I feel bad because I was the one who said, "Oh, wait.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.160]   You're going to want this.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.160]   You're not going to--"
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:41.120]   Just, you know, don't-- this is-- and unfortunately, that's been echoed by all the people who said,
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.640]   "Oh, look how fast this is."
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.440]   So I just wanted a little cautionary note.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:49.120]   There are some reasons why you would want to keep your old Mac lying around.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.120]   And maybe not--
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:53.360]   Like your radio audience shouldn't, but I think that the Macbreak audience probably
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.960]   is watching us on there.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:55.960]   M.Y.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:56.960]   Macbreak.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:58.960]   And they probably can deal with it.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:45:59.960]   I can deal with it.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:05.080]   And of course, I have an iMac Pro and I have a Dell and I have other things I can run.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.680]   So I did do the advent of Code Day 1.
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.520]   So I can do that.
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:13.120]   I'm disappointed because I want to do everything on this bright shiny nude.
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.120]   Me too.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.120]   Object.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.120]   And of course, this is-- this is hard.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:18.920]   It was just a month old.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:19.920]   So it'll--
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.920]   It's changing fast.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:27.720]   But by the time we get a vaccine, a lot of these problems will be solved and we'll be
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.120]   able to go out and enjoy these.
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:30.720]   Summer's going to be amazing.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:33.120]   Summer 2021 is going to be amazing.
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:35.120]   You can't get it right.
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.320]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.520]   We have lots more to talk about.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:42.720]   I'm Ronnae Ritchie, Andy Inaco, Lori Gill.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.600]   It's always fun to get together with you on Tuesdays.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:45.760]   I missed you last week.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.600]   Again, thanks to Micah for filming.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:48.600]   Yeah, you too.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:53.800]   You know, I've been resisting taking a vacation because I'm can't go anywhere.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:54.800]   What's the point of a vacation?
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:59.120]   But you know, just not going to work two days in a row was kind of nice.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:03.720]   I had five days of home just in my boxer shorts.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.720]   It was great.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:11.200]   All right, so they brought to you by four word networks.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:16.480]   Your network is-- I think I don't have to tell you-- mission critical to your business.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.240]   And I have just blown away.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.360]   I spent some time talking to the founders about what they're doing with forward networks.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.560]   I was just blown away about what they've been able to do.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:30.280]   This is an example of computer science done, you know, to do something kind of amazing.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:34.960]   It was founded by four graduate students at Stanford seven years ago.
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:41.920]   They developed-- they actually came out of feeling bad for network operators who just
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.600]   really didn't know what was going on in their network.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:45.600]   We're applying changes.
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.720]   We see this in the news all the time.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.440]   You know, let's change our BGP tables.
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:54.640]   And all of a sudden, the entire internet is going through a small town in Maine.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.680]   They really felt bad for people.
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:06.360]   So they decided to create a software-based model of any network that's 100% accurate.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.360]   100% accurate.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:12.360]   A digital twin of your network and software, you're looking at it if you're watching the
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:18.280]   video on the screen right now, which means you can actually query it and say, "Is my
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.920]   network configured correctly?
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.800]   Is it compliant with our policies?
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:25.160]   Is it behaving as we would expect?"
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.280]   They can also apply a change.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.520]   They will change the routing table.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.520]   What happens?
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:34.560]   And it happens in software before it happens in the real world.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.720]   That's incredible.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:41.520]   They offer this thing-- you'll know if you've ever used diffs to compare text files, they
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:45.360]   have behavior diffs, which allow side-by-side comparison.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:50.560]   Your network as it is now, your network as it will be if you change configuration in
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.760]   any device.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:56.000]   It goes out and looks at all the devices on your network to create an always accurate
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.720]   network diagram.
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:00.880]   Full details about the topology of your environment.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:05.520]   Visualizations you could just look at and understand and are fully exportable.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:11.240]   You can search the model for network behavior configuration and state.
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:15.120]   It's got a very intuitive, easy to use, very powerful search tool.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:19.360]   You can do end-to-end path analyses across your network, both on-prem and cloud.
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:21.080]   This is everywhere.
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:25.160]   Proactively identify potential connectivity and security policy violations.
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:29.640]   Remember at NASA a couple of years ago, one of the engineers brought in a Raspberry Pi
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:33.880]   and plugged it into the network and Havoc ensued.
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.560]   This would detect-- what is that?
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.240]   It immediately would see it.
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.560]   It would allow you to control it.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:40.240]   It would allow you to fix it.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:46.120]   Having that kind of software-based image of your network will give you 50% faster resolution
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.640]   of network trouble tickets.
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:54.360]   90% faster fixes related to audit processes and a 33% reduction in aborted network updates
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:57.160]   because of identified errors.
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.000]   Imagine searching your network for what's causing problems.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.680]   That's exactly what Forward Networks does.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.320]   Forward Networks-- it's funny.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:08.000]   They just did a seeround of funding and it was led by Goldman Sachs.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.800]   Goldman Sachs found out about Forward Networks because they were trying to figure out what's
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.320]   going on in the network.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.320]   It was far.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.320]   People networked.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.720]   There were issues.
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.960]   They couldn't figure it out.
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:20.960]   They got Forward Networks.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:21.960]   It solved it.
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:22.960]   They said, "You know what?
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.840]   We're going to lead their funding run around.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:25.840]   This thing is good."
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.640]   Mark Andreessen is a huge fan of Forward Networks.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:32.520]   Andreessen Horowitz, also an investor.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:40.920]   PayPal was considering building their own diagnostic software.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:45.600]   Instead of building, they found Forward Networks and they said, "Oh, this is incredible."
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.600]   It works.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:50.400]   They collaborate with a wide range of infrastructure and application technology partners from the
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:56.560]   world's leading IT companies to some of the new, small, but very interesting innovators.
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:00.760]   They've solved problems for some of the biggest companies in the world like Verizon, Telstra
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:06.760]   and Australia, Bank of America, government agencies who shall remain nameless.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.400]   You should find out about Forward Networks.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:13.360]   Go to forwardnetworks.com/twit and you can get a complete demo.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.400]   Forward Networks.
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:18.280]   If you had not heard of them yet, you will.
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:25.320]   Imagine a software digital twin for your network that you can use to plan, to diagnose,
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.640]   to solve problems.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.640]   Forwardnetworks.com/twit.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.600]   Don't forget to check out.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:34.160]   They've got a new podcast which you'll find in all your podcast platforms called Seeking
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.040]   Truth in Networking.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.760]   A single source of truth.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.760]   Amazing.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:42.440]   You can download it anywhere you get your podcasts.
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:47.520]   At network.com/twit, I was really jazzed when I talked to these guys about what they're
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.440]   doing.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.600]   Thank you for your support.
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:52.600]   Forward Networks.
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:53.920]   Thank you for supporting us by using that address.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:54.920]   Please do.
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:57.960]   That way they'll know you saw it.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:03.760]   I guess FFmpeg is also working on this.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:10.800]   On the FFmpeg, I'm in the process of supporting all our code to ARM.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:15.560]   See the libraries are really what's part of the issue is.
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:18.320]   There is an FFmpeg for Apple, so look at my think.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.280]   I'm looking anyway.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:26.480]   I've been spending a lot of time on GitHub, repos, and bug reporting platforms looking
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:27.480]   for.
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:30.480]   Are you working on it?
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:35.800]   One of the biggest problems that's affecting software today is that there are so many just
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:42.600]   absolutely critical open source projects that are relied upon on all levels of technology,
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:43.680]   of software and the internet.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:49.040]   I'm talking about this fundamental software code for moving a file from one place to another
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:52.040]   that everybody and every institution relies on.
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:55.040]   And then you find out that, oh, there must be like a hundred thousand people.
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:57.400]   No, it's just two people.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:02.800]   And if one of them gets sick, this might not get a security update that if there's a security
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:05.800]   of older bullies discovered, it's not going to get passed for a few months.
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:10.200]   And that's the way that everybody's moving their banking records from one place to another.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:17.400]   So this is kind of exposes the hamster running desperately inside the wheel, hooked up to
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:21.400]   the generator that's been underneath all of this equipment for so long.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:23.360]   What's the next Apple Silicon Mac?
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.360]   What do you think, Renee?
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.600]   You got a prediction?
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:31.920]   The 13 inch four port MacBook Pro, maybe the 16 inch.
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:33.720]   Pro MacBook Pro 13.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:37.720]   I keep calling this the MacBook Air Pro because that's really what it was when they introduced
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:38.720]   it in 2016.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:42.120]   They're like, this is the pro for people who love the air and just want to retina air.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:46.080]   And it's always been thus, you know, people who self identify as pros but could really
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:47.240]   get away with an air.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:51.400]   I don't mind only two ports because I just use a port extender and all that.
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.120]   I had to say the battery life, we didn't really touch on that.
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:56.000]   But everything people say about the battery life is true.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   I'm running on battery.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.760]   I would never run on battery if we try to run a show on any other computer because it wouldn't
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:03.840]   make it.
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:06.600]   And I've been running it all day and all run all day and no problem and I'll be able to
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:07.600]   take it home.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:11.880]   I did all of Mac break last week on Skype, which was running in electron through Rosetta
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:12.880]   2.
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:16.800]   And I went from, I think, 95 down to 65% battery life.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:21.440]   And I would have had to plug in on my 16 inch I have had to plug in on my six.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:22.440]   Absolutely.
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:24.480]   It is very dependent on what you're doing though.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.840]   But I'm getting battery life very consistently.
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.760]   The lowest I've ever gotten is about nine hours.
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.960]   And most of the time it's around 18, 19, 20 hours of battery life, right?
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:34.560]   Is that what you're getting?
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.560]   Roughly.
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:39.640]   You're using it much, much harder than I am probably.
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:41.000]   I can kill it if I need to.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.400]   Like if I just run tons of rendering, if I just put on a bunch of processes and just
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.280]   let them run, I can totally kill it.
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:49.560]   But like if I'm just doing normal things, it's getting to the point where like I have
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:53.760]   this problem with the iPhone 12 pro max now because I haven't used the max phones.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:56.200]   I used to use the plus ones and I switched to the normal size.
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:59.720]   The max ones last so long I treat them like iPads and I forget to plug them in.
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:00.800]   And now my Mac is like that.
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:05.080]   I would never have dreamt of going for more than an hour, you know, doing video work with
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.600]   a six inch MacBook Pro.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.240]   And this one I come back like two days later.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.280]   It's still like it's I haven't killed it yet.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:13.440]   And then I forget to plug it in and when finally is dead.
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:14.440]   Laurie, how about you?
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.800]   What experience have you had with battery life?
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:22.560]   Yeah, with the battery, especially that's where it's been really impressive for me.
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:25.520]   I had a zoom call with my family over Thanksgiving.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:31.440]   We just ran it for I don't know three hours and I didn't plug it in and I didn't worry
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:32.440]   about it.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:37.400]   And I think the battery dropped from 100% to 78% in the entire time with zoom running
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.400]   the whole time.
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:42.240]   It's pretty it's nice not to have battery fear.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:47.560]   Yeah, I mean, this is something I've been other than, you know, right now things like
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:51.200]   this where I'm doing the podcast and I have, you know, all my cameras and everything all
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.920]   connected to a different computer.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:56.920]   I've been using the MacBook Pro exclusively for everything that I've done.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:01.480]   And I would never just sit there all day long without plugging it in.
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:04.080]   I would always after a few hours have to plug it in.
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:10.080]   It would, you know, it would start to trickle down into the 50, 40, 30% range, especially
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.400]   throughout the day.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.800]   I can go.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:17.400]   I've been checking the battery trying to remember by the way to check the battery because it's
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:22.720]   hard to remember to do because I don't ever have to take the battery, but I will get usually
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:28.480]   on average I'll end my day somewhere around 60% and that's after working a full eight-hour
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:35.400]   day jumping into meetings in Chrome using Google Neat, which is a huge battery drain
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:39.560]   usually for other things, Skype meetings and all that kind of stuff.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:41.800]   And it's usually at about 60% at the end of the day.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:49.480]   So basically, I can use my MacBook Pro for my full-time work computer for two days before
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:51.560]   I would have to plug it in and charge it.
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:53.000]   And that's unheard of.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.760]   I've never been able to do that before.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:57:04.720]   This battery parsimony, if you will, is important for more than just portable because the low
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:08.080]   power curve helps even in desktop computing.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:10.560]   It means you're not going to have cooling issues.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:17.720]   There's not as much issue with power being dissipated into heat, which just means it's
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:19.640]   more efficient and it's going to work better.
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:22.920]   You can run at higher clock speeds, not in life as well.
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:24.720]   And the chip will last longer.
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:31.720]   So it is great for a laptop, but the fact that these chips are so low power and the power
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:36.520]   performance curve, so high performance for such low power is really a big deal even on
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:37.520]   desktop, I think.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.520]   Yeah.
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:42.080]   But they nailed the efficiency and that's what gave them the performance.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:46.880]   And I know that sounds intuitive in hindsight, but for years, for decades, Intel has been
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:52.600]   successful by pushing by brute force, basically taking a fire hose and just forcing as much
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:54.520]   water through it as they could.
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:57.760]   And Apple was basically like, what if we just open a stream?
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:02.720]   Like sure, the water is moving slower, but there's just so much of it moving that it'll
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:06.360]   give us even more performance without wasting any of that energy.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:11.600]   And it turned out that that worked and it worked at like five and a half watts.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:13.240]   And now it's up to 10 watts.
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:17.800]   And if you follow that curve on Johnny Shuruji's graph, I cannot wait to see what it does
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:24.360]   at like 25, 30, 35 watts next.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:28.440]   So we said you think that'll be a probe 13 inch pro.
[00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:33.240]   And a pro mini that another space gray mini that's higher and mini.
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:34.400]   Proified with more ports.
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:42.160]   So part of that is just that the hardware SOC has two Thunderbolt ports on it.
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.480]   But how would you do that?
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:45.840]   Would you put an extra chip on there or?
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:49.160]   Yeah, they would have to add more Thunderbolt controllers onto the die.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:50.160]   Okay.
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.720]   And the same thing with RAM.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:57.760]   There's 16 gigs is the max, although I have to say it's as we expected 16 gigs of RAM
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:02.040]   on M1 is very different than 16 gigs of RAM on Intel.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:05.360]   It really does sort of like it doesn't make it like I think something's going to be a
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:06.360]   little bit more than people.
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:08.240]   And then pressure makes them to 32 gigabytes and it doesn't.
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:09.240]   No.
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:13.100]   It's just the way RAM like most, most integrated graphics never had anywhere nearly this much
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:14.100]   access to RAM.
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:19.600]   They had pitiful stores of RAM and now they have access to the unified pool of memory,
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:20.960]   which you means there's a lot.
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.880]   But and also it like paging isn't you.
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:26.520]   And a lot of people are concerned about paging like, Oh, my SSD is going to have Apple's been
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:32.400]   paging since like since the first SSDs and seriously, since they were RAM constrained with
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:37.360]   LDD sorry, LD LPDDR three with the 2016 Mac books.
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:38.680]   So all of that's been working for years.
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:41.240]   That's not a problem, but it's still using memory compression.
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:45.760]   It's still using machine learning to try to optimize the order of the memory.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:48.680]   It's still using really fast SSD swap.
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:50.600]   So there's there's no magic to it.
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:55.200]   It is just the you are getting every bit of that RAM that you could possibly get is the
[00:59:55.200 --> 01:00:00.400]   difference where before it was wasting just a ton of resources moving files and copying
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:01.880]   files back and forth every time.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:09.600]   Yeah, that larger 4k motion project used ended up using something 17 gigs of RAM.
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:15.400]   But you wouldn't know because the swap is so fast and everything else I've used if I
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:22.160]   look at memory, I rarely go beyond maybe half the you know, I have right now five, almost
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:25.880]   six gigs free RAM on my system.
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.040]   You have to go looking for it.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.840]   Like if you know what memory pressure is, you probably want more memory, but you would
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.720]   also have to go looking for it to find it.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.760]   Just because of how abstract Apple has made all of that stuff.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:39.640]   Yeah, that's where I step and use this great by the way, you can really look at these detailed
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:44.520]   performance indicators 24% memory pressure is pretty low right now.
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.200]   It's pretty good.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:50.080]   I find myself wondering if there's what what Apple's priority is going to be over the next
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.080]   couple of years.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:57.320]   Is it going to be to get to get to the point where they filled out the entire Mac line first
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:01.600]   or they're going to be we're going to keep remaking the Mac book pro and the Mac mini
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:07.800]   until we have we have these whatever we release has to be at a point where it's it's at its
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:10.720]   final Apple Silicon state.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.720]   I could certainly see them.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:15.920]   I could certainly see them holding on to the regular Mac book pro until they've got an
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.560]   iMac for instance out there.
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:20.960]   I'm sure they I'm sure that's a priority for them.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:25.680]   It's it's really I think that the next step forward for them is going to be if there's
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:29.840]   going to be like an M1 X is just going to be it has exactly the same sort of performance
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:34.280]   as the M1 but we put more Thunderbolt channels onto it so that you're not limited to just
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.720]   two ports.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.440]   But it's the thing that I'm looking forward to most of all is when they start to get into
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:45.920]   the something that's more powerful than than a Mac book error when they really try to say
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:52.920]   okay what if we decide that it's okay for this this Mac to draw I don't know 60 watts
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:53.920]   of power.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.880]   So these CPUs can be put in there and how much butt can we kick with this.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.920]   This is what this is what it's going to get doubly exciting.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.160]   So there are a couple of rumors.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:05.120]   I think Mark go ahead.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:08.440]   I think Mark Gurman's rumor was 16 cores is the next.
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.960]   Oh, it's 2012.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.920]   12 cores was the next six plus six and one at performance and six efficient.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.320]   No one knows it's it could be six plus six.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.640]   It could be four plus eight.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.280]   I mean I guess it depends on how they want to distribute the performance course.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.280]   Right.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:27.420]   Yeah, that was that was it for a 16 inch the M1 X and then there is the rumor from Mingchi
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:32.680]   quote that next year late next year they'll become a completely new industrial design for
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.680]   these devices which might indicate what Andy's saying is that just going to keep iterating
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:40.040]   on the portables until they get that right and then they're going to start working on
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.040]   the desktops.
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.040]   I don't know.
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.840]   It's just rumors.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:44.840]   We don't know.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:45.840]   No one knows.
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:46.840]   Johnny Saruji.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:50.480]   There's a lot to there like they're very I don't want to say they're predictable but when
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:53.520]   you look backwards they're sensible like they're very logical.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.520]   Yes.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:58.160]   Company and one of the ways that they quote unquote win is that they just iterate year
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:02.880]   after year and they build like they got that architecture cleaned up with the a seven and
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:07.960]   they've been doing like then they started doing their own like partial GPUs and then
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:10.240]   floating point and then they did their own custom.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:13.960]   So it's like year after year they just add to that the biggest question I have right now
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:18.480]   is what cadence is the M series going to be on late right now the iPhone gets a new
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:23.360]   a series chip every year but the iPad pro doesn't like the iPad Pro's just don't come
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.680]   out every other come out like every 18 months.
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:30.280]   So is the Mac going to just get the latest generation IP because it shares so much IP
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:34.080]   with the a series so every year there'll be a new M series or we're going to have to
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:41.000]   wait like an iPad pro for these bigger more GPU more CPU core versions and I think to
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.040]   Andy's point I want to see when those updates come out not just when the rest of the max
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:49.240]   comes out but when is that M2 coming out for these lower powered systems because I think
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:52.240]   that'll tell us a lot about Apple scheduling.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.640]   It's fun.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:04:02.960]   I mean I think I think we're entering a very interesting era and I feel like there is going
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.440]   to be a little bit of pain.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:08.880]   We knew that maybe it's a little more than I had anticipated with the stuff that I like
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:15.000]   to use but we knew that and I think this is going to happen very quickly and very
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   interestingly.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   All right.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.400]   I'll just I'll just say that I'm still I don't care how much money I just spent on
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:27.600]   the first generation MacBook Pro with an M1 the moment that they come out with a they
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:33.280]   decide to really really double down on the MacBook Air concept and say we've we're our
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:38.000]   challenge was let's take the dimensions of the iPad Pro and build a Macintosh around
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   it.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.440]   That's that will get about $1,500 of my money whether I've got the money or not.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.440]   Yes.
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.920]   It's like it's come full circle.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.240]   That's the so exciting thing about me.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:51.960]   Like I know everyone talks like most of the world likes their phones and like their tablets
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:56.280]   but just as someone who's been on a Mac for a while and been on Apple since the Apple
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:59.120]   2 Plus it is so exciting to see all of this.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:02.960]   It's like that movie that big hero movie where the mentor shows up and says all the
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.720]   roads that you've been on have led to this every path you have taken has brought you
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:12.160]   this and it takes out a shiny M1 chip and just hands it to a little Mac and it's it's
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:15.240]   akin to like Jorrell telling Kellell to step into the light.
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.600]   I'm so excited about this.
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:22.400]   There needs to be a new version of the 1984 commercial where she's hurling an M1 chip
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.520]   at an Intel logo.
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:30.000]   Suddenly everybody's blown away by the performance.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.960]   Other stories of note.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:39.640]   A little warning from Glenn Fleischman at Macworld about the Apple ID recovery key which
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:45.600]   by the way I used with my new M1 and now I'm wondering if I should have waited.
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:49.760]   He suggests not enabling the recovery key until Apple is fully updated.
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:06:02.680]   It's ecosystem because it works in some places but then in some places it doesn't and it
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:10.240]   is certainly more secure but it also prevents you from changing the password through the
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:15.080]   Apple ID website or the I forgot site.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:17.000]   Was it a mistake to do the recovery key?
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.400]   I printed it and put it in a special secure location in my office.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:29.080]   It's funny when they generate the recovery key they say copy this and you close it and
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:36.320]   they say okay type it in now to make sure you prove that you copied it.
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:42.120]   I guess after the fact you'll be able to turn it on so maybe just don't rush.
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.320]   Has anybody done this process yet or is it just me?
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:50.320]   I did the recovery key thing years ago and I still have that piece of paper in a box
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:53.080]   somewhere.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:58.680]   I haven't needed to use it so it's been just sitting there unused this whole time.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:06:59.680]   I don't know.
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:05.160]   I guess I don't understand what the problem is because the recovery key is supposed to
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:10.480]   actually be sort of like your backup for if you forget really important things like
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:11.480]   your Apple ID.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:13.480]   Apple can't change for you.
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:18.440]   So wouldn't this be a situation where you would just be able to call Apple and use the
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:19.440]   recovery key that way?
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:23.560]   I'm not sure what the problem is in this situation.
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:26.600]   So remember the Apple ID recovery press.
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.320]   This isn't your grandpa's recovery key.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.320]   I guess it's the answer.
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:36.320]   Remember in the old Apple ID recovery process which took time and so forth, that's no longer
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.960]   available.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:49.520]   So if you lose access to your trusted devices, your account is now irretrievable.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:53.080]   So you get, yeah, it's more secure because a bad guy can't steal all your stuff and
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.080]   use it.
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.080]   Right.
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:01.680]   No, I mean, I get what recovery key is, but what's the problem with recovery key right
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:02.680]   now?
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:10.240]   Well, let me see what Glenn, you know, his warning is it's not, I guess, not all of the
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:15.040]   Apple tools yet know about it.
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.960]   So there's a disc, there's, I guess, a disconnect between the old recovery key and the new recovery
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:22.960]   key and all of Apple prepared.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:28.120]   It says, Apple has updated necessary pieces of iOS, iPad, OS and Mac OS to let you set
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.120]   a recovery key.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:35.640]   So when we had our new Macs, we did that weeks after iOS 14 and iPad or us 14 were released.
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:41.160]   The Apple ID support sites, the Apple support app and find my app remain out of date with
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:46.640]   use of this newly revived recovery key, even though very support documents have been updated.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:52.000]   So he says, until Apple gets it together and has, and everything is supports this new recovery
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.840]   key, it might be worse not doing it.
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.640]   You will be able to do it later.
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:57.640]   Yeah.
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:02.600]   The basic problem he's saying is that we're at, if you don't have a recovery key and you're
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:06.600]   out of options, your option is then okay, we have to go to the, you have to go to the
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:10.600]   US mail, they will ask for documents, they will ask you to prove your identity through
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.880]   very analog means, but you will be able to get access to your account.
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:18.800]   If you do have a recovery key and it doesn't work, that option is, he says is not available
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:19.800]   to you.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:20.800]   Right.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:23.760]   The worst case scenario is now just even a little bit worse.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:29.840]   I don't know why Apple doesn't allow me to use like a third party standard authentication
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:35.880]   app or a thought, authentication authentication fob because so many other services use it.
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:39.800]   They're absolutely right and everybody needs to understand sometimes I have to remind myself
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:45.040]   that authentication through a text message to a phone is terrible and you absolutely shouldn't
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.600]   rely on it anymore.
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:52.520]   But it's the number of times where I've had to, I am a multi-platform office, a multi-platform
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:57.600]   home, the number of times where I've tried to sign in somewhere and the only way to authenticate
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:03.600]   a device I haven't used before is involves me having to boot up a Mac that I've shut
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:09.240]   down or find my iPad and recharge it enough that I can actually get the authentication
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.280]   code off of that thing.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:15.960]   It's the exact sort of thing that makes me wish my machines were less secure, which is
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:20.680]   the most dangerous result you can possibly have when you're creating a security scheme.
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:23.520]   We work together on this Andy and I don't mean this to be what about his at all.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:28.040]   But I've been setting up all my Google accounts on these new machines too and it does, I have
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.400]   all of that in authenticator and it doesn't want me to use it.
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.160]   It's like go open Gmail on this phone.
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.680]   I'm like, that phone's not even plugged in.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.320]   I'd have to go charge that phone.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.920]   I like just, why does everyone hate that?
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.560]   Like we've been using stuff for years.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:40.760]   Give me options, sure.
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:45.400]   But like don't make me dig and dig and say, yes, please, I want to use the app to authenticate
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:46.400]   it.
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:50.720]   I want to ask Steve Gibson about this because what I'm guessing and I think he's even addressed
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:56.880]   this before is that both Google and Apple have seen scenarios where the authenticator
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.840]   apps are not as secure as they ought to be.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.320]   So Apple's decided not to use an authenticator app.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:06.840]   They're doing this trusted device thing, which also happens to make you want to buy
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.560]   more Apple stuff so that you're because you can use your watch.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:12.840]   I have like eight devices that are trusted like that have Gmail apps that are trusted
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:16.320]   by Google, but it gives me names for them that are not immediately obvious to me because
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.280]   I don't remember what they're all called.
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.040]   And I know this is a completely a reviewer problem.
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.240]   Like normal humans don't have this problem.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:26.640]   But like take me up by the hand and EL5 it say, look, we're trying to deprecate authenticator
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.640]   apps.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.120]   We really want you to authenticate with a phone.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:31.360]   Try to be a normal person for once.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.360]   And Apple is no better.
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:37.480]   I have because for a while you couldn't have multiple services on one iTunes iCloud ID.
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:42.680]   So like if you had iTunes connect for developing, if you had podcasts for your podcast, if you
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:48.000]   had something for iBooks, you had to have separate accounts and you have to install those accounts
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.160]   now to get the thing to pop up to give you the code to put in.
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:53.360]   And it's like you have to where did it pop up?
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:54.760]   Oh, on the iPhone 10s.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.320]   I haven't used in two years.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.320]   Where is that?
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:04.000]   I actually freaked out because when I got the new iPhone 12, I erased the iPhone 11 and
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.480]   I put it in a way and then I got the check your iPhone 11 for.
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:13.600]   And I went, oh my God, I ran and I turned it on.
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.880]   Unfortunately, I found another way around it.
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:21.800]   But yeah, it's also strange that sometimes the two factor authentication is on the same
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.720]   device I'm logging in on.
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:28.800]   So it pops up, you're logging in from a device in Petaluma.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.800]   Here's the 60.
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:30.800]   Is it okay?
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:31.800]   Yeah.
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:32.800]   Here's the 60 to the code.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:33.800]   Well, God, you could have just filled it in.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:34.800]   It's the same screen.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:35.800]   That doesn't seem like the best.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.840]   But I think what they've decided, it could be two things.
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:41.680]   One, they've probably decided it's more convenient.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:43.480]   It's easier, right?
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.480]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:49.120]   This, these push authentication are like single sign on are easier.
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.000]   That's what Google wants you to use too.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.200]   But I think it may also be that they've decided it's more secure.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.760]   For some reason, we don't.
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:59.760]   Well, if they can see the entire process and to end that they know, they know that
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:02.440]   each link in this process is trustworthy.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:07.320]   Whereas if they're just going to trust that this other app that, okay, it says that it's
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:13.080]   validated through these military specs standards.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:18.800]   But we're just, we're taking this other apps or this other key fobs word for it.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:21.720]   And yeah, that's a, that's a bad thing.
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:22.880]   It's terrible.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:26.880]   It's terrible when your parents make you eat your vegetables and they make you like walk
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.680]   to school because it builds character and it's terrible.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:34.840]   But it is actually, it is all in your best interest, but it doesn't mean that you didn't
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:39.400]   wish that there was a way that you could get driven to soccer practice instead of having
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:43.400]   to walk half a mile in this 60 degree weather.
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:46.800]   I'm going to guess this is what Steve is probably going to answer when I ask him.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:51.960]   I'm going to guess that Apple on as seen scenarios, undisclosed.
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.960]   We don't know about where this is a better way of doing it.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:58.160]   And I think the push probably is more secure.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:03.680]   For one thing, an authenticator, the way authenticator works is with a secret long number.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:08.000]   But that number, if it's, if it's known by an adversary, you're done.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.280]   I mean, that's how the sink was, was attacked previously.
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.280]   Well, I think that's right.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.360]   If memory serves, yeah.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.360]   Yeah.
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:18.840]   So if somebody can get your secret identity that's stored in that authenticator, they
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:21.160]   can do the authentication themselves anywhere.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.480]   It's just a hash between that and the time of day.
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:29.400]   So I'm guessing they've, they've decided, well, you know, the least secure is SMS.
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.520]   We're never going to let you use that.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:36.920]   Because of sim swapping, the next least secure is this, you know, this authentication, this
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:41.960]   time, time of day authentication standard because if somebody got access to your secret
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:46.040]   codes, it's no different than them getting access to your password, your, your out of
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:47.040]   luck.
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.760]   A push is a lot harder to, to spoof.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.880]   So I think that's why I can't just tell me that, like just tell me that you want me
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:53.880]   to do it this way.
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.960]   And that way I won't expect that it'll work.
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:56.960]   Right.
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:57.960]   Yeah.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:03.360]   So the thing that I'm most, I'm most appreciative of the last two or three years in user interface
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:09.080]   design is all of the companies, Google certainly, Apple certainly, there are the companies that
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:14.640]   are kind of similar where they're not afraid of being verbose and English when they are
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.440]   about to ask you what do you want to do next?
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.200]   Where it's, it's, it's one thing to hear.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.760]   Here are two radio buttons for your security authentication preferences.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:27.560]   That was the way it used to be up until like at least five years ago.
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:33.680]   Now, when I signed up for the new version of the, the Google Wallet app, it was, it was
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:38.920]   so, it was night and day because I had actually read a paragraph and a hack, a half of plain
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:41.280]   English text saying, well, here's what it means.
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:45.480]   If you push, if you push this button that says, trust me to do this for you.
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:48.000]   And here's why you, and you don't have to do that right now.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.600]   We've, we've, we've, we've, we've, we've, we've highlighted the one that says yes, but by
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:57.040]   all means switch that to do really the, the, the solution to the, the, the aspirin for a
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:02.400]   lot of user pain and a lot of apples pain is just simply be more verbose, be more, be
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:06.600]   more clear about here is the ramifications of every single decision we're presenting
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:07.600]   to you.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.680]   And if it means that you get a cluttered screen full of text, go for it.
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:12.680]   Monospace it.
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:14.480]   Put it in courier if you want to.
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.040]   It's, it really does help.
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:17.680]   Mario more is all problems.
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:19.680]   Cairo.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:20.680]   Cairo.
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:21.680]   There you go.
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:22.680]   Wingdings.
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:25.600]   Let's take a little break.
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:29.680]   We got more to talk about lots more to talk about some, some big moves, executive moves
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:30.680]   by Apple.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.560]   But first a word from Twilio.
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:34.560]   You're talking about Authy.
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.720]   They are the people behind Authy.
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:43.920]   They're the people behind all kinds of useful, interesting ways to communicate with your customers.
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:45.840]   World's changing fast.
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.480]   You want to stay in touch with customers.
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.320]   That is so important.
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:50.480]   And you can with Twilio.
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:54.840]   You can engage customers wherever they are on any channel they want from text messages
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:58.040]   to emails from phone calls to video and more.
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.360]   One single platform.
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:02.200]   I've been a Twilio user as a hobbyist for years.
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:05.200]   It's the greatest platform for developers.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:09.000]   And it is, you know, don't don't think just because little Leo uses it.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   It's not a big deal.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:16.680]   Twilio powers 795 billion plus interactions across channels with five nines of uptime,
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:19.760]   99.999% uptime.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:25.520]   They have three billion phone numbers available across more than 100 countries.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.520]   Customers love Twilio.
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:31.160]   Developers love Twilio because it's easy for them to implement this.
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:35.800]   Shopify uses Twilio to run their entire global contact center.
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:39.920]   More than a million customers, they use Twilio Flex for that.
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:42.280]   That's their programmable contact center solution.
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:45.280]   Blue Apron uses Twilio to power newsletter emails.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:47.680]   They use Twilio's SendGrid.
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:49.120]   Netflix uses Twilio.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:52.480]   If you ever do use two factor Netflix, that's Twilio.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:57.440]   Back end of that, ride sharing and contactless delivery services like Lyft and Uber.
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:02.960]   They connect riders and drivers by text message, of course, using Twilio.
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:08.520]   Twilio gives you new ways to communicate with your users and their API is easy to use.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:12.440]   It can give you all sorts of new features ranging from account notifications with text
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:18.760]   messaging to yes chatbots to securing online accounts with two factor.
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:26.840]   Marketing loves using Twilio's SendGrid to send out newsletters to do campaigns over
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:27.840]   email.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.160]   They can build chatbots.
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.640]   They can do text messaging and phone calls.
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:36.840]   Customer service team build global contact and support centers with Twilio Flex.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:40.840]   What's important to understand that Twilio is built by developers for developers.
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:42.920]   It's just a few lines of code.
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:46.000]   You don't need to be a specialized telecom network engineer.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.280]   They hide the complexity.
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:52.720]   If you can already build web apps, you can build apps that can text, call, chat and
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.200]   video conference.
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:55.200]   That's why I use Twilio.
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:19:01.760]   It's really, as a hobbyist, it's a great way without a lot of advanced knowledge to incorporate
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:02.760]   these kinds of things.
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:04.920]   I've been building a chatbot for quite a while.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:07.320]   I won't tell the chat room about that.
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:13.120]   Even your strength and your customer relationships by uniting communications across your entire
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:16.760]   business, it is time to build with Twilio.
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:22.480]   T-W-I-L-I-O Twilio.com.
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:28.240]   Thank you, Twilio, for supporting the Mac Break Weekly folks and our network.
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:32.840]   Thank you all for supporting us by going to Twilio.com and inquiring.
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.680]   I've had all that.
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:35.680]   Twilio.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:42.120]   I don't know what Apple is building, but they've been busy.
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:46.720]   They just hired one of the founders of Robinhood.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:53.760]   You know Robinhood, the finance app, has been a huge success.
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:20:02.040]   Josh Elman, who actually he'd left Robinhood, he was the vice president of product at Robinhood.
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:05.960]   He left and became a venture capitalist at Graylock Partners.
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:10.840]   He led early investments there in Discord and Musically.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:17.280]   They have hired him to work on the app store.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.080]   He certainly has a lot of experience with apps.
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:22.080]   Robinhood has been a very successful app.
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:25.360]   Two of his investments are obviously very successful.
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:30.680]   He also invested in house party.
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:35.560]   So what do you think they're going to do with Josh Elman?
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:37.480]   It's a very high profile hire.
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:39.840]   What did they say or when it's actually going to happen?
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:41.080]   Which of those questions are you asking me?
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.080]   So what do they say?
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:45.400]   Because they say that he's going to work with app store discoverability, which has been
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.400]   an ongoing issue.
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:51.560]   Actually, that's what he said in his announcement tweet, to help customers discover the best
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.360]   apps for them.
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:57.720]   Even basic search stuff that has been a solved problem like nearest neighbor and fuzzy results
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.440]   and all of them search widening.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:04.680]   For some reason, it just doesn't exist on a lot of apps.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:08.720]   They can handle misspellings now for the last couple of years, which is fantastic.
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:14.360]   But there's just so much basic search engine stuff that doesn't seem to be implemented.
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:15.920]   But I'm sure that's well below his pay grade.
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:20.840]   I'm sure he's going to be working on fancy ways to go to the today's screen and see more
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:23.600]   appropriate content for us specifically.
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:26.920]   But I don't know, it feels like it's not native to them.
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:31.600]   As much as they get some things, they just don't get search and they need to populate
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:36.280]   themselves with people who live, breathe and were born like that banjo.
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:39.440]   You built a search, but I was born to search.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:42.160]   I don't know how this moves and needle on that.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:46.000]   No, I think Renee is absolutely right.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:52.400]   Whenever you see these hires that are announced, especially for Apple, you have to ask what
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:56.280]   convince them to leave what they've already got and join Apple.
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:00.560]   It can't be, well, I had an opportunity to increase discoverability of apps inside the
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.320]   app store.
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:10.440]   I really think it's as expertise and essentially connecting customers to things that they actually
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:15.000]   want to buy and actually services that they're going to be actually paying for.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.920]   I would guess that his bailiwick is going to stay within the app store, but mostly it's
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:22.560]   expertise and a way of thinking.
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:27.680]   Apple tends to, when Apple hires away someone who is having a hugely successful career,
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:31.280]   it's not necessarily for their skill set, it's not even necessarily for their contacts.
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.200]   It's for their way of thinking.
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:37.520]   It's part of the, they looked at all the different bees inside their hive mind.
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:42.000]   They realize they don't have someone who thinks like this and they need this for the hive.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.200]   Meanwhile, they come and they go.
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:52.680]   He's chief architect, his left to go to Roku, Brian Pinkerton, where he was going to focus
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:57.320]   at Roku on technical innovation and strategic software development across the platform.
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:58.760]   Maybe you'll be able to talk to your Roku.
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.240]   You can already talk to Roku.
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:02.520]   Do you say hey Roku?
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.520]   No.
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:06.280]   You press a button on Google or Amazon, right?
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:12.200]   So chief architect of Siri until November, before that chief technology officer at the
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:16.800]   Chan Zuckerberg initiative, that's their charity arm.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.000]   That's an odd resume.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000]   Yeah, it is, isn't it?
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.240]   Well, it's this work with A9 that really stands out for me.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:32.280]   I think when I look at his LinkedIn as the ability to do really, really large-scale integrated
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:38.280]   projects, when if there's a platform that benefits from not having a single distinctive
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:43.560]   app or single distinctive feature, but having integration so that every single code part
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:47.200]   of this works and it bounces off every other code part of it, that is Roku.
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:51.560]   And probably give him a much bigger playground to play with play and more freedom than just
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.000]   managing Siri on Apple.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000]   Yeah.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:00.040]   Can I also say that the fact that one of the chief people who works on Siri felt although
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:06.440]   it was cool to leave, it does make me start to ask questions about what is going on with
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:09.240]   Siri development inside of Apple.
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:15.720]   Did he see that he didn't have as big a future there as he would have at Roku or is Apple
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:21.160]   doing a big pivot on Siri, either putting a lot more money in or even just sort of scaling
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:22.880]   it back or rolling it into something else?
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:30.560]   He would start to work under a different boss.
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:35.320]   It's just as fun as guessing about the next series of Apple Silicon Macs as trying to figure
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:40.960]   out why did they make that move, Rook to Queensborough, or whatever.
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.360]   Why did you make that move?
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:43.360]   And could be a simple reason.
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.240]   Well, they could move Sebastian over, right?
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:49.680]   Like, Sebastian was vice president of QNEX and then he became, he was running CoreOS and
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:51.240]   then he was running camera.
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:56.400]   And now at WWDC, they announced that he's running intelligence, like device intelligence,
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:59.000]   which seems to have a huge overlap with Siri.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.520]   And he looks like one of the next generation, Craig Federichy, so gets dropped into whatever
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:06.880]   project is critical at the time.
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:10.720]   Like he's the one who got a lot of the camera stuff to ship when it was running a bit behind
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:13.360]   and he's the one who started nailing down all the security stuff.
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:16.880]   And now he's the one who drove a lot of the new stuff we're seeing with device intelligence
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.200]   and dubbed dub.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:23.040]   So he seems highly effective at least and maybe that was a different environment than
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.960]   was previously there.
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:31.560]   We spent a long time on the Twitter on Sunday talking about the issue of Apple suppliers
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:37.160]   trying to move out of China, the difficulties they're facing in China, both because of
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:45.000]   the trade war, but also because of public relations war, they're also losing.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:51.880]   Apple has been apparently lobbying for some changes in a bill that said, "Pass the House,
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:57.880]   the Wieger Forced Labor Prevention Act, pass the House by 406 to 3."
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:25:58.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.960]   So there's pretty strong unilateral support of this.
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:01.960]   2020, 2020.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:10.880]   It's expected to pass the Senate could be signed into law, but lobbyists, not just from Apple,
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:13.920]   but from many large companies are weighing in.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:20.840]   Of course, we've learned that last year Nike was making shoes in a factory that was hiring
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:28.680]   slave labor or forced labor from the Wieger minority in the Shinkan who are in concentration
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:29.680]   camps.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:39.480]   Coca-Cola was making sugar in a plant that was sourced from Xinjiang, perhaps with Wieger
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.240]   workers.
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:48.560]   So Apple, although when I read the New York Times article, we had talked on Sunday about
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:53.080]   unnamed sources, I think it was in the Wall Street Journal saying that Apple was lobbying,
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:58.800]   but they weren't sure what the lobbying was going, what they were going against.
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:01.200]   The New York Times has more detail.
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:08.080]   And actually, Apple says, "We support this, but we also have some concerns about some
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:12.200]   of it, and we want to make sure that it's appropriate."
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:16.480]   Coca-Cola says, "It's strictly prohibits any type of forced labor in our supply chain,"
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:18.280]   uses third-party auditors.
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:26.280]   Apple says, "The same thing, Nike did move out of that plant, and they say have not lobbied
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:31.400]   against the forced labor protection act, but had," this wasn't lobbying, they said,
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:32.960]   "constructive discussions."
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:36.440]   Well, that's legit.
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:42.720]   Their Times when the company is trying to weaken a law or make sure that its teeth get
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:46.680]   pulled out, but sometimes the lobbying efforts is just saying, "We want to at least have
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:49.480]   our voices known while they're discussing this."
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:54.840]   And it's an interesting piece of legislation because it doesn't specifically say, "If
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:28:01.560]   it goes into law, that's just like phase one of this enforcement."
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:08.240]   It gives the government a lot more teeth in punishing companies and holding goods at
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:15.200]   the border if they believe that Muslim forced labor has been used in these Chinese products.
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:23.760]   However, it says that the Congress has three months to figure out what kind of punishment
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:25.920]   should be levied against companies for using this labor.
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:28.600]   A lot of the specifics are not mentioned.
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:36.240]   It's just saying that we already have domestic laws that prohibit the use of slave labor
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.000]   and products entering the country.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:44.640]   We want to carve out a special circumstance for this situation, which is far exceeds
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:47.920]   what is going on, what the government has seen before.
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:51.440]   Apple, according to the, I'm glad that the New York Times piece has.
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:55.000]   They mentioned a document that they have seen, which makes me think that Apple showed them
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:00.500]   this document, that says that what Apple was going for is that give us more time, make
[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:07.680]   sure that we have more time to actually adjust our procedures so that we can comply with
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:08.840]   this law.
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:16.280]   So because the government, the Chinese government makes it so intentionally murky to find out
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:19.360]   whether this kind of labor is being used at a certain plant or not.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:24.240]   Remember that it's not just a factory town that's being built to house slave labor and
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.040]   also turn them into a workforce.
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:30.760]   They're also saying, this company needs 800 workers, great, we will shuttle these 800
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:37.600]   to help them to more satisfactorily integrate and rehabilitate them into Chinese society.
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:39.960]   We will move them into this factory where they are needed.
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:44.660]   So it's very, very hard for even a company like Apple to absolutely know for sure what's
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:45.660]   going on.
[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:49.320]   So one of the things they're suggesting is could you do that job for us and just simply
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:53.760]   say that these companies are now on our on our naughty list.
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:56.440]   And these are the companies that you are not allowed to work with anymore.
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:59.880]   So that's, it's going to be interesting to see how this shakes out.
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:07.360]   It's absolutely necessary because the more we find out about how this, it's not hyperbole
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.320]   to refer this as a slave labor force.
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:10.320]   People are being rounded up.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.320]   That's terrible.
[01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:12.320]   Made to live in camps.
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:13.960]   And it's not, it's not just torture.
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:14.960]   It's not just this.
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:21.840]   It is the, it's, I hate the cynical way that it's like, oh well, we could just since since
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:26.160]   we were, we have complete control over these people and what they can do inside of China,
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:27.960]   why don't we exploit their labor?
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:31.200]   Hey, that's, we need to address that.
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:37.640]   People's lobbying group is called fierce government relations.
[01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:42.520]   It's led by former staff aides to Mitch McConnell and President George W. Bush.
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:43.520]   They've paid them two names.
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:45.720]   You definitely want to be associated with them.
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:51.800]   They've paid them $90,000 to lobby on issues, including shingong related legislation.
[01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:54.840]   The Washington Post had this original story, not the Wall Street Journal.
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:59.080]   The Post wasn't sure what they were lobbying against, but the New York Times has reviewed
[01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:04.920]   a document, Apple says they, they dispute the claim they'd tried to weaken the legislation
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:09.480]   and they say they support efforts to strengthen American regulations and believe that the
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:13.760]   Uighur Forced Labor Prevention Act should become law.
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:19.920]   Their edits are, I think, fairly minor things like extending some deadlines for compliance,
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:23.720]   releasing information about supply chains to congressional committees rather than to
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:24.880]   the public.
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:28.320]   That's probably to protect, you know, proprietary information.
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:33.000]   In Chinese entities to be, quote, designated by the United States government, quote, end
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:41.960]   quote, as helping to surveil or detain Muslim minorities in shingong, requiring Chinese
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:46.560]   entities to be designated as helping to surveil.
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:47.760]   Oh, I see.
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:51.600]   So if they're going to cut ties off with a Chinese entity, they want to make sure that
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:57.000]   the government has announced that they're doing this so that they have a reason, a pretext
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.760]   to say, okay, we can't do business with you.
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:02.160]   Look, the US government said you're so we are not, we're not paying off the rest of your
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:03.160]   contract.
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.160]   Yeah.
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:05.160]   Yeah.
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:06.160]   Ah, that's probably it.
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:07.160]   You're right.
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:08.160]   So all of those, all of those seem completely reasonable.
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:10.320]   And Apple says, look, we're not against it.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:15.320]   We just want to, you know, we just, we have some business issues that we have to resolve.
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:17.840]   Apple, Nike are not alone.
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:23.680]   Coca Cola, 82 companies, potentially benefited according to an Australian report directly
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:28.760]   from abusive labor transfer programs.
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:34.240]   So apparently O-film technology, which is a contractor for Apple, but also Microsoft
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:38.800]   and Google and other companies received at least 700-weager workers in a program that
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:41.760]   was expected to gradually alter their ideology.
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:44.720]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:46.880]   That's nice.
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:51.480]   Apple says we have the strongest supplier code of conduct in our industry regularly assesses
[01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:54.240]   suppliers, including with surprise audits.
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:56.000]   I believe Apple on that one.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000]   Absolutely.
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.640]   This is one area when it comes to how workers get treated in the factories that produce
[01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:02.720]   Apple products.
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:07.000]   This is one area in which I am inclined to believe that if there's, if there's a lot
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.800]   of like flur, flur, flur, furious traffic about, well, Apple is trying to weaken a bill that
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:14.200]   protects people in China.
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:16.120]   It's probably not what's going on.
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:21.920]   I wouldn't say that about every company, but Apple has consistently worked much, much harder
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:27.840]   than they are legally required to make sure that they're sourcing their labor appropriately.
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:29.840]   You win one and you lose one.
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:37.800]   The courts have dismissed a lawsuit claiming that sign-in with Apple was an infringed patent.
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:39.800]   I, yeah, yeah.
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:43.800]   Blue mail developer Blix said, "No, we invented that."
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:44.800]   No.
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:46.800]   We own math.
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:47.800]   Yeah.
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:48.800]   Yeah.
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:49.800]   Yeah.
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:50.800]   Yeah.
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:54.760]   They, by the way, Blix is one of the founding members of the Coalition for App Fairness that
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:57.400]   fought Apple on the 30% cut.
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:59.080]   They did win, by the way.
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:00.080]   We haven't even mentioned this.
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:02.200]   You probably mentioned it last week, though, right?
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:06.440]   30% to 15% if you don't make more than $1 million on the App Store.
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:07.440]   That's a victory.
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:08.440]   That's a big victory.
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:09.440]   And I think a lot of-
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:10.440]   Just enough not to give it to Epic and Spotify.
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:12.360]   It was a feature secret for Epic.
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:14.560]   They knew exactly where to draw the line.
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.360]   Exactly the number they had to hit.
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:17.360]   Yeah.
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:18.560]   I don't blame them.
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:22.600]   But they did win, lose one in Italy, a fine of $12 million.
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:23.600]   Oh, no.
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:25.800]   How will Apple pay that?
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:29.800]   Although I agree with the Italian regulators because I think Apple has for a long time given
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:32.800]   the impression that the iPhone is somehow waterproof.
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:33.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:37.440]   First part I thought was weird because the IP ratings are just a standard, but the second
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:38.440]   part, absolutely.
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:43.400]   And it is absolutely the case.
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:46.480]   Apple says iPhones were water resistant and resistant.
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.520]   There's an important wiggle word.
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:53.360]   At a depth of between 1 and 4 meters for up to 30 minutes, that's the IP standard.
[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:55.480]   What is IP67, I think?
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:56.480]   68.
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:57.480]   68.
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:58.480]   68.
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:05.560]   But according to the Italian regulators, Apple did not clarify the claims are only true during
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:11.440]   controlled laboratory tests with the use of static and pure water, not seawater, not
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:13.440]   lake water, not in the normal conditions.
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.040]   Well, that part is a standard though.
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:22.040]   It's the second part that I think is not the warranty issue because the regulator also
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:27.840]   took issue with Apple's warranty terms which do not cover damage caused by liquids.
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:33.680]   The Italian Authority considered it inappropriate to push an aggressive commercial practice highlighting
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:39.480]   water resistance as a feature while at the same time refusing to provide warranty assistance
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:41.760]   if you suffer water damage.
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:43.520]   Mike and I talked about this on iOS today.
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:45.000]   We both knew this.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.360]   I mean, I think anybody who's ever brought in an iPhone with water damage knows they
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:50.880]   can just look in the port there.
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:56.560]   There's a little piece of paper that turns blue when you've hit water and it goes, "Yeah,
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.560]   well, we're not covering it."
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:03.800]   So I think it's known among some people, but I think it's really, I'm actually glad for
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:08.440]   this, not because the fine's going to harm Apple that much, but mostly because it will
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:11.440]   chase in them, I hope, to not be too aggressive in them.
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:16.080]   Hopefully it'll make them be a little bit more explicit about what they, I think that
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:21.120]   when all of us have talked to gut briefings from Apple, they are very explicit to us that
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:26.400]   this is just we want to make sure that if you have an accident, your Apple, your iPhone
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:28.640]   is not necessarily going to die.
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:32.200]   However, a lot of people have seen how it's IP68 water resistance.
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:33.200]   What does that mean?
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:37.520]   Oh, it means that it's tested by being underwater for five feet for upwards of 30 minutes.
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:41.560]   And that a lot of people think that means that, "Oh, that means that when I take my baby for
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:45.120]   the swim class, I can actually take the phone into the pool with me and it'll work fine."
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:46.120]   It's no longer camera.
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:48.120]   Yeah, or it's an underwater camera.
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:49.120]   Look at this.
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:50.520]   This is an ad for the iPhone 12.
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:53.680]   This is one of the ads that the Italian regulators cited.
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:57.080]   This is the iPhone 12 and a wind tunnel with things going at it.
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:01.920]   And then eventually a little spider-man falling off of it.
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:04.200]   Apple's hitting it, broccoli hitting it.
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.200]   I didn't see this ad.
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:06.200]   So one of the other issues.
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:07.200]   I think it's like, "Bunch out.
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:11.560]   Here comes the wedding cake and now the sprinkler."
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.560]   It's a quick point.
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:15.760]   Percadura, y l'floré.
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:23.640]   Yeah, so I don't really feel like Apple has been sending the wrong message about how
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:29.160]   water-resistant the phone is because they've never used waterproof.
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:33.040]   They don't show people swimming around with a phone.
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:36.640]   And I do realize that there's going to be people who don't understand what that means,
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:39.920]   but they've never implied that it's waterproof.
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:46.680]   But what I do think is wrong and I do think that this lawsuit helps address and hopefully
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:49.720]   this is something Apple will make a change.
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:56.400]   You can't go around saying that you can drop your phone in the toilet on accident and then
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:00.600]   say we're not covering it under the warranty.
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:01.960]   That's where the disconnect is.
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:04.320]   That's where Apple needs to make a change.
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:10.600]   Is that if they're going to have a water-resistant phone, then they need to include some kind
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:15.200]   of warranty protection, even if it's limited.
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:20.800]   It shouldn't just immediately make it so that your phone is out of warranty if the little
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:21.800]   strip is blue.
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:29.280]   That's where I think Apple made a big mistake and hopefully this lawsuit will actually make
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:32.320]   Apple change that a little bit.
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:36.880]   My big difficulty is particularly when you talk about the Apple Watch where there is
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:39.360]   an exercise of swimming.
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.440]   So that indicates that you're not meant to be swimming with your left hand above the
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:46.040]   water line every time that you do a backstroke.
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:48.600]   So that should definitely be covered.
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:51.040]   Water ingress should definitely be covered by warranty.
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:58.160]   I do appreciate that the problem with covering water resistance on a phone is that if you've
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:04.480]   ever seen the difference between a device that is designed specifically, Olympus makes
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:07.800]   a camera that is designed to be waterproof.
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:09.560]   Meaning you can take it.
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:10.560]   You can take it.
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:11.560]   I own that camera.
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:12.560]   Exactly.
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:17.440]   And it looks and it's basically sheets of steel help screwed together with bolts with
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:19.600]   rubber gaskets between them.
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:24.520]   With a phone, all they can do is we've used, we're holding this thing together with adhesives.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:27.840]   We're sort of making sure that whatever there is holes in this thing, it's not going to
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:30.160]   lead directly to the heart of the machine.
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:33.560]   And as a result, it's certainly going to become less water resistant over time.
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:37.560]   So there's a, I have some sympathy for Apple saying, well, look, this thing's been dropped
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:38.560]   twice.
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:40.600]   As the adhesives are like two years old.
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.440]   I don't care if you are paying for Apple care.
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:46.360]   We can't, we can't give you unlimited dowsing on this device.
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:48.840]   But nonetheless, I think part of it is just messaging.
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:52.480]   They've been, the number of times I've had, once again, had to tell people do not please
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:55.040]   don't take your phone into the water.
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:40:00.680]   Definitely not into salt water because, oh yeah, salt water hates electronics the way
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:05.760]   that certain, the way that, oh God, the way that God hates the devil.
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:10.040]   It's, it's, they're, they're not meant to coexist on the same plane of existence together.
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:12.600]   Well, consider yourself warmed.
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:13.600]   Okay.
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:14.600]   Yes.
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:16.360]   That is an awesome camera though.
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:17.360]   I keep wanting to buy.
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:20.920]   Oh, it is called the, I can't remember the name.
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:24.960]   I can't remember, but I've come so close to buying one of those like two or three times
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:28.080]   just as just the yellow, like the waterproof Walkman.
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:29.080]   Mine's red.
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:30.080]   Anything yellow is waterproof.
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:31.080]   Right.
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:32.080]   Mine's red and I love it.
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:35.640]   Oh, I can't remember the name of it, but the, I've recommended it many times.
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:37.880]   Dust, dust proof, drop proof, waterproof.
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:38.880]   Yeah.
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:40.960]   It's not a great, it's a point and shoot.
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:44.320]   It's not the best camera ever, but it's, it's, it's, it's 12 megapixels.
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:47.680]   But the idea is that you never have to worry about it.
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:53.000]   And there's so many, if I've gone kayaking with friends and I've taken with me, okay,
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:58.680]   let me go into my drawer here and find like my five year old, like Android phone that
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:40:59.680]   I don't need.
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:03.880]   I don't care if it gets destroyed because I do want to take pictures during this trip,
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:08.480]   but I don't, I know that I'm not going to trust anything that I paid more than $8 for.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:13.360]   Within the last, I even have a little floaty strap on it because if I drop it off the
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:16.680]   kayak or the boat or whatever, I can, it'll float.
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:21.480]   There was some, it's the Olympus tough T G and there's a number of them.
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:23.720]   This is the T G six is the most current.
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:24.720]   Yeah.
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:25.720]   Yeah.
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:29.720]   I have a 350 bucks really, really everybody should have this as a second camera.
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:34.120]   You know, there were some rumors that Apple was working on and maybe this ties into the
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:38.440]   portless iPhone, but they were working on underwater filmography capabilities.
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:43.440]   And I think there were some patents on it too, including computational distortion removal
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:46.280]   so that it would sort of try to equalize whatever was coming through the lens.
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:47.280]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:51.960]   I think all of that is super, super fascinating as you started thinking about where Apple
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:54.440]   could take computational photography next.
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:55.440]   Yeah.
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:56.440]   Yeah.
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:01.560]   One of our chatters, the Mac Keek says my cousin used his iPhone for music while he was
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:06.480]   showering the steam, set the water indicator off and Apple said, no dice.
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:07.880]   We're not fixing it.
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:08.880]   So they're pretty.
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:09.880]   It was not permanent either.
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:12.680]   Like the resistance goes like the seals and stuff break down over time.
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:17.240]   And if it's exposed to chemicals in the water, like if it's not pure water, all the water
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:18.760]   resistance breaks down over time.
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:23.040]   So it's, it is like what Andy said, it's meant to stop like to help you case of an accident.
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:25.720]   It's not meant to be your shower buddy or you're swimming toy.
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:26.720]   Yeah.
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:27.720]   Hey, breaking news.
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:31.160]   Just coming in sales force has announced.
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:32.920]   It has purchased slack.
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:33.920]   Wow.
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:38.760]   27.7 billion dollars.
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:42.880]   It was rumored to be a part cash, part stock deal.
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:48.080]   I don't know the exact details, but that is, that is pretty impressive.
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:49.080]   20.
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:55.480]   I mean, 27.7 billion sales force has about 20 billion in annual revenue.
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:58.120]   So that's a lot of money.
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:59.120]   Yeah.
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:02.120]   20.7 billion sales force has announced.
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:04.120]   So it's not a lot of money.
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:05.120]   It's not a lot of money.
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:06.120]   It's not a lot of money.
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:07.120]   It's not a lot of money.
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:08.120]   It's not a lot of money.
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:09.120]   It's not a lot of money.
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:10.120]   It's not a lot of money.

[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:46.120]   Yeah.
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:47.120]   Yeah.
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:48.120]   And a buck in a buck.
[01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:49.120]   Dot 083.
[01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:50.120]   It's not Mac Stadium cheap, but
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:51.120]   it's not.
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:52.120]   Right.
[01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:53.120]   Right.
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:54.120]   Right.
[01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:55.120]   The other great thing about this,
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:56.120]   even if you're not a developer,
[01:52:56.120 --> 01:53:01.120]   is that it points out why the design of the Mac Mini is so genius.
[01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:04.120]   That they're not doing some fancy sort of like server emulation.
[01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:09.120]   The fact that they've got Mac Mini in AWS means that they have a buttload of actual physical
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:10.120]   and racks running these things.
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:15.120]   And because Apple chose such a boring square off like hot plate sort of design,
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:19.120]   it means that they can rack them very, very easily.
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:22.120]   And so that's why you will never see anything really, really fancy.
[01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:26.120]   I think happened to the Mac Mini because it's just too valuable to the server in the
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:27.120]   development community.
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:31.120]   I think we've talked before like Alex particularly that or I'll speak for
[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:34.120]   myself every time I'm in like, no, it doesn't matter if I'm in like a network
[01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:38.120]   control room or like a little local cable station.
[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:41.120]   They've always have like racks and racks and racks of really blade servers,
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:42.120]   wonderful stuff.
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:46.120]   And then one or two Mac minis that they're using to administrate the entire thing
[01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:50.120]   because it integrates really, really well into the interface they want to work with.
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:57.120]   So another vote against having the Quaker Roadspox design for the next M1.
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:01.120]   Apple Silicon based Mac, Mac Mini.
[01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:03.120]   We did a whole iOS today.
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:07.120]   I'll point people to it showing how iOS apps run.
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:12.120]   On the M1 Mac and for the most part they do.
[01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:15.120]   It's kind of an amazing thing.
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:19.120]   And in fact, Apple has exposed it in the App Store.
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:22.120]   I'll just do a search here in the App Store for HBO Max.
[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:25.120]   And you see there's a tab, a field up at the top here.
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:29.120]   There are no Mac apps, but if you hit the iPhone and iPad apps, apparently they're
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:30.120]   none of those either.
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:32.120]   I must have spelled something wrong.
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:33.120]   What did I do wrong?
[01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:36.120]   Or maybe they just took it off just in time for the show.
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:38.120]   Let's try it again.
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:39.120]   There it is.
[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:41.120]   There's a space between HBO and Macs.
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:42.120]   So you can download this.
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:50.120]   It runs HBO unlike Netflix didn't disable it, but they did disable full screen.
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:53.120]   It's kind of annoying.
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:57.120]   Obviously you could do this in the browser and you don't really need to do an app.
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:02.120]   But there are a few apps in the iOS App Store that don't have analogs on the Mac.
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:07.120]   And in less development, we want Instagram and all the ones that you really want.
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:08.120]   They're like, nope, sorry.
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:10.120]   It costs us nothing, but you can't have them.
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:12.120]   We'd much rather get your browser data.
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:13.120]   So frustrating.
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:14.120]   Instagram.
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:16.120]   And this is something you have to say.
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:20.120]   By default, it will be available.
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:28.120]   In fact, quite a few apps say, you know, iPad app not necessarily approved for Macintosh.
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:31.120]   You see, design for iPhone, not verify for macOS.
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:33.120]   But we'll still run.
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:36.120]   But if there is a switch, the developer can throw.
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:41.120]   Is it in the next code where you say, don't make this available on the app store?
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:59.120]   And to be fair, a lot of these iOS apps, they don't really look that good because there's some of the mechanics of how their user interface works that multi-touch does not translate well to a mouse pointer or even that whatever they did to make sure that the window is, that it's device independent,
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:04.120]   and doesn't extend to whatever weird shape that the user might stretch the window into.
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:15.120]   So for a lot of people, it's just that we don't want the users to, we don't want the users first introduction to our $30 product, getting things done app for iOS to be a terrible experience on the Mac.
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:21.120]   We want to experience it on the iPhone first and then decide if it's worth moving into the Mac.
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:27.120]   So far that hasn't actually been my experience in terms of what I can find and not find.
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:33.120]   Actually, the companies that have things like productivity apps and stuff, they all seem to be on board with it.
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:38.120]   It's all of the apps that want your location.
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:41.120]   Or they can get that, can't they?
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:51.120]   I don't know, but for me, every app that didn't work, it was just like we were saying Instagram, Instacart, which I love using.
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:57.120]   But I just want to be able to add my groceries on my computer instead of having to switch to my phone.
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:59.120]   That's all I want to do.
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:05.120]   Those are the things that they actively check the no box instead of just making it possible for you.
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:16.120]   I don't think it has to do with the user experience because the app will show up on your Mac screen and it might be limited in size, but you can't stretch it.
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:23.120]   It's a frozen size of a screen, so it will be elongated or something like that.
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:27.120]   You can't make it wider or anything. It just stays in that one spot.
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:33.120]   I think it's more the companies that are checking the box to not do it.
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:38.120]   It's like they want something from your phone that they can't get from your computer.
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:40.120]   That's the first time I'm doing it.
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:41.120]   I do, a couple of them.
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:42.120]   Some of them said they just don't want to give away the Mac version.
[01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:44.120]   They don't want to give away a Mac version.
[01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:46.120]   If they're going to do one, they're going to charge you for it.
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:48.120]   They don't want to just be a gimme.
[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:49.120]   That makes sense.
[01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:55.120]   If you do nothing, like Bill Atkinson did, and you coded it right, it actually works really well on the Mac in touch.
[01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:59.120]   The Mac software was like 30 bucks a shot, not like two bucks on the iPhone.
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:00.120]   You've taken all our money already.
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:01.120]   We're not giving it this.
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:02.120]   That's exactly right.
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:03.120]   That's exactly right.
[01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:08.120]   I don't hope I'm not stealing your pick of the week, but Renee Richie, you've heard of him.
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:09.120]   He's a YouTube star.
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:11.120]   Maybe you should be following him.
[01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:14.120]   YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie or he's on Instagram.
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:17.120]   Here there is a little Easter egg you discovered.
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:24.120]   If you type, "Let it snow" in the App Store search field on iOS, it snows.
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:27.120]   You probably can't see that, but it snows.
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:28.120]   That's really cool.
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:29.120]   You have to put on Darkmoon.
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:32.120]   Yeah, Darkmoon would probably work better.
[01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:34.120]   How did you find that?
[01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:35.120]   It's pretty cute.
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:41.120]   They've been doing this for, they do like little, it's such a funny company.
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:46.120]   This is a company that will take away your charger, but spend a billion dollars chamfering the edges of an iPhone.
[01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:53.120]   When a basketball team wins, they'll spend money web developing, like the logo for that basketball team flying across.
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:58.120]   They'll make it so that there's a special treatment in the messages.
[01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:00.120]   They just do this kind of stuff.
[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:04.120]   Everyone's in a while, people start talking about it and you're like, "Wow, that works."
[01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:10.120]   There's a part of them, probably much to James Thompson's chagrin now, that actually approves of Easter eggs.
[01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:16.120]   It's such a nice touch, particularly on a device that's so personal, like a phone or a watch.
[01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:22.120]   On a desktop it's nice, but when you pick up, when you do a device, you can see the phone.
[01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:27.120]   When you check your watch on your birthday and it's far and confetti, you're like, "Oh, you remembered?"
[01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:34.120]   And you immediately forget, "Oh, well, this is a faceless billion-terr- trillion-dollar corporation, but still it's nice to see confetti on my birthday."
[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:35.120]   Well, I don't know.
[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:36.120]   The humans at work there, that's the cool thing.
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:40.120]   I don't know what Renee has against Dark Mode, but I'm going to try it in Dark Mode.
[01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:41.120]   Oh, there it is.
[01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:44.120]   And it does show up a little bit better in Dark Mode, doesn't it?
[01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:46.120]   Just type "Let it snow."
[01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:48.120]   I let the sunset dictate my motley.
[01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:51.120]   I'm not going to impose mods on my phone.
[01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:53.120]   I let it do what it's going to do.
[01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:54.120]   You've got to do what you're going to do.
[01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:56.120]   I find Dark Mode oppressive during the day.
[01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:58.120]   I like the brightness and the openness.
[01:59:58.120 --> 02:00:02.120]   And then at night, I like the coolness and the calmness, so I let sunset.
[02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:03.120]   It's pretty cool.
[02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:06.120]   Does it stay on forever?
[02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:07.120]   If I do that?
[02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:08.120]   I don't know.
[02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:11.120]   It makes me want to shop more on the Apple Store.
[02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:14.120]   Maybe it'll stop in March.
[02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:16.120]   It should accumulate.
[02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:20.120]   I want to do a different pattern of these pseudo-random snowflakes
[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:22.120]   having the desired effect.
[02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:24.120]   I want to build up so that I can see it.
[02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:25.120]   It could soon.
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:26.120]   Buy more.
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:29.120]   Buy more.
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:36.120]   All right, let's take a break and then if you will, prepare your picks of the week.
[02:00:36.120 --> 02:00:38.120]   But before we do that, I should mention.
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:42.120]   Oh, Leo, one last thing that Apple just released a Pro XDR display calibration utility.
[02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:47.120]   So if you update your firmware, you will now have the ability to run this.
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:51.120]   If you're a display nerd and you have one of these 6K for 6K panels,
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:53.120]   you can calibrate the XDR out of it now.
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:55.120]   This could be my pick of the week.
[02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:58.120]   I got just in time for my new MacBook.
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:01.120]   This is Armor Lock from G-Technology.
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:06.120]   This is the most awesome encrypted NVMe SSD.
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:10.120]   It's USB 3.2, so it's 10 gigabits per second.
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:12.120]   External drive.
[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:13.120]   But here's the thing.
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:17.120]   I think if you work in a business, like, say, the TV or motion picture industry,
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:20.120]   where you use external drives, maybe you ship them around,
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:24.120]   there's always that fear if somebody gets it, you're going to lose your intellectual property.
[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:28.120]   I would like something that I could keep all of my documents,
[02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:31.120]   all the key stuff, you know, tax returns on and stuff that I feel safe about.
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:33.120]   And that's what's so cool about this.
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:35.120]   An external drive that is encrypted.
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:38.120]   The other thing that's very cool about it is how you open it up.
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:41.120]   Let me plug it into my Macintosh and I'll show you here.
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:43.120]   So I'll plug it into the USB-C port.
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:50.120]   By the way, it will work on any device, including a USB-C, a phone or an iPad,
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:51.120]   or a Windows device as well.
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:56.120]   But you can see, when I plugged it in, the light goes on and it's locked.
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:59.120]   Now, there's a Mac app that you can use to unlock it,
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:05.120]   but I'm going to use the Armor Lock app on my iPhone to unlock it.
[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:06.120]   So watch this.
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:10.120]   It uses Bluetooth LE to connect to the phone.
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:13.120]   So it's plugged in, the phone sees it, tap to unlock.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:18.120]   It uses Biometrics, Face ID or Touch ID, depending on what is on your phone to unlock it.
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:21.120]   Now it's unlocked and I can use it as a standard hard drive.
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:23.120]   In fact, here it is.
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:25.120]   You see, and by the way, I love this.
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:26.120]   And of course, it's G technology.
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:30.120]   So of course, it's got a beautiful icon that perfectly represents it.
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:35.120]   And this is where I keep all of my most important stuff, my documents and so forth,
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:39.120]   my audio tracks, things like tax returns that I just don't like.
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:41.120]   So I just don't want somebody to get.
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:47.120]   If you are using external drives, this is a very fast NVMe SSD drive.
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:51.120]   If you use it to put private important stuff on there, you'll appreciate it.
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:57.120]   It's 256-bit AES/XTS hardware encryption, the same kind that FileVault uses.
[02:02:57.120 --> 02:03:01.120]   And it's so easy to unlock with your phone or on the Mac app.
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:06.120]   So I love it because you get all of the security of a really locked phone,
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:09.120]   but there's no kernel extension you have to install.
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:11.120]   There's no weird stuff you have to install.
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:13.120]   It just works right off the phone.
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:14.120]   I love it.
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:17.120]   You can even enable other people to unlock it.
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:21.120]   So if you're mailing it to somebody, you can authorize their phone to unlock it,
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:22.120]   which is awesome.
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:25.120]   IP67, dust and water resistant.
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:29.120]   It's just a fantastic device.
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:33.120]   And like I said, it really helped me in getting this new Mac up and running
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:37.120]   because I have everything copied off onto this, and I can just quickly copy it back
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:39.120]   onto my new Mac and boy, is it fast.
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:41.120]   Take control of your data privacy.
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:48.120]   G technology's brand new, armor lock, NVMe, solid state drive.

[02:03:57.120 --> 02:04:02.120]   And if you are thinking of a holiday gift for the geek in your life,
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:06.120]   I don't know any geek that wouldn't be thrilled,
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:08.120]   thrilled I tell you to get this.
[02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:12.120]   It is so cool, so good, and completely frictionless.
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:17.120]   ArmorLock.com.com to get yours.
[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:18.120]   You can't have mine.
[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:20.120]   I'm keeping it here.
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:23.120]   And then of course after you eject it, I'll show you real quickly.
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:25.120]   I'll select the icon.
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:27.120]   I'll eject it.
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:35.120]   And as soon as it's ejected, the drive locks, and it is no longer readable by anybody
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:37.120]   without the secret key.
[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:42.120]   You see, it immediately goes to locked, and now I can unplug it.
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:45.120]   And sorry, you can't -- oh, by the way, isn't that cool?
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:48.120]   It's got this -- I thought, oh, that's just a pretty design.
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:51.120]   And they said, no, no, that's the heat sink on the SSD.
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:54.120]   Those beautiful gold fins that shine through.
[02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:57.120]   It was really cool of them to do it that way.
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:04:59.120]   Thank you, ArmorLock.
[02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:04.120]   Gee technology has always done great stuff for Mac and Tasha's.
[02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:09.120]   Let's start with Renee Ritchie this week in your pick of the week.
[02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:12.120]   So my first pick is just ridiculously self-serving,
[02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:15.120]   but I finally put out my first T-shirt.
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:17.120]   It's under pre-order now, and I was really debating,
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:19.120]   because I don't like just the logo T-shirts.
[02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:23.120]   That always feels like minimum possible effort on a T-shirt.
[02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:26.120]   So I started thinking about things that I tend to say just out loud,
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:29.120]   often inappropriately, and I went through a few of them,
[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:33.120]   and decided that one of my trends for this year is --
[02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:35.120]   technology is amazing.
[02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:36.120]   It's wonderful.
[02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:37.120]   It's fun.
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:39.120]   And even if we have problems with it in frustrations,
[02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:42.120]   and there are things we don't like, I think it's still important
[02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:45.120]   to have fun with it, and it just seems like there was a lot of
[02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:48.120]   negativity in some of the tech stuff this year,
[02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:52.120]   even for things that were legitimately amazing and maybe problematic in some ways,
[02:05:52.120 --> 02:05:53.120]   but still amazing.
[02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:57.120]   So the first one I talked -- I did it with Simon,
[02:05:57.120 --> 02:05:59.120]   who's forgotten Tal on Twitter.
[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:00.120]   He's brilliant.
[02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:03.120]   Simon Buckmaster, brilliant, brilliant designer.
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:05.120]   And we came up with one that says,
[02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:07.120]   "Cynicism does not equal intelligence."
[02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:08.120]   Oh, I love it.
[02:06:08.120 --> 02:06:09.120]   Which is beautiful.
[02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:13.120]   Like, negativity is not honesty, and cynicism is not intelligence.
[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:18.120]   And I thought that would be just a fitting design for my debut.
[02:06:18.120 --> 02:06:19.120]   Where do we get these?
[02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:22.120]   You're terrible at plugging yourself.
[02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:23.120]   Where do we get these?
[02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:24.120]   I put the link in the sheet.
[02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:25.120]   I put the link in the sheet.
[02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:28.120]   It's standard.tv/renaeritchie.
[02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:30.120]   Standard.tv/renaeritchie.
[02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:32.120]   I'll show it here.
[02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:36.120]   Cynicism does not include -- does not equal intelligence.
[02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:38.120]   Oh, and it's dark mode.
[02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:39.120]   I like it.
[02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:40.120]   Yeah.
[02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:41.120]   Oh, I like it.
[02:06:41.120 --> 02:06:42.120]   That's really nice.
[02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:43.120]   20 bucks, too.
[02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:46.120]   You could make a little more money on this if you charged more.
[02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:50.120]   There's going to be a bunch of stuff up there that I want to make useful,
[02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:54.120]   but I also want to make sure that it goes to worthwhile causes and things.
[02:06:54.120 --> 02:06:57.120]   So I'll have some other stuff that wasn't quite ready on time, sadly.
[02:06:57.120 --> 02:07:03.120]   But I want to try to make people's lives a little bit better, and we'll see how that goes.
[02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:04.120]   Oh.
[02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:06.120]   I'm a cynic.
[02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:08.120]   [laughter]
[02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:10.120]   I don't buy it.
[02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:13.120]   Standard.tv/renaeritchie.
[02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:17.120]   That's your Renee Richie Collection t-shirt.
[02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:18.120]   And there's a --
[02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:19.120]   It could be clear.
[02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:20.120]   You can be a cynic.
[02:07:20.120 --> 02:07:22.120]   Please claim test everything.
[02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:23.120]   Test everything.
[02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:28.120]   But I think you can tell when someone actually has joy in their heart about technology,
[02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:31.120]   and when it's just something they're super angry at all the time.
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:32.120]   Yeah.
[02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:34.120]   And that's immediately -- you're joyful about this stuff, Leo.
[02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:35.120]   You might go on the house about it.
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:37.120]   The show is half-growsing.
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:40.120]   But you can tell all of us have a deep and abiding love for the technology.
[02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:43.120]   That's I grouse because I care.
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:50.120]   Although I have to say, I was much more of a positive person until I met John Cena Foreck,
[02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:51.120]   who totally --
[02:07:51.120 --> 02:07:52.120]   [laughter]
[02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:54.120]   -- who really taught me to hate.
[02:07:54.120 --> 02:08:00.120]   So he's made his living for years being cynical and saying, "Yeah, it'll never work.
[02:08:00.120 --> 02:08:01.120]   And who wants a mouse?
[02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:02.120]   Somebody wants a mouse."
[02:08:02.120 --> 02:08:06.120]   And he always said, "Oh, Leo, you're too positive about this stuff."
[02:08:06.120 --> 02:08:08.120]   And I took it to heart, and I started getting less positive.
[02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:10.120]   I'm going to be positive again.
[02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:13.120]   I don't want to be too positive because it's not perfect.
[02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:14.120]   But I enjoy it.
[02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:16.120]   Like, we can all enjoy technology.
[02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:17.120]   Absolutely.
[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:18.120]   Yeah.
[02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:23.120]   I'm going to actually -- I already mentioned it once, but I want to -- just if you're a coder,
[02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:26.120]   I really want to recommend Advent of Code.
[02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:29.120]   Topaz is amazing.
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:32.120]   This guy has done this now five years in a row.
[02:08:32.120 --> 02:08:34.120]   His name is Eric Wastel.
[02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:38.120]   And he puts so much effort into these puzzles.
[02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:41.120]   There are 50 puzzles, two per day.
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:45.120]   So you can earn a total of 50 stars.
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:48.120]   There's always a plot.
[02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:51.120]   And there are always leaderboards.
[02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:54.120]   And don't be embarrassed -- oh, I just logged out.
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:09:01.120]   Don't be embarrassed if you aren't on the leaderboard because it's not just about being the first
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:02.120]   or the fastest.
[02:09:02.120 --> 02:09:04.120]   It's just about the fun of solving these puzzles.
[02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:06.120]   I have a day job.
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:08.120]   There's no way I can solve these.
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:11.120]   There are people on the leaderboards who solve them in seconds.
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:16.120]   And I look at them and go, "That's going to take me five hours just to figure out how to start up my editor.
[02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:17.120]   Stop it."
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:19.120]   He was so popular.
[02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:24.120]   I think there's a lot of coders who are not fully employed right now or they're at home
[02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:29.120]   and they can do whatever they want because when it started at midnight eastern today,
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:33.120]   his whole site pls clobbered.
[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:37.120]   So there's no leaderboard for day one.
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:39.120]   You can't get on the leaderboard.
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:40.120]   Day one is worth no points.
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:41.120]   But you know what?
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:42.120]   It's pretty easy.
[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:44.120]   I've never gotten past day five.
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:46.120]   I want to be clear.
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:50.120]   It gets harder and harder and harder and it will really test your coding.
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:53.120]   But what a great way to learn a language.
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:56.120]   I would say you need to be pretty adept.
[02:09:56.120 --> 02:09:58.120]   You need to have good math skills.
[02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:05.120]   And Eric wrote a great piece on Reddit about how he comes up with these puzzles.
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:10.120]   In every case, these puzzles can be, not every case, many cases, they can be brute forced,
[02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:12.120]   but he designs them.
[02:10:12.120 --> 02:10:15.120]   So if you brute force it, it's painfully slow.
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:20.120]   In every case, these things can be solved with even a low end machine to be solved in seconds.
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:25.120]   So if it's taking forever to generate an answer, you're doing it wrong.
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:28.120]   He also prevents cheating by having a variety of data sets.
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:30.120]   It's really cleverly done.
[02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:31.120]   Highly recommended.
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:35.120]   There are quite a few programming puzzles online, but this one's a fun one.
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:37.120]   Advent of code.com.
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:38.120]   No cost.
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:41.120]   I kicked in some money because I just want them to keep doing it.
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:43.120]   I just think it's such a great thing.
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:45.120]   Advent of code.com.
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:47.120]   Andy Naco, your pick of the week.
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:52.120]   I've been enjoying a video player for the past few weeks since I discovered it.
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:54.120]   It's called IINA.
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:58.120]   I don't know if you pronounce it INA, but it's spelled IINA.
[02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:05.120]   What I love about it is that it's a specific, is such a total like Mac interface video player.
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:10.120]   It will work with pretty much any video file format that you've got stored that you can access
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:13.120]   on your local storage or network.
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:15.120]   It will stream from YouTube.
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:18.120]   It'll stream from a whole bunch of other services as well.
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:22.120]   I was just for fun.
[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:26.120]   I tried to, in addition to opening files, it says there's a box for opening open a URL so
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:32.120]   you can paste in a YouTube URL, but I even paste it in like a URL from PBS.org for like
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:34.120]   the last episode of Nova, which is amazing.
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:39.120]   It's all about like the recovery of the Notre Dame Cathedral after the fire.
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:46.120]   And instead of having to work through like PBS's window, it will just simply open it in its own
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:48.120]   like floating window.
[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:50.120]   You can have it in a floating window, a non-floating window.
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:52.120]   You can have it full screen.
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:54.120]   You can have it as picture in picture.
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:56.120]   Playback controls are absolutely thorough.
[02:11:56.120 --> 02:12:00.120]   You can control how much GPU uses if you're having a problem with there.
[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:03.120]   It makes it really, really easy to do screen captures individually.
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:06.120]   Just Command S and it will do it for you.
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:07.120]   On and on and on.
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:12.120]   Sub-Tile support is wonderful because not only does it support whatever subtitles are baked
[02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:18.120]   into the video file, but it also supports open subtitles.com so that you can just simply
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:24.120]   go to the subtitles menu and under subtitles, just say just find online subtitles.
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:29.120]   And if it knows what it is you're watching and there's an open subtitles file for it,
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:34.120]   it will simply download that file and you've got subtitles where you didn't have subtitles before.
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:36.120]   It's under it's on GitHub.
[02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:38.120]   It's an open source project.
[02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:41.120]   It's being updated and built regularly.
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:42.120]   It's totally free.
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:47.120]   It's not a universal binary yet, although on GitHub they say that they're working on it.
[02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:51.120]   It's just going to take a little time to get that done because as you can imagine, like we're
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:56.120]   talking earlier about an open source project, it uses lots of libraries and has to make sure those libraries
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:12:58.120]   are actually working.
[02:12:58.120 --> 02:13:04.120]   But I downloaded because I was looking for a better alternative to VLC player is wonderful,
[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:06.120]   but it is what I always think.
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:09.120]   It's always all the negative things I think about when I think about an open source project.
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:16.120]   It is amazingly thorough in its feature set, but it's not really a pleasant thing to use
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:17.120]   on a daily basis.
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:24.120]   Quicktime player works very, very well and you get it for free, but it is limited to what it can do.
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:32.120]   This is really like whenever I'm stuck with my two or three screen display and I want to watch
[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:38.720]   an hour long YouTube video, this is how I'm doing it because it really allows me to integrate
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:42.120]   this with my entire workspace.
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:45.960]   Again, just the ability to say, just please just float this window on top of everything
[02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:49.320]   else so that no matter what happens, this is always on top.
[02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:53.080]   Just that simple feature is such a big thing to have in a video player.
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:58.560]   It does music as well, but I've really just been relying on it for a video.
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:05.360]   It got one of those coveted open at launch slots on my Macs, so that's about as big
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:08.280]   as a compliment as I can pay for it.
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:12.200]   So you mean it opens and is always running in the background in your system?
[02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:15.160]   No, I know I'm going to use it at some point.
[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:16.160]   Just have it running.
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:17.160]   Yeah.
[02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:20.800]   You can have it automatically quit whenever you close, whenever it has no video windows
[02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:23.680]   to go for, but it stays out of the way.
[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:29.440]   It doesn't choke any, it doesn't use any CPU that's not entitled to.
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:35.840]   And as I said, it's just a, I'm always annoyed when I can see an app that works really well,
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:38.680]   but it was not built as a Mac app.
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:41.240]   This is one of the reasons why I still really miss aperture.
[02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:47.280]   I love Adobe Lightroom, but aperture was built by Apple to be an Apple made app for the Macintosh,
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:52.040]   whereas Lightroom is designed to be the Adobe user interface that will look the same on
[02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:53.040]   everything.
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:58.560]   But there's a reason why I'm paying the Apple tax for Apple hardware, and so I can get apps
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:00.760]   that look as pretty as Apple intended them to be.
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:05.000]   And this is, I, I, and A as pretty as Apple intends a video player to be.
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:11.120]   Yeah, this, it's choked a little bit on this giant 4K video that I rendered in motion,
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:15.200]   but I think that's probably because it's Intel running on a version of this.
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:16.520]   You can also get an native version.
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:18.400]   I'm sure it'll be a lot better.
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:23.440]   If you've got performance problems that you would like to solve, you can actually go into
[02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:27.920]   like detailed settings and say you can use multiple, here's how many threads I'm allowing
[02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:29.080]   you to use for this.
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:32.160]   You can use the GPU exclusively to decode this.
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:36.600]   So I'm just amazed that they took the time to say, I know that almost nobody will ever
[02:15:36.600 --> 02:15:42.480]   actually need to use this, but when somebody wants to use, wants to watch their 4K totally
[02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:50.040]   legally obtained MP4 file Wonder Woman 1984, they will be able to run it properly on this
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:51.040]   app.
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:52.040]   Nice.
[02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:54.760]   I should mention that one of the ways I find out if stuff's running natively, I mentioned
[02:15:54.760 --> 02:16:00.800]   it before, but I'm amazing as offering a free silicon app that lets you scan all the apps
[02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:06.240]   and find out immediately if it's universal or if it's fat binary or if it's Intel running
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:07.240]   on a Rosetta.
[02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:10.840]   So does that work on, does that work on all hardware and operating systems or do you need
[02:16:10.840 --> 02:16:11.840]   to be?
[02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:12.840]   Great questions.
[02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:13.840]   That's a great question.
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:17.680]   Yeah, it's free from my amazing.
[02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:21.000]   So yeah, that's a good question.
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.720]   Lori Gill is also here.
[02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:25.080]   What is your pick of the week?
[02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:28.200]   What am I spending my money on this week?
[02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:31.720]   You may not be into this one, but I was really into this one.
[02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:33.880]   I bought myself this over the weekend.
[02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:38.880]   It is face masks with the Disneyland logos on them.
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:43.440]   So all my friends out there that love Disneyland.
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:47.840]   And it has the retro style of the one that's the gray color.
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:50.280]   I love that logo so much.
[02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:51.280]   It looks so great.
[02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:56.720]   So if you're lucky enough to actually be able to go to Disney World, let's say, which
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:02.080]   by the way, don't anyway, because just don't leave your house, please, just stay at home.
[02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:07.440]   But if you do, you can actually wear yourself a Disney on face mask while you're there.
[02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:08.560]   They have a Disney World too.
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:12.840]   So if you are a Disney World attendee, they have them for Disney World too.
[02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:16.000]   And they're just adorable and I love Disneyland.
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:19.880]   And we're going to be wearing face masks for a little while longer, so we might as well
[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:23.440]   like have our big variety and show off our Disney side.
[02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:25.720]   So I have such a stack of face masks.
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:28.080]   Some I've made, some Lisa's bought a Nettie.
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:30.880]   We have so many face masks.
[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:32.120]   I think it's going to be funny.
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:37.640]   I think there'll be a face mask exhibition in the Smithsonian in about 50 years.
[02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:39.240]   Remember 2020?
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:40.520]   Here's what we were wearing.
[02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:41.520]   Yeah, so comfortable.
[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:42.520]   Why isn't everybody wearing them?
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:45.320]   I'll be wearing it for the rest of my life, I think.
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:50.960]   Especially now that it's winter, I was introduced to how nice it is to have a face mask going
[02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:52.960]   when I started biking in the winter.
[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:56.640]   And now it's like, oh, here's the reason why my cheeks and my nose and my chin are not
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:17:57.640]   freezing off.
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:03.040]   Oh, that's because I'm heating it with my exhaled breath.
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:07.440]   From the happiest place on the earth to the saddest place on earth because this is Lori
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:10.760]   Gill's last episode with us.
[02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:16.320]   But for good reason, she's taken a job with the fruit company.
[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:17.240]   Congratulations.
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:18.240]   Thank you.
[02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:19.240]   Another one.
[02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:27.120]   Yeah, I'll be writing scripts for Apple support YouTube channel.
[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:33.080]   So those adorable little two-minute videos that Apple support puts out on YouTube that
[02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:39.200]   Talizia had a sign up for an Apple ID or how to take pictures with your phone.
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:40.840]   I will be writing those scripts.
[02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:45.200]   Are you going to write the part that says, and then John Hodgman says, because that would
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:47.480]   be pretty cool.
[02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:53.160]   I mean, if John Hodgman is going to be on an Apple support video on YouTube, yes, I
[02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:55.200]   will be one of the people writing his script.
[02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:57.040]   When do you start?
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:18:58.040]   I start on Monday.
[02:18:58.040 --> 02:19:00.040]   Are you excited?
[02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:01.040]   I'm very excited.
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:04.640]   Do you get to go down to the campus for your initial, because I know you're working from
[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:05.640]   home.
[02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:08.400]   I won't be until they open.
[02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:10.240]   They'll onboard you later.
[02:19:10.240 --> 02:19:13.200]   The only people allowed on campus are people who have to be there.
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:15.520]   They're not going to just invite me there to just check it out.
[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:21.720]   So when the campus opens back up, I will be able to go take a gander and take a trip.
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:24.640]   But that probably won't be until at least next spring.
[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:26.920]   We've lost so many people to the fruit company.
[02:19:26.920 --> 02:19:27.920]   Makes me crazy.
[02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:30.320]   Renee, are you now feeling kind of offended?
[02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:31.320]   Yeah.
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:32.800]   I'm sure they've called Renee.
[02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:33.800]   It's only a matter of time.
[02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:35.400]   I'm pretty sure Renee has been asked.
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:37.400]   He just decided not to.
[02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:38.960]   Well, maybe not.
[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:40.400]   He's not saying anything.
[02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:44.720]   I feel like I'm just so happy that all these people that I've worked with have found wonderful
[02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:45.720]   careers.
[02:19:45.720 --> 02:19:46.920]   So Renee is very happy.
[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:49.560]   I know Nathan Oliver's Giles used to be one of her hosts.
[02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:50.920]   He's very happy there.
[02:19:50.920 --> 02:19:52.680]   I'm sure, although he never writes.
[02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:53.880]   He never calls.
[02:19:53.880 --> 02:19:56.160]   Who else is over there now?
[02:19:56.160 --> 02:20:01.120]   From I'm more Leanna Loffd, Ali Hasmuhas, Renee Caldwell, Lori Gill.
[02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:02.120]   Wow.
[02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:07.400]   Chris Breen and like half a few people in that Mac world and Mac world.
[02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:08.400]   Chris Breen.
[02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:09.400]   Yeah, that's right.
[02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:10.400]   Yeah.
[02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:11.400]   Well, good for that.
[02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:12.400]   I mean, they're hiring the best.
[02:20:12.400 --> 02:20:16.280]   Lori, I'm very, very sad because I look, you're one of the reasons I look forward to
[02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:17.480]   doing this show every single week.
[02:20:17.480 --> 02:20:19.000]   You're 40 different kinds of awesome.
[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:23.400]   I'm glad that you've, I'm glad that you found a job that was wonderful.
[02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:24.400]   That gets you all excited.
[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:27.280]   I'm just sad that I don't get to talk to you every week on the show.
[02:20:27.280 --> 02:20:29.920]   Well, it actually was Lori who introduced us.
[02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:32.920]   I mean, Andy who introduced us to Lori, right?
[02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:35.400]   You were the, and you said, you got to get Lori on.
[02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:36.720]   She's great.
[02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:38.520]   And so, yeah.
[02:20:38.520 --> 02:20:44.760]   So next week, Merlin Mann, we'll probably have a rotating crew of people for a while.
[02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:49.000]   I told Alex, you know, he can have a seat back, but he's busy.
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:50.000]   He said 6 a.m.
[02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:51.000]   Lea, I told you 6 a.m.
[02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:52.560]   He's busy.
[02:20:52.560 --> 02:20:54.040]   We do love Lori Gill.
[02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:55.040]   We're going to really miss you, Lori.
[02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:57.000]   I'm going to miss out, too.
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.200]   This has been a wonderful time.
[02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:01.480]   I've really enjoyed all of our weekly chats.
[02:21:01.480 --> 02:21:05.960]   I actually, when I don't get the opportunity, I really do miss it.
[02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:09.240]   So this is going to be hard for me to not be able to see you every week.
[02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:10.240]   Come by.
[02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:12.360]   And I should say it's not Apple that said you can't do the show.
[02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:16.720]   It was, it was that son of a bitch Leo.
[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:22.400]   I just, I didn't want to put you in the position of working for Apple and then having a comment
[02:21:22.400 --> 02:21:24.840]   on Apple on the show.
[02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:28.440]   And I just didn't, I think that that's not a good position for anybody to have to be in.
[02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:31.320]   I'm going to nasty call from PR maybe depending on what you want.
[02:21:31.320 --> 02:21:34.920]   Yeah, or just feel uncomfortable that, you know, here's a company that employs me and
[02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:37.040]   I got to say something about them.
[02:21:37.040 --> 02:21:39.920]   So I just, it just isn't, it's generally our policy to do that.
[02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:44.520]   We've lost a lot of people to Apple and tell and other companies.
[02:21:44.520 --> 02:21:45.520]   Sometimes that's the best outcome.
[02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:46.520]   So congratulations.
[02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:47.520]   We're very happy for you.
[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:48.520]   Thank you.
[02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:49.520]   Yeah.
[02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:50.520]   Yeah.
[02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:56.040]   I also wish I had known it in advance because I would have like gone to the really good bakery
[02:21:56.040 --> 02:22:00.560]   this in the walking distance, bought a big cake and pretended it was actually just for
[02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:01.560]   you.
[02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:04.760]   And then be able to eat it, eat it myself at the next week.
[02:22:04.760 --> 02:22:07.400]   Well, you know, I'll be, I'll be sad.
[02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:08.400]   I'll be sad.
[02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:12.840]   I'll be sad eating all day tomorrow.
[02:22:12.840 --> 02:22:13.840]   Anyway, so.
[02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:16.280]   All right, you're, you're, you're not, you're not dying.
[02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:17.680]   You're not joining the French foreign Legion.
[02:22:17.680 --> 02:22:19.440]   We will be, we will be in touch.
[02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:20.440]   We enjoy each other's coffee.
[02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:22.960]   Well, I'd like to still have you on from time to time.
[02:22:22.960 --> 02:22:26.240]   I just, you know, I want to put you in, I don't want to put you in an awkward position.
[02:22:26.240 --> 02:22:27.240]   So.
[02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:28.240]   Yeah.
[02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:29.240]   Thank you, Lori Gill.
[02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:37.640]   Formerly, I'm Wars managing editor now soon to be an Apple employee.
[02:22:37.640 --> 02:22:40.320]   We also thank Andy and I co for joining us.
[02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:44.440]   Andy is of course going to be around WGBH Boston Thursday.
[02:22:44.440 --> 02:22:45.440]   Yep.
[02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:47.160]   Thursday at 1 p.m. this week.
[02:22:47.160 --> 02:22:52.320]   Go to wgphnews.org, a, you can stream it live or wait a few hours and they'll post my segment
[02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:53.320]   later on.
[02:22:53.320 --> 02:22:54.320]   Nice.
[02:22:54.320 --> 02:22:55.320]   It's always good to have you.
[02:22:55.320 --> 02:23:02.900]   I H N A T K O dot com or on Twitter or on Instagram and Renee Richie is at youtube.com/Renee
[02:23:02.900 --> 02:23:03.900]   Richie.
[02:23:03.900 --> 02:23:07.480]   He is a YouTube star.
[02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:12.040]   So good to have you on at Renee Richie and don't forget standard.tv/Renee Richie for
[02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:13.040]   the t-shirt.
[02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:15.960]   I caught up by huge video.
[02:23:15.960 --> 02:23:19.520]   It took me like two weeks of research, one of the videos I'm happiest with all about
[02:23:19.520 --> 02:23:20.520]   how we got to the M1.
[02:23:20.520 --> 02:23:21.520]   Oh.
[02:23:21.520 --> 02:23:22.680]   And I'm surprised people are watching it.
[02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:23.680]   It's got like a hundred thousand views.
[02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:24.680]   Oh, nice.
[02:23:24.680 --> 02:23:29.280]   A 30 minute video about a chipset, which really makes like Redeam's YouTube a lot for me.
[02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:30.280]   Yeah.
[02:23:30.280 --> 02:23:31.280]   No.
[02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:32.280]   Yeah.
[02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:35.560]   I think that, you know, that's a good role for you on YouTube is to be a be kind of like
[02:23:35.560 --> 02:23:41.200]   the geeky guy that, you know, there's so much shallow stuff on YouTube or cynicism
[02:23:41.200 --> 02:23:45.520]   on YouTube that would be, I think this is a good opportunity for you to really go deep.
[02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:47.680]   And I bet you, you do better because of it.
[02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:53.200]   I would expect, frankly, I'm not surprised at all that people are interested in that is
[02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:54.200]   a let's see.
[02:23:54.200 --> 02:23:55.720]   So it's not on your website.
[02:23:55.720 --> 02:23:58.120]   So I'll have to go to YouTube behind a little bit on my website.
[02:23:58.120 --> 02:24:01.280]   I keep, I keep trying to get my website to play nicely with Markdown and then I break
[02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:03.520]   it and then it takes me a while to fix it again.
[02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:04.520]   Me too.
[02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:09.160]   Oh, the web, oh, the web, the web, the web, whatever we going to do.
[02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:15.880]   Well, then just go to Renee Richie, Renee Richie on YouTube.com/Renee Richie.
[02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:19.960]   And of course, don't forget, you can make educational content and rap.
[02:24:19.960 --> 02:24:23.360]   If I can make educational content and wrap it in goofy YouTube titles and thumbnails,
[02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:24.760]   I think I can treat people with watching it.
[02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:28.720]   You have definitely nailed the YouTube thumbnail reaction shot.
[02:24:28.720 --> 02:24:34.520]   People complain, but I have tested it and it, like every video I don't do it on, I get
[02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:36.320]   like one fifth of views.
[02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:38.200]   Like humans just like those thumbnails.
[02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:41.000]   I think we've started doing your hat backward in one of them.
[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:44.320]   Oh my God, Renee, Renee, Renee, Renee.
[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:45.320]   What the hell's going on?
[02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:46.320]   What is that?
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:47.320]   What is that?
[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:48.320]   He's really trying too hard now.
[02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:50.720]   You're trying to treat people to think you're on a box therapy.
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:52.280]   That's what needs you, Renee.
[02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:54.960]   I felt like unboxing something the minute I was on that.
[02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:56.760]   I felt like unboxing something.
[02:24:56.760 --> 02:24:57.760]   It was unreal.
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:00.200]   Or yelling, what's up?
[02:25:00.200 --> 02:25:03.200]   I just like, it was either McKinnon or Lister.
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:04.320]   You're getting a lot of views.
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:06.000]   This is really good.
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:07.840]   This is really good.
[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:08.840]   Fantastic.
[02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:10.840]   No, it's been a nerve wracking 2020.
[02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:12.480]   I'm sure it has.
[02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:13.480]   Yeah.
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:18.880]   Honestly, Renee, the quality of the videos you've been doing, the level of service you've
[02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:23.520]   been extending to viewers and readers through these videos, that's one of the things that
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:29.120]   is one of the reasons why I did decide to maybe prematurely buy an M1 MacBook was that
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:31.360]   I really do want to start making videos again.
[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:34.840]   Now that I can see how it can be done like really, really well, which I couldn't figure
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:38.600]   out for myself and absolutely could not do that on a five-year-old Mac.
[02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:44.160]   But you're one of the channels that said, "Oh, that is an effective way to, if you've
[02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:47.880]   got a point of view and you feel as though it's valuable, there are people that are going
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:51.840]   to see it on video and they're not going to be able to read it or listen to it on a podcast."
[02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:55.080]   So that's how your channel is really great.
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:58.000]   Because I've decided never to do videos every day.
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:25:59.000]   Wait a second.
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:00.000]   I'm doing it.
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:03.000]   But Michael says my backwards hat is fine and not to hat shame me.
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:04.000]   So I'm seeing Michael.
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:05.000]   Michael is our fashion.
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:10.240]   The only thing I'll share before is if you're one of these people over the age of 18 who
[02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:11.240]   does this.
[02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:14.000]   Little sideways hat, little 45-degree angle.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:15.320]   That's a narc.
[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:16.320]   That's a narc.
[02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:17.320]   No kids.
[02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:18.640]   I'm really in high school.
[02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:19.640]   No, I'm not kidding.
[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:20.640]   Hello, fellow kids.
[02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:21.640]   Hello, fellow.
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:22.640]   Hello, fellow.
[02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:30.640]   Hey, before we go, I did actually launch the Silicon app on my, it's not even Big Sur.
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:38.680]   I'm running Mojave on a 2012 Mac mini and it does work nice.
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:42.480]   And I'm learning that I actually still have a lot of power PC until 32.
[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:44.040]   Oh, you're kidding.
[02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:45.040]   Oh, wow.
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:46.040]   What?
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:52.800]   Yeah, I've got an old audacity here and I've got, of course, my Lippa's camera firmware
[02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:53.800]   updater.
[02:26:53.800 --> 02:27:00.600]   The app that I haven't used for years that I used to use to connect the Firewire port
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:06.160]   of my Mac to the Firewire port on the back of my cable box to like record stuff off of
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:07.160]   it.
[02:27:07.160 --> 02:27:12.480]   Yeah, a lot of stuff that maybe is a little bit antique like George W. Bush era perhaps.
[02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:17.800]   Actually, I got fooled because I'm looking for an Emacs that will run and everybody say,
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:19.400]   oh, Emacs for Mac.
[02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:24.000]   So if you go to Emacs for Mac OS 10 and it says, look, universal binary.
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:28.920]   But what they meant was it's Intel and power PC.
[02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:32.400]   This is not an M1 universal binary.
[02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:35.520]   This is the old kind of universal binary.
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:36.520]   That's beautiful.
[02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:43.440]   That's exactly like when like you, you, you, you, you cheap out and like you, you don't
[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:47.600]   reread your car keeps failing, register, register registration.
[02:27:47.600 --> 02:27:51.600]   And so like finally, if you put off like re registering your plates long enough, like
[02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:54.120]   they go back to the green sticker.
[02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:56.240]   So you've got another four years.
[02:27:56.240 --> 02:27:57.240]   Amazing.
[02:27:57.240 --> 02:27:58.240]   It was low.
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:03.240]   So all these people who like thought they were out of the Mac business in 2004, you're
[02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:05.240]   back in baby.
[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:08.400]   All right, Lori Gill.
[02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:09.400]   Thank you.
[02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:11.560]   Godspeed have fun at Apple at the fruit company.
[02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:13.000]   We're going to miss you next week.
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:18.240]   Merlin, man, I'll be sitting in Lori's seat, a return of one of the, one of the original
[02:28:18.240 --> 02:28:20.720]   Mac break weekly members.
[02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:26.200]   We do this show every Tuesday, right after iOS today, make your, make your morning or
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:31.360]   your Tuesday, a Mac day, an Apple day with iOS today with me and Michael Sergeant, followed
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:35.280]   immediately by Mac break weekly.
[02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:36.280]   We try to start.
[02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:39.680]   We rarely make it, but we try to start 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:41.680]   That'd be about 1800 UTC.

[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:06.040]   In the case of this show, it's twit.tv/mbw.
[02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:09.640]   Look, we're going to have to get a new, a new picture there.
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:12.000]   I'm going to leave you there, Lori.
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:13.080]   I hope you don't mind.
[02:29:13.080 --> 02:29:16.120]   It does look like you're starting to leave the room in that picture.
[02:29:16.120 --> 02:29:18.840]   I must say, she's slowly edging her way out.
[02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:21.280]   You have to be looking up the joint.
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:22.280]   Twit.tv/mbw.
