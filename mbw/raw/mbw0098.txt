[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.480]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly and a big shoe.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.160]   A really big shoe, finally after weeks.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.960]   My name months.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.760]   Yeah, years of anticipation.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.160]   iPhone 3G is finally out and Scott Born is triumphant.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.120]   He is with us from the Apple phone show.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.560]   Also here, Andy Ennaco, who's happy because his new book
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.840]   is soon to be out.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.160]   Does it come out at the same time, Andy?
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.160]   Ah, yes.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.160]   We're on.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.280]   Fortunately, there was, or bad news for me, bad news for my sleep schedule.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.120]   There was such demand for it that it's been crashed on the schedule.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.640]   So I'm spending the entire month writing the update to iPhone fully loaded.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.880]   So basically, I've already tossed one chapter that got rewritten last week because of a
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.880]   cool new app.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.120]   So that's okay.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.120]   Onward and upward.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.360]   Well, I think we'll be talking a lot about the iPhone today, including apps.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.840]   And Mr. Merlin Mann is here as well.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.840]   Hello, Merlin from...
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.840]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.840]   How are you today?
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.960]   I'm a couple of folders and you look nice today.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.640]   And Alex Lindsay has a week off because he's teaching this week.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.280]   So how many of you got 3G's?
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.280]   We got one at the show.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.480]   I didn't get one personally.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.480]   You didn't.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.480]   You just upgraded your old?
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.120]   No, I'm not upgrading my old.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.120]   Oh, interesting.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.120]   Why not?
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.880]   Well, because I've got about 20 million emails from listeners going, "Hey, I upgraded my 1.0
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.560]   iPhone and it doesn't work.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.440]   And now I can't make cold to my grandma and can you help me?"
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.440]   That would be a bad thing.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.840]   Yeah, I'm tired of taking that risk because this is my only phone.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.360]   I don't even have a phone in my condo.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.360]   I rely on my phone.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.960]   So we got a brand new one, which we've tried just fine.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.520]   But we've heard everything from the upgrade to a 2.0 went flawless for some of the original
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.880]   iPhone owners down to, "Hey, it's still a brick, so I'm just not going to take that
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.880]   chance."
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.880]   Yeah, I'll blame you.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.640]   Andy, did you get the one Apple had promised you?
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.120]   Yes, I'm holding an Apple Apple phone right now.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.320]   It is next to...
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.400]   It's designated phone number three.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.240]   I'm using my band-a-lear of iPhones.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.000]   Probably I'll be buying one my own next week or the week after.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.880]   I still don't have my own SIM card in Apple's phone.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.880]   I can't use...
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.040]   I really can't use their phone for my calls.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.840]   But I'm waiting for the lines to thin out.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.600]   And also for a reason why I really want to be back in a mall in July.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.600]   And Merlin, what are you doing?
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.680]   Are you upgrading to stick with your old phone?
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.400]   How are you going to handle this?
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.120]   Yeah, I don't think it's going to happen.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.480]   Everything that I want is working great with the 2.0.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.960]   So you did upgrade to 2.0?
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.960]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.960]   I got in early.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.040]   I got in before everything broke on Friday and was able to reactivate before the surf
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.640]   feet of other people tried to reactivate.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.240]   Were you using a legitimate 2.0 or did you use that pre-release quote?
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.240]   Say legitimate.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.200]   No, I was on the one comma two version and then rolled back to one comma one after everything
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   calmed down.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.080]   So anyway, but I... it's like a champ and...
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.640]   No, there's just too many not that great things about the new phone, including the line.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.560]   But no, everything I've won is thrilled by the 2.0 upgrade.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.680]   It seems that a lot of the people that upgraded early Leo are the ones that are doing okay.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.880]   I upgraded my iPod Touch with the quote pre-release.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.360]   I don't know where this came from, probably some renegade developer.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.560]   Give up for somebody ward dialed.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.120]   I think they must have ward dialed the DMG out there or the IPSW and posted it on Mac
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.120]   Rimmers.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.120]   That's where I got it.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.120]   And it worked fine.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.360]   I had no trouble at all with a touch and the app stores working and everything.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.800]   But now I want to pay for it, but now the iTunes says, "Well, you don't need... you're
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.800]   already up to date."
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.800]   So I don't know.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.800]   I'm sure it's got porn.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.320]   I mean, you're saying people still have bricks after Friday, Sunday, Sunday, Wednesday
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.320]   in California right now.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.680]   They still have bricks that can reactivate.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.960]   They have 13 emails today about bricks.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.960]   It's problematic.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.320]   And of course, you can't get any help from Apple because they're like, "Stand in line."
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.760]   But I just wanted to see if you could stand in line.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.200]   But I just want to visit the stand in line.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.200]   So that's it.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.880]   In fact, Newport Beach, where I was this weekend, I was refused entry to an Apple store unless
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.920]   I wanted to buy a 3G Apple store.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.040]   Well, that's pretty funny because most of the stories you could get in if you weren't
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.480]   buying a phone.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.680]   If you were buying a phone, you had a wait in line.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.680]   That was my experience.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.960]   At Newport Beach, their policy was, "Unless you're buying a phone, you can't get in."
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.960]   Family was downtown on late Monday afternoon, actually kind of early Monday evening.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.440]   And we had to go to Creighton Barrel up at O'Farrell and Stockton.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.840]   And the line almost all the way...
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.920]   This is Monday at about 5, 6 p.m.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.120]   I think it was about 6 p.m.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.240]   And the line almost went all the way down to Creighton Barrel.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.760]   And the time that we had dinner and came back, actually saw Sean Carruthers while we were
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.760]   downtown.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.760]   Really?
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.760]   The line moved...
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.760]   San Francisco?
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.760]   Hey, it's visiting for one day.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.760]   Oh, how funny.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.760]   But it's great to get to meet the baby.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.800]   But the line moved literally about 11 feet in an hour.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.800]   It was unbelievable.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.400]   And I've got, "Hey, get listen to me, Scott.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.120]   My sources tell me that people at the Apple store are like, you know, it's definitely
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.240]   taking a pretty long time because...
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.240]   I had to...
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.240]   I didn't watch this video.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.560]   They must not have watched the video.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.800]   A lot of people weren't already and now I feel very guilty about it, to be honest with
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.800]   you.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.320]   You should have watched Todd.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.280]   I did actually get an email from people saying, "You idiot.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.160]   If people had only watched Todd more closely, they would have been ready."
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.200]   Because you just Todd, nobody paid attention to him and now look what happened.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.200]   Man.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.040]   It'll be in a Wikipedia entry like a thousand years from now.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:39.640]   The iPhone 2.0 launch was completely thwarted by Leerla Porte, the distad during the I-ready
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.640]   video.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.840]   Millions of people merely watched that video.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.840]   There would have been no line.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.080]   I'm so lucky because I walked into...
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.320]   I call my AT&T store on Saturday.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.600]   They'd sold out of the 80 phones they had allocated.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.080]   So I went up to Apple in Santa Rosa.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.080]   There was a line.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.360]   There were a few people ahead of me.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.360]   So I waited.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.360]   That was about half an hour.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.400]   By the time I got to the front of that, by the way, there were a lot more people.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.960]   And I walked in AT&T accepted within seconds.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.680]   There's two activation steps.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.640]   You have to get approval for a new AT&T account and then you have to hook it up to iTunes.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.280]   And then Apple says, "Okay."
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.480]   And both things took literally seconds.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.480]   And I was out the door.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.560]   So maybe I just went at the right time.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.560]   I don't know.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.680]   But I feel very fortunate because it worked fine for me.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.480]   The point of this though is that Apple is selling more phones this time around than
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.520]   they did last time.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:35.000]   And that's an indicator that people have so little anticipation of getting a good experience
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.760]   when buying a cell phone that they'll take this kind of crap and stand in line anyway.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.280]   You sound angry, Scott.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.280]   I was a mess.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.240]   Friday was just a lot of fun.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.680]   I'm disappointed for the first time since I've been an Apple customer.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.600]   I'm truly disappointed in the way they've handled this.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.320]   And I was a huge fan of 1.0 and took crap from everybody, including people on this panel
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.600]   for promoting the iPhone.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.840]   And guess what?
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.400]   I'm not a fanboy because I'll call a spade a spade.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.480]   They did a poor job.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.280]   As good a job as they did selling 1.0 where we literally got out of there in eight minutes,
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.880]   they've done that badly here.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.080]   But like I said, it doesn't matter.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.560]   They sold a million phones in a weekend.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.840]   They're probably going, "Hey, what's the problem?"
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.840]   Well, I think they're connected.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.240]   I think the fact that they had an unexpected...
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.200]   We never did get the number for the first weekend of iPhone 1.0, but it was something
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.160]   like 700,000.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.920]   So they literally sold 30%, no, almost 50% more.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.280]   I think that's why I don't think they expected this.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.080]   I thought they thought maybe we'll sell half a million.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.880]   They just didn't expect the demand.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.360]   It's so difficult to watch.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:43.560]   If you watch the WWDC keynote and you saw how nicely all of these pieces fit together,
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.560]   right?
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.760]   You come on over to happen because here's what's going to happen.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.600]   Your music is going to be on your phone.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.920]   Your contacts are going to be synced with your computer.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.120]   You're going to have this incredibly well integrated experience where you don't have
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.440]   to keep thinking about where your stuff is.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.360]   We're going to take care of you.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.360]   I'm not here.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.920]   I thought you knew that was crazy.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.600]   That's the Steve Jobs reality distortion.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.720]   What I'm trying to say is that this was...
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.960]   I'm not saying this in a way to be mean.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.480]   I'm just saying it was a terrible missed opportunity because this was a day that a lot
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.080]   of people were walking into an Apple experience for the first time because they bought into
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.240]   a huge amount of hype about all of this crap.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.240]   God bless them.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.360]   They went in and said, "Okay, here's my money."
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.040]   They walked out with a fundamentally broken experience on every level.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.640]   That's a terrible lost opportunity that they won't get back.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.760]   Well, I can't say I disagree with you on that.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.400]   You should have been able to flip that on and have your stuff synced and it would just
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.400]   work.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.400]   I still haven't synced my stuff.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.480]   Mobile mode is still malfunctioning.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.280]   Everything that we've done in the past, for the most part, with Apple has worked like that.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.120]   The reason I'm such an Apple fan is I don't want to take time debugging things just to
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.120]   get them to start.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.560]   I want to be able to plug stuff in and have it work.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.560]   I've usually got them in that experience.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.360]   That's why people pay what they do.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.240]   That's part of the reason I feel like I'll pay a premium to Apple because they deliver
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.240]   the goods.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.200]   Again, I hate to sign up piling on because this is still a company that I admire and
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.840]   love.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.000]   It's just really a shame.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.280]   A lot of people work really hard.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.560]   People who had nothing to do with the scale issues.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.160]   People who, friends of mine who worked on the mobile projects really busted their ass
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.160]   for months.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.080]   It all just melted down in this day.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.960]   We're not talking about a ferry explosion in Hudson Bay here.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.920]   It's the same in 2000 lives.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.600]   We're talking about a problem where there was so much demand and we had a system for
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:31.440]   initializing phones that didn't anticipate that sort of demand.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.360]   By the time everybody who was, all the first timers are in and out of the store, it's
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.560]   going to be pretty much a good set of normal.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.520]   Mobile Me was, this is the first time I've ever gotten a mass mailing from Apple that
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.720]   started off with God, we're sorry this all happened.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.720]   No, that's shitting.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.960]   That's definitely a landmark happening.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.520]   But let's ding Apple for what we need to ding Apple for, but let's not repeat the mistakes
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.320]   that have been made on the nightly news for the past three days.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.080]   They're saying, "Oh, well, technical problems, plagued Apple's launch of iPhone 2.0."
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.240]   What's incorrect about that?
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.400]   I couldn't touch .Mac for two days.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.720]   That's what people use that so that they can have their email.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.760]   What's incorrect about that being a ferry crash, if you're the person who can't get
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.360]   their email, it damn sure is a ferry crash.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.360]   You can get to your email?
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.040]   I could get to my damn email.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.200]   I could get to my damn contacts.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.200]   I could get to the damn internet.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.440]   I could get to the damn app store.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.720]   I could get to every damn feature that's inside or iPhone 2.0.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.360]   If he's going to .com, your email?
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.120]   I've been able to use .Mac for every four days.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.760]   On Thursday afternoon, you'd use .Mac.com.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.120]   No, it was down on Thursday afternoon.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.960]   It was down on Friday.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.880]   I wasn't checking my mail then, but it wasn't this the same panel who basically almost had
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.600]   t-shirts made with every slogan about how much we hate .Mac and never use it and don't
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.440]   think it's a good buy for anybody.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.080]   And so releasing it was a new logo, same type of stuff, and improve it.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.320]   I'm a .Mac user.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:57.600]   I just had hoped that this was going to be the improvement we all hope for and to the
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.600]   mobile me thing.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.600]   That's still happening.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.920]   I just think it's really cynical to act like this wasn't a huge problem because a lot
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.800]   of people who depend on this, people who came to Apple and trust them with a huge amount
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.240]   of their data, suddenly don't have access to it without explanation.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.240]   I don't think that's...
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.240]   I think we talked about so many phones.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.960]   This is the email that Apple sent out.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.600]   Mobile me services are now available, sort of.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.240]   We've recently completed the transition from .Mac to mobile me.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.560]   Unfortunately, it was a lot rockier than we had hoped.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.760]   I think Apple should be praised for coming.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.360]   I was kind of shocked when they said that.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.360]   They invited it.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.360]   Very awesome.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.080]   Yeah, I mean, it was a rockier.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:37.800]   Although core services such as mail, IDISK, sync back to my Mac and gallery went relatively
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.800]   smoothly.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.880]   The new mobile me web apps had lots of problems initially.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.160]   Fortunately, we've worked through those problems and the web apps are now up and running another
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.160]   snag.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.720]   This is one that pissed off a lot of people.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.880]   It didn't bother me so much, but it's a terminology issue.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.960]   Another snag we've run into is our use of the word push in describing everything under
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.240]   the mobile me umbrella while all email contact or calendar changes on the iPhone and the
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.120]   web apps are immediately synced to and from the mobile me cloud.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.040]   That's been my experience.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:09.320]   Things made on a Mac or a PC, in other words, on your computer are not pushed.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.040]   They take up to 15 minutes to sync with the cloud and your other devices.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:17.440]   Even though things are indeed instantly pushed to and from your phone and the web apps, we
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.480]   are going to stop using the word push until it is near instant on PCs and Macs too.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.280]   It's clearly pull on a PC or a Mac.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:32.360]   You have to sync and nothing happens to you sync and they're admitting it.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.360]   Which is nice.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.960]   It would have been nice if they admitted it while Schiller was on stage.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.440]   Well, I don't know if they knew.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.440]   Did they know?
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.440]   How could they have known?
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.920]   I mean, that's a term that means something.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.680]   Oh, I see what the push thing is.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.160]   Enterprise market calling something push has a meaning that people understand.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.400]   And then they did give everybody a 30-day extension.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.400]   I think they handled that really well.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.720]   I felt classy for them to like, it was very classy for them to pony up and go, "Hey,
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.720]   look, we got this wrong."
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.280]   I thought that was super cool of them.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:04.120]   I was proud of them for doing that and I was disappointed as much as I was proud of them
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.120]   for doing that.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.720]   I was disappointed that they haven't even said boo about what's happened with the iPhone
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.920]   launch, with people being bricked during the upgrade with the problem.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.560]   Has there been nothing from Apple on the bricking?
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.840]   Because that is really a more serious problem.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.840]   Not a single.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.400]   I've sent emails to their press contacts.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:28.760]   No response nor has my ability to search the Googles resulted in one single press release
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:35.960]   or official word from Apple of any kind on anything related to the launch other than
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:41.080]   its usual Raw Raw story so-and-so loves the iPhone.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:46.640]   I think if they'd done the very same thing they did for the mobile meet mess up with
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.560]   related to the upgrades, problems, and stuff like that, then I don't think any of us would
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.920]   be sitting here talking anything bad about them.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.400]   We'd be saying, "Hey, they did a great job and it is a tough job."
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:00.040]   Andy's got a- I think the point you're trying to get to is it isn't the end of the world
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.040]   and it isn't.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.960]   Leo's point that it's probably caused by the success of the phone.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.400]   That's certainly valid.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:10.280]   But you've got to say, "What if we're going to be terribly successful?"
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:16.360]   If you went to the restaurant in town and they never had a seat ever after a year or
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.360]   you bought it-
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.760]   This is only four days.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.800]   But they're still lying last night, Leo.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.200]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.200]   There's still only four days.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.240]   There's more demand than they expected.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.840]   I don't think- I had no activation.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.840]   I don't know if they're having activation difficulties.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.240]   I still- I didn't have any activation difficulty.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:42.840]   Andy, you were giving the rundown of degrees of pain.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.160]   Yeah, I mean, I have one friend.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:51.000]   I think you know, her too, she colors comic books for DC Comics and she uses .Mac galleries
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   to show her editors.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Here's what I'm doing.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.200]   Go grab these proofs and see what's going on.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.800]   So obviously, that's a feature that I never use outside of an academic sense, you know,
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.160]   just as a reviewer, but it's her whole life.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.320]   The only point I was trying to make is that I'm not trying to minimize the disruptions
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.160]   that .Mac had for a lot of people.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.120]   All I'm saying is that I really felt like there was a lot of piling on that says this
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:17.480]   is a horrible, flawed launch that's left to- someone has found a big, long hair and
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.440]   somebody's soup and now I'm never going back to this restaurant again.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:25.400]   I mean, I've had two separate iPhone experiences granted I never had to go to a store to pick
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:30.200]   up this iPhone 2.0, but I did download the 2.0 software for my existing hardware and
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.400]   I was out for about six hours before the activation problem settled.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.080]   And still, I feel as though the iPhone has been completely reinvented for me with the
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.440]   2.0 operating system.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.200]   So I'm nothing but happy about the events of the weekend.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.320]   I don't think there's anything wrong with separating those two issues.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.000]   I have nothing but, first of all, I want to be super clear about what I'm saying.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.480]   I have nothing but great things to say about iPhone 2.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.640]   I'm very happy with the work that the Mac, formerly.Mac folks have done.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.800]   And I think it's as a company, I feel ridiculous that I even have to say this, but I obviously
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.040]   it's a company I have a huge amount of respect and admiration and fondness for.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.280]   I think what I am trying to say is if you want to play with the big boys and you want
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.360]   to start throwing around words like enterprise and then email goes down for two days, you
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.880]   have to stand up and say you ate the booger.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.320]   And to just say, oh well, I don't use this functionality, well then they shouldn't advertise
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.320]   it.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.680]   If this isn't going to work, then you shouldn't charge me $100 a year for it and it's stormy.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.560]   This is the Apple we know that was working with Microsoft Exchange Server?
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.560]   Probably yeah.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.080]   I think people with Exchange Server weren't having any trouble.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.080]   But this is the Apple we've known back to my Mac never worked.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.840]   It took a year for back to my Mac to work.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.840]   Apple never acknowledged that.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.480]   I mean, I think that this is not unusual with Apple.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.320]   This is a very public failure, however.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.240]   Well, you know, it's the same problem.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.520]   It's like the first time you see daddy drinking a little bit too much.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.500]   It's like you don't like to think that your dad is the sort of person who can get over
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.800]   served at the local tavern.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.800]   But sometimes it happens.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.800]   It's not something.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:55.800]   Go ahead.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.800]   Sorry.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.800]   I apologize.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.800]   I cut you off.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.800]   I just want super fast thought.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.760]   And this is just something that's been on my mind the last couple of weeks.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.760]   And it's so funny because I certainly have been somebody who's been super glib and lazy
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.440]   about making Microsoft jokes in the past.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.800]   And I've done it for years because it was always the fashion.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.960]   But you know what's funny?
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:16.160]   It's funny to watch companies I love and theoretically thought we're the opposite of Microsoft,
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:22.200]   like Google and Apple, watching them in ways that are clearly very painful for the folks
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.400]   who've been there for a while, watching them face the same problems that Microsoft faces.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.120]   And I start to think, you know what?
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.880]   It's not just because Microsoft has halitosis and is full of stupid people.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.160]   It's because working with a big company and a huge installed base is really, really hard.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.080]   And once you have to start playing defense and being having 100% uptime, stuff gets super
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.280]   duper hard.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.160]   And so I just think it's an interesting, like maybe when it's a ton of time to go into
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.160]   it in a lot of detail today.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:49.600]   It's very interesting to look at what happens when you decide to make it theoretically a
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.880]   10x jump in the number of bodies that you're trying to support who are going to be all
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.360]   hitting your server at the same time to get an update.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.960]   What do you do with that volume of affection for what you do?
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.600]   And I just think it's interesting because in the past I used to think, oh well, Microsoft
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.160]   obviously they're a bunch of fascist dumbasses, which, you know, I don't think that's--
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.400]   No, it's a hard thing to do what they're doing.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.400]   I agree with you.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.400]   95 thought that.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.400]   And I got to be honest.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.200]   I think it's something Apple is going to face and I think it's really something Google is
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.200]   going to face.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:21.760]   I got to tell you though, this is-- the other side of the story is you're going to hear
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.160]   people start going, oh, those Apple winers, you know?
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.160]   Oh, there they go.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.000]   They didn't get their push.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.840]   Oh, wine, wine, wine.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.360]   And I think you're going to hear a lot of that too.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:36.560]   I think it-- you know, first you hear this champion of the iPhone.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.760]   Everybody's so excited about the iPhone.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.320]   And then it comes out and they end up-- you know, people-- Apple customers will turn on
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.880]   the dime if you don't fulfill their every whim.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.600]   You know, I take a little bit of umbrage with that.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.720]   I think within the case of something like push, I think we all have to agree that words
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.880]   have meanings.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.840]   And I think, you know, and I think just in fairness, this does not change anything.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.080]   I mean, I've come from nothing.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.080]   Yeah, but really, Merlin, 15 minutes?
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.600]   15 minutes of what?
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.240]   Well, I mean, the difference is, okay, I update my calendar on my phone.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.240]   It goes right to mobile me instantly.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.200]   I updated on my Macintosh.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.600]   It takes 15 minutes or however long I've set the sick-- I could sync right now.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.600]   It would go.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.120]   I mean, if I told you-- if I told you-- if I told you-- well, let me put it this way.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.520]   If I sold you a car and told you it had six cylinders, but then it had four and I said,
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.320]   you don't need more than four, what's your problem?
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.400]   You'd say, you know what?
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.960]   You just lied to me to tell me something.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:29.120]   I think it was good to get rid of that word because the, you know, the IT guys-- Merlin's
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.120]   right.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.760]   I mean, I get this email all the time.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:36.160]   I mean, when the first iPhone came out and they talked about the Yahoo mail push, I had
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:41.560]   these guys writing me three four-page emails going on and on and on with technical description
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.120]   to push and blah, blah, blah, blah, and it just made my ears bleed.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.880]   So I think it was good to get rid of that word just because it takes that off the table.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:56.200]   And now what we have to do is we have to address the issues of, you know, the bugginess
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.440]   that's caused by too many apps.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.120]   This is the very thing I warned about with one point on why I thought it was a good decision
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.840]   for Apple to not let third-party apps on the phone originally.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.400]   The people right now that are having these apps are crashing like crazy.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.840]   They're just a good 20 and 30 app on the phone and that's the problem.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.840]   Even the good ones.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.840]   I mean, I've had crashes in probably six or eight different applications that I use
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.440]   a lot at totally random places.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.320]   Every single one of them that I've used, every single one has reset the phone at one point
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.880]   or another or just died.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.320]   I think in the horizontal lines and you kind of seize up.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.880]   Oh, I mean, I don't know what the issue is.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.200]   I thought Apple was going to vet these more carefully.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.000]   I guess they really wanted to have a full store when people came there.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.680]   Look, these apps are great.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.200]   There are some amazing games.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   We're going to talk.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.560]   Our picks are all going to be iPhone picks.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.000]   There's some amazing location-based software.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.240]   I'm totally satisfied, but then I didn't have a long line.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.720]   I didn't get bricked.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:57.680]   I didn't care that much about the difference between push and pull on my calendar.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.240]   I still haven't been able to sync my calendar up to a mobile me.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.240]   It just won't let me go.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.240]   Really?
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.240]   It works great for me.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.040]   That's sinking though, is normal, right?
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.720]   It's you always have some problem or other.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.720]   That's just the way it is.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.840]   I can live with that.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.600]   Should we have a unicorn chaser and talk about some of the apps we like?
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.560]   We will talk about the apps we like in a little bit.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.560]   Love the apps.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.560]   Don't get too excited.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.120]   Don't get too excited.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.880]   I guess another question is why are all these people buying iPhones?
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.720]   What happened?
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:32.040]   This was a big surprise when I did that 24 hours of iPhone broadcast was the lines.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.800]   There was nobody in line at midnight.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:40.720]   Then suddenly it's 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. the lines swelled to larger sizes and they had been
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.880]   for the previous launch.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:42.880]   What happened?
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:43.880]   Why did that happen?
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:47.560]   It must be because the buy in price going down.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.560]   It got normal people.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.320]   It got the not the cult of the Mac, but normal people got sucked in by the prices.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.080]   They didn't care that they were actually going to pay more for this phone than they
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:59.920]   would the first one over two years because that's the mindset of the American public.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:05.840]   In the old days they used to sell brand new cars at $39 a month before the laws changed
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.640]   without any mention of the total selling price.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.560]   Everybody said, "Hey, I can afford $39 a month."
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.440]   Everybody knows a phone is going to cost you thousands of dollars over the year.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.600]   They people their two years, they know that.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.040]   Look, every phone, give me a phone that doesn't end up costing you a lot more.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.000]   That's just it, but see they don't stop and think about that.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.320]   They say, "I got $100 bucks to help."
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.640]   I think this is a freakin'omics thing.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.280]   I think the freakin'omics guys should talk about this because I think it's very much a
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.200]   perception thing and it's the same reason that gas doesn't cost $5 a gallon.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.680]   It costs $4.99 a gallon.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.480]   It's all the stuff that goes on in your cognition that I think they're really playing on with
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.640]   that number.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:44.640]   You think that the reason they suddenly lines is because new people can't—what percentage
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.640]   do you think of upgrading users, what percentage of new users?
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.640]   Any guesses to that?
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.640]   I don't think Apple's said anything.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.640]   Black the new users.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.640]   Pardon me?
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.480]   I saw in the Apple line and the folks that I saw in the people that I talked to, there
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.840]   were a lot of new users.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.840]   I think Apple had a few.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.800]   We interviewed 100 people in line at the San Francisco store, like 90 of them had never
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.800]   bought an iPhone.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.760]   That actually is to what you were saying, Merlin, which is this is Apple's chance to talk to
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.360]   a whole new audience and show them what a great company they are.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.800]   That's why I don't mean it as a pile-on.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.720]   I mean it as in that's our Hindenburg because that was the day that they had the chance
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.480]   for everything to go perfectly.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.360]   Have you ever walked into an Apple store?
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.640]   What's your usual experience in an Apple store?
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:25.840]   For me, it's like you walk in and for most of the time, there's a really smart, bright-eyed
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.240]   person with a little gadget or hand that goes, "Can I run your credit card and help you
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.640]   get out of here in record time?
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.040]   You want me to email you?"
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.040]   And then you go and you've emailed you.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.440]   Like I said, I just had the experience at our Apple store a couple of weeks ago that
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.680]   was sterling.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.920]   I went in there and these guys treated me like a prince.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.680]   I think it's a shame that instead those Scott describes it sounding like something from Hogan's
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.680]   heroes.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.000]   I think that's a pity because that's really what Apple's selling is, that kind of high
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   touch service.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   But isn't this just a blip?
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.680]   Tomorrow, is it going to be okay?
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.800]   Don't you think?
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:00.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:01.800]   Is that addressed to me?
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.800]   Well, yeah.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.880]   Well, you know, I think on the one hand, yes, absolutely.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.480]   I mean, in the end, what really matters, what really matters is that you, you know,
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.320]   next month, it's going to be fine.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.760]   Well, yeah, it will.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:13.920]   It'll settle down.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.920]   But I mean, I don't know.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.800]   I think this is just a mode that I'm in right now.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:24.040]   And I guess just right now, I guess I'm feeling kind of sensitive to two different sets of
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.360]   reality coming out, depending on how much attention is focused on something.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.320]   And I'm very troubled with the huge amount of hype that went into this versus the execution.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:35.360]   And I think that I think in the end, I'm sorry to say this, and I hope nobody that I love
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.440]   is affected by my saying this, I think it was sloppy.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.600]   Well, I have to say, I don't think this is anything new for Apple.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.240]   I think they've done this before.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.320]   I bring up Mac to my Mac, another example, which, you know, never worked.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:51.920]   I mean, there are a lot of issues with stuff that Apple comes out with that doesn't work.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.160]   This is a big, bigger stage they're playing on.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.840]   Maybe this is a coming of age for Apple.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.840]   It will go away.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.600]   I think it's been, I think it's not, I think it's not so much a big deal in that it's an
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.600]   isolated case.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:09.200]   But if the next Mac Pro comes out and has a bunch of problems or the next monitor comes
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.520]   out and has a bunch of problems or, you know, they start to see us kind of.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:17.280]   If that starts to happen, then we're all going to have to say, we've got to be on
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:21.200]   the honest and say, you know, our Apple loyalty could be misplaced if that would happen.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.680]   I don't think it's going to happen.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.200]   Like I said, I want to reiterate, I have faith in the company.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.000]   I think they're doing a good job.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.560]   And I think that obviously they've done something right because a record number of people wanted
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.360]   to buy their phone in the first weekend.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.680]   I think that that's really, you know, that's, that is important.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.880]   The more I think about it, Leo, you're right, those two events are so tied together that
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.560]   they start to mitigate one another.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:47.520]   I'm going to please some listeners and piss off others by making a Simpsons reference.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.800]   How can I piss anybody off?
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:54.080]   I'm guessing that our demographic does include people who watch the Simpsons.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:58.920]   And I think that let's call a new indicator, the Simpsons effect, that when you have so
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:04.600]   much love for a certain thing, be it a commercial product or whatever, you start to expect that
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.560]   every single experience you have with that is going to be as good as the best experience
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.000]   you've ever had with that.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.720]   So when you see a bad episode of the Simpsons, when you realize that, you know, out of 22
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:17.040]   episodes over the course of a year, there are six absolutely perfect ones.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.040]   They're 10 that are good and they're six that are just terrible.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:24.800]   Suddenly you start to wonder if this franchise is starting to nose dive, if that that isn't
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.800]   it.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.680]   Apple has always had bad products.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.640]   Apple has always had in successful launches.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:34.120]   Apple has always had incidents in which they have made it very clear accidentally to that
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.720]   they don't really care about their users or they don't really care about developers.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.080]   These are things that every company goes through.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.280]   They have ups, they have downs, they have hits, they have misses.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.480]   One of the problems that Apple and the Simpsons has to face is that people expect both of
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:51.600]   these franchises to be perfect 100% of the time and they never promised to be perfect
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.600]   100% of the time.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:57.440]   I don't think that the launch of the Mac Pro or the next monitor or their next Mac books
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.400]   are going to have these sort of problems.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.440]   For the simple reason that neither of them involve lots of people hammering a server all
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:07.920]   at once at the same hour of the same day to activate the new monitor.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.440]   Nonetheless, I'm very certain that there are going to be a new, every time Apple comes
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:16.480]   out with a brand new portable Mac, you never buy the first version of any new portable
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:21.520]   Mac because there's always that one little solder, little trace that's always a little
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:25.760]   bit close to the FPU or something that causes really, really bad numbers to spit out of
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.280]   the grill at the wrong point during your demonstration.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.520]   You always wait for the second version when they kick out all the bugs.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:38.840]   If I only have one thing to say about this is that we should always remember that Apple
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.440]   is not going to be perfect all the time.
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.680]   When have you only heard that one thing is saying anything?
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.200]   I got some banana pudding that I made last night.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.520]   I think I joined my banana pudding now.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:55.120]   I really, if you call the fac slime, we'll have the recipe for Andy Naught goes, "cripples
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.120]   sweet banana pudding."
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.920]   I think you put that very well, but there's another point to this that I just want to underscore,
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:05.160]   which is we also expect people to do what they say they're going to do.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:09.040]   I think that when people don't do what they say they're going to do or when they over-promise,
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:13.040]   I think it's not out of line for the people who have stepped up for them in the past to
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.000]   say, "Hey, listen, tell me a little bit about what went wrong.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.280]   Help me understand why Scott Borne, my friend Scott, is getting help emails from people
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:26.240]   who he persuaded to buy this because our sweat over 15 years or 20 years also has kind of
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.240]   gone into this.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:31.280]   Apple too, Apple's not communicative historically.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.520]   They're not the company that steps forward and says, "Maya, Colpa, that's why that email
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.520]   is so amazing."
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.000]   This is why they need a blog.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.360]   They need somebody who, I'm not scoble, but somebody who's empowered, somebody who's empowered
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.800]   to speak for the company and to say an insane...
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.520]   Do you realize how fired that person would be with him?
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.440]   Steve Jobs would never allow that.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.440]   No, I know.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.440]   That was one of the things that I think this is why this is why I'm going to work for it.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:01.880]   That would be the shortest road trip to career disenfranchisement in history.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:02.880]   This is not just corporate culture.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.880]   This is where a blog makes sense for a company.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.880]   It does.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.880]   It does.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:07.880]   It does.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.880]   They just don't care.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.880]   I mean, they're...
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.560]   As all the companies I deal with on a PR basis, they are the hardest to deal with, the least
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.560]   communicative.
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.480]   They don't even respond most of the time.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.560]   And they know we have a big audience, but they don't care.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.320]   I don't think it has anything to do with that.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.320]   They're just...
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.320]   They're corporate culture.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.320]   They just don't.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.320]   They're not communicative.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.320]   When you learn that it's...
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.680]   I mean, you talk to anybody who's worked at any company that Steve's ever touched, and
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.160]   you learn that that company is...
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.440]   I mean, I don't want to turn this into a personality thing, but accept that it is a personality
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.040]   thing, which is that it's Steve's company.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.880]   Anybody who works there will tell you...
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.880]   Excuse me.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.840]   Every significant decision they have to make, they're going to...
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.600]   Hey, they're going to parse that in their mind.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.600]   What would Steve think about this?
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.400]   And then, B, they're still going to make sure that it's the right thing to do before they
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.400]   do it.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.400]   Right.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.800]   I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.880]   I just think things in general could be improved by communication.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.880]   I mean, once again...
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:02.520]   He can be apparently, it can be a very capricious guy, where it can be a little bit crazy sometimes
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.520]   to work out.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:07.520]   Well, I understand, except that if you look at the track record, the overall Apple success,
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:12.840]   I mean, just today, I noticed that Apple continues to climb on the Fortune 500.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.960]   They're somewhere around 337.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.200]   They keep easing up there.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.760]   They keep easing up in market share.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:23.560]   You can say what you want about the guy, but he's driven the car to the finish line so
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:28.040]   many times in first place that I don't know...
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.280]   Certainly, the shareholders don't care.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:36.960]   It is frustrating to us, of course, since we report on it that they won't talk to us.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.960]   But...
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.960]   I don't care about that.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.880]   Hey, I do have to say though, Merlin, I think you hit the nail on the head.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.280]   I think Apple is now having big company problems.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.040]   And this is what happens as you grow, you become a Microsoft.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.480]   You have to start having big company problems, and that's exactly what you're seeing here.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.560]   Do you remember when you were young?
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:58.040]   I don't know if you're like me, but when I was young, I remember having a thought that
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:01.040]   only really makes sense to me now in retrospect, and of course, it doesn't really make sense.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:04.680]   But as a child, I remember thinking, "God, old people are so stupid.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.880]   What did they do to become so weak?"
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.880]   And now we're the old people.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.880]   I know.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.080]   But yeah, but when you're a kid, you go like that.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.080]   They're so...
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.080]   You can dump.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.080]   What's wrong with that?
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.080]   That's wrong with it.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.560]   And now I'm one of them, and I go, "Wow, you know, it's not something that just happens
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.560]   to you because you're stupid.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.920]   It's something that happens to everybody if you're around long enough."
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.680]   And I think that's what you're saying.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.080]   There's that famous quote by Mark Twain.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.080]   When I was 14 years old, I thought my old man was a dumbest man alive.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:34.400]   When I was 21 years old, I thought, "My God, he's learned so much in the past seven years."
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.920]   My kids are at the first stage, by the way, of that.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.840]   I think that this is the kind of thing that happens to big companies.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.960]   I've seen it happen to so many companies before.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.440]   The real test for Apple will be how they respond.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.800]   I think the email is a good start.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.520]   I sure like to hear what they have to say about breaking and how they go forward, you
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:54.520]   know?
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:55.920]   And if they can keep people happy, they've got...
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.240]   Look, they've got a great product.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:01.840]   I don't think there's any question among any of us that the iPhone 2 is a great product.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.320]   I don't know if it's so much of a great product that you need to abandon your iPhone 1.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.840]   I think you're right, Scott Bourne.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.920]   Just upgrading to 2.0 is really all you need to do.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.400]   All you need is the App Store.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:16.520]   I'm not that overwhelmed by the GPS because the location-based stuff in even the old iPhone
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.560]   and the iPod Touch is fine for what we wanted.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.560]   That's great.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.080]   Yeah, it does a great job.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.080]   And I don't know...
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.560]   I don't have 3G in Petaluma, so it wouldn't make any difference to me anyway.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.560]   So by the way...
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:31.880]   I've heard different reports from different folks who did not hear our episode about
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.520]   going and checking the map.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.240]   And there's a lot of folks who stood in line.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:39.360]   I mean, it's just like a big old disappointment hoe-g-y for a lot of people.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.480]   So many things went wrong and...
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.600]   Or not not went wrong, but I'll just say, let's just say things.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:47.080]   You know, you have a bad day and it's not anybody's fault, but you just had a bad day.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.840]   There's a lot of people who had a bad day because after going through that line and
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:53.480]   giving their Social Security number and going through all of that, they went home and the
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.480]   little E came up.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.480]   It's really disappointing.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.360]   God, I thought I was going to...
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.760]   And then I still can't make a call from my room.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:01.760]   It's really disappointing.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:06.240]   I had the 3G when I was...
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.320]   I bought the phone in Santa Rosa and I'm driving home and I'm watching it and I'm watching
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.040]   it and I'm watching it and it gets slow.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.280]   That was so sad.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.240]   And there's an E, just an E.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.080]   But I use the Wi-Fi a lot.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.960]   You know, I got the phone because you know, you need to have the new thing.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:26.200]   But I really do think my advice would be to anybody who has an iPod Toucher at 1.0, just
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:30.320]   upgrade to 2.0 because the applications are really what makes this special.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.240]   And still no cut and paste, by the way.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:36.520]   If they put cut and paste in, I'd forgive them everything.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.720]   Jaws says that that was a low priority, by the way.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:44.880]   Yeah, I did want to point out that a couple of the prominent analysts have said that actually
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:49.680]   today have downgraded RIM to underperform from whole.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:50.680]   Interesting.
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:51.880]   Well RIM has to come back.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:56.920]   This bold and the thunder that two new Blackberries have really got to come back strong.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.040]   And they are having problems of their own, according to internal reports.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.120]   Well, and I'll tell you something.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:07.920]   I'm deactivating my Blackberry and going to the iPhone 2 because the applications were
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.920]   what I was waiting for.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:13.240]   The reason I stayed with the Blackberry, I wanted the ability to add third party applications.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:20.040]   There are such incredible, the gaming on this thing absolutely lives up to its promise
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.040]   and then some.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.000]   We're going to talk about our picks in a little bit.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.800]   But before we do, I do have a couple of things I want to mention.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.280]   First of all, I want to say hello to Drobo.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.080]   They hello to Drobo.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.280]   They were off for a couple of weeks because they had a big announcement.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:37.280]   Now you all know FireWire 800 on the second generation Drobo.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.280]   That is fantastic.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:43.480]   USB 2.0, faster speeds, cooler, quieter operation.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.520]   And we've got a new offer for you.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.880]   An instant $25 off.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:53.720]   This is $25 off the purchase of one of two Drobo's, the original Drobo, USB Drobo or
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.720]   the new FireWire 800.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.200]   Of course, they dropped the price quite a bit on the original Drobo.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:03.640]   If you've drooled over Drobo in the past, now you can get the original Drobo at a great
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:04.640]   deal.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:10.280]   Go to Drobo, DROBO.com/MacBreak for this offer.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:13.920]   I suppose we should explain what the Drobo is.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:18.680]   It is an external disc on steroids.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.680]   It's like a raid only.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:20.680]   It's not a raid.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:21.680]   Yeah, it's not a raid.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.680]   Well, I'll give you a great example.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.360]   My Drobo, I use it like crazy.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.840]   I don't use, you could use it with Time Machine, but I just use other backup software and I
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.880]   fill it up with everything that comes on my machine.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.400]   I've got copies of because it's so huge.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.400]   I finally fill it up.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.640]   There's only, you know, it's so funny.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.440]   I got the, you know, there's indicators on it.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.440]   So it's green.
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.440]   There's four drives in it.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.680]   There's green, green, green, green if you've got plenty of room.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.520]   Then it goes to orange when you start to fill any one of those drives up.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.520]   I've never seen red.
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.800]   I got red because there's only 48 gigs left.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.440]   Oh no.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.440]   That's how big this thing is.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.520]   48 gigs left.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.600]   So, but this is the beauty of it.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.960]   I've had this Drobo for a year, year, when did they come out a year and a half ago, two
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.960]   years ago?
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:04.080]   I've had it since the day they came out and then drives were, you know, smaller.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.920]   So I only had smaller drives.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:10.200]   I just bought a 750 gig drive from Newegg for a hundred bucks.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.960]   I bought two of them.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.800]   And so what you do is you take, you can only do one at a time.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:18.280]   So I take out one of the drives, put the new 750 and all of a sudden expanding it'll
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.280]   rebuild automatically.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.800]   I don't have to do anything.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.000]   Think any, no data loss.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.800]   Once that drive is accepted, I'll put the second in there and I'm going to add another
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:30.120]   terabyte to my Drobo just like that for a couple of hundred bucks.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.400]   This is an amazing device for backup.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.960]   The USB versions we are going for 349.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.760]   So with the 25 bucks off, that's even better deal.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.240]   And by the way, don't be worried about the USB.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.520]   If you're just purely using this as backup, it's fine.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.400]   Here's if it takes an extra hour.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.720]   Now I started using the firewire version as a primary drive.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.360]   Do you notice it's much faster?
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.640]   I actually did test.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.760]   I was lucky enough to have a beta unit and I did test.
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:00.400]   And what's interesting about this company is they gave me the specs and I said, "Bann,
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.560]   that's an impressive jump."
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.800]   And I tested it and was actually better.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.800]   Wow.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.280]   It was actually better than what they promised.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.280]   I got more than--
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.280]   What do you use to test that?
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.280]   I'm curious.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.280]   I copied TIFF files.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.280]   Okay.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.800]   So you're just watching kind of watching it go.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:19.280]   No, actually what I did was I used the clock, the stopwatch, and I timed it using the original
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.280]   Drobo.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.760]   And then I did the same-- I mean, I don't have fancy test equipment.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:23.760]   No, just curious.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:28.880]   Because the last time I used that hard drive benchmarking tool was on probably eight.
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:29.880]   And I was just curious.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.320]   I do kind of want to try it a little less.
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.520]   I just did seconds.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:36.080]   And I found incredible performance increases.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.080]   By the way, the 800 is 400 compatible.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:44.120]   It has the dual 800 ports on the back, which meets the full firewire 800 spec.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.560]   So it is a big step up.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:50.920]   But if you don't need that, the 349 minus $25-- It's a good deal.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.280]   It does work with time machine, bootable backups, whatever you need.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.280]   Drobo's got it.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.440]   It's a great choice.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:03.040]   Go to drob.com/macbreak for $25 off either the original Drobo now at a reduced price
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:06.600]   or the new second generation Drobo offer good through August 31, 2008.
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:12.080]   We thank Drobo so much for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.080]   There is other news.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.120]   Real quickly, before we get to our picks, I'm really excited about the picks.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:20.120]   I think this is where the application store makes such a difference.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:24.320]   Now, when you meet somebody and you see the iPhone, the first thing out of your mouth,
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.560]   what do you like, what applications?
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.760]   And this is just the beginning, right?
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.360]   Presumably, there are going to be many, many more applications coming out all the time.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.360]   So it's very exciting.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.520]   Yeah, we're just seeing the first wave.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:42.080]   I have been-- Obviously, no iPhone developer has ever broken NDA for any reason.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.680]   Certainly not with me.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:48.040]   However, I have conjectured that there are certain people writing certain wonderful apps
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:52.760]   that have yet to deploy yet only because they realize that they could either see their wives
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.720]   and see their children, see their husbands, et cetera, or they could--
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:59.200]   And be there for the first weekend or they can get it right and get it right two weeks
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.200]   from a place where--
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.200]   There's no hurry.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.200]   So there's no hurry.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.200]   We're just seeing the tip of the iceberg.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.440]   I've been telling people via Twitter and other places that if you're looking for an outliner,
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:10.200]   if you're looking for a certain kind of software and you don't see exactly the sort of app
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.360]   that you like, just wait, don't spend the $5 just to have something.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.640]   There'll be something really great coming up in about a month.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:19.560]   Well, and if I'm a developer, I'm not in a hurry because it is so easy.
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:23.480]   I don't know how much I've spent, but I've bought probably 10 applications.
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:27.120]   I've probably spent 50 or 60, maybe 100 bucks.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.880]   And without even thinking about it, it's just so easy.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.720]   So if I'm a developer, you know, I know originally developers said, "Oh, Apple takes 30%--
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:34.720]   Forget it.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.880]   Don't worry about it because the point of access is so important that you could be on
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.800]   that phone, have a minute to spare nothing much to do."
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.880]   Let me see what's new out there.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.400]   And buy an application that easily is huge.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.320]   I wish it would remember my password.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:53.560]   I understand why they do it because on one password nerd typing a secure password with
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.440]   that stupid keyboard is maddening.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.680]   And I wish I could flip up it.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.680]   That's why it needs cut and paste, Merlin.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.440]   Did she-- did she see Groobers post about that?
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:07.040]   Well I saw that Jaws said it was a very-- we went through a list of all the things we
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:10.960]   wanted to do on the iPhone and cut and paste was way down there.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.960]   What did Groobers say?
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.520]   Oh no, just talking about the difficulty of it.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.320]   You know, and then it's that it just seems like it's-- there's a lot to it, you know.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.800]   To doing cut and paste?
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.800]   Well, yeah.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.800]   What'd you say?
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.800]   I wanted to cut and paste much.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.080]   And the next guy probably more really, but given the evidence of hand, the new iPhone
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   has the significant features.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:28.160]   If Boggles in my mind that anyone could take Jaws' explanation regarding the lack of
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.560]   copy and paste and anything other than the obvious truth.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.560]   I disagree.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.080]   You know, John's a developer, but I've done some developing.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.000]   Cut and paste is not difficult to implement.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   I might be misstating him.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   I might be misstating him.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.760]   I do not believe it's difficult at all to implement.
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:45.400]   However, what is difficult is to-- you can't provide that capability backwards.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:49.280]   What he's saying here is that-- and I really should let John speak for himself because
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.720]   he would-- but writing the code implemented system like clipboard isn't the hard part.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.320]   Hard part is coming up with the right UI design for it.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.320]   Oh, that's easy.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:57.320]   You could do a gesture.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.560]   That's-- I mean the palm had it for years.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.960]   Remember, it was a simple gesture for cut and a simple gesture for paste.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.960]   I love this.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:04.960]   Those were great.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.960]   Yeah, didn't that work?
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.960]   I lurked for everything.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.120]   I love-- why am I supposed to shortcut?
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.120]   My God, I hate typing.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.120]   Can I publish that?
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:14.800]   I think the problem now is they've gone so long without cutting paste and now they have
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.160]   all these applications.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:20.400]   You could put it-- you can create an API and a system call, but none of these applications
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:21.400]   will use it.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.240]   So you suddenly have the situation on the phone where some applications support it and
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.240]   some don't, and that's ugly.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.000]   And I'm almost positive.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.720]   That's what's really keeping them from doing it.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:35.160]   We talked to Jaws about the gesture thing and we couldn't tell, but it seemed like he was
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:40.520]   making a gesture with his middle finger to us back over the phone.
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:45.920]   They must know this is-- I mean that if I'm Blackberry, if I'm Rym, I'm saying thank God
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.280]   no cutting paste.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.680]   Yeah, but realize that there's something that Jaws has been talking about that kind
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:55.120]   of surprised me that it's really difficult for two different applications to share data
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.120]   between each other.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.280]   There's no shared storage of any kind.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:02.560]   So that kind of made me wonder if the real roadblock to cutting paste is where do you
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:05.720]   put the cut content so that another application could find and use it?
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.840]   You need shared storage somewhere.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.200]   In memory, if not in the drive, you need shared storage.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.920]   And of course, the OS could take care of that.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:17.240]   But then are we now giving a resource that other programmers would then exploit to put
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:21.240]   in really awesome, wonderful, cool new features that Apple in no way approves of?
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:24.160]   How dare they?
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.040]   So another story, SciStar is getting sued.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.600]   Finally, Apple dropped the other shoe.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:33.320]   SciStar, the company that was doing Apple clones, basically making beige boxes and putting
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:37.440]   OS10 on Apple, says cease and desist.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.520]   They even said-- and by the way, everyone that you sold, we want them back.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:44.200]   We want them back.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:48.200]   So I don't know what will happen there, but that was just a matter of time.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:52.520]   So if you bought one of those boxes, keep a tray of pastries and a pot of coffee on.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:55.960]   From Apple, we'll be coming by to say hi.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:58.280]   Let me read this story.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.760]   Leave the side door in line.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:04.960]   We'll be right over to get our hardware.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:10.480]   Apple filed suit against the Florida-based Mac clone outfit SciStar.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:16.720]   And they're saying it's not a violation of the EULA, but it runs a modified unauthorized
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:20.320]   version of the Leopard operating system.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:24.680]   And these modified versions are part of the problem also.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:29.560]   Part of the problem Apple says is that the computers are so crappy.
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:35.280]   And they don't really like their operating system running on this junk.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:39.120]   SciStar's actions have been committed with intent to damage Apple and to confuse and
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.120]   deceive the public.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:44.920]   And as a direct result and proximate result of SciStar's infringing conduct, Apple has
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:48.440]   suffered and will continue to suffer loss sales and profits in an amount not fully
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:53.320]   ascertained, but they will prove it a trial and believe me, they're going to want it.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:57.840]   And Apple wants SciStar to re-clone all Mac systems sold since April.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:01.000]   I just hope that they haven't ruined cloning for everybody.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.640]   Right now, Apple has had sort of a, has been aware that it's possible to run the OS on
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.800]   other hardware.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.400]   It's not been big enough and they really haven't really cared about it enough to really put
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.560]   any to stop it in any way.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:17.720]   But if this really goes forward any further, Apple could suddenly just say, you know what,
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:22.960]   this 0.1 of 1% out there running, you know, running a non-Apple hardware, we're going to
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:23.960]   have to end you now.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:28.160]   I have to think that if SciStar had deep enough pockets to fight this, that they would have
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.880]   a chance in court.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:36.680]   I think because these are legally purchased copies of OS X, I think SciStar might, I don't
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:37.680]   know.
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.240]   I'm not a lawyer, but I wonder if this might be defensible.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:44.120]   And if Apple might not be taking a chance, because the last thing they want to do is
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:47.680]   have a court rule, oh no, it's okay.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:51.400]   Apple must feel like either SciStar doesn't have the deep pockets to pursue it, which is
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:56.040]   probably the case, they're just running out of a barn somewhere, or they have a pretty
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.040]   good legal case.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.480]   But I'd sure like to talk to a lawyer about that.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:04.080]   I wonder if there's a defense SciStar could make.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:08.360]   They just don't sound like the sort of company that whatever they did to get the OS running
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.440]   on the machine.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:13.560]   It doesn't sound like they would have been careful enough to do it in a clean room environment.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:18.240]   You can do all kinds of things that smack of absolute outright theft.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:23.000]   Your worst competitor can have a really wonderful chip that does ungodly good things.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.480]   And you can just flat out say, you know what, that's a good chip, we're going to steal it.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:30.760]   So long as you do it in a clean room environment, when you reverse engineer it so that whenever
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:34.800]   you face that inevitable legal confrontation, you can say, no, we had absolutely no access
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.920]   to this chip, we had absolutely no access to anybody who had access to this chip.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.960]   You simply contracted this fellow to say, please develop a chip on your own that has
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:44.880]   the same sort of features and your pure as ivory snow.
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:49.400]   That's exactly what Phoenix did back in the PC days when they made a clone BIOS.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:52.640]   They were taken to court and they were able to prove that in fact it was clean.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:53.640]   Exactly.
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:57.400]   So I just don't get that impression that these people would be that probably right.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:01.360]   There's also the issue is, did they have to crack encryption if they did, then there's
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.440]   clear violation of the DMCA.
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.440]   It's possible.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.200]   I'd love to talk to a lawyer.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.600]   I wonder if there's anybody who thinks this is defensible.
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.840]   Well the Apple lawyers would love for them to talk to a lawyer because that just keeps
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.480]   them employed.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:24.040]   John Romero, the guy who wrote Doom and Quake has written a post on the Mac Heist forums
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:27.040]   saying, Hey guys, I switched to a Mac.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.440]   You want to know why?
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:35.400]   OS 10 is a more capable environment for development than anything I've ever seen since next step.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:38.120]   He says actually really is next step under the hood.
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:39.840]   Yeah, I wonder why.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:43.000]   It's interesting to note that most people don't credit part of Doom and Quake's success to
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.560]   the platform we developed them on.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.360]   We developed it on next step.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.960]   I didn't know that.
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.160]   He said even cross compilation of our code was a really sweet perk.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.880]   All we had to do on MS DOS was run the executable.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:59.720]   It automatically, I don't know, I won't get too technical here, but it's a really interesting
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:00.720]   post.
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:05.720]   Because today there's absolutely no reason to develop on PC hardware.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:11.040]   You can run Windows in VM Fusion in one of your spaces while the rest of the Mac runs
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.040]   native.
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:16.080]   When you need to do Windows work, you switch over to that space for a programmer coding
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:21.040]   in Objective C is just heaven compared to C++ in Windows.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:25.800]   He says, Coco development is way more fun and easier than Visual Studio and Apple's unified
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.920]   user interface across their hardware and web shows the company as a very clear vision
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.840]   for their product line and has accomplished something no other company ever has and that's
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.840]   why everyone, everyone he says is switching.
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:39.280]   Their UI is fun and easy and does what you expect.
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.520]   This is a guy.
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:43.440]   This is kind of one of the legends in the game industry.
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:44.440]   Very interesting.
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:46.440]   This is not a curiosity.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:50.960]   I'm not trying to start a turf war, but is there anybody on the, I don't know, even the
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:55.040]   right term for this, the PC side, the Windows side, the non-Apple Mac world?
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:59.880]   Is there anybody who's doing the same thing in a reverse and going like, wow, I'm so
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.760]   glad I stayed with this stuff.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.600]   Is that happening at any level outside of press release?
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:08.920]   They're occasional outliers, but I don't think there are a whole lot of them.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:09.920]   I've met people.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:14.120]   You know, for years I've done Photoshop and movie editing on my Mac, but I switched to
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.120]   Vista.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.880]   Well, you know, what's interesting for years, I don't think anybody, certainly Mac people
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:19.880]   never talked about this.
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:22.320]   Photoshop was much faster on Windows than it was on the Mac.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:24.120]   I mean, I'm kind of sandbagging a little bit.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:27.080]   There's always been stuff that Windows just leaves the Mac in the middle.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:32.040]   Photoshop was superior until Intel, you know, until they moved to Intel and then had an
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.040]   Intel native.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.040]   Until CS3, you'd be crazy.
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.520]   I mean, if you really wanted speed, you'd be crazy to use Photoshop on a Mac.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.720]   Part of what makes somebody like me such a, it makes it so hard for me to stop being a
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:45.280]   partisan is the years where I was handed some incredibly broken version of a Windows app
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.280]   that have been ported.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:53.040]   I'm looking at you word and then people go, oh, if you want to really use a computer,
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.040]   you should get a picture.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:59.520]   You know, I'm still trying to recover from PFS file back in 1985.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.000]   I like those applications.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.800]   That left that left scars.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.760]   If I turn a corner the wrong way, it was a little bit too fast.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.760]   There it is.
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.320]   That text interface in my face all over again.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.320]   Hey, good news.
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:12.440]   My mobile me just synced.
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:13.960]   That's only been taken only took four days.
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.760]   It finally finally I'm on mobile me.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.320]   My calendar is there.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:20.040]   Actually my address book has been there for quite some time in this act.
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:23.320]   I love the fact that I go to the web, get that in nice interface.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:27.360]   I'm using Spanning Sync, your recommendation, Merlin, to sync with Google Calendar.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:29.120]   I moved to Busy Sync.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.120]   No.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:35.480]   Well, the new Spanning Sync 2.0 came out and it's very nice.
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.200]   What do you use now Busy Sync?
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.200]   Yeah, I moved to Busy Sync.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.400]   I felt a little more flexible for what I wanted to see.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:42.400]   Did you spell it, Merlin?
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.520]   Sorry, B-U-S-Y-S-Y-N-C.
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:49.440]   Because I'm about to do that now that I got my Mac book here.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.280]   Well, I see what you will about all these apps.
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:55.560]   I mean, just to be honest, I really prefer Google Calendar for doing almost everything.
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.560]   I agree.
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:57.720]   It's easier to invite, easier to deal.
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:02.200]   And this just, apparently there are some issues on the horizon for the way syncing works.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.040]   And I haven't read the whole post about this.
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:08.240]   But I think one of the Busy Sync developers maybe wrote about how some of the syncing
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:11.000]   stuff with, I'm going to stop talking about because I don't know.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.840]   But apparently there is potentially troubles on the horizon.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.920]   With that said, I had nothing but good luck.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:19.520]   What Busy Sync does well, and I don't know, the new Spanning Sync might do this, but if
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:23.800]   you've got a local network, you can seamlessly share iCal calendars.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:24.800]   Oh.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.600]   And it's, yeah, it's without any other syncing.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.120]   So, we do want to do that.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:29.120]   We want to do that here at the cottage.
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.840]   If you share a calendar, it's really easy.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.360]   And it does all heavy lifting.
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.600]   Well, and the thing is, the reason I wanted to get that Google Calendar and iCal, I didn't
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.600]   even use iCal.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.600]   I just subscribed to the Google Calendar.
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:44.640]   But the reason I wanted to use iCal is because I do want this push, or whatever you call
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:47.400]   it, to my iPhone.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.160]   That was one thing I used on the BlackBerry.
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:51.880]   My BlackBerry automatically synced with the Google Calendar.
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.240]   It wasn't pushed, it was pull.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:58.240]   But it sure was nice to have that calendar be able to be on both platforms.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.880]   The thing is, though, the calendar, yeah, the calendar is a big thing.
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:03.680]   I mean, I think it's going to be really interesting to see.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.560]   We're running over our time here, but to see what Google does next with that.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:10.320]   Because, again, Google, which is glancing blows in a Labor Day weekend, can do what
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:11.880]   a lot of companies do in five years.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.360]   So that'll be really interesting to watch.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.920]   For now, I mean, let's be honest.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:23.920]   iMap implementation, iMap is just close to push as most normal Mac users do.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:29.120]   And I mean, the Gmail app on the iPhone is so much better.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:31.200]   I use Yahoo mail that because it's push.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:35.560]   But I'm just saying, like, still, I mean, I hate to beat this to death, but it's still
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:39.120]   unconscionable to me that you don't have flagging in mail.app on the phone.
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.120]   It's ridiculous.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:42.640]   You don't have to do this on the phone natively.
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:44.080]   That's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:45.480]   It's unacceptable.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.960]   And Gmail's experience, the apps that Gmail has made, even after the mobile me stuff, are
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:49.960]   just superior.
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:50.960]   I agree.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:51.960]   I agree.
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.960]   And that's why Android is going to be a very interesting platform.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:55.680]   Well, I don't know about that.
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:56.680]   You think?
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:57.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:58.680]   Really?
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:00.160]   If it's well implemented on phones, I think Android could be very strong.
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:05.080]   If you've talked to anybody who had to build software for an ATM machine, and how hard
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:08.240]   it is to develop software for an unknown device where you don't know where the buttons
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.240]   will go?
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:10.240]   Well, that's true.
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:11.240]   Really.
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:12.240]   Well, there's a fantastic post.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.800]   You Google Wells Fargo ATM.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:18.520]   There's a guy who worked on the design, the fantastic redesign of the Wells Fargo ATMs,
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:22.880]   and talked about the design constraints of trying to make software for an amazing array
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:23.880]   of different machines.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:24.880]   Right?
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:25.880]   Of course.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.320]   Some of these are the ones you get at Wells Fargo where it's all touchscreen.
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.720]   Some of them have four buttons or five buttons on each side.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:33.680]   But what is more likely to give you the features you want in your Google Apps, but Google's
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:34.680]   phone operating system?
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:38.040]   Like how would you run Android on an iPhone versus a Nokia?
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:39.920]   No, I don't think you'd run it on an iPhone.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.720]   In fact, the first hand sets will be at the end of the year.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:46.040]   They'll be from HTC and they do know the form factor of those HTCs.
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.200]   I'm guessing there are going to be a couple of different reference designs.
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:53.040]   I think it can be more like Windows Mobile where if you're asking for a phone the size
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:57.840]   of a pen with a four pixel high, 800 pixel line LCD and pointing it to that, I don't
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:58.840]   think that's going to happen.
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:03.160]   But I think it's going to be limited to whatever the standard size QVGA screen is, whatever
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:06.360]   the standard five button input is.
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:10.480]   I have to agree that I haven't seen a whole lot of Android apps that have really impressed
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.680]   me the way the first iPhone apps impressed me.
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:14.560]   Oh yeah, I agree with you on that.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:15.760]   We're going to get to our iPhone apps.
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:20.440]   In fact, just a second, are picks of the week and they're all apps for your iPhone or iPod
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:21.440]   touch.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:24.480]   Even if you don't have one of those platforms, you might want to listen to see what's out
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.640]   there because there's some amazing stuff being done.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:32.280]   Before we do, though, we want to thank our friends at audibleaudible.com/macbreak.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:35.760]   They're the folks who make this possible with their support of, in fact, the entire
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:41.800]   Twitter network, and we want to make a recommendation for a fine audible product.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.640]   Perhaps you, Andy, not go.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:44.760]   It's up to you if you want to do one.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.760]   I have plenty if you want to do one.
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:47.760]   I like to give you the chance.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.960]   I absolutely do.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:54.880]   It's part of my job as the manager of my own operating system to upgrade that operating
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.120]   system from time to time.
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:55:00.160]   You recognize holes in the implementation, patches, things that need to be fixed.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:02.480]   I need to broaden myself, never possible.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:06.800]   Never is that more necessary when it comes to my appreciation of literature.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:12.360]   Recently, I realized that there's an entire field of the English endeavor that I had never
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:13.920]   even dipped so much as a toe in.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:15.960]   That is the world of Star Wars novels.
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:16.960]   Oh, dear.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:17.960]   Oh, dear.
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:18.960]   Oh, dear.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:19.960]   Oh, dear.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:20.960]   It was only a matter of time.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:27.200]   Excellent time to take what I like to call a break.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.200]   That got right from him.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.200]   Okay.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:32.200]   Now, here is what I think about 43 folders.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:35.160]   Well, see, I have a really good friend, John.
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:39.480]   He is like eight times eight eight to the order of magnitude times more of the Star
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:43.800]   Wars fan than I am, if you can believe such a thing, chiefly because I feel as though I
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:46.440]   feel as though there's the stuff that really happened.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.840]   That's the movies and the stuff that they're just making stories up.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:50.800]   And that's everything that happened outside the movies.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:54.120]   I realize we're still all talking about fiction, but bear with me here.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:57.960]   So I've never read any of the books and never read anything like that.
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:03.880]   So finally, a couple weeks ago, I said, John, I think I need to read one Star Wars novel
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:07.480]   to make me decide whether or not I ever want to read another Star Wars novel.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:12.880]   Will you pick a good company because Audible has 111 Star Wars novels.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:17.800]   Again, you know, this is what is known as good understanding of your demographic.
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:18.800]   They thought, you know what?
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.480]   Are people we have, they have computers?
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.480]   They have MP3 players.
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:23.040]   They know how to download things digitally.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.640]   I'm guessing they're Star Wars fans.
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:26.640]   111.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:27.640]   Yes.
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:32.960]   So the one, see, he recommended like six or seven that are good jumping on points.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:38.600]   I have picked for myself and for you friendly listeners, Star Wars, colon or Star Wars,
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:43.840]   boom, boom, the truth, the truth at bakura, the truth is that bakura.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:44.840]   Okay.
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:45.840]   B-A-K-U-R-A.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:50.400]   It is set immediately after the events of Return of the Jedi, AKA episode six.
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:54.560]   So if you have seen those movies and I'm sure that you have, you already have all the backstory
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:57.160]   you need to start again with this new novel.
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:02.880]   Again, part of the problem with these novel series is that, you know, it's my first opportunity
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:06.000]   to be on the outside of Star Wars fandom looking in.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.800]   And I said, what's the deal with the lady with the big like skin ponytails?
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:15.040]   Oh, well, that's the different race of Jedi that was cloned from Luke Skywalker's recovered
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.160]   left hand.
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:18.840]   But then the clone was cloned.
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.320]   So there's a good clone in the bed.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:22.120]   Oh, God, God, God, God, God.
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:26.000]   So this all makes a lot more sense once you've read the entire series.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.880]   I'll take the home of seven books.
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:32.520]   I'll tell you what order to read them and we can do, we can Twitter each other on after
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:34.120]   each one, you get stuck.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.120]   I feel bad.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:38.200]   I didn't mean to make fun of it any cause I did a, there was that, I think it was called
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:44.560]   a very special Django FET wedding, part seven.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:48.520]   Characters were so rich in action during the final toast was amazing.
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:52.040]   You want to listen to just a little bit of this book, the, I should just read the,
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.040]   publish your summary.
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:55.800]   No sooner has Darth Vader's funeral pyre.
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:57.240]   Please, please let me.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.240]   Okay.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.440]   I think, I think, I think this does require that special touch.
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:01.440]   Please do.
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:05.520]   If you want to do that like atmospheric background, like Moody, like fog, fog, fog, fog, fog,
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:08.160]   music, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:13.000]   no sooner has Darth Vader's funeral pyre burned to ashes on end door than the alliance intercepts
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.320]   a call for help from a far-flowing imperial outpost.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:22.680]   Baccura is on the edge of known space and the first to meet the, oh god, the Cybrooke
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:27.840]   all go directly in favor of who once allied with the now dead emperor are approaching
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:31.440]   imperial space with only one goal.
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:35.120]   Dominate, dom dom dom dom dom dom.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.000]   Let's hear a little, the man to book.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.040]   Let's hear a little bit of the, of the clip.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:41.640]   I just have to, cause I just have to see what this sounds like.
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.080]   I'm sure they do a good job of producing this.
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.920]   These two crystals apart.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.200]   It's a self-destruct of some sort.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:49.200]   Crystal?
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:51.720]   Electrite crystal leads.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:54.400]   The mechanisms trying to push them together.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.360]   Let them touch, the whole fusion engine.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:59.200]   Oh, so this is dramatized, which is kind of fun.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.200]   Nice.
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.200]   I'll come, you go old ed.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:02.200]   Series.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.200]   That's nice.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.200]   Yeah, yeah, I like that.
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.200]   You know what?
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:06.200]   You might have won me over, Andy and I co.
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:09.880]   Well, we'll have our own Oprah's book club moment, but a month from now, we'll get on
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:11.840]   a circle with discuss about how.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:14.840]   You get a land speeder and you get a land speeder and you get a land speeder.
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:17.200]   You all get land speeders.
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:23.040]   This is the pick of the week Star Wars, the truce at Bakura by Kathy Tires, narrated by
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.480]   Anthony Heald.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:29.400]   And there are literally, if you are in his Star Wars 111, which is probably the complete
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:34.960]   set of Star Wars books, those, this could, this could get into some money if you get
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:35.960]   hooked on this.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:37.480]   Oh, but you know what, that's a beauty of audible.
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:42.280]   You get a subscription and you're, you know, you pay one monthly fee and you can get, you
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:44.560]   know, so let me tell you, go to, this is what you do.
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:50.480]   You go to audible.com/macbreak, you sample this or any, any of the 50,000 titles.
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:52.080]   Audible is just a wealth.
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:54.040]   It's like a library in your computer.
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:57.080]   You click, you download it's on your iPod or your iPhone.
[00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.240]   I put them on my iPhone and it's just wonderful.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.560]   Audible.com/macbreak, we thank them for their support.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:10.080]   I am glad I got the 16 gig iPhone because I'm starting to fill this thing up with applications.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.400]   Let's get our application picks of the week.
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:16.840]   I know it's not going to be easy for you kids, but you're going to have to pick.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:21.400]   Merlin, why don't you start because you had a, I see I was going to, I kind of want to
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:25.280]   sneak into because I started, I started to write this post for 43 fours and I'll probably
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.840]   still do this, but I was going to do a post that was going to be like, oh, one of those
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:34.640]   do she end things that do why it was going to, I was going to do the like five iPhone
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.320]   apps that seem like magic.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.320]   Right.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.920]   And there's two in particular that I think are so well done.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:43.080]   Guaranteed, a guaranteed dig front page if you do that.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.080]   Exactly.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.160]   Well, I mean, of course I have to give a shout out to my friends at OmniFocused because the
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.880]   location where stuff in OmniFocused isn't that cool.
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:53.960]   I thought I first, I scratched my head a little and I was like, hmm, is this a good idea?
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:54.960]   Like, do I really want to do that?
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.920]   But now like for people who travel and for people, anyway, this is not my pick.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.920]   So I can't say this.
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:00:59.920]   Anyway, OmniFocused is really cool.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:00.920]   Here's my picks.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:01.920]   Okay.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.920]   Fix.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:03.920]   I'm going to do them really fast to that are like magic.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.920]   You don't have to run.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:05.920]   We got time.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.920]   Go ahead.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:07.920]   Take your time.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:08.920]   That are like magic and involve music.
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:09.920]   Okay.
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:12.920]   The first one is Pandora, which I've never used before, but Pandora for a lot.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.920]   You're going to hear a lot of that, I think.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:16.920]   What?
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:17.920]   Actually, I don't like Pandora.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:18.920]   I would like to talk.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.920]   No, no, go ahead.
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:20.920]   Go ahead.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:21.920]   I got another one.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:22.920]   Shazam.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:23.920]   Shazam.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:24.920]   You like Shazam?
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.920]   I'm liking Madomi a little better than Shazam.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:28.920]   It worked for me at all.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.920]   Oh, let me give you a bit.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:31.920]   Shazam.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.920]   Shazam is this.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.240]   Shazam is you hear some song on the radio.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.920]   You hold the mic of your iPhone.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.160]   You're the talky thing.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:44.400]   Up to the thing, it records something like 15 seconds of music.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.280]   If you, if now, very important, if you have a connection at the time, this is very important.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.280]   I'll come back to this.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.280]   It sends that back to the mothership.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:58.840]   And with what I would describe as 80 to 93 percent perfect awesomeness, it tells you
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.320]   what song that is.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.320]   Okay.
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.360]   And it is so well done.
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:07.880]   And the thing that really pissed me off about it though is that if you can't get a connection,
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:10.280]   it still lets you do it, but then it drops it.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:14.000]   The song's already off the radio and I have no way to actually, when I tried to show
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.280]   it to my wife, it was the world's worst demo ever.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.280]   It would work.
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:20.680]   It would have failed four times in a row because we were near Laguna Honda and there was no
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:21.680]   connection.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:25.480]   So anyway, so that's my pitch for Shazam, which I thought was great.
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.960]   And then there's tagging involved.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:27.960]   I don't understand that.
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:28.960]   It seems like a whole lot of web2 podcasts.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.120]   That's all I get when I go to the front page.
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.720]   So I don't even really understand how I'm going to use the rest of it.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:36.720]   It's like, well, you just hit something like create a tag or edit a tag or something like
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.720]   that.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.720]   A tag now.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.720]   And then the rest of the application becomes available.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:41.720]   Oh, now it's listening.
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:42.720]   It's anything.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:44.720]   And it works.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.720]   I got Neil Young.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.720]   It got Death Cab for QUTI.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:47.720]   It got Dinosaur Jr.
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.720]   Did it get it when you were singing?
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:52.400]   Maybe that's what I like about Madomi is you can sing to it.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:56.000]   I'm not a bad singer and it didn't get any of my songs.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   Really?
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   I've been working on the rail.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   Oh, fault.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   Sorry.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.960]   The feet could not fly.
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:07.600]   This is like the world of Wally all over again.
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.280]   Now we're basically playing name that tune.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.280]   We're the hosts and the song.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.280]   Give me a song.
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.280]   Give me a song to sing.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.840]   Give me, I'm going to try Madomi.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:14.840]   Give me a song to sing.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:15.840]   Sing.
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.840]   Six-day way to heaven.
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.840]   Okay.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:18.840]   Here I go.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:19.840]   There's a lady.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:24.960]   There is a lady we all know who says all that glitters is.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.120]   This is a lounge version.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:29.000]   I can't do it.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:37.120]   And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.560]   We finally found something Neil the port's not good at.
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:41.560]   Well, we knew that.
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.000]   And it says no results.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.960]   It says no results because that's because I laughed in the middle of it.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.680]   I just always comes up with a bunch of rap songs.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:49.800]   No, no, we got the wrong song.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.040]   We got the wrong song.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.840]   What's love got to do with it?
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:54.320]   We don't know what you're favorite.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:57.880]   What's love but a second hand emotion.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.080]   What's love got to do with it?
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.080]   Okay, let's try that.
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.080]   All right.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.080]   Let's try Jesus Christ super strong.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.080]   Yeah, that's my song.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.080]   My mind is clear right now.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.080]   Oh, too well.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:10.640]   Oh, Jesus Christ.
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.640]   Something's wrong with it.
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:14.320]   Oh, I'm doing the radio one.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.920]   No wonder I have to do the sing one.
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.160]   I'm going to turn my phone on.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.160]   All right, wait a minute.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.480]   Can we have some rat hole?
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:26.240]   And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.400]   All right.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.720]   Now that should be enough.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:32.600]   If this thing works, it should be able to pick the song based on that, right?
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.600]   All right.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.160]   Jesus take the wheel by Carrie Underwood.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.160]   Exactly.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.400]   A spiritual day esta salva by barot, it didn't get it.
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.800]   Hey, see what happens when you play the rat hole music.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:44.800]   It didn't get it.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.520]   It won't know the rat hole music.
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:47.520]   All right.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.520]   All right.
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:49.520]   All right.
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.520]   You're right.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.520]   Shazam wins.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.520]   But Shazam, can you sing this?
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.520]   Shazam, it's only for holding it up to the radio.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:55.520]   I've never tried to hold up the radio.
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.120]   I've never crossed the streams.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.400]   I, I, but no, it was worked.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:02.280]   But the thing that's frustrating is that you have a very short window.
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:05.040]   There was actually a song where I wanted to find out what the song was and it wasn't
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.040]   just a demo.
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:09.880]   And I was really frustrated because it captured it, but then it went, you know, oh, I'm sorry.
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:10.880]   I don't know.
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.280]   Like, I can't get a connection.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.280]   That is frustrating.
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.200]   Yeah, I'm going to try the medomi.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.880]   That's a song that I really, really know.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:17.880]   You need to be able to sing it.
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:21.440]   I mean, I've actually used it a number of times and it's, and it's worked really well.
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.520]   I demoed it for my family and they were raised.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.520]   Okay.
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:25.520]   Here, he's just taking a second.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.560]   I'm, I'm done letting Shadomi right now.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.360]   It's clean right now.
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.560]   I love that to well.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.560]   Jesus.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.560]   I can see what we are.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.360]   That's so bad.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.360]   Jesus.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.760]   Oh, Jesus.
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:39.760]   Ah.
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:40.760]   All right.
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.320]   If it gets that, I'll be very impressed.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.320]   That's a really good.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.320]   That's a good news.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.800]   How well did it get it?
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.720]   I was doing the more, the Murray head version.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:48.720]   Okay.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.720]   Let's go.
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.720]   10.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:51.720]   You know, actually it did pretty good.
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:55.440]   It says it's 10 para lost 10 by Playa limbo or actually this is very close.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.760]   It's a more Del Bueno by Ray Rayley.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:58.760]   Oh, it didn't.
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.680]   Oh, colors of the wind by Vanessa Hudgens.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:01.840]   She's very popular from the high school.
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:02.840]   Wait a minute.
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:03.840]   I got one.
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:04.840]   I got one.
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:05.840]   I'm going to try this one.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:06.840]   Okay.
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.400]   Here we go.
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.560]   Tap and sing or hum.
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.320]   I'm never going to give you up.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.160]   Never going to let you down.
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.760]   Never going to mess around and desert you.
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.520]   Never going to give you up.
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:21.760]   Never going to let you down.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:22.760]   Okay.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:23.760]   That should be enough.
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.480]   I've just Rick rolled my iPhone.
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:27.480]   Let's see.
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.480]   Let's see if it can do it.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:29.480]   Loading.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:30.480]   Okay.
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:31.480]   Ladies and gentlemen, listen.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:32.480]   Listen carefully.
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.640]   Listen carefully.
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.960]   Is this the song you're looking for?
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:36.960]   D-D-D.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:37.960]   Play.
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:41.440]   Oh, I have the sound turned off.
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.560]   There we go.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.680]   Is this the sound?
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.840]   Is this the song you're looking for?
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.480]   This is a great magic trick.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:51.760]   If it ever works.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.600]   This is a good party game where you pick a song out of a hat.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:02.560]   Whoever can get the service to actually identify correctly gets to pick the next song.
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.560]   It found it.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:04.560]   Really?
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:05.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:08.600]   From my lousy singing, that's pretty good.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:09.600]   And I think that's pretty...
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.600]   I think that's just a cool...
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:11.600]   What is it?
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:12.600]   It's a great party trick.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:13.880]   Now I can't get Rick athletes.
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.240]   It actually just stops singing.
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:18.040]   You know, Rick rolling has never worked on me because I love that song.
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.040]   I do too.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.040]   I don't mind hearing that.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.040]   I could hear...
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.840]   Of course, like, oh, this is so much better than like a video from PIC.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:23.840]   This is awesome.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:27.000]   And for the purpose of all of our listeners, what's that email address where they can send
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.240]   you links pretending to be hot new software?
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:31.600]   Somebody Rick rolled my phone.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:32.600]   They found...
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.680]   I don't know where they got my number, but I picked up the message and it was never going
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:37.160]   to give you a...
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.800]   But there are great music applications.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.960]   I agree, Pandora.
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:44.440]   Believe it or not, AOL radio is pretty good.
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:50.000]   In fact, I'm going to give a lecture to some radio people next month.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.840]   I'm going to show them this and say, "You guys are screwed."
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:57.760]   So that's the end of my PIC, but I would like to be pulled back in just briefly if somebody
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:01.120]   talks about another application that uses the Music Genome Project.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.120]   AKA.
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.120]   Don't leave it out there.
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.120]   And we...
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.120]   In not go.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.120]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.120]   Go ahead.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.120]   You can do Pandora.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.120]   No, I don't think I will.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.120]   I hate you.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.120]   I'm so angry.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.120]   This is what is known as gaming the system.
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.120]   Can you identify this one?
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.120]   Hi, Andy.
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.120]   Go over.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.120]   Take this.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.120]   That's right.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.120]   I'll pull up.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:25.120]   Oh, it says that's Playa Della.
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:29.120]   Oh, that keeps Pandora in play for one more round.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.120]   All right.
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:33.840]   So, I think we're not going to take our 12-30 out.
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:34.840]   Yes, we are.
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:35.840]   We've got 11 more minutes.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:36.840]   Come on, keep going, guys.
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:37.840]   Okay.
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.680]   I'll make my mind's quick because it's nice and simple.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:44.200]   There are two or three applications that I really, really, really need to have.
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:47.400]   I think I've already written them about them before, but one of them is a good to-do list
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:48.560]   manager.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:52.760]   And I tried a bunch of them and I finally found one that is damn close to perfect and
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.760]   it's free.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:54.760]   It's called Zen-B.
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:55.760]   Z-N-B.
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.280]   I'm writing this down because I haven't found a good one.
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:00.480]   I like the Omni focus, but you have to use Omni focus.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:03.680]   I have a lot of our efforts to do this a lot.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:04.680]   Yeah, it's awful.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:05.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:08.960]   This was the first one that I used and the first one that I absolutely abandoned because
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.600]   it just doesn't work for me, period.
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.560]   But Zen-B is exactly the sort of thing that I'm looking for.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.280]   It allows you to create lists, multiple lists.
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:18.320]   It allows you to organize those lists effectively.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:22.280]   I was using it just my first demo of it was just to use it just for a simple shopping
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:23.440]   list.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:27.640]   Not only does it make it easy for you to- I just take out my iPhone and add things to
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.960]   the shopping list as they occur to me if I want to reorder the list so that all the
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:33.920]   neat things are in one area and while all the cereal stuff are in one area so that I can
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.720]   shop effectively, it'll allow me to reorganize those things.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.920]   When I check things off, things don't get deleted.
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:43.520]   They simply go gray and go to the bottom of the list so that if I need frozen yogurt
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.600]   next time, I can just simply uncheck that and I get frozen yogurt once again.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.480]   It is part of a larger service called Zen-B.com.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:57.640]   One of those things where they clearly got their venture capital funding because now
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:02.920]   they're talking about with enterprise extended to unify the marketing, multi-level blah,
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:03.920]   blah, blah.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:04.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:08.640]   My eyes glossed over because it's supposed to unify all your email, ignore all that.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.280]   Just take the free list manager.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.600]   There is also a sync button though.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:16.920]   If you set up for free account on Zen-B.com, you can just tap a button and synchronize
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.880]   every list you have on every iPhone.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:19.880]   I like that.
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:23.400]   See, I want to remember the milk to do an application because I already have all my
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:24.400]   to-do lists there.
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:29.600]   Actually, it also has that feature that same sort of thing that I like from my want
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:34.040]   to Sandy in which I can just be at my computer and say, "Oh, I want to add some stuff to
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:37.400]   my list," and just know that magically they'll start to appear on every device that I've
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.840]   subscribed to that list on.
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.840]   That's cool.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:42.800]   Do you do that through Twitter or how do you do that?
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.400]   It is through a web client.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.680]   I'm just talking about the idea where I don't necessarily have to be in front of my iPhone
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:48.840]   in order to add things to the list.
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.640]   I can do things wherever it's very, very convenient.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:54.600]   It's just a matter of time before Sandy supports a lot of these things too, I would imagine.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:55.600]   Yeah.
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.800]   Again, we're waiting for lots of second shoes to drop.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:58.800]   Exactly.
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.280]   So, I'm just going to be significant that most of the great stuff that's appeared in the
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:06.800]   store, including things like Pandora, including things like, "Someone's going to have to talk
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.120]   about every note at some point because that's also awesome."
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.120]   Awesome.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:13.040]   Talking about these wonderful services where all your information is actually being held
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:16.320]   someplace centrally, but now you have different ways to access it.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.720]   The great thing about Zenbi, as opposed to some of these other things, is that you are
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:22.680]   actually keeping your lists locally on the iPhone.
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:25.920]   So, you do not need to have an internet connection in order to find.
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:31.440]   Remember that, again, the brand of frozen yogurt that's 249 of the store is this Danons.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:34.400]   Z-E-N-B-E, it's free.
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:39.440]   You remember when we were talking about the tablet, Apple, you really said, "All you really
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:40.720]   need is a great outliner."
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.480]   Have you looked for a great outliner?
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.040]   I've looked for a great outliner and there's a lot of people who just want to be the first
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.720]   ones out with an outliner.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:52.440]   It's kind of okay, and it works the way that you expect an outliner to sort of work, but
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.720]   there's really no elegance to it.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:59.280]   Again, I didn't mean to really knock on the focus.
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:00.760]   It is a very beautifully designed outliner.
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:03.240]   I think on the outliner, we need an outliner.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:07.600]   It really does take advantage of the way that an iPhone application should look and
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:10.800]   having that really great economy of user interface.
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:14.680]   I just don't think that someone's created an outliner yet that really takes advantage
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:16.800]   of everything that makes an iPhone an iPhone.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.920]   You could write this just as well on a Windows mobile device or on a Palm device, as you
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.360]   could for an iPhone or with all the outlines that I've seen so far.
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.560]   It's a gooey version of like Vim outliner.
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.200]   Just something really simple where you can just move stuff and set it and change the
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.200]   order.
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:33.520]   And just also in terms of the answer, you'll never hurt my feelings by disagreeing about
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:36.800]   a piece of productivity app because that is such a personalized thing.
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:38.200]   It's like a pillow or underwear.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.600]   It's like something where everybody's going to have a different feeling about that.
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:42.600]   I totally suffered that.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:46.480]   Okay, with OmniFocus more like you're in that shop that sells the rubber underwear
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.640]   with the studs on the inside.
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.880]   It's like, "Ooh, totally not for me.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:53.040]   I'm glad it makes some people happy, but well."
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.920]   I've had a new zipper to the back of those.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.760]   So there you go.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:04.000]   No, what I loved about the OmniFocus was that it had used the GPS, it used location
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.160]   awareness for its contexts.
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:07.720]   There's four different ways.
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:08.720]   Four different ways.
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:09.720]   Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:10.720]   That's what I love.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:15.760]   As you can go like, but what it has, I want to negate some of the bad karma I've created
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:19.840]   about this product by saying that I've read about five different, I've read about five
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.960]   different things about the iPhone in the past week, three of them mention OmniFocus just
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.560]   for how cool that feature is.
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:26.560]   Yeah.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.360]   There do something that I wonder when other people are going to get that you can do this.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:34.320]   You see lots of stuff where you go like, "Whatever, show lonely people within one mile or three."
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.920]   What I want is something that goes like, "You know what?
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:40.400]   Remind me when I'm near some place that sells bulbs."
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:44.440]   What this does, and again, I'm not just, what I am going to do is pimp my friends who worked
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:48.640]   on this because they did a fantastic job and with the sinking and everything, it's crazy.
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:53.040]   But what I think is neat about it is you can say, "Okay, in my case, this is going to sound
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:56.520]   really stupid, but there's a wine shop down the street that I don't go to that much.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:00.320]   It's kind of fancy, but I want to remember next time I'm near there to do this."
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:03.800]   And so I say, "This wine shop, there's four different ways that I can identify it."
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:07.200]   I could say it's where I'm standing right now, click.
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.800]   I can say, "Remember it by this address," which by putting that in.
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.960]   Oh gosh, what's the third one?
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:16.000]   You can either say wine stores.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.840]   That's the fourth that I was going to, yeah, the neat one is you go, "For example, I have
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:23.360]   a grocery list, a running grocery list, and that's a context."
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:27.000]   And I'll say, "When I'm near any place that sells groceries," and then just say, "Show me
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   stuff I can do based on how close land is stuff."
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   And anyway, I guess that's what I'm--
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   I love that idea.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.160]   Wouldn't it be great if you could also say, "Whenever I'm near Merlin Man, remind me that
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.280]   I'm supposed to give him this?"
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.760]   That's called, and getting things done, that's called an agenda context, where I would say,
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:43.680]   "Here's the things I want to talk to Leo about."
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:48.160]   Like, think about it this way, next time at the Seattle office, and I'm visiting with
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.360]   Jim, I want to talk about these things.
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:51.360]   Next time, you know what?
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:54.400]   I thought of something I want to do the next time I'm at my mom's house six months from
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.960]   now, right?
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:59.880]   And have a starting date of six months from now, and in that context, like take her to
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:02.640]   Costco and buy her a case of this or whatever.
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:03.640]   I don't know.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:08.440]   It's mostly to say, I can't wait to see how other people use that Google search functionality
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.160]   without calling it Google Search.
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:15.080]   I think location is the single most important thing that this phone introduces, and I think
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:19.000]   it is going to be the killer app of the next few years, is location.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.240]   As long as we can protect our privacy and safety.
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:25.600]   Well, that's why it asks you every time, "Is it okay if I see where you are?"
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:26.600]   Yeah.
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.840]   It's also annoying.
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:33.480]   I can honestly say that I would happily have traded turn-by-turn directions for this sort
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.920]   of ubiquitous access to location services.
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:36.920]   Yes.
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.920]   Yeah.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:38.920]   I agree.
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:41.520]   You didn't have to because apparently Apple is working on turn-by-turn.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.760]   I think it'll kill the battery.
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:45.960]   I mean, that's the thing.
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:49.000]   If we're going to say one negative about the iPhone battery life, when you start-
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.040]   Yeah, you know when if you're a dumbass like me, and you rely on your newbie to go, "Okay,
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.040]   recalculating.
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:57.080]   You're stupid, and now I have to think about where you really are because you didn't listen
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:58.080]   to me."
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.680]   That's a lot to put your phone through.
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.240]   Battery life.
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.240]   You plug it in in the car, obviously.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:07.920]   Merlin, I would like to know who you think the voice of the newbie sounds like in your
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:08.880]   personal life.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:09.880]   She's very harsh.
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:14.720]   I'm guessing she sounds like a substitute teacher who's going through a divorce.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:15.720]   Yeah.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:19.480]   No, I'm guessing that there's a former girlfriend that you had a really bad time with that somewhere
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:22.320]   in your subconscious you're attaching that personality to your newbie.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.960]   You really passed aggressive from my third year of college, maybe.
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:27.080]   I have no idea what you mean.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:29.080]   Scott Borne, what's your pick?
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:30.640]   I'm going to make mine quick and simple.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.440]   It's Google app for the iPhone.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:34.440]   I know it's not new.
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:35.440]   It's not sexy.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.440]   Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:37.440]   But it's cool.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:45.040]   You know, we fired up the 3G iPhone and we were just, it was just crazy how well this
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.520]   thing works.
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:52.480]   The finding your contacts faster with the Google's suggest thing.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:53.480]   That's my favorite.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:56.400]   The Google's suggest thing, you just type a couple of characters.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.480]   You go right to stuff.
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.040]   It was finding things nearby us.
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:07.760]   And just faster than I could type in on my real GPS in the car that I wanted to find
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.240]   a point of interest.
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:10.560]   Super promising.
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:17.160]   I mean, it really is the one thing that when I, you know, if I do eventually upgrade my
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:20.600]   personal phone, this will be the reason I did it.
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:23.680]   And things like this that like you guys say, this is the big deal.
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:28.120]   When we start getting to the point where I can walk into the, you know, home depot and
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.760]   it says, oh, here you are, Mr. Borne.
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:33.040]   Last time you bought these things and here's this aisle in case you forget in this vast
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:36.680]   expansive warehouse where that is, that kind of stuff really is cool.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:41.480]   I don't know if we can do that with the 1.0 phone as well.
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:44.600]   But Google app is just, they continue to refine it.
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.600]   They continue to.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:50.080]   In fact, they do things on the iPhone that they don't do on the regular Google website
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.760]   because of the way the iPhone is designed.
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:52.760]   I'm going to have to try.
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.280]   I've been using Google app on the Blackberry software to give it a try.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.560]   Can I just go for a foot note?
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.600]   Can I mention who's one of the developers?
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:00.600]   Yes.
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:01.600]   Alport.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.600]   Can you guess?
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:03.600]   Alport?
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.440]   So it's Quicksilver for your phone and a very early part.
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:07.360]   Oh, I'm installing it.
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:10.680]   It's not perfect and it's not a, still could use a lot of polish.
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:14.960]   I really am getting sick of these apps that have like weird built in browsers that break
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:16.680]   things like one password.
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:18.760]   But it's, but man, it's really promising.
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.520]   I'm going to take a look at it.
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:21.520]   Google app.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:22.520]   Hey, so Merlin, like something I liked.
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:23.520]   What do you know?
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:24.520]   And free.
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:25.520]   Sure, this is me.
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:27.320]   I got my last pick and we have one minute to go.
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:29.920]   I'm just going to just mention there are so many things.
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:31.320]   It's very hard to pick.
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:33.960]   There's one that never worked for me very well called where.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:34.960]   You know, I'm going to have to Scott.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.160]   I'm going to hang up on you.
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.160]   Okay.
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.160]   Okay.
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.160]   Thank you for being here.
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:40.160]   I appreciate it.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:41.160]   Glad to be here.
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:42.840]   But I think that we're getting that echo back from you.
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:43.840]   Okay, bye bye.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.840]   Take care.
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.360]   We only have one minute left.
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:50.000]   I might as well just disappear you.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.600]   This is called where?
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:56.600]   We're with a little exclamation mark after it and it crashed every time I used it.
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:59.040]   But finally I got to use it.
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.280]   It's worth trying.
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:02.440]   It has a bunch of little location where apps in it.
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:03.440]   But this is my favorite.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.160]   It's called, Hey, what's that?
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:11.920]   You say, okay, give me the skyline for where I am and tell me what those mountains are.
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:17.560]   And literally it's generating right now a map for exactly my location and you could
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:21.480]   turn a hundred and eight or 360 degrees and say, Oh yeah, there's Santa Rosa.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.320]   So this is just a crazy little thing, but it gives you an idea of the kinds of things
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:27.200]   you can do with location based phones.
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:30.960]   It also does a star map, same idea, North Sky, South Sky, and West Sky.
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:31.960]   Nice.
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:34.360]   If it always crashed for me too, this is really cool.
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:37.760]   If it works, it's amazing.
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.520]   And where is one of those?
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:42.160]   It's not going to be around much longer, I don't think because what it is, it's kind
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:45.560]   of an omnibus of several other different services.
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.280]   Somebody obviously slapped it together.
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.920]   It's been very unreliable.
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:54.760]   However, I am excited about it because of what it signals is going to be possible down the
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:58.680]   road in terms of there's there's there's the map I just generated for those of you watching
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:19:59.680]   live on video.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:04.400]   So those are my mountain tops and I can I and there's my wife calling me.
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.840]   So can I give a can I give a couple quick, like 10 second tips that are really, really
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.840]   useful.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:12.760]   Please do because this this look at I'm excited about this phone for all the negatives.
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:16.040]   This thing is amazing and I'd like to give us a fast, crazy fast.
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.040]   So two things.
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:19.360]   Make sure you've got the latest version of all your apps.
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:22.960]   If you click on applications and iTunes and anything and you can click down at the bottom,
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.600]   it'll say so you know, end number of updates available.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.560]   Make sure you do that because people are updating their apps.
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:28.560]   They're getting better.
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:31.120]   The app store will put a little number on it when there's updates.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:32.360]   It's so cool.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.360]   It's a good idea though.
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.360]   Do that in second.
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.560]   I got this off of Oh God, I'm so embarrassed.
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.560]   I can't remember.
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:40.720]   It's been all over the place, but you can now do screen grabs built in by hitting home button
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:41.720]   and power button.
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:42.720]   It's so cool.
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:45.360]   In fact, that's been a fun thing on friend fee people are uploading their home screens
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:49.600]   because we all have new apps and we didn't mention so many great apps like all the music
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:54.880]   apps Pandora last FM ao radio ever note if you use ever note.
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:56.680]   This is amazing and you should get it.
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:59.680]   Jot has a very fun Jot interface.
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:01.080]   I use Jot all the time.
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:02.520]   If you use Jot, you're going to want to get that.
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.200]   This just goes on and on guys.
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:05.200]   I really appreciate your time.
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.840]   Scott Borne who is no longer with us.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:13.200]   Well, he is with that said it terrible special three hour episode left next week.
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:14.360]   Yeah, it was sad.
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:15.360]   It was sad.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.880]   It seems to me that you live your life.
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:20.480]   The candle in the wind.
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:22.000]   Scott Borne is at Apple phone show.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.680]   That's where you'll hear really in depth tips of this kind and more applephoneshow.com.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:29.880]   And of course, he also is part of twi p this week in photography.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:32.800]   He's got his Nikon lenses now and it's fascinating.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:35.600]   Don't forget Merlin man's you look nice today.com.
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:39.000]   That is the funniest bar none show anywhere.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.200]   I find myself listening to it and laughing out loud the whole time.
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:45.560]   I finally heard the live show and really enjoyed that.
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:46.640]   You guys are just great.
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:52.760]   I just love that show and and Andy and I co of the celestial waste of bandwidth C W O B
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:56.480]   dot com and also of course the Chicago Sun times.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:58.040]   I can't imagine three guys.
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:01.680]   I'd rather spend this time with talking about Apple news.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:02.680]   We really appreciate it.
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:04.960]   We'll see you next week for another Mac break weekly.
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:05.520]   Take care guys.
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:06.520]   Bye.
