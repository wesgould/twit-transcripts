[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Renee Richie's back from his trip to
[00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.400]   Cupertino. He'll tell us what it was like sitting in the audience during Apple's
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.680]   announcements last week. We'll talk about the new air powers. Well, we talked about
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.240]   the old air powers that no longer exist in air powers and the new air pods, which
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.360]   we do have in hand. That and a lot more coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.160]   the latest Apple news. Andy and I go from the beautiful confines of New England and
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:32.360]   WGBH Boston joining us. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello again. It looks like spring, but I'm
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.480]   reminded that it is absolutely not spring. So please Andy, keep the heater on. Don't
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.080]   have another night like you had the other night when he said, I can turn all the
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.920]   heaters off. Look, the birds are cheap chirping. They don't come back unless it's warm.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.480]   No, no, they... It could be worse, you could be in Montreal where it's snowing.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.960]   According to Renee Ritchie, I'm more.com. It's so much fun. We all watch the geese come
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.160]   back. They were honking. They made a dive for the river and they just bounced off
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:09.880]   because it's still ice. We are today gathered to talk about many
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.520]   new things from Apple. Renee, you were at the event last Monday. I guess we talked about
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.880]   it, but you weren't here. What were your thoughts now that we've got you back in studio?
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.800]   So I have two sets of thoughts. One was live being there and second was having to watch
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.800]   it afterwards. They were two very different experiences. Being live in the room, there
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.280]   was a ton of energy. Apple was really going into storytelling. It doesn't matter the medium.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.320]   We want great journalism. We want great TV. We want great games. We want all these things
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.560]   they were touching was about empowering creators to make the projects that either can't exist
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.080]   because the business model doesn't work or they have to mutilate the content to make
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.720]   it fit a paper, a subscription or a paper purchase or an in-app purchase business model.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.480]   They really wanted to let JJ Abrams, Steven Spielberg, and all these people make the stories
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.240]   they want to make. They want to let all the people who are making the magazines and making
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.480]   the newspapers tell the journalism and the essays that they want to tell. Even the video
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.080]   game producers and some of them were saying there's just no way to make this game that
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.480]   I want to make and fit it into the current clash of clans, Fortnite business model and
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.600]   they're giving me the opportunity to make it. That all played really well. But then watching
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   it back, it reminded me of the iPhone SDK event, but they were just like demo after demo
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.920]   without the excitement of being. Because when you're live and you see Oprah or Jason
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.920]   Moa or Jennifer, it's like, "Oh my God!" And people were turning around in their seats,
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.120]   trying to get them in the selfie frame as they were sitting in the audience. But just
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.080]   watching it on TV, it's like, "I was done after Steven Spielberg."
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.360]   Well, actually, your perspective is interesting because we were so focused on the fact that
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.280]   this is Apple, kind of the new Apple, the services Apple versus the hardware business
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.280]   Apple. I didn't really think about it, but you're absolutely right. Every single product
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.800]   on that stage was all about making a venue for content creators to reach Apple users.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.680]   I was not expecting that. I'd heard about rumors of Arcade, but I didn't know how it
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.480]   would square because people who make clash of clans or Pokemon go who are making a fortune
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.120]   on in-app transactions are never going to give that away to join a subscription model.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.640]   And if you just let people be part of the subscription model, they're just going to
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.360]   program for attention the way a casino does and do all the instant and ego gratification
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.840]   stuff that results in the Facebook newsfeed or YouTube recommended and all the problems
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.120]   that come with that. And it never occurred to me that Apple would actually help fund
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.240]   and help develop an original set of games for iOS and for Mac because they're going
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.920]   to make the Mac an equal citizen in this, which is exciting. Not Apple watch yet, but
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.840]   basically every other device. And that was sort of the deal with this is they're not
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.720]   even just hand picking people, they're making partnerships and making, I don't want to call
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.840]   them first party games because they're not being driven by Apple, but they're definitely
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.600]   like second party cooperative sort of games. And that was really, really interesting to
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.800]   me. It's going to reduce the amount of content they have at launch. Absolutely. It's not
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.320]   like Apple music or Spotify where it's every game you've ever wanted all for one price.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.360]   It's like 100 games at launch, but in 125 countries and some of those games looked really, really
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:33.080]   good. So in a way, again, a new perspective, Apple's doing the same thing with games that
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.800]   they're doing with TV. They're actually creating content for a service. Is that right? I mean,
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.520]   are they it's like one step removed. It's in between. It's not like because they're not
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.280]   they didn't hire a couple of game executives and say, go make us 100 games. Right. But they
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.560]   did hire a ton like there was a ton of people that I vaguely knew from the gaming industry,
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.880]   but I'd never seen it Apple before and are now working at Apple. Like whole teams have
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.400]   staffed up for this in whole new areas and categories that just their only job is to
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.720]   make sure that Apple Arcade doesn't just launch, but launches really, really well. And Apple
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.640]   is despite Apple making a lot of money, they still remember having no money and they're
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.880]   often the stingiest, especially internally organizations and watching them spend like
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.000]   on on all the internal components you need to sort of shepherd a launch to me show that
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.240]   they were like really interested in in having this do well. Yeah, I still wish they'd given
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.760]   us more details. That's my response to pretty much every topic from last week. Yeah. Yeah,
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.080]   but it's it's it's all in the nickels and all in all the dimes, like how are they making
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.080]   sure that these developers are going to be happy with the deal? Do the developers get
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.720]   this IP back if they want to after a certain amount of time? Like if they've been if they've
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.720]   developed a big audience for this original content, original characters and suddenly
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.200]   they want to make an Android version of this game after a certain amount of exclusivity
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.400]   or they're free to do so. So we're going to hear a lot more before we really all decide
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.960]   what's what's going to be the upper of the down about this. But I agree that it's really
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.520]   nice that it's okay. Sorry, go ahead. No, I did I did ask like a bunch of questions.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.840]   One of the things is they're not talking about like so they did Apple Apple TV is coming
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.120]   out. Apple Music's already on Android. Apple TV is coming out even like on Tizen, which
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.720]   is really odd. And I did ask about Android. And the thing is that they explain it's not
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.820]   like just move your TV streaming where all you have to do is point a stream and make
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.520]   a target client. All these apps are being written specifically to perform really, really
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.520]   well on iOS devices. And they they never said we're never making this for Android, but
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.880]   they're not using like emulators or a lot of the third party stuff. You know, maybe
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.320]   some of the individual developers are, but they're not targeting unity. They're not targeting
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:43.460]   the unreal. They're really trying to make apps and the max side too, which is traditionally
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.560]   given very little love. And that would be non trivial to port over to Android, at least
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.840]   initially. Oh, I wasn't having the Android story. Oh, yeah, no, I'm sorry. I wasn't
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.760]   meaning specifically when are these things going to come to Android. I meant that if
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:02.800]   I write if I write a game that gets accepted into Apple Arcade, is it always going to be
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.360]   exclusively Apple as a part of the agreement that I have to sign? Or do I get it? Do they
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.320]   get an exclusive for let's say one year after which I can now do whatever I want with it,
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:18.080]   which could be a really big deal if we if we think about a game not just as the game itself,
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.080]   but also the world and the characters and a lot of the intellectual property and the
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.840]   trademarks of it. So I was I was keen to see what the terms of the deal are that what
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.880]   you I'm sure that they have to give Apple some window of exclusivity. But I don't know
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.960]   if it's I would like to know if it's permanent or whether they're just going to say for the
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:40.000]   first year, it's ours after a year. We're going to be wanting to bring fresh meat in anyway.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.480]   So yes, you can have this back and make it a regular app store game or port it to some
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.160]   place else or do whatever you want with it. And some of them aren't exclude like some of
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.600]   them are exclusive games, but like Sonic is not an exclusive character and Lego is not
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.640]   an exclusive character. And from talking to some of the people around there, they could use those
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.720]   characters elsewhere, but the kind of games they're making, they literally do not know how they
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.280]   would be able to survive making them outside of sort of a patron of the arts model, which is what
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.000]   Apple is doing here because they'd have to add some free to play elements, which they think would
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.680]   gumk up the game or they'd have to add ads, which they really don't want to do, or they would just
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:19.600]   not be able to make the game financially viable. So okay, how much is Apple given them to do this
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.280]   though? Are they is Apple making a viable by giving them a hundred million dollars?
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.040]   It's interesting to me because for a long time, like we've talked about this on the show that,
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.400]   you know, Apple doesn't really subsidize, but they have all these hardware profits
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.840]   and where Google subsidizes by giving you free services in exchange for data,
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.000]   Apple makes a ton of money off just selling iPhones and it sounds like both with TV
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.120]   and with games, they're realizing that if they put some money into making great content,
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.760]   that in itself will help lift up the entire ecosystem. So it makes iPhone more valuable,
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:53.280]   Apple TV more valuable, Mac more valuable, and hopefully that's the, it'll make money off the
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.120]   subscription, but you know, that's, that can be good money. Netflix obviously makes good money
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.800]   off subscriptions, but these are such new services. It sounds like hardware is going to have to
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.440]   carry them for a while. Yeah. Well, it also sells hardware. I mean, this is what we've always said
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:10.400]   that ecosystem plays good for Apple because then you have to buy an iPhone and iPad and a Mac,
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.840]   although it doesn't feel like that's, that's the strategy anymore because
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:20.240]   of saturation, right? It's not going to drive people into the store to buy new ones. It's just
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:25.600]   going to support Apple with subscriptions. That's the whole point of the service. Until you buy your
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.000]   next one, maybe. Yeah. Well, it'll keep you in the fold. It'll, it'll, it'll build loyalty.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.280]   Yeah. And it could be flipping the, flipping the model, whereas we'd always talk about how
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.320]   the reason why Apple has iCloud, the reason why they give away these iMovie and all these other
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:46.000]   great tools is because they want you to spend your money at the place where Apple makes all the
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.480]   money, which is the 40% markup on hardware. Maybe we're seeing a flip of that where they're
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:56.320]   realizing that the fewer, the desktop market is getting more confusing, the notebook market
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.040]   is getting more complicated with all these other players in the market. The iPhone market is getting
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:06.960]   saturated. Maybe now we can use all these new services starting with music, but then going
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:13.920]   into video, then going into games and going into news so that because you already have this iPhone,
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.600]   maybe you'll want to give us 10 bucks a month for this, then 10 bucks a month for that, then 10
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.120]   bucks a month for this other thing. And then by the time they decide that they don't want to do
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:26.720]   max anymore, you're going to continue to be an Apple customer for all of these services that you're,
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:32.960]   that you're paying for. What about Apple Card? We, we, of course, we've talked about it already.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.280]   We talked about some more today with Jason Snow on iOS today. He took over for Omega and Roney for
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:44.560]   the week. But since last week, Matthew Panzerino put out an article, how Apple Card works, that had
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:51.120]   a lot more detail, including, and I have to correct what we were saying for most of last week, and we
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.960]   weren't the only ones, he said, and this is very important that there is in fact no penalty for
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:02.880]   late payments, including an increased interest rate. We had said that, well, they're not going to
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:08.720]   charge a penalty, but the interest rate will go up. Matthew says, that's not the case. So I just
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:14.800]   wanted to correct that you'll still pay the same interest rate. You will not pay a penalty.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:23.120]   But of course it will go on your record. And one thing that Matthew talked about,
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:29.440]   and you know, despite all the privacy, Apple's talking about, they are reporting everything to
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.800]   the credit reporting agencies, they have to. I don't think they have a choice in that matter.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:43.120]   So it was a pay off your card. It was a great article. I mean, I would not be surprised nor
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.920]   disappointed if Apple was feeding him all kinds of information that did not get into the presentation,
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.840]   which should have gotten into the presentation. Because so many basic questions were answered there,
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:57.200]   including, so what happens with late payments? Does the interest rates go up to 25%?
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.640]   Yeah, everybody's reporting that that they would, but apparently that was a mistake.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.040]   That's standard practice in the not very good industry. Well, if you standard practices to
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:10.880]   charge you a fee, but it may be raise your interest rate, depending on how often you do it.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:18.080]   Yeah, but they're not going to do either. He even got a detail where whatever your credit rating is,
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:26.400]   you will be assigned a late finance charge, you know, the usual interest payment based on your
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.360]   credit rating, but it will be at the floor of what that zone is for your credit rating. So it's not
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:38.080]   as though they're going to try to, we can assign you an interest rate of 14% to 17.01%. They will
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.320]   automatically try to, they will automatically give you the 14% rating instead of setting you
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:48.320]   setting you high. So why was this not all explained by the company? Well, that's kind of, I mean,
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.160]   that's because it's kind of complex, even just hearing you explain it. Yeah, they did
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.800]   briefings afterwards for a bunch of the folks. They had financial press there and they had
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.320]   entertainment press there and they had a whole bunch of different things on the whole bunch of
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:05.520]   the stuff. Yeah, the entertainment press is going, "Come on, move on, move on." So the interest rate is
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:11.200]   Apple says between 13 and 24%, depending on your credit score, but like all companies, the way they
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:16.880]   work with the credit score is they tear you out and in some cases, companies will charge you a
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.880]   higher interest rate than Apple will because they're going to use the bottom of the tier, not the top
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:26.080]   of the tier. Again, how much that difference will be and whether it'll be a difference to you at all,
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:33.200]   you're just going to have to, as we said, shop around. Well, yeah, maybe you won't find out
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:38.640]   your interest rate till you apply. I don't know. My favorite part because I'm super shallow is
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.480]   that if you lose the titanium card, they will give you another type of free. Free. Free.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.760]   So obviously you're-- I don't want to flex with that card, Leo. Can you get this card in Canada? Are
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:52.080]   you allowed? No, I think-- I don't have to find out if you have a US bank account and maybe a US
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:58.560]   address, it's going to be all sorts of US only for a long time. Yeah, yeah. So there's-- if you want,
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:05.040]   you know, the footnotes and the hidden details, that's a very good article on Tech Crunch by Matthew
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:11.680]   Panzerino. So it's your sense, Renee. This is from additional briefings that he got and you guys
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.560]   got after the event. I'm guessing-- yeah, I didn't do Apple Cash because I was on the Canadian track,
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.480]   but I did just-- I'm only talking about stuff we can get here in Canada.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.960]   So there. Your influencer's credit score was too low.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.440]   Too high. I didn't get the briefings apart.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:35.280]   It does look like it'll be a cool card for sure, but whether Apple Card will
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:41.840]   be-- have features that are better than any other cards out there, I don't know. In fact,
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.160]   it doesn't look that way. It's the interface in the app that I found really-- like, I'm on record
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.360]   saying I really dislike the entire credit card industry and I agree fully that it's
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:53.600]   uterus and that it-- you know, people go to jail for trying to do what credit card companies do
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:59.280]   routinely. But when you take this business, which is the worst, Apple is doing a really good job of
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.040]   taking all the things that they learned from coaching with the Apple Watch and applying those
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.520]   to-- here's how you can pay off your balance faster. Here's all the different categories of payments.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.440]   And somebody noticed that the color of the card reflects what you're spending on at a given time.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.600]   Isn't that funny? So yeah, yeah. Because they mentioned the different graph colors, but they--
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:21.200]   it wasn't clear that that also affects the sheen on your card. Not your physical card. I don't think
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.960]   they figured that out yet. But on the card-- I need information. They don't-- I'm going to buy some
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.800]   more stereo equipment because I'm not-- I don't want-- I want to close that red band. I want more red.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.960]   On my spending. Yes. Yes. It's all-- it's the same thing as the watch.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.040]   But I was delighted. Like, I have an American Express card and whenever I use Apple Pay or I use
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.360]   the actual physical card, my Apple-- my iPhone gives me a push notification. It shows me the amount.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.160]   I love that. I can go and I can look at it. And that's way faster than any banking app I've ever used.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:53.680]   And if this stuff is all presented in wallet with these graphs and lines and just being mindful--
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.840]   because it's real easy to spend-- like, let's say you're getting a bonus of like $20,
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.680]   typical human will spend that four times over. I got a bonus. I can get a hamburger. I got a bonus.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.360]   I can go to a movie. And you-- like, you know that it's the same bonus that you're spending eight
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.960]   times, but you don't really think about it in the moment. But if it's right in front of you,
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.280]   just being mindful of what you're buying, I think, is a huge advantage and is presented to you.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.080]   As you're going to buy, which I know to me will at least give me some pause.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:20.800]   One thing that might give people pause is you can't write a check to pay your bill with Apple
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:27.440]   Cash. You have to pay with ACH, an automatic transfer from your bank or with whatever's in your
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:34.240]   Apple Cash balance. That's kind of not how it's done typically, right? I mean, if you have a credit
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.200]   card, you get a bill and you write a check. I know, maybe I don't-- maybe I'm old fashioned.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.640]   I get a notification and then I press a little button and then I get a bite to the bite stick.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.800]   So an ACH is the modern check then.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:54.480]   Okay. It does point out, like Rene says, how almost any bank and almost any card can actually
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:00.080]   offer most of these services, but they don't because they're old fashioned. One of the only
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:08.240]   things I need to pay-- I need to write an actual check for. I still do it through my bank's banking
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:14.080]   app, my phone app, because as a recurring payment, because there is no conduit between me and this
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:20.880]   person who gets the check, I have to have my bank write and actually print and mail a physical check.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.320]   It has the only advantage it has is that I can do recurring payments and that the amount of money
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:32.960]   is automatically deducted from my held in escrow. So I know that if I accidentally have a recurring
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:37.120]   annual thing where, hey, thanks for signing up for this website service. We're going to
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:44.240]   build the entire $600 for the next year just tomorrow. But it's important to realize that
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:49.040]   it's not that Apple is doing things that are miraculous. A lot of people that I've been talking
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:56.160]   to were surprised that things like getting an alert for spending limits and being able to
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.720]   create virtual credit card numbers is actually a feature of a lot of cards that are already out
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.840]   there right now. So just like it's important every now and then to check in with your wireless
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:13.280]   provider to see what features could be available to you for just for no extra money a month,
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.600]   it's important to occasionally talk to the nice people at your bank, the local branch,
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:22.240]   not the people at the other side, the 800 number, to find out exactly what services you could get
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.720]   if you switch from one type of account to another type of account.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:30.000]   As the most hilarious for me is that they're really trying to get you to pay off your debt.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.440]   And I had this all my life. I've always paid my bill at the end of the month. I just hate the
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.840]   idea of having debt. And at one point, I got an interest charge on my card and I called up and
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.720]   I asked why? And they said, well, you were a few hours after the time you were supposed to pay it.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.840]   I go, come on, I'm a great customer. I always pay my balance. And the guy goes,
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.480]   let me be candid with you, kid. You're a terrible customer. You're a deadbeat. You make us no money
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.880]   to keep about it. So I'm not really inclined to help you. I was like, all right, let's do the work.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:03.120]   This is going to be great for like brand newly minted adults. Because I don't want to tell you
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:09.040]   how long it was before I realized that I was informed that, well, my credit rating must be amazing because
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:14.880]   I never I don't carry a balance on any of my cards. And I pay cash for my car and pay cash for this.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.960]   I don't carry debt whatsoever. Said, no, that's why you're a terrible credit risk. We have
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:24.800]   him. You have not proven that you can owe people money and pay it back. But I pay my bills on time.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:29.120]   This doesn't make any sense. I'm an upside down land. Yes, I had the same problem.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.280]   Also, as Panzarina points out, there's no point in using this unless you live in the Apple world,
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:41.680]   because without an Apple phone and or an Apple watch, this credit card is just another credit
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:48.400]   card. You don't get much. You get 1% cash back and that's it. And there are many credit cards that
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.240]   offer more than that. If you cancel your iPhone, cancel your Apple card and get to that.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:58.080]   But that's a loyalty. Honestly, it feels more like a loyalty card than anything else.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.960]   I wouldn't say so. It just shows you how much money there is in debt.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:11.920]   And the yes, that's two apples credit. They are giving everybody really, really fine tooth tools
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.800]   to keep an eye on what you owe, how to pay it back, how to quickly make sure you're not just
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.320]   keeping up with the interest. You're actually also paying off the principal. But the thing is,
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:29.920]   13% is a lot of money to carry from month to month. 24% is a hell of a lot of money to carry from
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:35.680]   month to month to month. And it just goes to show you how much money you can make just off of people's
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:42.000]   debt. Without having to charge an annual fee, without saying, you know what, you're giving us
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.840]   so much money and interest, we're not even going to charge rather trying to charge you 10 bucks for
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:56.080]   overdraft. We're happy with that 14, 18, 24%. So that's why I think Apple is being very
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:02.640]   responsible and making sure that people have as many tools as possible for not getting themselves
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.960]   in over their head. But credit cards mean people are going to get themselves in over their head.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:13.120]   All you need is a couple of bad months. And suddenly you've got 18% interest on $2,000 that
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.920]   you can't pay, but you still got $8,000 left in credit. And that's the only way you're going to be
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:23.760]   able to buy groceries until you find a new job. So that's, like I said last week, that's the only
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:29.440]   reason why I kind of wish that Apple was not in this business because it's not a good look for them
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:37.040]   to be getting 14 to 24% interest from its customers. And to be praising that as here's our new,
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.720]   here's our new push into services, here's how we're going to make money without being able to
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:48.160]   successfully sell phones in China or India. And you can't get Apple news on Android either.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:53.520]   And if you were a texture subscriber, and Android Apple has said we're going to shut it down at
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:59.840]   the end of May, and that means the texture is gone on Android entirely. At least for now, I don't
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:06.400]   think it's like texture was a very PDF-y, very old school app where Apple news is very sleek.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:11.760]   And it's supposed to use Apple news format. And I would not be shocked to see an Apple music
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.760]   app eventually roll out. It just makes sense if they want to get those eyeballs.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:21.280]   Actually, for the Riko Vittichi, got to admire his stamina, went through a list of...
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.520]   Do not any Espresso's had to die to make that list, Leo.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:28.960]   MacStories.com. We made a list of all the magazines available for Apple news plus in the US
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:35.680]   for $10 a month. And how many of them use the Apple format, the new Apple news format, and how
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:46.640]   many of them stuck with the old texture PDF style format. He counted 125 magazines using the Apple
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:59.360]   news format and 126 using PDFs. So almost exactly half. And what's your sense? Is that going to
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:06.400]   change? Is ABC's soaps in depth eventually going to shift to the Apple news format? Or is it just
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:12.240]   not worth it for them? It's hard to tell. I mean, texture really was just a packaging of those PDF
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.720]   apps. It was drop dead simple for them. And Apple tries to encourage everybody to use it because
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:20.320]   even if you just look at someone's bandwidth build, the difference between getting Apple news format
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:24.240]   and getting PDF, the amount of storage it takes up, the amount of storage it takes to transit,
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.480]   it's all so much better for everybody. And they're actively evangelizing it. But we saw this with
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.680]   the old newsstand too, is that you're fighting decades of, you know, we spit it out in
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.000]   InDesign and we just moved up from Quack Express. We're not inclined to do anything. But you know,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   as they show off the new features, like there's stuff you can only get an Apple news format and
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.640]   they're working with publishers. And as new things like Oscar season and the Olympics come around,
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.160]   and they'll be saying we'll feature people to use it, it's probably going to help incentivize
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.160]   more and more people to convert over. Right. Right. That makes sense. Yeah. Particularly if
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.080]   they're if one of the reasons why they're doing this is to get more attention for specific
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:02.800]   articles that could then be popped out into the main newsfeed by Apple human editors.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:09.440]   Yeah. It is a pretty close approximation though of texture. I mean, except for that Apple news
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.920]   format, it basically. It's got one huge glaring hole that's driving like, you know, I moved my
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.120]   mom, well, my mom actually moved herself over. She's like, I went to me like my mom's been reading
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:22.240]   texture since she heard about it on Mac break weekly. And she saw she had to move over. So she
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.400]   went and then she's like, where's my list of magazines? I just want to see all the magazines so I can go
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.960]   and reselect all the ones I had in texture. But there's no list of the magazines. You have to search
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:34.400]   for them. You have to hope they get recommended to you or you have to go and search for them one by
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:40.640]   one. There's an alphabetical list. I haven't found it. Oh, yeah. Let me show you. I'll help your mom.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:46.800]   Please do. I thought you were going to say the fact that back issues only go for a year.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:52.880]   And in texture too. Yeah. In texture, they would go back in some cases, many, many years. Let me.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:26:01.040]   Yeah. So unless I'm completely wrong, let me open up news plus go to news plus tab. And then you see
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:05.920]   browse the catalog A through M and through Z. It's right at the top. Oh, yeah, you're right. And then
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:11.840]   you can do it by category featured and so forth. But but they actually they well, I figured there
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.720]   had to be otherwise, Frederico really was working hard. Yeah, that's true. Right? No, I can't believe
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:22.880]   I missed that. Yeah. So she can see the corner. Yeah. And you know, it's a it is a little it seems a
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:27.280]   little different. Texture was a sponsor. So I had a lot of experience with texture because
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:32.400]   you know, these are my magazines. I don't know, you know, some of them are things that they thought
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:38.400]   should be my magazines that seen that's not going to be my magazine. And then I think it's
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:44.000]   downloading yet is it's downloading stuff that you favorite. So that's that's a that's a nice
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.240]   feature. But I can't if I go to Vanity Fair, I can't go back. I don't even know how I'd get to
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:55.360]   back issues of Vanity Fair. But I can't as far as I could tell, go back in time,
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:01.520]   more than a year on most of these. So yeah, the interface is maybe a little bit clunky. The other
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:08.240]   thing for magazines, and I mentioned this on iOS today, it really de dis aggregates the magazine.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:14.640]   So most people are going to use it. Your mom included by just going through the Apple editorial
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.040]   looking for interesting articles, they brokered. And you know, it's apparent in the Wall Street
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.800]   Journal, because people freaked out thinking they weren't getting Wall Street Journal. But with
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.720]   the Wall Street Journal, meant is you you're not getting like if you subscribe to the newspaper,
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:31.040]   you can sit there and go page by page and see everything in the paper where this is a much more
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:36.000]   article by article experience. And I think like they want true subscribers to really subscribe
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.920]   directly still. But if they figure they're not going to get to as a subscriber, they'd at least
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:44.080]   rather get some incidental revenue by having you get all the articles you can munch as part of the
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:49.600]   app. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and especially if you're not, you're not getting subscribers, at least it
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:54.800]   introduces people to your content in a fairly nice way. And they might decide they want like
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.480]   the premium package at some point, move over to you. I mean, this is a New Yorker story, but you'd
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:03.280]   never know it from the way it's laid out. When you get to it, you see the New Yorkers type face.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:07.200]   And by the way, that's Apple News format, right? That's not the PDF style.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:12.160]   Go ahead, Amy. I'm sorry. Well, that's that that's a lot of the danger that's that's involved in
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:17.280]   signing up for these sort of deals for publishers that you want to have a relationship with your
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.840]   readers. You don't want to have a relationship with Apple and then Apple has a relationship with
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:29.520]   your readers because that's that's counter to your to your mission of being being a provider of
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:35.680]   news and retirement services to an actual person. It's hard to know exactly how much traction
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.840]   your articles are getting, what they're liking, what they're not liking. So it's it's very,
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:46.400]   it's a very, very weird sort of calculus. Wall Street Journal is kind of it's own separate
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:52.720]   special case because they're already people who people who spend 40 bucks a year for for the Wall
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:59.280]   Street Journal are are kind of businesses, business people there. This is an expense where they expect
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.320]   that they're going to make that money back because they need this information to
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:11.520]   to go from the 1% to the 0.99%, whatever whatever it is. And so the the the the tourists are not
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:16.240]   are not the ones who are buying this annual subscription to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:21.200]   So it's actually very, very beneficial for them to have a cheaper option for people who again,
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:26.000]   to get the tourists a way to actually contribute money to the Wall Street Journal's bottom line.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:33.360]   But when it but there was a great feature article, I think was Vanity Fair about how hard how hard
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:41.120]   New York Times was was lobbied from by Apple to be part of this, how hard Washington Post was lobbied
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.840]   for this for this service. And a lot of the skepticism that even smaller publications were
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:52.320]   having about again, why what I want, why would I want people to think that they're paying 10 bucks
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:59.840]   to Apple to be given a raft of articles curated articles and publications that are curated and
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:05.760]   given to them by Apple when I could make them into Washington Post readers. So it's it's going to
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:10.160]   be a hard calculus. I don't think it's going to move the needle on news at all, particularly the way
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:16.480]   they've unveiled it as a 1.0. Let's see what they do two years from now and let's see how either
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:23.360]   desperate or how buoyant independent newspapers and independent news sites get in that time.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:28.080]   It's a little weird because I mean Wall Street Journal is weird. So I'm looking through the
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:34.400]   catalog and through Z. I'm here in the W's wall risk web designer. There's no Vogue wall.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.760]   Is this part as magazines only? I don't think the newspapers are there at all because I don't see
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:43.280]   the Toronto Star and I don't see the LA Times. No, you can't. So the this is magazines only. You
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:50.240]   only see the Wall Street Journal over here on the in the gutter and even then you know it's it's
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:57.680]   you saw the LA Times that looks like the newspaper but the Wall Street Journal is I don't know. I
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:04.000]   guess it's the newspaper. I don't know. Also these are Apple news come ons inside the Wall Street
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.600]   Journal. I'm wondering how they feel about that also. You know I see it's the difficulty is that
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:16.240]   if you're going to redefine your business so that you're reliant on getting a slice of the Apple
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:23.600]   news pie then you're not building an audience of your own. You're not not building an ad business
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:29.760]   of your own. You're not building a way to get your own readers to buy other things other than
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:34.320]   subscriptions such as let's say that you're having just you're putting some of your political
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:40.720]   analysts on tour and and having them speak at sort of private town halls where there's ticketed
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:46.560]   at sixty to hundred bucks. Whatever sweatshirts tote bags whatever these are ways that you really
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:51.600]   want to make sure that you have a business that's related directly to your consumers. Apple then
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.440]   can two years from now three years from now can pull the Darth Vader and saying I have changed
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:01.200]   our deal our deal pray that I did not change all through it further. It's a this is why a lot of
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.600]   different publications are very very testy about getting involved in Apple news.
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:10.400]   The way I look at it it's sort of like the remnant business where anyone apples have to do this too
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:15.440]   time was everything was a direct site people would go to apple to get apple stuff they go straight
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:19.600]   to daring fireball they go straight to the Wall Street Journal but at a certain point it changed
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.120]   and people started wanting everything to come to them and that's when we saw apple go on tumblr
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.320]   and apple go at all these other venues to try to reach people who would traditionally
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:30.880]   go straight to them and I think the best model for this is have your own subscription service be
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.960]   like the Wall Street Journal the New York Times have everyone who cares desperately about you
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:39.920]   have the direct relationship and give you 95 whatever percentage of money minus transaction fees you
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:45.360]   make but realize there's a whole other segment of the world that just is casual towards you they
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.880]   are not they don't not like you they'll read you occasionally but they just don't have enough
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:54.880]   investment to reach you specifically and then use apple news use whatever product google puts out
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:59.440]   use all of those things to reach that other percentage of the audience which is huge you get less of
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:04.400]   it but it's so huge it can make a nice secondary business for you yeah yeah we'll find out hopefully
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.320]   they'll hopefully they're part of the agreement is that they can actually talk about what their
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:13.440]   what the deal is and how they how they feel about it a year from now uh any shows that apple's
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:18.720]   debuting on apple tv plus later this year any shows getting getting you uh hot and bothered
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.800]   we're now i love the space race one the idea that the space race never ended yeah that is just that
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:28.000]   hits me right in my uh like realistic sci-fi geek art how about you Andy anything you really
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:35.200]   looking forward to same thing my measure is if this were to appear on iTunes or on the google
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:40.160]   place or something i could just buy without subscribing like hbo shows like already it's like
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:44.080]   when is the next season of archer i don't i don't subscribe to cable but i will buy
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:50.000]   the archer f on fxx and yeah space races the definitely the one that i would go for it's
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.480]   great trailer all you have to do is all you have to do is to have really really bad 1960s uh
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.120]   transmitted video of russians put a hammer and sicker all sickle on the moon and then somebody
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:07.440]   you know in a t-shirt someone in a white uh nasa t short sleeve shirt and tie just looking at this
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:13.600]   headline and being sickened by it that's a okay you know what i your i'm in for at least the first
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:19.360]   episode i want to see the warning show the jennifer anderson and reese witherspoon show it could be
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:24.080]   really good it could be really bad this is the problem with all of this stuff is you just don't
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:28.960]   know until you see it and we didn't even see clips so we don't we saw snippets but we didn't even
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:34.000]   see anything more than a so like a sizzle reel yeah sizzle reel is all we saw so yeah you know i
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.040]   i i'm i'm looking forward to like the second because like you're gonna they're gonna make all
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:43.360]   their mistakes with the first batch of shows just like so many networks have made so many mistakes
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:47.200]   in the past and then the second one will be a little bit better and they really have to figure
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:52.320]   it out for the third split slippers yeah yeah let's let's just hope this not like uh remember when
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:56.640]   oprah got his got her own channel if you i forget what channel cable channel basically decided to
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:02.000]   change itself into the oprah oh n o wn thank you and the for and of course of the big press release
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.720]   it's like here's all these really big ideas and we're gonna make uh television important and vital
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:12.880]   again and after seeing the numbers fall fall fall fall it becomes basically another host organism
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:18.880]   for uh buy buckets of food for for disaster preppers networks it's it's we'll see we'll see
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:23.520]   the good the the thing is we're gonna have to make sure that we don't judge apple tv until
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.880]   now let's say year two year number three well there is a long time well there was a long time
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:31.360]   well there was a long time it wasn't even good it was a long time well there would be on the other
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:36.480]   hand west wing wasn't good after the fourth season so it's very difficult will there be a way to see
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:40.720]   these for free i mean how do they didn't say anything about this sounds like no they're not
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:46.160]   announced so um i got the real sense that this was not a typical apple launch and that like they
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:49.920]   didn't have all their ducks in the world everything wasn't ready but they were dealing with so many
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.800]   outside providers so many hollywood studios so many developers of games that they just knew
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.800]   almost everything was gonna leak and it already started leaking and they just wanted to get ahead
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:03.040]   on the base messaging and they figured well if we're gonna announce x and y we might as well
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:08.000]   announce z and this numbers this percentage sign at the same time so that at least we can put like
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.640]   a the rumors are going to keep going but at least we can put some of like why we're trying to do it
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.320]   up front and they just don't have pricing ready and it sounds like some might be free
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:21.600]   and some of it might be premium but it and it could be they don't have exact terms with everybody
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:29.040]   involved yet yeah like my we just saw youtube hard exit original programming and i loved cobra
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:33.840]   kai so i just want like i i just hope that if there is each show that i love at least apple is
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:38.560]   really the product will see since behind it at this point yeah and i hope it's not always locked to
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:46.000]   apple to apple tv plus because it's i'm willing to be like a season behind on game of thrones
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.400]   i'm not willing to spend 20 bucks a month even when game of thrones is not on or excuse me 10
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:57.760]   bucks a month if i could probably get the rapple tv it's it's it's going to be i don't know what the
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:02.000]   math is like on this sort of stuff if they're saying that no no no if you can only see it within
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.800]   the apple tv ecosystem as time goes by that it's just going to make our our channel more and more
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:11.440]   important or whether they're saying that if you you don't get to watch it while it's being
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:15.520]   while new episodes are dropping but if you're willing to wait eight months that's when we will
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:20.400]   put it at least in the not in the not on the amazon digital store not on the google play store but
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.280]   at least you can buy it through iTunes and maybe when you get excited about when you find a series
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:30.480]   that you don't want to wait anymore for that will get you to bite for the eight to forty one
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.800]   dollars a month who knows they're they're they're searching for like they make the old season free
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.720]   or free ish right before the new season comes out because they're hoping that but i've that's worked
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.560]   on me i get like the first season on streaming and then the second season's out and like why is it
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:48.960]   oh god i gotta wait i'll just buy it the new you know what the new the new the new cbs all access
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:53.040]   version of the twilight zone they release the first episode on youtube for free
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:58.720]   and so yeah that's that kind of gets you but but other shows like again there's i'm already like
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:07.360]   waiting for uh there's a there's a uh gwen there's a new version of uh there of a new series uh drama
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:14.240]   about the relationship between bob fosse and gwen verdon that i absolutely am on tenterhoods
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:20.480]   cooks to buy i will buy the season pass to that immediately uh and of course jock metering out i
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:25.520]   bought the season pass to that immediately all this sort of stuff that i'm willing to buy if i
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:31.120]   get in don't have to commit to a monthly subscription and but if all this were tied up to a monthly
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:37.360]   subscription i don't know if fx fx fx has that series that i want it also has archer it might
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:42.800]   a eight apple tv sort of cool like that could build into you know what maybe it is worth 10
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:47.760]   bucks a month for me to have access to not only the three shows i want but everything else it's so
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.960]   weird because you know there is a lot of talk about subscription fatigue and i've been talking
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:54.880]   about it but then when i was watching some of this stuff like especially they showed the old-fashioned
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:59.200]   new stand and i remember as a kid i wanted to subscribe to a bunch of different magazines but
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.040]   i couldn't afford it so i would subscribe my parents would get me like two of them and i'd buy like
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:07.600]   random issues of the other ones but there was always this full new stand and i just intrinsically
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:12.800]   knew i couldn't have everything so i had to pick and choose and now for the same price is like one
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:18.240]   or two of those magazines i can get you three hundred magazines but now it starts feeling like
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:23.280]   why can't i have more and in whole industries have been folded into packages they used to be all
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:27.360]   these different magazines now it's just one price for magazines all those different music i buy CDs
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:33.520]   every week or tapes before that i buy vhs or dbds and on now i just i can get netflix and i'm now
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:38.640]   starting to think it's too much to pay one price per industry when i used to pay like one price per
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:44.960]   item per industry not too long ago there there was another product with the plus name attached to
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:50.080]   it and we've been watching has been hospice care for the last couple of months i was up a couple of
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:40:01.040]   hours ago but google plus is now no more uh it's uh this april second today is the day google kills
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:10.240]   a bunch of stuff including plus inbox the goo.gls url shortening service a couple more things they're
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:15.920]   all going away but uh yeah i just thought i'd mention that google plus is a bad start you probably
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:22.160]   you probably still have like a few hours left to run the the uh run the uh run the uh the little
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:27.040]   a little tool they give you so you can export all of your google plus content i i forgot about it
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:31.200]   because i i couldn't remember anything that i'd posted on google plus and then when i thought
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.960]   what the hell i did this morning so that's a three to five megabyte package a gigabyte package like
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:43.600]   okay is it that big wow i'll be i'll be keen to see what's in there because i i don't i couldn't
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:49.680]   even remember how to log on to google plus or what button i had to push to get out to it so i'm i'm
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:54.480]   sure it's going to be a really really comprehensive guide to everything that caught my fancy during
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:01.360]   the two and a half months first after the product launched i'm looking here i'm not going to save my
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:08.080]   plus ones i don't think i'll save my circles uh the communities i own or moderate i guess i should
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:14.320]   include those because we do have some communities for our shows and my google plus posts all right
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:20.080]   that's all of the data and uh... was interesting for me because it was the first social network that
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.920]   taught me i didn't have to be part of every social network i don't mean that in a bad way it's just
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:28.480]   like i was already using twitter i was still using facebook facebook and instagram and i just i
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:33.520]   couldn't add one more thing especially because they had no character limit and people would get
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:38.160]   really angry if you didn't write out an entire like paper in response to everything they asked
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:42.160]   you like how dare you how why won't you answer like you're only gonna give me a three sentence
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:46.480]   answer to this blah blah blah and i was like i need to opt out and never since then even whether
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:52.720]   it was apple music or i felt no sort of sense of obligation to be part of any social network anymore
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:59.280]   i feel the same way yeah google plus was the best though and i really think it should have been
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.960]   the social network and i'm disappointed that google fumbled that it was it was interesting and
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:11.680]   i'm i've got as usual i've got a twitter window opened and uh you see that all of everyone's
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.400]   avatars are in circles and that was the that was the first service to decide well what if we
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:22.320]   make them circles instead of squares and now everything is a circle i just wish they'd had
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.400]   very short carat like i came to i used to hate the twitter limits and now i love them so much
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:32.000]   because they defend me from writing myself to death uh let's take a little break when we come back
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.520]   there is new hardware and i have some in my hot little hands and we can talk about the well that
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:42.240]   looks just like the old one but we could talk about the new one how you supposed to find a flex with
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:46.880]   all the new people they don't show that you got the new ones i uh well i'll show you what my solution
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:51.520]   of that in a second but i showed they first i showed they brought to you by express vpn i know

[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:21.440]   so because these new airpods look exactly like the old airpods i've actually used the
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:30.240]   engraving to say these are leo's second airpods actually they're like my fifth so i got these today
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:34.240]   i haven't really played with them tell me rene i'm sure you've been using them since the last week
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:40.400]   we're using them right now yeah um there it's different it's so funny because i tweeted out when
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:44.640]   apple announced them and my tweet got somehow picked up by millennial twitter and i got these
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:49.600]   responses that took me three hours in her dictionary to actually learn like someone's like you're so
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:54.640]   on saying i'm gonna find a flag yeah it was great or someone said oh you gotta be like you gotta be
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.320]   the right kind of bougie to get these or all the brookies gonna cry now they can't upgrade
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:06.400]   oh man oh man it was it was remarkable insight into our our budgeting culture but yeah those so
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:09.760]   uh these are an interesting product because obviously they were announced a couple of years ago
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:14.880]   and they didn't come out and they didn't come out and now they're finally here and the there's
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:20.400]   two what i'd say real big differences one is the inductive charging case which you can get for
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:25.440]   the first generation ones as well you can buy the second gen with it or you can buy it by itself
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:30.960]   and it just lets you drop it on any bog standard chi charging plate uh and it'll top up not quite
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:34.880]   as fast it takes like three hours instead of two hours the charge up but it's just super
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:40.000]   convenient to drop them down and and then head off the other is that apple decided to split out
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.440]   its wireless chips it had w1 in the first air pods and then w2 went into the apple watch
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:50.240]   because they were doing a bunch of stuff they wanted lower latency and lower power consumption
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:54.480]   with on the watch and they decided it would be better to sort of leave the wireless chip with
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:47:01.200]   the watch the w series and move into a dedicated headphone chip for air pods and for other um
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:06.560]   audio gear in the future and so we have h1 now and that does a bunch of super interesting things
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:10.480]   that are designed not exactly for what the watch would want but specifically for what you want
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:14.880]   with air pods and that is lowering latency so it's better for not just gaming but also for
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:20.160]   accessibility because latency is a big issue with that also faster pairing it used to take a few
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:24.560]   seconds especially on ios device it was pretty good but on the mac it would take a few seconds
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:28.960]   longer to chug around to switch which took a little bit more time and to answer a call i mean it
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:33.680]   seemed miraculous when they announced it but over time it's like oh really i can count it too before
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:38.800]   they connect too that's a lot of numbers apple and now it really is super fast answer calls to do
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:44.480]   all of those things and it also has a pro a dedicated low energy process to handle
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:51.200]   uh yo yo series so that you can and that to me is like it seems weird but it's really transformative
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.960]   especially with the other updates they've given serie recently so i don't even have to i don't
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:58.800]   have to have my iphone with me i don't have to have an air pod in the room i can just walk around
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:04.640]   and say turn on the lights i can say play avengers on my apple tv and it just it just does it
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:09.280]   and i don't have to think about it set a timer for this i can especially when doing housework
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:13.600]   i just listen to my music and tell it to do things i don't have to shout i don't have to double tap
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:17.280]   i don't have to do any of that stuff it's not making double tapping sound hard now lio it really
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:21.200]   was it not having to do this is better it's one more step towards her right where
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:25.840]   star you scarlet joe has just responds to you when you talk to like tony stark when he's like
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:30.480]   Jarvis uh what is it like new year's protocol and all the arm ironman armors blow up does it work
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:36.000]   pretty well if i just say hey slo-mo does it what does it be yeah yeah so they really i mean
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.040]   i if you want to get like all geeky on it apple really nailed farfield serie with the home pod
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:45.680]   and that's just dedicated microphones that even if the music is super loud it'll understand you
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:49.120]   and now they're really doing that with near field so the microphones are just listening
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:53.280]   you say yo serie and it'll just quietly answer you in your ear nobody else hears anything
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.840]   the other world is anon the wiser and it just does exactly what you tell it to do
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:04.720]   okay 199 bucks it's a little more expensive than the old ear pods but that's for the wireless
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:08.480]   charging case which can you can also buy separately if you just want to keep your old ear pods
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:14.240]   but you won't be able to put it on an air power mat because bump bump bump
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:19.200]   which is ironic because i think that that's what this was developed for right really is is
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:25.200]   universal wireless charging is complicated in tragic but you can look at the packaging and
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:30.720]   see that these are all circa 2008 air pod packaging and sort of draw conclusions from there yeah
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:36.080]   so you think they had these in the factory they were stacking up waiting for the air power and
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:39.760]   they finally just said i think that the air the air power has been one of the hardest things
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:44.000]   for apple because they are so institutionally driven to ship great artisanship it is so part
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.400]   of their culture and most of the time they're right like they'll get up on stage and they'll say
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:52.880]   you know we'll we'll have air pods we'll have home pod it's a miracle they get like the same way
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:56.400]   it's a miracle that windows boots up on a billion different configurations every day
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:00.960]   it's a miracle like a supply chain miracle that they get the iphone out every year at exact and
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:05.040]   sometimes it takes an extra month for some of the models but it's it's a miracle that that gets
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:09.120]   done and they trust their engineers and the engineers report up to them like with all the
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:14.080]   credibility that they've earned and this time uh you know they they just could it could not be
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:18.000]   done and some people were confused because they're like well there are other companies that have
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:24.640]   three coil chargers like no this was like 30 coils of all different shapes and sizes in very close
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:30.560]   proximity so that you wouldn't have to align anything and also um iphones apple watches and
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:35.520]   air pods all charged differently apple watch has a different charging mechanic entirely that
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:40.000]   requires magnetics and they have different amounts of current and everything that they need to control
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.080]   and as a human you you were not supposed to have to worry about any of that you would just drop it
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:48.800]   down and it would handle it but it turned out it couldn't handle the thermals in that small
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:55.280]   it's small space yeah see that's that's that i think that this one was different though because
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:02.400]   as soon as as soon as it started to look like we knew exactly how air power was supposed to work
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:09.040]   by having 30 overlapping coils everybody i knew who i talked to about this kind of technology
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:15.040]   said that that's not possible that there's they they were they're making it very clear to me that
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:20.320]   apple would have to crack a fundamental problem that no one else has cracked in order to ship this
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:27.360]   and so it seemed like a very very and so i was uh my my relationship with uh with apple as an
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:31.840]   observer and as a customer's like wow they've probably cracked it that's gonna be it's going to be
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:35.680]   really interesting when they've shipped this maybe it'll be a little bit late but it'll be interesting
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:40.720]   to see how they solve this problem and it's very clear that no they didn't they thought they were
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:45.840]   going to but they didn't and so i i that's why i think that this is a different thing there was
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:53.280]   there was a certain amount of we don't we we don't we clearly don't have a working version of this
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:52:01.440]   but we think we can fix it by the time we are committed to actually ship uh and if apple ever
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:06.800]   decides to share the post-mortem of that uh be fascinated to hear about it but for now
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:13.440]   it just seems as though this is going to be into and when apple internally talks about project
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:20.320]   guidelines and project milestones this is going to be a okay now when you say that it will take you
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:25.680]   nine months to figure out the engineering on this are you trying to solve a problem that nobody
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:30.960]   else has solved even though they had ten years to solve it or are we talking about we we have a
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:35.920]   we have a version of it that works just fine but we don't know how to make it look like the way
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:42.080]   that johnny ive and the rest of the design team want to make it look so it was it was it was it
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:46.960]   like an azer laptop now my sense is it was two separate problems originally groover reported
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:52.880]   there was a a uh heating problem yes and then they solved that and went into production
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:58.960]   and then i i think the i fix it articles probably accurate based on the patent that that that
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:02.960]   even though they were able to manufacture this and they didn't overheat or explode
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:08.720]   they could stop your pacemaker or fry your hearing aids because the coils would generate
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:14.640]   so much radio energy yeah coming off the fcc has has limits on what they what they what they can
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:19.360]   generate and that would be a showstopper if you couldn't get fcc approval yeah that'd be that
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:25.520]   well this see this this was kind of thing that the in latte that's very uh yeah well you can also
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:31.360]   sell it i don't know as a as an immersion he's ever country dor do you see reasons yeah but it's
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:38.800]   it's the the only it's these things happen uh apple is uh is composed of mortal men and women
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:43.600]   who are subject to the laws of physics uh this these things happen i don't think they should be
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:49.440]   in there i don't think these should be uh hung up by the longest yard arm over this the only
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:54.720]   thing that really really annoyed me is when the is the the press release was indicated that
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:59.680]   oh it totally works and it's beautiful it's wonderful and beautiful but because we
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:06.800]   unlike sam's song i don't need to say have impeccably high standards it it just doesn't meet our
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:11.680]   high standards and that's why we're canceling this product not because it doesn't work because
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:16.960]   it totally works not because it was it was causing pigeons to die and explode mid flight over your
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:24.160]   office because that was not happening totally not happening all it's because we have impeccably high
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:29.520]   standards i'm like oh for god's sake just just say that the engineering problems were larger
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:34.080]   than you thought you could then you could manage and that you're finally forced throwing the towel
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:39.680]   you don't have to say that oh the thing is we this is this is not the sort of product that apple will
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:44.800]   start as the name to our competitors would do it would result it would ship something like this
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:51.840]   but no no not apple we are far far far too high standards well i do give it credit for not shipping
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:56.720]   a bad product i mean well i'm reading like my reading on that quote was that you know they could
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:03.120]   push out some uh like a quote-unquote airpower that had three coils and say yeah this is airpower
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:07.920]   it's got three coils just a line your stuff but they really wanted a halo product they wanted
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.920]   the equivalent of air pods for charging and they made this whole spiel about how they were going
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:16.400]   to push the chichan standards forward and they just they could not deliver on that and they weren't
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:21.440]   willing to put out a product that was pedestrian that was just like a regular like a chichart like
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:28.960]   a belkin with an apple logo on it yeah it's again i i think this is endemic of problems that apple
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:34.480]   has with their design we saw the the mac pro where they were so focused on we're going to have a
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:39.440]   tower design that doesn't need a fan that they didn't where they weren't able to look forward
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:44.400]   enough to think that what happens when processors generate way too much heat for this design to
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:49.760]   to deal with they had this rocket get into an hour-long discussion about the the about the macbook
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:54.960]   keyboard but they got this fixated on let's have a super flat keyboard without thinking about well
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:56:00.640]   are people going to like the feel of the super flat keyboard and so and similarly there are this
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:09.120]   is not uh this is the problem of having uh of lining up a a a a key a key chargeable device on a charger
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:15.440]   this is somewhat of a solved problem it's not where again i i have i have used these i have used
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:21.040]   these things for years and years and years i do not spend like minutes in frustration hours a day
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:27.360]   trying to trying to find where that sensor is because i i did that i did that maybe the first
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:31.600]   night maybe the second night by the third night you know exactly where it has to go and there's a
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:36.560]   light that comes on it tells you you found it this is a solve this is it's it would be nice if i could
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:42.400]   just simply be half halfway drunk and drop it anywhere on my don't nightstand would start charging
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:46.240]   that's that's that's a that's a nice little flex for your engineering apple watch that made it so
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:49.920]   complicated because if you look at the third party ones they have a whole separate little tower
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:55.040]   mechanism just for yeah apple watch and the way it's not such a small target and the way apple
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:57:00.880]   solved it of course with their their chargers is a magnet and it yeah it goes junk uh i have two
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:08.800]   three wireless chargers on my bedside table one for the apple watch uh and two easels because
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:13.760]   i find easel cheese stands are much easier you just put the phone in there in in portrait mode
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:17.920]   in the easel and it's going to be in the right position now if you could just have the samson
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:21.600]   do both directions at once you could put the samson on a key charger in your air pods on the
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:27.680]   samson and then just stack them just stack them it's ugly i admit on my bedside table but it gets
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:32.240]   the job done they're all there they're all charging oh rumor has it that this time next year you can
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:36.800]   just like stack them one on top of the other like jenga and because they all have like their own
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:42.240]   chargers plug one in somehow find their way plug one in and it'll charge the rest of them
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:49.920]   yeah actually that's what i do with the samson uh 10 uh s s 10 plus is i put my air the samson
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:54.400]   ear pods on the back of it and it charges those fine and then you plug in the samson it's charging
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:58.960]   and it charges the ear pods at the same time and it's that's actually works pretty well i mean it's
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:04.320]   a little weird but it works i have that with my phone i know it's called reverse charging and they
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:10.560]   say uh it's rumor is uh iphone will have it this fall um all right we gotta do something about the
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:15.280]   apple keyboard the butterfly three keyboard this is what happens when you don't cancel so like
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:18.720]   see like we should be a little bit happy they canceled air pod before it became an antenna or a
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:22.720]   keyboard i because you don't want a hundred million people finding your problem you've had problems
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:31.040]   with this rene i know you have andi refuses to buy one uh rightly so video on them um you gotta love
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:37.520]   joanna stirren's wall street journal piece on wednesday in which she gives you a switch of three
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:42.400]   it's not amazing so apparently she's having trouble where they're ease so you can turn them on or off
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:48.080]   to see how it looks with the ease or the ours on or off if you're if you want to read it with the
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:53.680]   most trouble you can switch those off and then turn on double ease and now you're really it's really
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:59.200]   a mess i turned off ease but turned on double ease yeah you want to read it with double tees and
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:08.640]   double ease now it's getting weird so apple says and i think based on this article i think you know
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:15.200]   they had to respond to the wall street journal quote we are aware that a small number of uses
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:21.920]   are having issues with the third generation butterfly keyboard and for that we a soy
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:28.960]   yeah i'm sorry i have to switch some of these things off here um the vast majority this is a lie
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:33.680]   uh this is a lie the vast majority of mac notebook customers are having a positive
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:39.760]   experience with their new keyboard that's not true is it i would say by their percentage it like
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:45.520]   so this is where you get into like how do they mean like 58 percent vast majority is that what
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:52.000]   there's no way for the vast majority of passengers on bowings through 737 max did not crash again
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.960]   have not died yes you know like you can't make everyone happy this is this is for the 90 percent
[00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:03.040]   of people who intend not to cry in a crash so the thing is with these numbers is that they're
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:07.520]   they're like humans aren't used to dealing with these numbers but like if you have
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:12.000]   like a 10 percent return some uh return on something that's catastrophic we're not like you don't need
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.120]   to reach like 95 percent if you have a high like a high single digit of percentage of problems
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:23.200]   are millions of people when you get to two digits of problems that is a a crap ton of people so when
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.320]   you say the vast majority of people you know it's like there are people who use occasionally they're
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.400]   people who don't take and repair this people there's all there's a huge volume they don't know about
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:36.480]   my wife who every once in a while she hits the space barn it types three spaces but it doesn't
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:41.680]   happen all the time i keep saying bring it into the apple store she just suffers that's i think
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:46.640]   a large number of people just go even if you hit like 20 percent you can say it's not a large because
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:50.800]   there's 80 percent we have 80 percent we have a 20 percent the vast majority 80 percent
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:57.760]   this is i i will just say again that apple cannot simply keep saying that most people are happy
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:02.160]   with this it's so we're sorry that some people don't like it they have an actual problem here
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.520]   gonna say it it's holding you keyword comes out we both know that though they're gonna do this
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:09.520]   over and over and over and it's you know will it come out on the new apple a macbook air
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:13.520]   a better if you imagine if they shipped the 16 inch with the same keyboard at this point
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:20.160]   yeah but they're they're gonna say we took everything we learned about went from the old from the butterfly
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:26.800]   keyboard and used it to develop the next generation of keyboard that is actually using cherry brown mx
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:34.400]   switches anyway it has nanites inside it that eat all the debris as you like you like there are
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.560]   people who like i like this keyboard i like it a lot it like i don't like that it doesn't work but
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.000]   i actually i don't mind the like the butterfly keys were perfect and they worked every time
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.560]   i have no problem with the design but i still say that if andy doesn't like the design and apple's
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:51.200]   the only manufacturer and 50 percent of people hate the design that still can't stand like you
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:57.040]   can't have a divisive product if you're the only one making them so there there has to be even based
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:00.560]   on like if you were gonna say all the people are overreacting the sheer fact that you have so
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:07.520]   many people with such a bad sentiment is a problem especially for apple where they are used to having
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:11.920]   these things beloved and if there anything other than beloved that is again catastrophic
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:18.640]   you know it's a problem though when a graduate student in british columbia has made an app called
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:25.120]   unshaky that senses and kills second presses of a key that occurs debounces the key in effect
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:34.160]   uh if you want to get it it's uh it's available at unshaky.nested error dot com
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.960]   uh the fact that that even exists tells you this is more than just a few people
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:44.800]   remember remember the good old days when apple was in deep financial trouble and we would make
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:51.040]   fun of microsoft and del and compact for creating computers that had these pro these kind of problems
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:55.760]   that we would say that oh yeah the stock price is tanking but we would never have a problem like
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:01.360]   that where our entire cpu has a problem with long division yeah like okay yeah now they use
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:05.840]   intel processors so if they do it's gonna hit them anyway when do what are so
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:14.480]   i'm worried because honestly i feel like apple's on the cusp of a whole new generation of max running
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:22.400]   on a 13 or whatever chips on on their own custom design silicon maybe with better keyboards uh they
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:27.760]   have to other things very well including screens track paths are great i mean that's a complete
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:31.520]   redesign that's got to be somewhere around the corner yes
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:38.160]   it feels i mean like the rumor is indicated it feels like it and the one thing is like if we've
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:43.280]   seen anything else with the mac lineup it's that their bandwidth is low um and you can say that's
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:47.920]   inexcusable but it is absolutely what it is they seem to only be able to get to so many max in any
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:53.200]   given year and it feels like everything is gearing up for the next macbook um it feels like
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:57.840]   maklok's macbook pro and maybe this is my own fear that they've given up on the mac
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:03.760]   i mean they they are still one of the biggest mac cut i mean they use mac for everything he's
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:08.960]   developed by us everything they're they're huge mac users and like if you talk to like uh like i
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:13.680]   had to talk to me talk to tom boger on my show about you know he's been at apple 30 years he runs
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:17.840]   mac product marketing you have john tennet you have so many people there that are so committed to the
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:23.600]   mac and you know they they want to make these great products and they're making on the new mac pro
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:27.680]   and i think they did go i think they did go way too far in the wrong direction they saw they saw
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:32.400]   mainstream success with the ipad and they thought that by bringing more ipad style qualities to the
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:37.200]   macbook they could leave that one percent that single digit percentage niche and maybe start
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:42.160]   making macs for everybody and they were in some ways financially successful with that because a
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.320]   lot of people did like it but it abandoned their core community and it created a whole bunch of
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:53.040]   other problems for them but it seems like step-by-step from the mac pro to you know having a 32 gigabyte
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:57.040]   version of the macbook pro just step-by-step they've been systematically addressing sort of all of
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:01.120]   our gripes about the mac for the last and i was afraid it would be just the last year but then
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.760]   they did it for two years now i'm afraid it will only be for two years but i'm hopeful that they
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:11.680]   will continue doing this year after year until everything is fixed i'm i'm hopeful i do think that
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:18.800]   they missed uh they made a huge mistake in not finding a way to integrate touch into macOS because
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:23.040]   it's just they they just told i feel as though they totally missed the boat there and they missed a
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:31.680]   huge opportunity uh and i would like to see some sort of specific effort to bring macOS into 2019 i
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:37.840]   think it's stalled in 2011 2010 right now um and every time that i see improvements that are being
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:42.880]   made to competing operating systems i see lots of features that i would love to see on my mac desktop
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:48.800]   i've can't remember the last time that that apple had a macOS event and showed off a new feature that
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:53.200]   wow i kind of i really wish i could use this on my linux setup i really wish i could use this on
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:58.720]   my windows setup or this is or this is a this is a feature that would definitely keep me as a mac
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:02.800]   user because i absolutely don't want to use a computer without this wonderful feature that exists
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:07.520]   i'm seeing a lot of well that looks good on windows let's take that or hey chromeOS seems to win
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:13.040]   indicated that this is a mature technology let's integrate that or and more more to the point
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:18.960]   here is something that we're doing as we're insisting is an important thing for iOS we need the mac
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:26.240]   to be compatible with that as well uh and i'm just not seeing that same amount of eureka moments uh
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:32.640]   those beautiful elegantly crafted moments of delight that i used to get with new versions of
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:37.120]   the macOS so i don't i don't think that they're willing they're trying to kill the mac i just think
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:44.960]   that they're they're they're they're content to just just like the uh just just like uh mars probes
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:50.320]   they're willing to hey i we're so pleased that the that the solar panels are still out and it's still
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:55.280]   and and and these and these probes are still surveying the surface of mars they're not willing
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:00.800]   to shut it down but they're not willing to do a resupply mission or repair mission to keep it going
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:05.680]   that's the that's my problem with the with the mac right now well and apple's focus is shifting
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:14.720]   to other things of course uh services and apparently electric cars uh news game again again they're back
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:21.280]   apple hired tesla's former head of electric powertrains which is interesting because there's been
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:25.840]   some speculation that apple might not be you at wanting to make a car a physical car but just do a
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:30.960]   software or have somebody else make the car but if you're not making the car then why do you hire
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:37.440]   tesla's vp of engineering and put them to work on electric powertrains that sounds like they're
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:43.760]   they're making a car i'm very confused well it's the same like if we'd been if we'd been around when
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:47.120]   they were working on the iphone it's like apple's making a tablet oh no they're making a phone
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:52.000]   they're not making p1 anymore they're making p2 i mean this is just the stuff that they go through
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.160]   and we don't usually see it but like media is so advanced these days and we know everything
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:59.840]   these days and now you get to watch you're gonna watch all the sausage being made on a regular
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:06.800]   basis yeah yeah it is it is weird though if they if if we believe that tesla is not in trouble that
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:11.760]   uh that whoever is whoever is in a really really senior position for an important part of the design
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:18.640]   of the of the tesla could have been happy continuing to make products for tesla if they could be said
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:24.720]   guess what why don't you leave this very successful career track at tesla and join this company where
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:30.240]   we haven't actually officially announced anything nor have we made any commitment whatsoever to ship
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:36.560]   any sort of a product that is one hell of an employment pitch to say that we we have a secret
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:42.240]   project which means that at any point we could have you working in on the grounds crew at one
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:46.320]   different loop not even at the spaceship campus we could basically play out your contract where
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:51.520]   you're mowing lawns because we have not committed to doing uh doing a product that requires your
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:57.600]   engineering expertise but to talk to this person into yes leaving tesla where you're making actual
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:02.000]   things that you can point to to say you know this component this this new feature or this new
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.440]   reliability i did that that was my team that did that and you know you have to yeah it's okay
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:12.000]   that's the idea it's like it's possible he just had enough elon and like yeah
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.120]   came up i mean it happened with latin and a couple other people right so that's not
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:22.640]   impossible yeah it does happen he he did he did tweet himself right out of the ceo chair that was
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:29.120]   that was that was efficient i don't think that's a very efficient way to lose to lose a very very
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:33.600]   high position at a company that you founded well those darn swiss have done it again
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:41.920]   swatch has won its trademark battle with apple swatch apparently had a campaign called tick
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:50.480]   different apple said well you can't you can't use that we own think different swiss court today
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:56.880]   dismissed apple's objections swatch it contended apples think different was not known well enough
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:02.320]   it's switzerland to warrant protection in a ruling release today the federal administrative court
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:09.280]   agreed saying apple had not produced documents that sufficiently backed up its case so and honestly
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:13.120]   can you own the word difference friends can you own different really i mean
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:18.000]   they didn't capitalize a different which makes me think it really was a homage like they just
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.720]   capitalized the different than i would have not thought anything about it but they didn't do that
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:29.040]   it's clearly a play on apples thing different thing it's funny it's good it's satiety parody
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:34.720]   exception fair use fair use i i i think that their response to the lawsuit must have been just
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:41.280]   one word in an emoji just really you're really going to sue over this you really
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:46.720]   go i mean fine we got lawyers too and they need to keep you kept busy but really okay fine i think
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:52.480]   the uh the ad agency uh for swatch has a sense of humor because apparently they also trademarked
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:57.840]   one more thing and apple tried to block it and that failed as well
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:06.400]   so uh the trademark for Steve Jobs trademark one more thing is owned by swatch
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:14.160]   which is pretty funny actually swatch there was to be honest is probably lost a lot of market
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:20.800]   share to the apple watch i would guess a huge amount yeah well i don't know like there are people
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:25.920]   who were gonna buy swatch watches now buying apple watches the thing the thing is with watches is
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:31.120]   that people buy lots of them and swatch is the company that will that's selling watches $60
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:36.640]   Swiss watches to people who want to have just like just who want to have one of every color and
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:41.600]   have a want with one with an NFL pattern on it just just like just like you know Renee buys
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:45.760]   bands or people who buy swatches for the exact same reason they want to have one for every occasion
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:50.400]   yeah yeah i think like that's that's a tricky thing about market share like you you hear things
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:55.360]   like oh this product uh you know doubled its its share of the market it's because they sold 10
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:59.440]   instead of five this year and it's much harder to do when you sell millions but also my guess is
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:04.080]   that apple watch brought added a bunch of watches to the market it's not that people aren't buying
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:08.240]   swatches right is that people are buying a ton of apple watches now and that changes the market
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:13.760]   but it doesn't change swatches business to be fair i don't uh now that i wear an apple watch i'm not
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:18.480]   looking at any other watches in the past when a watch is jewelry i did have multiple i do have
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:24.800]   multiple watches but since i wear apple watch every day for you know fitness reasons uh it's panorite
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.680]   that's cursing apple right now panorite mega i'm not a market for another watch i really am not uh
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:34.720]   that's it yeah so i do think it might cut into other watch sales speaking of which five point
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:40.640]   two watch i was five point two is out adding ecg functionality europe and hong kong and of course
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:46.880]   support for these new air pod twos anything else to say about it it's just it's available and
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:52.880]   yeah if you want your new air pods to work you should go get it oh that that's a good reason i'm
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:58.560]   gonna do it right now let's see install usually i want to put the apple watch on a charger but
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:02.720]   it's fully charged it should probably be okay it might still yell at you because it ramps up
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:07.520]   wifi and then it gets nervous yeah i really likes to put it on the on the charger but i want to
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:12.880]   i actually been putting my audiobook on my watch which is really kind of oh nice yeah a good way to
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:19.760]   do it uh let's see is there anything else if we covered all the stories that we wanted to cover
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:25.520]   oh apple clips has been updated yeah i haven't heard about clips in a while
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:32.880]   uh do you anybody use clips i've used it several times because there was just like there are some
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:37.520]   effects in there that just aren't so convenient to do in final cut or an i-movie and are real real
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:41.600]   easy to do in clips especially if you just want to use them as social media you don't need like a
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:46.640]   pristine 4k output because they have like all sorts of cartoonify and really easy titling and
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:52.640]   things like that but you'll like to do a camcorder filter yeah yeah so extra posters that could be
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:14:00.880]   a chest tape stickers live titles sharing options the clips app all right and it's fun because like
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.160]   it's all it's all apples video teams so stuff you see in here will end up in final class stuff you
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.680]   seen final cut will end up in here it doesn't seem intuitive but like the live trans like there's
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:12.240]   just so many cool little things that they can work on and test out and and move around i wonder if
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:17.760]   i still have it on here oh you do i never took it off oh good i get all the new stuff now
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:23.200]   uh what else anything else i think that's it let's take a break and come back with your picks
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:26.880]   of the week unless there's some stories that either of you wanted to talk about what i haven't
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:33.840]   mentioned oh nothing on my list bueller it's kind of a slow day today because of course we had
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:38.720]   all the announcements the last two weeks uh this week is going to be a little slow in fact it's
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:43.520]   going to be slow probably all the way through ww dc i don't know i don't know because like last year
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:47.520]   we had like red iphones and we had there was a bunch of stuff through april and may just to the
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.680]   point where nobody can ever rest leo so you you never know what's going to happen there could be
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:56.000]   a product red day there could be a whole bunch of other stuff back to school you never know yeah
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:04.720]   so wait for new ipod a new ipods are here our show today brought to you by cap terra it's funny because

[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:22.880]   eight with because it won't work with anything more modern you really need to get rid of those

[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:29.200]   I am so excited I don't want to steal anybody's pickle and let me just check to make sure oh
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:37.200]   nope okay good I'll start pixel-mater photo you can get it right you can at least pre-order
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:44.080]   right now for $3.99 it'll be available for $5.4.99 $5.99 still very inexpensive I think six bucks
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:50.880]   April 9th this pixel-mater is great have you been playing with it yep have you tried it I saw
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:56.240]   the demo I got a demo to me at one of the events oh so pixel-mater these guys really know what
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:02.400]   they're doing they're making they've already made great editing software for the iPad and the Mac
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:07.440]   we've been waiting for really good desktop photo editing software, a disability photo editing software
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:13.360]   on the iPad Pro I'm very excited I'm going to Hawaii and bringing my cameras I am thrilled
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:20.400]   of course I'll install it I have Lightroom but you know this this could be the next big thing so
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:26.720]   I've already pre-ordered it you might want to get I think 20 or 40% off until April. Yeah the ML
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:30.960]   tool is amazing I got to see a bunch of demos with the ML tool and it was just amazing what
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:35.280]   it could do it just a button press this is really exciting because I know these guys are good I
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:41.280]   mean they really are good so we have some really good software on the iPad Pro frankly some really
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:46.960]   good choices but I'll add this to your list and at that price I mean they really could charge 10
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:53.440]   times that I'm surprised they're charging so little pixel-mater photo appears in one week
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:19:00.480]   pre-order it now and a year pick of the week. I've been having a really really good time with
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:08.640]   my Plex Media Server/Media Manager/Media Player I've had my Plex installation for like three or four
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:13.600]   years now I switched to it after iTunes started really really annoying me for the very last time
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:18.880]   and I kind of was anxious for Apple to start making it better and adding features to it and they
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:26.560]   weren't doing that. Plex is it's probably the best solution if you want to upgrade from iTunes and
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:32.240]   you have your own media library so you don't you're not getting everything that you need from Apple
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:40.000]   Music or from Spotify your collection really is about audio files and video files and and streams
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.920]   and stuff like that. What I love about it is that it really is just sort of a box of features
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:52.480]   that if you do nothing if all you do is you you you install the Media Server app on your Mac or on
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:58.560]   a PC or on your NAS or on any of any of the other devices that's compatible with it and then you
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:04.160]   can just access this through any web browser anywhere and you have a full bore media player
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:09.760]   that's really all it takes to in order to do it. What I love about it is that it doesn't assume
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:14.560]   that you like to have your media organized in any one specific way. One of the things I really
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:21.120]   wanted to do for years for instance on iTunes was be able to have separate libraries that are
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:27.680]   instantly accessible one that has all of my all of my albums that I have as complete albums meaning
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:32.720]   I've bought the entire album digitally on iTunes or I ripped the entire CD and there are a bunch of
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:38.400]   other songs that I have that are just a few tracks here and there but if you go into iTunes or really
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:43.760]   any other media player it will just give you what give me album view it will give you a list of
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:48.560]   every single album that's represented in your collection even if you only have two cuts off of
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:55.280]   Abbey Road. Whereas with Plex I can click I can create different libraries that reference the exact
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:21:01.680]   same folder of music. So for instance I have one library that contains all of the music that I have
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:07.760]   in any way shape or form another library that's just all of the albums that are complete albums.
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:14.800]   I can also organize things into collections because oftentimes as we've discussed many times
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:20.560]   of the past I'm a big fan of opera but sometimes it's really hard to categorize like if you want to
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:26.800]   I want to just look at a whole bunch of Joyce D. Donato recordings but some of them are albums
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:32.720]   where she is like the stars like Joyce D. Donato sings this and another one is just where she is
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:38.320]   part of the cast of an opera. I can just create by adding tags to individual items I can create a
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:42.960]   Joyce D. Donato collection so that all of these things I can just click on that collection and now
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:47.600]   from every source available here is all the things that I've tagged with Joyce D. Donato's name
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:54.080]   I can go on and on and on but the big point to make is that this is a way that I can finally have
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:22:00.880]   my music organized for me exactly the way that I want it and the same thing applies to videos too
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:05.920]   and the same thing even applies to I use it a couple years ago they added a feature for live
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:11.760]   TV and DVR so now not only does it record my favorite programs now it's added to my permanent
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:18.480]   video library so I don't have to buy seasons of Bob's Burgers I just simply have them as
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:25.200]   video files that are not going away so I'm really really happy about it you can download it for free
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:32.320]   you have to if for certain features like the actual iOS mobile app if you don't want to use the
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:36.560]   use your web browser if you don't use Safari that costs you something like 40 bucks a year or you
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:42.560]   can buy a lifetime pass for about 175 or something like that but you get like 80 percent of the
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:47.920]   features 80 to 90 percent of the features of of Plex just for free just for downloading but as soon
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:52.720]   as you start to get into it you will find yourself saying yeah this is probably worth the 45 bucks a
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:58.960]   year for me like I said it might take a couple it might take a while before you've got your library
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:04.720]   set up exactly the way you want it but once you've got it set up exactly the way you want it boy
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:14.240]   I'm just never going back to any other system ever flex plex.tv plex.tv and you know you're not
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:20.800]   alone there I hear from plex lovers all the time that yeah is I think the best way to go Renee
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:26.720]   Richie here pick of the week so I've got one tip and one pick the tip is with the new AirPods 2
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:30.240]   that are out I wanted to show a bunch of really cool things you could do with it so I asked
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:36.080]   Georgia Dow to help me she forced me to go to a sushi restaurant and we quickly recorded like 20
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:40.800]   cool things that you can do with AirPods 2 and the whole thing takes like three minutes so it's
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:45.440]   just 20 cool little life hacks three minutes of your time and you'll figure them out everything
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:51.280]   from using your AirPods case as an iPhone stand to sharing them to renaming them to having it
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:55.280]   announce the call so you don't get surprised by who's calling you and you don't have your iPhone
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:59.920]   in front of you just a bunch of super little handy things so I stuck the link for that in the show
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:06.080]   notes what one question did you include in the list of things you can do with AirPods use them as
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:13.520]   an excuse to expense an expensive sushi dinner no no yeah no I'm gonna pull you now Andy I don't
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:20.640]   get to expense things anymore all right I'll be watching this for sure because I'm excited yeah
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:25.360]   yeah it was it was just a lot of fun too like this one is one of my favorites where you basically
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:29.360]   take the AirPods out then you just take your phone on and then you just watch it yeah it makes you
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:35.280]   friends and makes a great kickstand yeah there's all sorts of cool stuff my recommendation to the
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:41.680]   surprise of nobody is the new fall collection of watch bands this is the hyper grape sorry the new
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:49.360]   spring collection this is the hyper grape sport loop and this one is the new grape so you can
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:54.800]   have everything for purple Andy and I share an affection for purple this is the grape Nike plus
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:25:01.840]   band which I really like as well it's not like Thanos purple it's more of a like grimace sort of
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:08.240]   purple really is like grape juice grape but um there I love these like I mean I still maintain
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:13.680]   that the sport loop is the yoga pants of wrist bands because no matter what you do it's just
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:18.720]   infinitely adjustable it always feels comfy and the holes in these make such a difference I didn't
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:23.040]   like the original sports band because they always felt a little clammy clammy to me but the holes
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:28.320]   in the Nike version I really like it just feels like air conditioning for your wrists yeah so I've
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:33.200]   been interchanging between these two yeah this is the old Nike I'm wearing but I really like it yeah
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:38.640]   so they have a whole new set of colors I didn't go thankfully there were no hermez bands that
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:43.760]   call to me for the last two seasons so I've been saving up on extra mortgage payments in the
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:47.840]   meantime but they have new Nike bands that dual tone ones that are really nice they have new
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:52.400]   leather loops they have new sport loops new sport bands all those things are all up on apple.com for
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:59.120]   your your watch addiction purposes. Somebody probably makes a living making up names for the colors
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:07.200]   on the spearmint Delft Blue Papaya Stone. Papaya is super popular this year too. I like papaya except
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:12.000]   I want to eat it. I'm really feeling the Delft Blue I saw I saw a picture of someone with an
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.920]   iPhone case in Delft Blue that's yeah that's that's speaking to me that's just glue to me yeah so
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:23.280]   do you coordinate your bands and your cases? I saw so many people especially those in California
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:28.240]   that did that and I was like do you have more than one like yes I have more than one oh my god
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:32.400]   you know that's that's why you know Herb Tarlick would never leave unless his belt and his shoes
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:38.400]   had were the same color. They went so you should have white shoes. Ooh that cerulean sport loop is
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:43.920]   coming out to me that's the lilac and they've got sort of those two tone things like sort of
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:48.960]   shit like because this one is both blue and purple and a sort of irichescent in the light yeah it's
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:54.080]   shimmery. Yeah I'm a fan I have a couple of sport loops. I don't know if I need any more.
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:27:00.960]   Fastest way apples ever freaking out to separate me from my money. We know you have a problem Renee.
