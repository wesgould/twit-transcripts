[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Renee Richie is off somewhere getting briefings I'd guess from Apple.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.320]   But Christina Warren has agreed to fill in, which is great. Andy Inako is also here.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.360]   Alex Lindsey. And what are we going to talk about? What do you think? The brand new Mac books,
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.080]   just some really interesting information about the chip, what it can do,
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.840]   its potentiality, and some speculation about what's next from Apple. This is a very exciting
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.240]   time to be a Macintosh user. And we'll talk all about it next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.720]   whole day. The show where you cover the latest news from Apple. Renee Richie, as expected, is
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.160]   somewhere. Don't know where. Getting something. We don't know what. But I'm glad to say Christina
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.960]   Warren has agreed to join us. She's of course a longtime Mac fan. I've been on the show many
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.760]   times before. Now senior developer advocate at Microsoft, senior cloud advocate, and always good
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.960]   to have you on Christina. And you ordered already. I see I hear. I did. I already ordered. And also,
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:43.280]   I'm wearing my my ATP M1 shirt. If you see this. This is this is this is this is this is this
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.480]   shirt that came up with the last year for the tech podcast, accidental tech podcast. And I figured
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.840]   to be fitting that I would wear my M1 podcast my M1 shirt now that it's obsolete now that we have
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.320]   the M1 pro and Max. And that's what we're going to talk about today. Andy Inako is also here
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.960]   from WGBH in Boston. Good to see you, Andy. He's busy trying to order a pixel phone as am I.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.880]   No, no, no, no. I've given up trying to order a pixel phone. I have this
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.800]   mankind was born under trouble just as surely as the sparks fly upward stuff said in the book of
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.000]   Job. And I don't think Job had it half as bad as Job would have been impatient had he had to
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.080]   order a pixel phone. Apparently the sites just broken. It's just broken. And a lot of people who
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.800]   like us who had been ordering for hours, Jeff Jarvis just tweeted he'd been on, you know,
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.200]   check trying to check out for an hour when he finally finally got a message. No, it's all sold
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.240]   out. Never mind. Yeah, you got that too. Yeah, I'm still hitting refresh. Also with this, Alex
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.760]   Lindsey, I just want to know how disappointed you are, Alex, that you didn't get a new Mac Mini.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.240]   Well, I'm not buying the book, the Mac book yet. So I'm holding out. I'm going to see if I can,
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.280]   it's so tempting. But I was kind of like, I really don't need a Mac. Another Mac book for
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.520]   right now. I just got one. I have a 2020 that's relatively in its last version. And it's
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.040]   so tempting to get one when you look at the chips. But I was like, I really, what I really need is
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.640]   that inside of a Mac Mini. We're going to talk about all the specs and so forth in a little bit
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.360]   because there's a lot to say. But maybe we'll do the high level conversation first. Apple did not
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.000]   announce a Mac Mini. In fact, Apple's event scared me a little bit, started by talking about colors
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.440]   for the HomePod Mini. Oh God, what canceled? What product failed in testing?
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.600]   Yeah, maybe that's where the Mac Mini was going to be. And yeah, exactly.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.200]   They're like, we have any of the Mac Minis that we can show? No, we're not done yet with them.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.880]   Yeah, we need it. Need another week. We have the whole time yet. We can't get the
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.960]   we can't get them to cool down and put the sticker on. What else do we have that small?
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.200]   No, because we got the go the rooms and we got to put them in the mini thing. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:09.200]   Okay, so now they're in colors. I couldn't care less. Then they announced these as long-awaited
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:19.920]   AirPods, the third generation at 179 Smackaroonies, which I guess they're kind of like Pro Juniors
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:27.600]   in a way. Yeah, you get the adaptive EQ. You don't get the noise cancellation. You get the better fit.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.760]   So that's it's not a small markdown. So that there are a lot of people who are going to say,
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.440]   well, any earbuds don't do great noise cancellation. Anyway, I'd much rather have some extra money in
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.080]   my pocket. The other thing that I thought was equally good was that they cut the price of the
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.080]   the AirPods nothing down to not nothing, but close to like what commodity earbuds go for. So now
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.400]   they're very much more affordable for a lot of people who either tend to lose earbuds and they
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   don't want to risk for $300 on something that they might be limited to mono in about two and a half
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.560]   weeks time on the subway. I think that's a really great thing. It's also a good trend for Apple
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.600]   consistently saying rather than take the cheaper the original version off the market, we're going to
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.120]   continue to make them, but we're going to cut the price way down. I think that's a really good
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.800]   thing that Apple's been doing. Yes. So they're on some right. Yeah. On some of my older AirPods,
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.520]   I did do the tests, the washer tests, you know, for everybody. Sometimes they say it actually
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.640]   very generous quality of the AirPod. Mine did not. It actually just stopped working.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.160]   Every I wonder though, every pair of I have to stop working as well. So I think you're close.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.720]   I think that we have to think about like, but was it cold or hot or warm? I mean, which one
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.640]   actually I have had friends that have watched them and they said they got rid of all the air,
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.000]   the earwax and everything else and it worked great, but don't recommend it. Don't wreck it.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.240]   Don't wreck it. Not my experience. Not our experience.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.520]   Somebody pointed out I did miss something. In fact, at first I didn't understand it.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:04.720]   They said a voice only version of Apple music for five bucks. But really that's a price cut.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.480]   It means if you don't want to make playlists, if you don't want to interact with it in any way,
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:16.080]   except through voice. Pandora. Pandora. Without the ads. Without the ads. And without, you know,
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.600]   and I don't think it'll just play. I think you need to keep on asking it what you want it to play,
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.560]   right? Oh, you can't say play. Oh, no, you're right. It does. It does do radio stations.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.360]   Yeah, you can say radio. Whatever the right is. So I could say,
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.400]   if you want to play an album, you have to say like play this album.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:37.360]   Oh, okay. Okay. Right. Does that feel weird to anyone just but just me? It's like it's like,
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:44.480]   it's not it's weird. It must be an offering. The concept is terrible. I mean, I don't know.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:50.240]   Is it in response to what Spotify does? Well, I think that the I think that the issue is,
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:56.240]   is that it's kind of a gateway drug because the the the issue is for a long time,
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.800]   the only way I used Apple music was so that I could just call out a song and it would play it.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:06.160]   So even though I subscribe to it, the only thing I was using it for was I just want to have access
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.720]   to it. When I say play this, I just want to have to play on my phone. You know, and so that's what
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.240]   that's the market that they're going. I already the market is for young. I've got to think it's
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.560]   for young people. Yes. Already have Spotify. Well, it's also the people who already have Spotify.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.680]   They already have all their playlists. They're not going to do it again in Apple music,
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.240]   but they do want to have access to just be able to call it out and Apple can get a little bit more
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:34.080]   money there and get you used to the fact that the audio sounds for me sounds considerably better
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:39.200]   on my Macs on from Apple music than it does from Spotify. So what happens is if you start playing
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.520]   them back and forth, you stop the big thing with Apple music and Spotify. If you have the AirPod
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.240]   Max or better or you have real headphones, as soon as you start playing the two of them together,
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.040]   you stop using Spotify. It just sounds so much better.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.920]   Yeah. I mean, I would agree with that. I think, though, that probably what they're going after,
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.600]   I think they're still trying to make HomePod happen and HomePod's never going to happen,
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.000]   because Siri's never going to happen. But this is very to me. This is very much a whole like,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:14.320]   okay, you can buy this $99 now in ugly color devices. And we have a competitor of
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:25.760]   a YouTube music or whatever it's called now. And Spotify is pairing with the various Alexa devices.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.640]   So I think that that's kind of what it is. I still feel like the $5 point, I've seen a few
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.720]   people, a few of my followers have said that they're going to switch to it because like you,
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:40.720]   all they use it for is just to call out and play a certain song or station on demand.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.760]   And you have these new dinner party playlists where a place music I would never in a million
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:51.440]   years play at my dinner parties. But okay. Right. But I feel like the big thing is probably to
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:58.240]   try to bring in synergy for this product and for this ecosystem that I mean, I agree with you.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.800]   Alex, I think that Apple Music sounds better, especially if you have good headphones.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:10.080]   But if you're listening to it from a $50 speaker or something, which I think a lot of people might be
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:16.320]   I think that I'm not sure if the Delta is there. But here, I think
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:23.440]   you can buy because you already are in our ecosystem with these other things. So you can now buy this
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.320]   less expensive speaker, which is, I think, priced adequately. I just wish it worked with other
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:35.200]   services. And if you want a cheaper musical alternative that doesn't have ads, you can pick
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.800]   that up for $5 a month. But I don't know how many people will actually be subscribed to this.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.920]   I can only think they did some research or some competitive market survey. Something stimulated
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.320]   this. Maybe they found out that there's a certain category of people who don't have a lot of money.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.240]   I'm thinking younger people, maybe college students who would sub you know, they've got a
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.920]   speaker in the in the dorm room and they would subscribe. I can only think that.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.920]   I think I think this indicates exactly how competitive the music market is and how aggressively Apple
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.800]   is trying to get every sound if they possibly can. The numbers are Apple Apple music has been
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.440]   doing fantastic, but they're still way, way, way behind Spotify. And when you look at everything
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:18.240]   they're doing when they get users, the idea of not all Spotify doesn't even officially have
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:24.880]   high res music doesn't officially have Dolby Atmos yet. Apple's giving you that for free. It's not even
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.040]   an extra tier. And now they're also saying, well, if there's some if there are people, they're
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.320]   basically saying we're trying to get rid of any reason someone has to not even try Apple music.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:39.360]   And cutting the price in half, okay, it would be interesting if you would be interesting if that
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:45.280]   were a freebie that you get with your Apple product, because remember Siri means that you are an
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.720]   Apple hardware owner. But this is I think it just shows how eager Apple is to be a player in this
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.720]   market. And I think there's actually a market for it. I mean, I think that my kids and my wife are
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.320]   probably a pretty good example of the market. We have a original home pod sitting in the kitchen.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:05.200]   It's used almost constantly. It is literally they're constantly playing out and they don't
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.720]   they don't have any playlists. They don't have any they just call out songs. They call
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.120]   out they use the timer a lot. And they don't have they don't have Apple watches. So my wife
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.680]   doesn't want to watch. And so it's so the but the so they're constantly calling out timers while
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.480]   they're cooking. And then they're listening to music. And it's the TV isn't running, which is in a
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:28.160]   adjacent space that that that home pod is running almost all the time. And a lot of it had to do
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:34.080]   with I just decided I didn't want to I had an am I had a an Amazon appliance in there for a while.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:40.320]   And I have the Facebook appliance, but I don't leave it on. And then and then and then I also just
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:45.840]   a little bit of a Google, you know, I have the Google one and I tested them. And the bottom line
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:51.200]   was from a privacy perspective, I just decided to stick with the home pod in the kitchen. And so
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.080]   as a result, I think that there are I don't think the market is massive. I think that there's a
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.440]   sliver there. But I think that it is there is a group of people that aren't building the playlists
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.960]   that just want to just call out a song or an album or a radio station and let it play.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.040]   I mean, I definitely think that's a viable market. Yeah. Well, obviously Apple does too. So
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:14.000]   that's the market, right? Let's take a little break. Because I'm really this is terrible to me.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.880]   I'm teasing the hell out everybody. But there there is something to talk about. We're going to
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.440]   talk a lot about you're just trying to delay the pain of explaining to people how much fun you
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:29.360]   spent yesterday. Oh my God. Everybody was that an expensive day yesterday. But no,
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.400]   Alex didn't buy anything. Christina, you bought one notebook. I only bought three.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:44.800]   I only one. Only one. They're very expensive. But I wanted to get one for review as quickly as
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.960]   possible. It turns out as far as I could tell, the only way to do that was buying a base model.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:58.720]   No, no build to order options at all. So I got a 14 inch with the Mac, the M1 Pro with 512
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:07.680]   gigs of storage. I like it like an animal, but I'll survive and probably probably review and return.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.920]   But we'll see. I might actually be taking that to Mexico because it does come next Tuesday. It'll
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:17.760]   come a week from today. Then if you did any build order options, you could see quite quickly that
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:23.760]   it wouldn't be available till next month. In fact, I ordered as you did Christina kind of a maxed out
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:29.040]   16 inch, which is I think we're going to review and then it'll go to one of our editors Anthony
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:34.400]   Nelson who really needs a high end laptop. And then I ordered one from my, as I promised for a
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:43.120]   graduation gift for an F for an I nephew. And that one, I waited a little while December 3rd or
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:50.080]   December 3rd or December 5th through the 23rd, I think it said. So it's going to be yeah. So they're
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:55.040]   already pretty long out. And that's not a surprise with the supply chain shortages and so forth.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:01.280]   Just parenthetically, I know it's not a Google show, but earlier today, Google had its announcement
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:08.880]   for the Pixel 6 phones. And as far as we can tell, as I mentioned, Andy, Jeff Jarvis and I,
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.200]   none of us have been able to order it. And there seems to be widespread problems with their website.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:19.440]   And it sounds like they're selling out quite quickly. In fact, somebody said the pro is
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.400]   completely sold out in our chat room, which happened within minutes of the announcement.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.800]   So I do have an update while we're going to commercial, I decided to see, well, what if I
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:35.600]   it will now let me put my 6 pro into the into the cart. But once again, I'm getting stuck at
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:42.320]   checkout error code R008. So so so so so far, the Pixel 6 is delivering a very Apple iPhone like
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:49.840]   experience. Actually, starting off on the right. Well, I was gonna oh, I just ordered one. Hey,
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:56.800]   it just went through son of a bitch, they must have heard me. So I might be distracted for the next 15
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:05.200]   minutes. So this so this I was going to say how unlike Apple disorder process is, but
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.760]   I mean, Apple's had definitely the same. It just happens at 6, 5 o'clock in the morning,
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.000]   all of us at the 5 o'clock in the morning. That's true. It's a 5 in order. They just move us so
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.200]   that all of our complaints just kind of are outside of the broadcast. It also makes me wonder about
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:26.160]   the supply chain issues, frankly, that everybody is subject to the there was a story this this
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:32.000]   week that Google had ordered double the number of Pixel 6 phones twice as many as they sold last
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.680]   year, 7 million. But ordered today doesn't mean delivered tomorrow. So that's we'll see what
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:44.160]   we'll see what happens. I think that supply chain problems is very much an ongoing
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:49.760]   ongoing issue. All right, let's take a is it too early to take a break? No, it's all right. Let's
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:55.440]   take a little break and we're going to come back and really dive deep on these. It's a little early
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:02.720]   nobody has one of these laptops yet. If anybody does, they can't talk about it yet. Renee probably
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.880]   will come back next week with some, but whether he'll be able to talk about it, I don't know.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.120]   We're going to see some really well edited like motion graphics videos coming out for him.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:16.480]   All of us take a look at this new cleaning cloth. And suddenly there's a 3D transform.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.440]   Yep. Oh, yeah. Did anybody order the $19 cleaning cloth?
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:27.280]   No. Kind of funny that Apple I they used to include them in the box. I remember back with
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:33.200]   this include them in the box with iMacs and with the laptops even. No, Apple, I love you
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:39.360]   not giving you $19 for a microfiber cloth. Not doing it. Not doing it. No, that was such an easier
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:45.360]   sold back when they had that posh British guy who could explain a chamfer angle on the nap of this
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:51.120]   fabric was bespoke to the product and the glass. Like, well, all right. Yes, we talked me into it.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.200]   You smooth talking son of a. I have to think that actually the and we should we will talk about
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:01.920]   this. The loss of Johnny I might actually have been a good thing for Apple given the basically
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:07.520]   the retreat from the 2016 Macbook Pro and all of its changes. But we're going to get to all of that
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:13.440]   in just a second. Christina Warren is here film girl great to have you and your animal crossing.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.600]   Are you excited about the new animal crossing? I'm very excited. I'm very excited. I'm going to
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:23.760]   get the expansion and pay for the new Nintendo add on service because even Nintendo has gone
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:29.520]   subscription as a service five bucks a month. I mean, you can get Apple voice music for that.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:37.280]   I already pay for Apple one. Yeah, like the premier thing. No, no, no, no, no point. No point.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:42.480]   I noticed though you have left the tags on your animal crossing critters. I have. I know.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:47.920]   Is that because they're collectibles or probably I don't know. I think I'm like the two minds of
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:56.160]   those things. That kind of feels like a collectible thing. I don't know. Next time I see you, I'll
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.920]   have different dolls and the tags will be will be off. I think you should consider minting NFTs
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:08.960]   for your animal crossing critters. That's not a bad idea. That's not a bad idea. It's a little
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:14.960]   more money that way. Andy and I can also hear WGBH embossed it from office hours.global and
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:21.920]   oh, nine oh, dot media. Alex Lindsay, who shocked me. I thought by now you'd have a $10,000 bill
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:29.840]   for new MacBook Pros, but we'll find out why you didn't buy in just a bit. Our show today
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:37.360]   brought to you by userway.org. I am a huge fan of this company. Userway is amazing.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:44.400]   And I love the vision. Every website without exception needs to be accessible because websites
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:51.200]   are public entities and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act mandates equal access
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:57.200]   to services for all Americans. It's also frankly, it's the right thing to do. And of course,
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.520]   you can be liable if your website doesn't meet these laws for accessibility. Userway
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:08.800]   is the right answer. It's very, very smart and incredible. AI powered solution that tirelessly
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:17.200]   enforces the hundreds of WCAG guidelines, the web content accessibility guidelines proposed by the
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:23.760]   W3C with just one line of JavaScript. Userway can achieve more than an entire team of developers.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.960]   And it's fully customizable. I'll give you an idea of why AI is so important. One of the things
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:34.880]   we all need to do is put, and you know this, text alt tags in all your images. Otherwise,
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:41.840]   somebody using a screen reader just sees a blob. They don't know what's there. AI helps you because
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:47.440]   it can recognize the content of images and automatically supply those alt tags. Now, you may want to
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.560]   enhance it. So userway's AI might say, well, that's a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge. Add
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:57.200]   that as the alt tag. You might want to enhance that, say, that's a Golden Gate Bridge, it's sunset.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:03.760]   And I don't know what else. There's birds flying over. You can do that. Userway makes it easy
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:12.640]   to do that. That's probably why it's used by over 1 million websites. Coca-Cola, Disney, eBay,
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:19.840]   FedEx, many leading brands use userway's machine learning solutions to make their sites accessible.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.240]   And now userway's making this best-in-class enterprise level accessibility tool available to you.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:30.320]   Small and medium-sized businesses. When I asked how much I was pleasantly surprised, very affordable.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:36.960]   And as you grow, so will userway. If it can handle Disney, it can handle you. When you scale,
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:45.360]   you need userway. So to understand what it's doing, you need to understand kind of how accessibility
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.480]   works on the web. Every browser gives you, and if you're sighted, you're probably seeing that's
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.640]   the page. But every browser also generates what they call an accessibility layer. That's what
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:02.560]   screen readers see. That's what other tools for disabled users see. And that accessibility layer
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:08.240]   is very important. But your website may not be generating an accessibility layer or a complete
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.160]   accessibility layer, and that's what userway will help it to do. Things like, for instance,
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:17.920]   you need to use accessible colors. Now you want to remain true to your brand and stick with your
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.560]   Pantone colors, of course. But what userway does is it tweaks it with hue and luminance,
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.520]   and in the accessibility layer, there is a more accessible color for people who need it.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:35.520]   The biggest problem I'm told for people without vision or just people with low vision is complex
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:41.840]   nav menus. Those are murder and hard to fix, except userway fixes it automatically. And it
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:47.040]   ensures all the pop-ups are accessible, fixes vague link violations, fixes any broken links,
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.280]   and you'll get a detailed report of all the violations that were fixed on your website.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:57.440]   It's using machine learning computer vision, AI, to automatically fix it at the code level. And
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:04.080]   it's so cool because it works with WordPress and Shopify and Wix. It's cost effective, easy to add,
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:09.120]   same goes for AEM site course, SharePoint. It integrates seamlessly with everything you use,
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:14.080]   even if you have your own hand-coded site. That line of JavaScript fixes it all.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.160]   Let userway help your business meet its compliance goals and improve the experience
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:23.760]   for your users. Check out their free scanning tool. You can go right to the website, userway.org/twit,

[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:47.760]   arranged. Userway.org/twit. Okay, Alex, why aren't you buying the best computers I've ever seen in my
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:56.640]   whole life? Oh, you're muted. See, if you had a M1 Pro, you wouldn't...
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.720]   It would just know that the girl would have been like, "That's talking, I'm going to turn this on."
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:10.400]   I think that for a decade, I spent a quarter million miles a year flying. My whole world was
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.240]   just a laptop. So I just, I didn't even want another computer because I just wanted everything
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:18.720]   in one place, the same ecosystem, the same everything else. And I was always somewhere I'd wake up
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:24.080]   trying to figure out where I was. Then I would then I'd go back to work. And so I was very mobile.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.160]   I'm not mobile as much as mobile as I used to be. You don't need it. You don't need it.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.960]   The problem is that it's not just that I have a desktop, it's that I've kind of
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.120]   collected a lot of stuff in that desktop. And so I have multiple computers and multiple monitors
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:42.800]   and multiple things. And I'm very comfortable working here. And I've also gotten to the habit of,
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:48.000]   we've talked about this a little bit in office hours this morning, that a lot of people travel
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.680]   and then a lot of people travel around their house. I've learned that I don't like to do that.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:26:00.160]   So I really like. I don't mind taking my iPad to draw on things or to go through stuff.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.240]   I actually don't want a computer outside of my office. That's what I that's what I really got.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:10.320]   I think that's kind of a COVID thing that being here so much and realizing that I had to set limits
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:16.080]   you know in my house because that's really is that my I really got that I'm very I really like the
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:23.840]   idea that my tech is in my house. You know, my my thought on my office on this is that it seems
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.600]   to be what Apple is doing because we thought that they were going to announce some many.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:35.200]   Right. Is they're making distinct distinct lines between mobile, the Mac books and desktop.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.120]   And I think what we're going to see and I the real question and I'd love to know what you guys
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.680]   think is when are they going to announce desktops because they've got a Mac mini they've got an iMac
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.400]   that definitely needs to be updated. They're really only offering a low-end small screen iMac.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.040]   And of course then there's the Mac Pro. We know this is going to happen
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:55.680]   you know in year two and they that's another thing right at the beginning.
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.320]   Tim Cook said we're in year one of our two year transition. They made that very clear.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:07.760]   I think what spring for a desktop. I think it's faster. That's why I'm holding out because it's
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:14.080]   it's really hard the the level of the speed jump is kind of dramatic. And so this is the other surprise.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:20.160]   This is they're almost doubling the performance of the M1 which was already remarkable.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:25.520]   Right. Yeah. And so this is this is what's so it was so impressive to me about yesterday
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.840]   that when you look at what they did to introduce these two processors they're still talking about
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.400]   performance per watt. They're still talking about how much heat it's take it's it's it's
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:39.840]   expending. They're still something you don't care about with desktops mostly. I'm saying that
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:46.400]   they're still they're still only building laptop CPUs. And imagine what's going to happen when they
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:51.520]   when they release a CPU a desktop Mac where they don't have to worry about heat because they can
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.280]   put in a fan. They don't have to worry about the die size because they have enough room for that.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:00.000]   They don't have to worry about power consumption because it's always plugged into AC. I think that
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.120]   the there's something really exceptional that's going to be coming up in the next in the next few
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.280]   months probably in the next year. And that's that's why I'm I was a little disappointed that there
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:14.480]   wasn't a Mac mini because this is what this is what I really really want to get a really good desktop
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.120]   version of it not the first version of it. But now I'm like, Oh my god, if this is if rather than
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:25.440]   getting a laptop version of Apple Silicon, if I can get the first desktop Silicon in this M1,
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:30.000]   that's going to be worth a couple thousand dollars of anybody's money. I think Christina,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.160]   you you agree? This is kind of a surprising jump in performance.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:39.680]   Yeah, no, I mean, I was expecting or I wasn't expect well, okay, first we thought we were going
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:44.560]   to get an M1 X, right? We thought we were going to get a slightly improved version of the M1.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:50.800]   I figured that we would get more RAM. And that was really what I was requiring. For me, I need
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:57.040]   32 gigs minimum. I went for 64. That's probably overkill, but this is going to be a five year
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.280]   laptop more than likely won't be the only thing I buy in five years. But it'll be, you know, I mean,
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:07.840]   that's about how often I buy like go all in on a high end Mac book. So, you know, I was able to
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.080]   kind of amortize it in my mind that way. So I was like, okay, I need at least 32 gigs of RAM.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.960]   I was expecting that I was expecting some improved GPU performance. We're going to have to wait for
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:24.160]   the testing to see how good that really is. But the generational leap was shocking to me.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:30.240]   It was really impressive. And I actually was not expecting a Mac mini just given how
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:37.360]   like frequently, infrequently, they update that product. I was not expecting that. But I do
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:42.320]   agree that, and I also just because we didn't have any leaks, I wasn't expecting the iMacs as
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:48.640]   great as that would have been. But I do agree that this does, I think, bode really well for what,
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:54.880]   you know, a mini that is either unencumbered or more likely, you know, an iMac or potentially
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:00.320]   even a Mac Pro, you know, could look like when you don't have the constraints of saying, okay,
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:04.160]   we need to have this performance per watt and this needs to be able to run, you know, the fact
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:09.600]   that it's running at the same high speed, whether you're plugged in or not, is really, really incredible
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:14.400]   when you look at the performance that it's outputting, that it's able to do all that delivered by battery.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:21.840]   That's, this is impressive. And I think it just continues the story about how much and how well
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:30.160]   Apple is done with Apple Silicon and what their chip strategy is and why, you know, AMD and Intel
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:36.320]   are understandably, I'm sure, very, very uncomfortable looking at least on the CPU side, GPUs, I think,
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:41.840]   are different, but I think are very, you know, uncomfortable with what they've been able to achieve
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:48.400]   with the last generation. And then if their, their benchmarks are, let's say they're 75% true,
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.840]   then this, then this generation is going to be even more impressive.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:57.040]   What do you think spring? You think December? You think June?
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:02.560]   No, not December. Yeah, I mean, I think it depends on supply chain. I mean, the fact that you
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:07.040]   ordered a laptop that you're not going to be getting until December that you ordered yesterday.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:11.520]   Yeah. In fact, I just got an email from Apple saying that that, and you should check your email
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:16.880]   Christina, because the one you and I ordered, which was going to be November 3rd, is now shipped
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:23.280]   slipped to the 17th. So there are definitely issues. So there's definitely issues. I also,
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.600]   I mean, well, there are a couple of things. One, and I don't know if this is the slippage for that,
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:32.960]   some of that might be the port stuff, you know, just just the supply chain getting products over.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:38.720]   But in general, I mean, I have a feeling that even though I know Apple buys up their ship time
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.640]   years in advance, I have a feeling most of that has been for phones, which they've said that they
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:47.760]   are not going to meet, you know, what their targets have been because, you know, that they can't get
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.520]   certain parts of the iPhone. I've imagined that's, that's going to be the same thing with these
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:58.240]   Macs. And I have to think that for the desktop stuff, especially if you're looking at a big redesign
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.640]   for something like the iMac and you're looking at new parts and other tooling, I don't even want
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:07.040]   to speculate because usually I would say they probably would have announced it now and maybe,
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:12.160]   maybe March, but who knows it could be June. I don't want to know just because the global
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:18.000]   situation is so up in the air with so many things right now. I don't think it's necessarily a matter
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.400]   of is there engineering ready? It's a matter of can we get the parts and can we produce this and the
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:27.040]   quantities that we need to produce it in? We thought that these would be announced and all the rumors
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:33.040]   are strong that these 14 and 16 inch MacBook Pros would be announced in last June and probably they
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:38.720]   were ready. The mini LED display was one of the things that was holding things up. You think Alex
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:44.000]   will be sooner? I think they could be this fall. I mean, I actually think they could go do another
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   now. I don't think that they need to. I'll be honest, I don't know if they need to do a whole event
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.320]   for the Mac minis at this point. I think they could literally go, oh, by the way, all those chips that
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.240]   you like, they're in the Mac mini. I mean, they've done that in the past with some of the desktop
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:04.320]   stuff, but we would see. The problem is that typically the March announcement is dedicated to
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:11.360]   the iPad. They've done it in the past where they've added the Mac mini into it and it could
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.960]   hit that cycle. It just seems like there's an awful lot of people that are pent up that would be
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:20.320]   interested. Really, the M1 has taken the Mac mini to an entirely different place than it was before.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:28.000]   A lot of Mac minis in the past. We use them as glue and just little servers and things to run
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:35.120]   things. They're the least expensive Mac that you can just have do Mac-like things. The thing that
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:40.400]   has changed them dramatically for us is A, the ability to run iPad apps, which we use a lot.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.240]   And then the second thing is the fact that they're just so much faster. And we can run
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:48.320]   resolve and cinema 4D and all kinds of other things and obviously final cut in motion on them.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:53.360]   In a way that we weren't able to do in the previous Mac minis. And so I think that there's
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.320]   a much stronger demand for them than there was before.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:01.680]   I agree with Christina. I don't think we're going to see it this year. I think that it really
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:06.960]   makes me think that they really are saying that we are doing mobile processors and next we're
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:11.600]   doing desktop processors. And when they decide to do a desktop version, they're going to want to
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:19.120]   really splash out just as big as they splashed out yesterday. It's amazing when you consider that
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:25.920]   Apple had two huge announcements. One of them was that, okay, the colossal failure of design
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:32.720]   from start to finish, that was the 2016 MacBook Pro. We are reversing all of it. Andy was absolutely
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:38.480]   right. But that was the only a footnote to just talk about how much time was spent just talking
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:44.240]   about silicon, just talking about CPU. And they're proud enough to show in an audience that they
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:50.160]   knew included in an on-tech. Here is some imagery of the actual silicon that we have. So you can
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:55.360]   actually look at it if you have engineers on stuff and find out exactly what we're doing,
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:00.320]   how we're placing components, where we're putting our lithography.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:06.160]   This was, I really do think that Apple's not going to do a single desktop until they have decided to,
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:13.600]   with the next generation stuff, until they really have the desktop part of the story told.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:20.160]   Last year, yes, we did see an iMac, of course, with the M1. We did see a Mac mini with the M1,
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:26.240]   but these are clearly like MacBook Air CPUs that they decided to just put into these new
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:32.480]   current form factors because people, there's pent up demand for it, people waiting for upgrade,
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.800]   it will be a serious upgrade over whatever people would have bought by Intel. But that's not what
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:41.120]   the experience that I think Apple wants to deliver. I think they want to show us a Mac mini, something
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:48.480]   this small that costs well under $1,000 that can absolutely eat the lunch of anything that Intel
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:55.840]   or AMD is putting out. It also answers a really important question because these Apple Silicon
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:02.640]   chips don't include discrete graphics from third parties. Can Apple make a GPU to compete
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:10.480]   with the Nvidia or AMD GPUs? They direct compared it to the highest end laptop GPUs,
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:17.840]   and performance is almost equal for 100 watts less power. Here's the picture you were talking
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:23.280]   about. Yeah, but that's a big caveat there, 100 watts less power. That's a big caveat.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:29.760]   Yeah, in a laptop you might care. I mean, they're claiming 21 hours of battery life.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.600]   No, no, no, I agree. I agree. What I'm saying though is that they're comparison when people say,
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:39.920]   oh, it's going against a 3070 or 3080A, that's mobile and B, that would be a wattage constrained
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:43.680]   mobile version, which is not with the highest in models of those go. Those are the local ones.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:47.360]   They showed that without, they had the, obviously if I can find that graph, but they had a graph that
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:53.360]   was, you know, if it is, and they even admitted it's not it's slightly better without wattage constraints.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.080]   Right. Right. I just, I was just saying like, yeah, they show the graph, but I'm just saying,
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:06.880]   until we get them, I am skeptical about how close they are because if it's, if it's like the
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:11.920]   wattage constrained models, maybe, and not to say that it's not very impressive,
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:16.000]   I'm just not willing to say, oh, they've created something that's as good as a mobile 30, whatever,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.160]   because I don't know it. Yeah, and the thing is, is that one of the things that will be really
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.040]   interesting is I don't think a lot of the benchmarks are going to make sense for a little while,
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:29.200]   because you're really just going to have to test them in the apps because of the way the apps use
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:34.240]   the GPU and the CPU. So they really gotten out of like you can't, those benchmarks aren't going
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:38.480]   to make sense because what does cinema for you do with this? What does resolve do with this? What
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:42.960]   does Final Cut do with this? Because, and how does it, and you have to do some real world, we're
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:48.080]   going to going back into the real world testing because the other testing may not be accurate.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:52.640]   The fact that it's, that they're both on the same chip means that a lot of stuff doesn't have to
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:57.840]   be doubled up between the CPU and the GPU that we have a much more efficient communication between
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.680]   them, all of those things are going to make a massive difference when it comes to graphics.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.960]   You know, and so it's, it's, it's a pretty profound change in the, in the total architecture
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:13.840]   that's going to sit, I think, way above what just GPU speed means. Yeah, the other, the other
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:17.840]   question is going to be remember that when you have these really, really super, super high-end
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:23.520]   graphics workstations inside Windows laptops, there's performance when it's connected to AC,
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.200]   and then there's performance when it's connected when it's trying to go on its own. So that's got to
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.520]   be another good thing to take a look at is Apple saying that, yeah, this is not just good when
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:35.840]   you're inside, at your office, this is also good when you're like in business class,
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:40.640]   and you've got six hours to finish something because, because you're really at the edge of it.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.640]   You know, no, you're exactly right. And again, I'm not trying to take anything away from like
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:48.160]   what they've managed to accomplish. No, no, I agree with you. I agree with you.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.000]   I'm just saying that it's an apple. It does seem like an apple's orange is comparison.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.760]   Right. The other thing that I, I'm concerned with when it comes to the GPU stuff, if I'm being
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:59.520]   honest, and I agree with, with Alex, like we're going to have to see the real benchmarks is
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:09.440]   a lot of the extent that people use high-end GPUs for excluding graphics work is done on like
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:13.760]   machine learning and other things. And those are things like people use CUDA. That's what they use.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:18.800]   They don't use Apple's APIs. They are not going to use Apple's APIs. So in some cases,
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.240]   some of this, if I'm being, if I'm just being completely candid, like this is not something
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:27.200]   that I would get to somebody who's going to be doing work in R or, or a lot of high-end machine
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.920]   learning stuff because AI kit and Apple's tools are not what they use and are not what people
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:38.880]   are going to rewrite their toolkits for, at least not in the next few years. So the impact, and it's
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:44.000]   not like we have games on the back. We don't. So, you know, I feel like it's, it's awesome.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.720]   And I'm excited about it. And I'm excited to do really good like video stuff and play around with,
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:53.200]   a lot of, you know, motion, emotion effects and whatnot. But in terms of the net impact,
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:40:00.240]   I don't know because graphics are not an area where Apple has a big play right now in either the
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:05.280]   machine learning space.
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:10.720]   And I just don't know how, I don't know how big the machine learning market is compared to the
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.520]   graphics market. You know, even, even at a low level, I mean, I think that the last installed
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.520]   base I saw a Photoshop, you know, years ago was 20 million. That was a, that was a, that was a
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:24.000]   perfect. So it's a, it's a really big number. So the machine learning is a, I'm sure it's a
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:30.320]   growing market, but the worldwide graphics market at all levels, not the highest level, but at all
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:35.760]   levels is a pretty, pretty big market to, you know, fit into. So the other thing is,
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:40.320]   it's, again, we won't have really any real idea what the real world experience is going to be
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:44.560]   until we get these, our hands on these. So right now a lot of what we're saying is speculation.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:50.880]   But I'm looking at notebook, check net, which did some calculations. And it looks like a 32 core
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:41:02.720]   M1, M1 max processor, a GPU can do 10.4 teraflops, which puts it in, you know, pretty high range.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:08.800]   That's a, that's a fast GPU. And we have to remember this is only, there's no book,
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.600]   in an open step two in a notebook. I mean,
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:23.840]   yeah. So the RTX 2080 does 10 teraflops 10.07. The PS5 is 10.28. Your M1 max maxed out is 10.4
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:28.720]   teraflops. Now teraflops aren't the only story. You're right. There's, there's CUDA cores and
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:33.600]   things like that. But still that's in terms of raw performance. If those numbers are accurate,
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:38.000]   that's pretty impressive. No, it's unbelievable. Impressive. I think for me, the big thing is just
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.160]   like, is the software going to take advantage of the tools? Yes. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean,
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:46.080]   I mean, I mean, that that's me. And I, I just, at least for the people who are other than the
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:50.640]   highest in, even the highest in graphical workstations are usually Linux based. They're not Mac based.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:55.760]   So like a render forms and stuff. So this is a potential that Apple could get back into a market
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:02.240]   the abandoned. But we just need to see the tools and stuff up. But I feel like the,
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:07.520]   the potential is there. And I think that the interesting thing here within the graphics is
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:12.240]   the reports that you're getting back from again, companies like Blackmagic with Resolve and,
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:20.400]   and with Cinema 40 with Max on, the, the multipliers are intense, like of how much faster 3X faster,
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:26.160]   4X faster. I mean, we, we've been in a mode for the last decade of 30% improvement and 50%
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:32.240]   improvement and 25% improvement. And suddenly we're like 2X and 3X and 4X. And that's going to,
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:36.880]   that is a, I mean, I can, I can definitely see that's why someone like me is looking at the Mac
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:42.880]   Minis is that the idea of stacking, you know, Cinema 40 on, you know, 10 Mac Minis is really
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:47.920]   interesting to me with the new chips, you know, where they, because they're so inexpensive, you know,
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.560]   and so, because I don't need the screen, I don't need all this stuff. I just want to put them in,
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:54.240]   I just want to put racks of them in there and let it go. Yeah, just put racks on racks on racks.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:59.360]   Yeah. And so, I mean, that's what, so the two Mac Minis that I have two M1, the last, you know,
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:04.640]   the M1 Mac Minis and most of what they do all day is they're rendering things, you know, like,
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:09.840]   I just send things over to them while I'm working and they get to do, do work while I'm, while I'm
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:14.480]   working. And, and that's why I don't need the screens. I mean, I, I prefer to have the screens on
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:19.760]   arms that I can move around and everything else. And so, but we have racks of Mac Minis, you know,
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:24.640]   and that's the, that's the real power. And I think that, but these chips, I mean, they're just,
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:30.000]   it's a really, it's a paradigm shift, I think, for, you know, the whole computing industry. And I
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.200]   think that it's going to be very hard for the rest of the industry to really replicate it.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:38.400]   You know, I think that's, that's the hard part is that, that you need all the pieces, you need
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:42.400]   Xcode, you need the hardware, the software, the infrastructure, all of those things, you have to
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:45.840]   have control of all of them to make this work. I think I don't, I don't know if
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:51.680]   Apple's claiming it's doubling in performance in CPU performance over their last MacBook 16
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:58.000]   inch, this is the core nine. They're claiming this is really amazing. In fact, it really looks
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.560]   like the max is all about improved GPU because it's four times faster than a Radeon Pro 5600 in a
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:11.120]   MacBook Pro 16 inch. So, yeah, when you're talking about doubling the CPU and quadrupling
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:18.000]   the GPU of your most recent fastest computer, remember also the 16 inch 99 was very much
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.320]   thermally constrained that that was a big problem. And of course those also get better. So this is a,
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:30.160]   this is a, to me, I thought we would see an incremental improvement on the M1. The fact that
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:36.240]   we're seeing something so dramatically better implies to me that we're going to see even more
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:42.480]   dramatic improvement next year with a Mac Pro. But one of the, this is one of the other interesting.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:47.520]   This is a, one of the other real, I'm sorry friend dropping, one of the other hallmarks of
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:54.160]   yesterday was you notice that this wasn't a, hey, we've totally reinvented the M1 to make the M1
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:45:01.600]   Pro and the M1 Max. It really is building upon what they built last year and the decision to,
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:08.720]   and the elevation from the M1 Pro to the M1 Max is just we took the M1 Pro and added more stuff to
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:14.240]   it and made it considerably more powerful for certain, for certain tasks and certain things
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:18.960]   are going to be very, very relevant for creative professionals. So that's another really enticing
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:23.280]   thing about this whole platform that Apple is not going to have to wait until well, we have to
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:29.440]   figure out a new way to make, to trick electrons into, into going faster through narrower channels.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:34.640]   It's like, no, we can just change an architecture here. We're, we've, we've, it's like they've dropped
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:40.000]   a really good engine into a car that doesn't have any aerodynamic properties that all we have to do
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.240]   is change it. We've built a truck, now we can build a race car, now we can build a hypercar.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:49.520]   It's very, very encouraging for the whole future of this thing.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:55.440]   And I think that the issue is, is that it is just a seamless, like we can just keep turning
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:59.440]   that dial up. Yeah, there, you know, there, yeah, the Apple's kind of known for pacing. So if Apple's
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:03.600]   already going to X4X now, that means they, you know, we have to remember that the chips that we're
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:10.080]   buying today were probably finished two years ago, three years ago, like they were probably
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:16.400]   three years, three years. Yeah, so, so there's, so they wouldn't be releasing them and excited
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:21.280]   about them if they thought they couldn't keep up the pace, you know, next year. And so I think
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:25.840]   that, you know, and I think that there's probably with any kind of new technology like that,
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:29.840]   there's, there's potentially three or three to five years of this kind of movement. I think
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:34.560]   that's what's got everybody spooked is, and again, because it's really hard to do if you don't own
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:38.000]   all the components, getting everyone to write to metal, which they've been telling us to do for a
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.360]   long time. You know, like, hey, you should be really good idea if you started off really nicely. And
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:47.600]   then it was like, you guys, you guys really got to move over. And anyone who hasn't, who thought
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:52.080]   that they could write it better is paying a price right now.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:58.880]   Let's you mentioned Andy that this was a repudiation of the 2016
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:06.560]   Mac books, a repudiation this long been welcomed. This is the Andy was, Andy was right about
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:11.920]   everything I didn't know it couldn't fit it all. So although I'll give credit to Alex, who
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:19.920]   demanded a return of the MagSafe. It's interesting. They only have three Thunderbolt ports and a MagSafe.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:24.000]   You can't charge with the Thunderbolt ports. I wonder if they took the four Thunderbolt channels
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.640]   and took one of them for MagSafe. No, I said you could, but I'm sorry, but I don't know if they,
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:33.120]   I wonder if they took the fourth Thunderbolt channel and made that the MagSafe.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:38.560]   You also have an HDMI there too. So you have an HDMI as well. So maybe they split it. Yeah. Okay.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:42.800]   I think it's probably split. Yeah, that's how I've, that's how I've viewed it because as we know
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:47.120]   from our framework laptops, Leo, you know, you can just, you know, plug in into one of the
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:51.040]   other. It's a beauty of Thunderbolt four is yeah. Exactly. You just plug in one of those
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:57.360]   things and it'll be HDMI out. I'm interested to see, I guess, when somebody does a tear down
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:03.040]   or like an investigation, how the lanes work because I had that same question. And then I thought,
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:10.800]   oh, I guess maybe they just allocated some of that to HDMI. Obviously, they're saying that with the
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:18.720]   32 core version, you can have, you know, like what three five Ks and like a 55
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:27.040]   to be a crazy. It was crazy. Six Ks. Six Ks. Six Ks. Six Ks. Six Ks. Sorry. I had the lowly 5K.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:39.120]   The XDR is at six K the XDR. Is the XDR six K? Yeah. I believe so, yeah. The XDR is six K.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:43.520]   Okay. Yeah. So the people, what the that Fuji 5K or
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:50.880]   the LG like me. Yeah. We lost a whole K. Yeah. Although I might use from Stephen Hackett. Thank
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:58.240]   you, Stephen. Beatmasters pointing out that maybe you're disappointed Alex, no ethernet on the
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:04.480]   power brick. No ethernet. I mean, that's bummer. You know, but it's not, you know, I thought a lot
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:08.320]   of us looked at it and going on. That's a perfect place to put it, but evidently, it's a mobile
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:12.880]   device. I wouldn't be surprised. Let's see what the Mac, Mac, many will certainly have ethernet.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:17.040]   Mac Pro will have ethernet. I'm back with the small ones do on the brick.
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.960]   One thing that I don't think we've had before, unless I miss the update,
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:26.400]   is the also the ability to do fixed frame rate outputs that are actually really interesting to
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:32.400]   us. So in the ProMotion that they talked about, having 5994 and 2997 is not trivial to someone
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:37.680]   like me. It is a huge problem that we have dealing with some of our hardware is to be able to define
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:44.000]   a hard 5994 or 2997 for broadcast. And so and that and Apple's always been in whole,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.240]   almost always been in whole numbers. And so we've always run it through a frame converter to
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:52.800]   get that to get fixed. So the fact that it's putting that out now is exciting. And I'm not clear
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:50:01.200]   whether that was an OS thing or a hardware is the process. I'm a little surprised at the HDMI port.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:05.280]   I feel like with the three Thunderbolt four ports, you don't really need an HDMI port.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:10.720]   You're going to use it so much. You don't like it. Yeah. I mean, I use it, but I also, I always have
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:16.480]   a dongle. So at this point, I'm kind of like, okay, although, I mean, I will say the dongles
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:20.560]   only work like half the time. Like you always have to test them. But I do wonder at this point,
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:25.920]   because things have moved more quickly. I haven't spoken in conferences in a year and a half.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:31.440]   Oh, yes. Projectors. Yes. Projectors will projectors are the biggest thing, honestly.
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:41.520]   Yeah. And like big, you know, the theaters and whatnot. Like when I was doing the Ignite tour,
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:45.760]   you know, I was, I went to, I can't collect 20 different cities around the world. And we had
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:49.760]   a similar text set up in most of them. But in some cases, like I had my MacBook that I was
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:54.160]   usually presenting off of, I always had a backup laptop to, and I had to have a couple of different,
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:59.520]   you know, docs to be able to have either the display port out from the USB-C or like an HDMI one,
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:05.520]   and then trying to get them aligned. So I do feel like at least for projectors and those systems
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:11.520]   is good. But part of me wonders, and I'm curious what what Andy and Alex think you too, Leo, is,
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:19.440]   you don't have to throw me in. It's okay. Well, no, but maybe you. Okay. So yeah, no, no, no,
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:24.400]   but I'm curious like what the panel thinks. Because in my mind, this is 100% a repudiation
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:32.160]   of the 2016 design. It was a failure in every way. This is 100% repudiation, but part of me wonders,
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:38.720]   okay, they probably started on this a few years ago. When they started on this was an HDMI output,
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:44.640]   a more necessary thing than it is even now, because at this point, if you buy a monitor,
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:50.400]   unless it's a super low end, it's going to have USB-C on it. So I wonder if that part of that might
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:55.520]   have been like a relic of like the design decisions they were making, you know, two years ago to say,
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:59.520]   yes, we're going to put HDMI and bring that back. And there's still a use case for it. And I'm
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:05.600]   excited to have it back, but maybe it's there because of the timing and not because of the market needs.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:10.640]   I also think though with HDMI, it's so what we, you know, there's so many of us that use it.
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:16.240]   And it's my switcher, you know, my little black magic switcher, whatever, and as well as, and so
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:22.240]   there's a lot of things that we use it for. And you know, our KVMs, you know, are going to be HDMI.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:26.800]   The other thing is that for there's with monitors, there's only three things that I mean, it's great
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:32.960]   if there's a USB-C, but if it needs a VESA mount, a C13 cable input, you know, so that doesn't have
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:37.840]   any external power and HDMI. Because I've had monitors without HDMI, and then you're constantly
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:42.800]   hunting around trying to figure out how to get into it. And so, so I think that that is still so
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:48.880]   lingua franca of monitors that I think that, you know, just being able to plug it in and just not
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:53.920]   have a dongle for that one thing, I think could make a lot of sense, especially if you're traveling
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:59.360]   and you just want to go into a conference room and make it work. SD card, it's certainly anybody's
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:04.960]   a photographer will be glad to see that, although a lot of pro cameras use other formats, but I
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:10.480]   thought that was I thought that was more odd than other ones. Mostly because I just don't use SD
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:15.200]   cards that much anymore, but but the I thought that was more of like a, huh, like I know there's a lot
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:20.880]   of people that feels just as retro as the HTM support to me. To me it was more retro, it was
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:26.880]   kind of like really do I do that because I mean, I will use it because I'm shooting the Sony A4s or
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:32.640]   A7s which still use SD cards, but I think a lot of the higher end like the R5 doesn't.
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:38.640]   Does it what formats use some sort of compact flash, right or no? I use C-fast.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:43.360]   C-fast, yeah. So that you would still need a reader for that.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:48.320]   Yeah, a lot of this is just that when you put the word pro at the end of something.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:51.600]   What was nice about SD? Go ahead, let Andy finish them, go ahead.
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:57.600]   Sorry, this is what came up during all over talks about the 2016 MacBook Pro. I think that
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:02.080]   when you put the word pro at the end of something, you're not expecting that I have to adapt everything
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:07.760]   that I do to the limitations of this machine. If you're gonna, if it's a useful thing like an
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:14.640]   HDMI port or maybe to a lesser extent in 2021, an SD card slot, if it's a useful thing and it doesn't
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:20.560]   corrupt the power or the price of the thing in general, you have to ask yourself, well, why aren't
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:26.240]   we putting this in? Like if there's a reason why there isn't a micro SD slot on most phones because
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:30.880]   there's just no room for it and it's just not as useful as a thing as it could possibly be.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:35.680]   On a pro laptop when you're saying, please go forth with this with a creativity machine.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:40.000]   Go out and take pictures, go out and edit videos. You, it's the sort of thing that makes you think
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:46.720]   that you spent $2,000 to $4,000 on the right machine. You don't want to hear, yes, but we've given
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:51.920]   you something better than what you asked for. We've given you four channels of chamfert, it's like,
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:57.440]   no, I just really want that port. I really just want that SD card slot. So that's, that's why
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:02.720]   it's such a change from last year where we had a MacBook Pro and a MacBook Air that were
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:07.520]   functionally identical. The only difference was when does a, when has a fan and can cool off
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:12.480]   and run it slightly, slightly higher temperatures. Now we are really reclaiming what the word pro
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:19.040]   means, I think, with this machine. Keyboard, I guess it's going to be the same one as we've seen
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:26.160]   with the M1 MacBook Pros. Still, no, no, no, no, that's silly strip stuff at the top. Oh, yeah.
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:32.240]   Hello, you have function keys and a big, big, big, huge, huge escape keys. The biggest,
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:36.880]   God, no, that should be. That's exactly, escape key all the time with my pinky.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:42.800]   Yeah, it's, it, it, it was constantly, like, thing was always figured out, how do I just turn
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:47.600]   this thing off? Like how, like, yes, I lost my keys and I was upset about losing my keys,
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:50.640]   but all I wanted to do was turn that thing off. Oh, I hit it by accident all the time.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:53.840]   And then it would be constant doing something I didn't want to do. And I was like, I just need
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:57.120]   this thing to just be not working, you know, like it just turns on faster.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:03.360]   Yeah. Yeah. Okay, good. So that's, yeah, you're right. That is a big, that is a huge improvement.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:09.520]   Still has a fingerprint reader. The screen now we're going to get finally these micro LED
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:15.520]   screens that we saw on the iPad Pro. Alex, you want to say anything about micro LED? I know you
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:22.800]   like it. You know, the place that you're going to see issues still, it's great. I mean, it looks
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:29.120]   great. It's, but where you see it is like, with lots of small like stars. So small,
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:35.120]   bright, because of the full of the backlight. Yeah. So all that stuff, you're going to see,
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:39.360]   you're going to see some not so much bleed from these spec, little specular highlights.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:44.080]   So yeah, so the things that are not things that are light over light, but it's light over dark is
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:47.680]   where you're going to start seeing that start to come out. And that's just the nature of the,
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.960]   of the technology right now. And I don't think I think they do it as well as you can
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:55.840]   do it in the price point that we're talking about and the monitors that don't do that are
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:02.320]   really expensive. 120 Hertz is very important, right? You like the higher frame rate?
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:06.320]   It's going to be more important as we move forward. I mean, so I think that, you know,
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:10.720]   right now we're not seeing a lot of 120 frame per second content, but we have now
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:14.960]   cameras that can shoot that and lots of devices that can play it back. And I don't think that we,
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:18.560]   120 is great for games and it's great for your mouse moving around.
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:23.200]   But it's also good for content, certain kind of content, not film content. Film,
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:28.880]   film makers go really crazy when I say that. 24 is fine for film, you know, but when we talk
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:35.840]   about our home movies, when we talk about documentaries, when we talk about sports,
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:42.960]   concerts, and oddly enough horror films. 120 is very compelling.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:43.440]   They're much scarier.
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:50.320]   So much, yeah, like I literally saw, I saw a test clip of a horror, horror shot at 120 HDR.
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:54.160]   And within 30 seconds, I was like, Nope. Like I am not.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:59.680]   Like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it was too much for me. And so it was because it feels like
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:03.200]   what happens is that 120 frames per second at the resolutions that we're looking at now with
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:07.840]   these monitors, it just feels like a window that you're looking through. It doesn't feel like the,
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:11.200]   you'd be surprised at how much that frame, the frame rate doesn't matter in our heads while
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:16.080]   we're doing it. And everything just feels a little bit smoother until you get to somewhere between 90
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:21.120]   and 120 frames per second. And then your brain just starts looking at that as that's a window,
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:26.560]   you know, and, and so it is a different, it is literally a different psychological experience
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:30.480]   at 120 frames per second than it is at. And we're not seeing that yet because nothing,
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:34.720]   almost nothing can play it back, but all of our TVs at home can. They're all set up for that.
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:38.880]   When we think of that promotion or that motion effect or whatever, that's horrible because what
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:44.640]   they're doing, it looks like soap opera, it looks very soap opera because it's adding lots of frames
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:49.520]   in between the real frames. When you actually see 120 frames, when you, there were real frames on
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:55.680]   every frame, it looks completely different. But again, I don't think it's for film, for most films,
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:59:00.800]   but, but I think that people, what's going to happen, I think people are going to start shooting
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:04.160]   120 frames per second. And these devices are going to start playing it back. So if you're shooting
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:07.920]   120 frames per second on your phone, the device will just play back 120 frames per second.
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:11.840]   This is parody with the iPhone because you can shoot that fast.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:18.320]   Right. And what will happen is, is people will start to see it. And then, and I can tell you
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:21.360]   from experience, you start watching 120 frame all the time and you feel like you could have
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:25.760]   lunch between every frame at 24 frames a second. Like, you know, it's, it, and just everything
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:28.960]   starts. What happens is everything looks stuttery and flickering when you're used,
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:33.040]   when you get used to it. And so what Apple, I think when they start to go down that path,
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:37.440]   it starts to get used to it. In other words, you get used to it. And then you start looking,
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:40.080]   and again, I don't think that I think that there's an important function,
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:44.160]   psychologically, of 24 frames a second, which is it tells our brain it's not true. And so we can
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:48.160]   sit there and want, do have them do crazy things and our, and our brain doesn't bother with it.
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:52.400]   But there are some places where 120 frame per second is compelling. And I think Apple's going
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:56.080]   to take advantage. We shall see when people start getting these, but I think a little
[00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:01.120]   underestimated is the thinnest of this screen. It's a four millimeter thick display, which means
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:08.160]   that lit is going to be extraordinarily slim and fragile. I thought of that too.
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:15.920]   Don't open it on your in the in the row 33. That's all. You know, we're careful because yeah.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:23.120]   Now let's get. Yeah, you might want to have a bear plan. Did you buy Apple care on yours?
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:27.680]   Well, okay. So here's the weird thing. So because I paid with my Apple card, because
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:35.440]   why not free financing? They wouldn't let me add the annual Apple care to it on the card
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:41.120]   as part of the monthly payment. So I'll have to put it on my Apple card as soon as I get the
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.960]   laptop. So yeah, I will. But what I'm going to do is typically like with my iMac and my other
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:51.360]   stuff I do to three years, this time they're just like letting you pay $100 a year in perpetuity.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:57.440]   Oh, that's interesting. So I'll just do that, especially I think because it includes like the
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.520]   you know, if it gets damaged, so everything but lost, which my homeowners would cover anyway,
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:06.640]   for the price of this, it would actually be worth it to talk about. You know what? 100 bucks a
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:11.120]   year and you can just extend it on and on and on. I actually think that's not a bad idea. I might
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:17.520]   do that too. Come to think of it. Yeah. All right. Do we want to talk about the elephant in the room?
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:21.680]   Yes. I've been the elephant in the room. Wait, let's take a break and then the elephant.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:28.880]   Well, rear, it's ugly head. And we actually there's also all sorts of little things like
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:37.520]   they implied that the SSD inside was much, much faster. Is it? I guess it is. They acted like,
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:41.520]   wow, you won't believe how fast it is that that while nobody knows correct.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:46.400]   You had numbers correct. It was a lot faster. That's there. It was like three, three gigs a second.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:52.560]   Yeah, crazy numbers. You might not think about that, but that could make it that more of a
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:56.640]   difference in your experience with a device than anything else is the speed of the hard drive.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:04.080]   So hard drive. Listen to me, Mr. Old, old school, storage, persistent memory and volatile memory.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:09.440]   That's probably all you need to. Yeah. And I cannot wait to see what 64 gigs of unified memory
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:18.560]   is like. That's that's mind-boggling. But we are going to take a break and then Andy will be the
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:24.720]   elephant in the room. I we as it's been a lot of conversation about this elephant.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:29.200]   Our show today brought to you by BlockFi. I've been aware of it for some time because Lisa has
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:36.160]   a block fight card and she loves it. She's got her block five black card and with every purchase
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:42.080]   she earns Bitcoin. And of course, now with Bitcoin going through the roof, she has to let me know
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:48.800]   how much her Bitcoin is going up. BlockFi, whether you're a crypto pro or total beginner,

[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:54.240]   following it. I think it was $60,000 this weekend. I mean, I don't look because I know that my wallet
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:59.680]   is forever lost to me. So I didn't want to know how much money is just sitting in it. BlockFi has
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:05.920]   been in the Bitcoin, the crypto business, and a long, long time they were named on Teforbs FinTech

[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:40.560]   Blockfi. I am not giving up on my Bitcoin wallet. I have given it to many people. The deal is,
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:49.440]   if they crack it first, they get it. Now that it's... Let me just see what it said. It was $60,000
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:57.920]   last time I looked. $63,731. I have 7.85. Don't do the math. I don't want to know.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:03.760]   I don't get in the way of that. You know what makes me feel better? Steve Gibson
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:09.600]   put up a Bitcoin miner when this all first began because he was interested in the technology,
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:14.720]   he did a whole show on it. The next morning, he gets up. There's 50 Bitcoin in the slot.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:21.680]   And he didn't think it was that important. So he reused the hard drive some time later and erased
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:32.880]   the whole thing. Now, I am willing to do 50 x $63,000. Oh yeah. I don't like to think about that.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:39.600]   A lot of money. $3 million. I don't mention it anymore. Although I think Steve's listening.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:50.240]   Oh that hurts. All right. Elephant in the room time. There's a notch, kids. There's a notch.
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:58.320]   Now, I have to say even for all of the noise about the notch when it first appeared on the
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:02.880]   iPhone sometime ago, I completely got used to it. It doesn't bother me at all. And I think it's
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:15.200]   even less of an issue on a Mac. Yes. It depends. I mean, it's in the menu bar, right? Your Mac
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:19.360]   is giving you so much more room anyway. I mean, what it is right now in your Mac book is
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:27.840]   just a bezel. So you're getting more. They're eliminating a lot of the bezel. Some of that will
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:32.640]   be dedicated to where the camera was on the bezel. Maybe more than it needs to because
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:39.760]   it isn't a face ID or anything like that. It's just a camera. It does have three sensors and
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:44.480]   it's the camera. It's also the true tone sensor and it's also an ambient light sensor. So it is
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:52.480]   taking up a good amount of space. Yeah. I mean, yeah, it's a fairly noticeable notch. I go full
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:59.920]   screen a lot on Macs. So some of my full screen apps, are they going to have a notch in the top
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:05.120]   there or will they not go as high? I don't know yet. Yeah. I just my attitude is that
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:12.000]   I don't love it, but I'll get over it. It's that I'm looking at my Mac book pro right now.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:18.720]   And there I've got so many many let's install that I actually use that it could actually become
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:22.960]   an issue. It's not an issue on when it's plugged into an external display, but on its internal
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:27.760]   display, it could start shifting things around. I'm not sure how much I would enjoy. I would
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:34.160]   personally enjoy that. I will say though, that I'm relieved that when there's a notch,
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:40.240]   there is still not Face ID because that would have really bummed me out. And maybe. So is David
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:45.680]   Pope's been going on and on about this on his Twitter account. He calls it notch gate and says,
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:50.400]   it's a tempest in a teapot. But somebody replied to him with an interesting thought that maybe
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:58.080]   Jacob Sohn said, maybe this was going to be a Face ID notch. It's big enough to be if you don't
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:03.360]   put the true tone sensor in there and that could be anywhere else. But supply chain meant they
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:08.720]   couldn't do it. So maybe that's that's all that we're seeing here is they wanted. Yeah, my big
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:14.720]   good or maybe they wanted a big enough sensor to deal with low light when you're doing conferencing.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:19.200]   There could be a lot of reasons for this, but I can't get an eye picture of the device in the
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:24.400]   notch. And as you said, it's got a lot of stuff there. There's a true tone sensor, there's a light
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:32.080]   sensor, and then there's a camera. That's the LED camera on an LED. I have to admit that I'd prefer
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:36.800]   them to make it make the noise a little bit bigger. If I got more things in it like the like the
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:40.240]   being able to do a face scan and so on and so forth. So I could just open it up and it would unlock.
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:45.040]   All those things would be more preferable to me. I think that up in the menu bar, I don't think
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:48.400]   it's going to matter to me. I mean, I don't think there's very many apps that I have that are going to
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:55.280]   be affected by that menu bar. I have a lot of things on my computer, on my resolution,
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:10:02.160]   and it's about a third of the way over maybe. Here's somebody posted a mock up of what DaVinci
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:09.360]   Resolve might look at. So the menu, because DaVinci has a long menu, goes right around the notch and
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:15.280]   appears on the other side, that's not ideal. Of course, what they may do is just start the menu
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:19.920]   lower, right? I was going to say they might just lower it 10 millimeters or whatever.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:27.440]   I'm with Alex and Andy. It's not ideal. I have a lot of stuff in my menu bar and when I'm not
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:35.200]   connected to an external monitor, it could be made annoying. But at the same time,
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:41.120]   I mean, I would rather if it had a face ID sensor. I would rather be there for that reason.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:46.880]   I bet it does next year. It is what it is. I'm sure I'm sure I guess from a design perspective,
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:52.080]   I'm not sure why they couldn't just move everything down the 10 millimeters they needed and just
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:56.560]   have that whole line of bezel. I know that there will still be some people who'd be mad about the
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:01.840]   lack of screen-to-screen thing. I just don't know if the notch trade-off is worth it in a laptop.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:06.800]   Like, I understand completely in a phone. I don't know if in a laptop if it's worth it, but that's
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:12.560]   for their industrial designers to think about, not me. I think that a lot of designers get kind
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:19.360]   of bezel crazy. I've read, I'm sure you have two reviews where it's like, "Oh, but damn,
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:24.960]   that six millimeter bezel just keeps staring at me and I want to throw up." I'm like, "Dude,
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:30.000]   I mean, it's okay. It's not the worst thing that's ever happened." But to get back to face ID,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.360]   I would be very disappointed if they remove Touch ID and replace it with face ID because
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:41.840]   I'm doing the only thing that I don't like about my Mac look. Yeah. Exactly. Right, exactly. I would
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:47.680]   like to have it as in addition to the Touch ID because again, right here, I've got my external
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:52.640]   monitor on an arm and it's actually covering what would be the face ID sensor if that's where it would
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:59.040]   go. And the idea that I would either have to type in like a 23-digit password or have to go like this
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:06.880]   in order to unlock my Mac, that's a no-go. And that's the only thing I don't like about my iPad Pro
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:11.680]   this year is that there's so many times where I have to confirm or purchase. I have to double tap
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:18.720]   on the power button, but I keep double tapping it with my arm and the arm blocks the face ID camera.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:23.520]   And so we'll say, "Sorry, I didn't get face ID tried again." So that's why I would hope that they
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:28.320]   would include both the Touch ID and face ID if they decided to do it. I agree. I think that they
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:33.360]   definitely, I would never want to give up. I vastly prefer Touch ID over face ID. I mean,
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:36.960]   it's just never, it's always like I have to look at it weird and I just can't put my finger on it.
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:43.760]   Right. So I really want it back on my phone and I definitely wouldn't want to lose it on the laptop.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:48.800]   But I would love to have both and have the convenience of that. And I'd also like to have
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:54.160]   the digitization appearance. So as an animator, right now what we're doing when we do like rough
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:59.360]   facial animation, we're using the phone as a separate capture device. So we tie that into
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:04.000]   things like Unreal and other things where you can sit there and do and having that
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.720]   information on the, I mean, having that camera on the laptop means that I can be working,
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:12.560]   let's just say in cinema or something like that, have a face and just look up and go,
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:18.400]   you know, and actually drive a face without having to pull out another device to do that.
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:25.120]   And it's, it'd be useful for, again, given that the pro is aimed at creatives, there's a lot of
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:33.680]   creatives that are interested in that kind of thing. So on balance, I bet you everybody gets used
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:38.640]   to the notch. It's an elephant, but I don't know if it's a full grown elephant. I don't know if it's
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:42.400]   more like a smaller Indian elephant as opposed to a seems like we were all worried about the
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:46.320]   notch on the iPhone. We got used to it. I think, you know, this is, this is, this is the sort of
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:51.760]   thing that like, again, if you're a design wonk, you make endless fun of it when, oh my god,
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:56.800]   Apple, I can't believe that Samsung put a notch on, or could a camera bump in a notch.
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.200]   Apple would never do that because they understand design. And then like as soon as Apple comes
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:09.120]   out with it, you know, it's an elegant solution. It is an inelegate solution. I think we can all
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:13.360]   agree on that, but it is a problem. And we'll get over it. We'll get over it.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:17.680]   I do say that I'm very excited about battery life.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:24.000]   Yeah. Both these laptops now have better battery life than an iPad. I never thought that would
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:30.240]   happen. Right? In a million years. The numbers sounded insane. Like they were just like,
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:34.640]   and now it will be 17 hours. You're like, what? And then they're like, and now it'll be 21 hours.
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:40.880]   And you're like, what? Well, the 14 inch model model is 17 hours in video playback.
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:45.600]   Part of that is because there is hardware, video playback, hardware that takes over from the
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:51.360]   processor. So you could actually turn the CPU off. Singapore from San Francisco to Singapore and
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:56.080]   watch movies all the way awesome without 11 hours wireless web browsing. That's that best
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:02.240]   the iPad or close to it anyway. 16 inch model is where you really go crazy. In fact, I might buy a
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:09.280]   16 just because I want 21 hours of video playback or 14 hours. I think that's I think that's London
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:12.320]   the Delhi. I think is. And we should say that
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:19.360]   Apple's pretty good with their estimates. They don't they used to be a divided estimate in half.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:24.400]   Certainly the PC world that's still sorted that way. And Apple's not saying that's how long it's
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:29.520]   going to last in general. They're just giving you two examples of usage. But I think that you can
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:34.880]   expect that that those hours right in that you say, except example, you have rendering 8k out of
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:40.080]   5k. If you're doing motion while you're flying to Singapore. Okay, it's another matter entirely.
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:47.040]   But that's just remarkable. Maybe explains why these are a little bigger, a little heavier.
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:53.680]   I don't mind this as a pro. I would have asked. I would love I hate it when they say it's this
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:57.840]   thin. I'm like, I'm a pro. I want you to tell me how thick it is. And I want you to add more
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:01.520]   battery. And I want you to add more power. And I want you to add all those, you know, more as
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:05.520]   many outlets, outputs that you can do. I mean, this is the pro version. This isn't the air.
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:10.720]   Yeah. Yeah. And took Apple's credit in the in the fine print at the bottom of their page.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:15.200]   They have a lot of footnotes explaining exactly how they did the testing.
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:22.160]   So you can at least verify that, you know, in these conditions, this is this is how it works.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:26.160]   And that's by the way, for all the benchmarks, there are something like 30
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:33.360]   footnotes here on how they did the testing. So good on you, Apple, for being pretty forth right
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:37.600]   on that. Of course, when a non tech does it, that's that's what I'm going to believe it. But
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:42.640]   yes, I think this is I'm sure very accurate. And boy, is that exciting? I mean, that that means,
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:48.800]   you know, I was going to I was going to hold out for the Mac mini like you, but I but I do kind of
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:54.160]   get around. And I love the idea of being able to do everything I want to do. It used to be, we would
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:17:01.280]   say, Oh, it's a that's a desktop replacement laptop. You're only going to get an hour battery life.
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:06.240]   Absolutely. Because it's got desktop power. Now, I don't know, again, I would love to see somebody
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:16.480]   compare the existing Intel Mac pros benchmark. Yeah, to a 21 hour laptop. I think this I think
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:22.960]   this laptop is faster than the than a Mac pro. Don't you? And oh, yeah, I bet you it is. And I
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:26.560]   think that the the interesting thing is, it's not just that it's one thing or another, it's like,
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.640]   it's really, really fast and has really, really battery life. And it really, there's all it's
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:36.880]   the composite of it is is just, I don't know, I think I has a the best laptop out there, but
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:42.480]   it's pretty close. I mean, it's not getting anything at every at every level. Yeah, I keep
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:48.880]   comparing it to every time that I've looked at a top top and power class windows laptop.
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:55.040]   There's always so many caveats. It's always, I've seen one I've seen the kinds that have actually
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:59.840]   two power supply supplies, because it just can't deliver enough power. And usually when they talk
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:03.360]   about battery life, they're really almost only talking about well, it has a built in
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:07.920]   unentrucable power supply that can deliver up to two and a half hours of power. If you get a
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:14.880]   blackout, but this is only £50. But yeah, exactly. And it'll be and the fans will be screaming and
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:19.520]   you don't want to have you put a potato like behind the power ports and it will be like
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:24.720]   cooked in about 40 minutes. The what gets this is one of the things that really gets me about
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:30.160]   about these new laptops. They can say, no, this is a four real powerful laptop. This is not,
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:36.080]   this isn't we just took a desktop machine, put water cooling inside it, put two handles on both
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:40.720]   sides of it, and we'll rent you out a motorized cart to haul it from one place to another. This
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:45.360]   is something you can actually just drop in a laptop bag and do professional level work with you.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:50.080]   You've got this tiny machine that you can connect. Like every monitor in your house can be connected
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:55.520]   to the damn thing. That's ambitious. And that's a that's significant. User 70,
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:01.280]   484 in the chatroom says, I can't believe Apple made a laptop brought back ports, made it heavier.
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:04.960]   Would this have been possible if Johnny I've were still there? What do you think? Yeah.
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:10.160]   Well, if you look at the timing, it might have been part of why he left. I was going to say,
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:15.120]   yeah, like I think there might have been like, hey, there's a lot of people giving us feedback. And
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:19.200]   he's like, don't well, this is the way we're going to do it. Well, I did. It's quality. Yeah. Well,
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:25.840]   okay. I'll put over it. And then I said, okay, here, I port I poured you a drink. Don't mind the
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:34.560]   bubbles in the phone. No, I love Sir Johnny. He's brilliant. Did some amazing design stuff.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:40.240]   But as often as the case with designers, maybe not me's van der Ro, some people say,
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:45.840]   you know, form over function or form follows function. But I think Johnny somewhat was willing
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:52.320]   to sacrifice function for making a beautiful device. And definitely with the 2016, right?
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:56.720]   Yeah. Like I think that we can all agree. And I mean, I mean, who knows why he left and why
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:01.600]   those decisions are made? I'm not going to speculate. But I can't think that the keyboard, you know,
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:06.480]   fiasco, the reaction to the touch bar, the reaction by pros to other things. And look,
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:12.640]   they sold bucket fulls of those laptops. But yes, because I had to keep buying one to replace the
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:20.560]   keyboard. Right. No, I mean, same. I had three keyboard replacements on my mind. But you know,
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:27.600]   but I feel like I feel like we can't understate just how poor the 2016 redesign was.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:32.960]   When every, I mean, when the biggest thing that we're all excited about is that, so I,
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:39.760]   this was on the top of pack her new state, but somebody posted something to the creator of a
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:45.040]   pen board, the bookmarking service published at the end of October of 2016. And it, and it was
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:48.880]   his Benjamin, but it was called like a Benjamin mutton review of like the next MacBook. And it
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:53.920]   was written, I think as if it was like in 2025 or something. And it was talking about how it was
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:59.520]   a return to all the things that they got rid of, you know, before it was satirical. But it was
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:04.720]   exactly what they've done, which was returning the ports, making it thicker, you know, having,
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:11.440]   you know, the keys again, you know, the escape keys and function keys, like it's having better
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:17.840]   key travel. So the fact that this left, we're all excited about it. And I think that the specs and
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:22.720]   the actual innovation are amazing. But I think that a big part of this is, like I said, again,
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:27.200]   there's a complete referendum on what we had for the last five years. And I think a complete
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:30.880]   acknowledgement that we were wrong. Good find on this. Let me read you what Mache
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:38.880]   Chaglaski wrote. In 2016, the new MacBook Pro shows that Apple is finally becoming serious
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:45.200]   about developers. Gone is the gimmicky touch bar. Gone are the four USB C ports that forced power
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:51.040]   users to carry a suitcase full of dongles. In their place, a cornucopia of developer friendly ports,
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:57.600]   two USB three and Thunderbolt two ports, a redesigned power connector, and a long-awaited HDMI port.
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:03.600]   Photographers will read this is unbelievable. This is so prescient. Five years ago, photographers
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:09.600]   will rejoice at the surprising and welcome addition of an XD XC card reader, a sign that Apple might
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:15.680]   be thinking seriously about photography. The new MagSafe connector is a bit of Apple genius.
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:24.320]   What hasn't changed the red in this place, storage and memory? So he five years ago wrote in satire
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:32.000]   exactly what just happened. Yeah, well done. Good job, Mache. Thank you, Christina, for bringing
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.920]   that up. I love this guy. And that's absolutely amazing. Let's also mention one other advantage
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:41.600]   of over the iPad besides battery. It has an headphone check.
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:45.280]   Must check that.
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:49.760]   That was a high-end one. It's got a better DAC. It's like a fancy, yeah, tell us about that.
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:54.720]   Better DAC, higher impedance. So it'll drive like the really expensive headphones that
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:58.480]   everybody who edits 8K video has told themselves they absolutely have to have.
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:06.320]   Oh my God, that's awesome. I was just when they showed the pictures you mentioned earlier of the
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:13.360]   die. I just was blown away by how much bigger this was. I'd have to rewind to a few weeks ago.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:17.360]   We were talking about what this next chip might be. And Renee was talking about what an X
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:23.680]   level chip was. And it was essentially an evolution. And so I really expected an evolution
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:32.240]   of the M1. But when you look at these pictures, this is not evolutionary. This is an incredible
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:38.880]   flex by Apple showing that Apple Silicon, we control this platform and we can do anything.
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:45.520]   And just wait till next year is the message I'm getting. Just unbelievable.
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:49.680]   Give me a power cord and I will give you the universe.
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:56.160]   So anybody was worried about the future of the Mac Pro, I think is going to be jumping up and down
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:00.320]   about six months. And what's interesting is that the last time they did this, we got a trash can.
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:03.600]   So the last time they said, we're going to do something completely different. What we got was
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:11.040]   something that was completely different. And you're right. What we all wanted was something
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:16.480]   stylish and didn't have a fan and could cool it. So Johnny I've, it's Johnny I've, it's like,
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:20.960]   I'm sorry, I don't want to slam Johnny I've, but it's design over function.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:27.680]   Was that in the 2016 Mac book pro that really got me disillusioned about Apple's
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:31.600]   hardware plan for the Mac, it really got me thinking that no, they don't really care about this.
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:35.200]   They're shoving it off to the side. They don't consider it a priority because if they consider
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:39.040]   it a priority, they would make it way more competitive with all these windows machines.
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:46.640]   And honest to God, if in 2017, my I bought a new, my previous new Mac book was 2015.
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:51.600]   If I if it had died in 2017, if I spilled another Diet Coke on the keyboard and killed it, okay.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:59.120]   I mean, I was very, very aware that I can't buy a Mac book pro. I can't, it's, it is absolutely
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:04.560]   unfit for my purposes. And I, I knew, I knew which model of ThinkPad I would be buying,
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:08.960]   if I'm going to be spending $1500 on a replacement instead of a Mac book and that kind of killed me.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.680]   But now I've never been more optimistic about the platform than I have.
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:17.440]   And I, and I, and I was the kind of person that bought almost every laptop that within six months
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:22.000]   of it being released, probably three months of it being released that Apple released for 20 years.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:28.080]   And, and I kept my 2015 for years, like four years, like I just, they do,
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:31.600]   just kept on going back to my 2015. I'm not going to get rid of them because I keyboard,
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:34.080]   keyboard a long, like the keyboard. I didn't like the, I didn't like the,
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:36.800]   the lack of the MagSafe. They didn't, I didn't like all those things. And so
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:40.480]   it, that's the, that's the hardest part. If I was still traveling, I would have, I'd buy,
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:44.240]   I would have been on the list. It's just that I just don't, you know, I just don't leave that much.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:50.400]   Apparently the MagSafe in this is even a, so much stronger magnet, which is actually good.
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:54.880]   Because my only complaint about the old MagSafe was it would fall out sometimes a little too easily.
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:59.920]   This one, yeah, this doesn't sound like it will. And yet, if you kick the cable,
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:04.480]   it won't pull your MacBook off the table. Here's Mark Gurman.
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:11.520]   Just tweeted, for those who think the M1 Pro and M1 Max and the MacBook Pro are impressive,
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:16.000]   the new Mac Pro desktop is expected to come in at least two variations.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:22.720]   Double and quadruple the number of CPU and GPU cores as the M1 Max.
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:27.840]   So, I mean, I remember we gasped when they said 32 cores.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:34.320]   We gasped up to 40 cores and 128 GPU cores in the high end.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:40.720]   Yeah. Like that's, you know, these are, these are big numbers. I mean, it's, and, and again,
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:43.600]   to go back to something that Christina was talking about it with people, you know,
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:48.000]   doing a lot of other things other than graphics on these, they have to look at that trajectory
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.520]   and start to think, we might want to start thinking about it.
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:53.920]   It's scary. It's scary. Yeah.
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:58.720]   If you look at the, at the, at the performance that's happening right now and knowing that it's
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:02.240]   going to come in a year, it, it seems like it would make sense for anybody looking for heavy
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:06.320]   computing. Because remember that I still think that, you know, Apple tends to pace.
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:10.160]   So if they're going at this pace, they, they have a, you know, they're not, they don't put out
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:15.600]   everything that they know how to do every product. They put out a reasonable upgrade for every
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:20.400]   product. So if this is what they call reasonable, we might have, you know, two, three, four, five
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:26.560]   years of, of this kind of growth. And so as the rest of the industry is kind of tapering off,
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:30.800]   they're hockey sticking. And that's a, it's a pretty frightening thing to, to consider.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:35.280]   400 gigabytes per second memory bandwidth. That seems like a lot.
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.960]   It's enormous. Okay.
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:41.120]   Insane, insanely fast.
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:42.800]   We're talking about the max, of course. Yeah.
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.880]   But this, this, of course, gets back into the advantages that they have of going between the
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:51.280]   GPU and the CPU. They're not going out to an outer bus. So they don't have to go out to the
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:55.040]   board and go over and, you know, there's, they don't have to go around the backyard and then
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:59.520]   through the thing and over over to get to them. They're in the same house and they're able to
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:04.240]   kind of move that data back and forth at extremely high rates. And that's part of what magnifies
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:07.520]   it. So beyond any of these benchmarks that we have, that's why you have to kind of check it
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:12.400]   inside of the app you're going to use. Because those, those numbers are going to mean different
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:17.360]   things. If the, if the, if the process is taking, if the, you know, if the developer is taking full
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:22.160]   advantage of the process and it's the kind of process that can make that work, it could be,
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:27.120]   you know, huge acceleration. Do you think Tim Sweeney is kicking himself right now for starting a fight
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:33.440]   with Apple? Wouldn't Unreal Engine be sweet on this platform? And I will admit Unreal Engine.
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:39.440]   I love Unreal Engine. Use it all the time. I don't use it all the time. We use it a lot for,
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:43.440]   first off, the, it's almost unusable on the Mac.
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:48.000]   Right. So it's like, it's not like, you know, that's why I have a PC right here. The only thing
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:54.080]   it runs is Unreal Engine. So that's the question. So certainly professional software developers,
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:59.920]   you know, like video and an audio, but maybe even game developers, maybe game engine developers
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:04.320]   are going to be looking at this saying, gee, maybe we should be developing for this platform.
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:08.640]   Yes. No. No. No. I don't think the market is going to be able to support it.
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:13.760]   There. The tools help. Yeah. I mean, look, I think it could be, right? And I think that if Apple,
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:17.600]   if, look, if I were running developer relations with Apple, and I'm not, but if I were,
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:22.720]   I would be reaching out to people who were looking at those things. I'd be reaching out to,
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:25.440]   you know, people who were doing stuff in R. Like, these are the people I would be
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.560]   challenging. How do you convince them? I mean, I think that you would try to,
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:31.840]   try to say, look, the tools are coming, and this is the direction where things are going,
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:34.880]   and no one else is going to be able to catch up. No one else is going to be able to achieve
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:37.840]   what we can achieve in a performance. Don't you think the tool makers are looking and saying,
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:41.920]   maybe we ought to adjust? Maybe, maybe, but let's start writing an engine. Maybe unity,
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:46.320]   you know, maybe there should be somebody cheating. But I think the problem is, I think the problem
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:54.960]   is that a, you know, you have this library of steam games and unless Apple wanted to contribute
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:59.200]   to something like what proton, like what seemed it for that, you have all these legacy x86 games,
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:02.480]   which aren't going to come over. So that's going to hurt a big portion of your market. I think the
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:06.320]   other thing is, is that you just have to realize like the market, like we all are all Mac buyers
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:10.320]   and owners, and I think the potential could be there to open the pie, but Apple hasn't,
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:13.840]   they want everything, they want everything to sell their games through their app store,
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:18.480]   and they want everybody to use only their APIs and only their tooling, which doesn't play well
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:24.240]   with cross platform stuff. So if I was a game developer, as impressive as this stuff is,
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:28.880]   if I'm looking at having to maybe outlay a couple hundred thousand dollars, this is if it's a small
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:36.560]   game for a port where I might only sell a certain amount of titles, like I just don't know if
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:42.400]   they were the investment, to be honest. I think Apple needs to build its own reference level game
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:48.160]   that is that they have Apple or a case, they're already buying it and what it needs to do is it
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:52.080]   maybe do an engine. What if they did an engine? And engines really complicated.
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:56.640]   They might be able to do it, but you know, you need to get a Ford to get a hundred person team.
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:02.640]   It's not a hundred person team. It's a thousand people. It's not just people, it's time,
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:09.680]   well, but I think that Apple could see a reticle and Unity, I think, does a good job. And by the
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:15.760]   way, Unreal publishes to Apple, which is fine. It's the development interface that doesn't work very
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:21.200]   well. So you can still build stuff in Unreal. I don't think Apple will be building anything new
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:28.080]   in Unreal on their own dime. But I think that if they built a game that was, let's say,
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:35.680]   something like what Epic did, and they built it so that it would scale seamlessly from the phone
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:41.360]   up to the desktop and just keep on taking advantage of the processors. And again, now that they've
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:45.520]   unified all those bits and pieces, they could theoretically do something like that where it's
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:50.480]   scaling. So it just takes full advantage of the hardware that it's sitting on. And whatever that
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:54.240]   hardware is, it just keeps on adding more detail. So it can add things like depth of field, it can
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:59.520]   add motion blur, it can add a lot of other bits and pieces. I'm just going to keep turning all the
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:03.680]   stuff up. And you have to think about that at the very beginning when you start writing the code,
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:08.480]   which no one really has done because no one's thought about building something that really scales
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:12.720]   that way, except for-- >> App should build an engine designed for this platform.
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:18.880]   The gaming market's a $175 billion market. It's going to be twice that in a year or two.
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:22.320]   This is a huge opportunity. >> I think that--
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:28.080]   >> Apple could own this. >> I think that the-- I think reality creator is kind of on its way to
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:32.400]   being an engine, a useful engine. I don't know if it's going to be a game engine, but reality
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:35.760]   creator does a lot of the things that you're talking about. I mean, that's a-- >> It's so simple.
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:41.360]   >> Yeah, yeah, that's a developer tool. And so it doesn't do-- you're not going to build a game.
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:44.800]   You're not going to build a huge game in it. They're already doing simple games in AR and so on and
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:49.760]   so on and so forth. But what it does is let you build inside of a 3D space. And so you can take
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:55.440]   your objects and-- >> I would submit-- if you want to build an AR business, which Apple clearly does,
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:33:01.680]   you can't ignore the gaming side of that. And an engine that Apple controls.
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:03.040]   >> No. >> No?
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:07.040]   >> I think-- >> No, no, no. I agree with you. No, no. This is so sorry. I agree with you.
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:12.720]   >> Yeah. This is something Apple has great ambitions in AR. This is a time for app-- I wouldn't be
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:15.520]   surprised if there's something going on right now in Cupertino on this.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:21.280]   >> No, I think that the seat of that is when you look at what-- again, it's just that building a
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:26.960]   whole engine that does everything that we see Unreal Engine do in Unity Engine. It took them a
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:31.600]   long time to get there. And there's just-- it just takes a lot to do that kind of thing.
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:35.280]   >> Well, there's a limited number of people who really can do it too. There aren't so many
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:41.600]   giant climaxes. >> You have to coach. You have to coach a lot of people to do that. And so I will say that
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:46.320]   these kind of performance numbers could interest a guy like John Carmack.
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:48.160]   >> Yeah. >> You want to play.
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:53.440]   >> Yeah. >> Because he's a real fiend for performance. And so I think that--
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:59.360]   but you get a John Carmack involved than you're in a different space. But you have to have someone
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:05.200]   like that. That's going-- because not only does he bring the knowledge that he has, which is intense.
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:12.960]   But he also brings the cache that will attract other developers. Other people to your team,
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:14.320]   if you were going to build something. >> Right.
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:17.920]   >> And he would be the person that-- if I was going to put someone as head of a team, that's
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:22.720]   who it was. But it would cost-- Facebook's got him. It's a big--
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:26.080]   >> It would cost the meat figures.
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:30.640]   >> Yeah. But at some point, money isn't the issue at all.
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:34.560]   >> No, it's not. It's autonomy and other things. And he, I think, has a lot of autonomy and
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:38.320]   innocuous and who knows what he would or wouldn't at Apple. But I agree. I think if you were going
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:39.120]   to do it-- >> That's who you need.
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:40.640]   >> -- you bring a Carmack in. >> That's who you need.
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:44.800]   >> Also, the bottom line is, I think, fundamentally anything else. And this is why I think it's a good
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:48.240]   point to say they would need a reference game. You would need a game. You would need a hit.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:49.520]   You would need something-- >> Yeah.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:54.240]   >> -- a studio of some sort. And I'm not sure if they are willing to invest the money that you
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:57.040]   would need to invest. Because it would be a $200 million product.
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:59.840]   >> Yeah. >> Apple has more than $200 million
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:04.080]   sitting in a bank account. >> That would be minimum. I agree with you.
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:06.480]   >> They could afford it. >> I agree with you. But Apple, but as we know,
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:10.080]   they could more than afford it. But Apple is cheap in a lot of these things. Like, they're
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:12.640]   frugal with their money. You know, like-- >> I just-- it can't be.
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:16.000]   >> -- but they've-- I think it's strategic-- I think it's strategic for them.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.960]   We know they actually make more money in gaming than Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft,
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:25.840]   and Activision combined. But that's a casual gaming, admittedly.
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:31.600]   And that's from 30% of the App Store. But they know it's a big business. And if you-- if you
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:36.560]   care about services, if you care about the platform, this has always been a laggard area for Mac.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:40.000]   That's why there isn't a lot of money in Mac gaming. You could transform them.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.640]   >> I guess my question would be-- you could. I guess my question would be, like,
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:45.120]   shouldn't you have done that five years ago? Like, shouldn't you have hired a car
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:47.280]   Mac or someone five years now? >> Well, maybe they knew they were working on the--
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:48.880]   >> Yeah. >> -- on this new platform.
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:52.400]   >> Yeah. >> And maybe they thought, well, let's work on the new architecture.
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:56.880]   >> The other thing is that if I was going to do that, one of the first things I probably do is
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:00.000]   build something like Apple Arcade. And so-- >> Yes.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.800]   >> --because I get a lot of information about what people like, what they don't like.
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.320]   >> Exactly. >> So you have a lot of--
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.840]   >> They have the pieces. >> Yeah.
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:08.560]   >> They're putting a lot of those things in place to be able to feel right.
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:11.040]   >> Yeah, but again, it's casual gaming. It's-- but again--
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:14.240]   >> Oh, it's a casual gaming thing. >> So I feel like it's a different market segment.
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:18.800]   >> It is. And they own that market segment. And I think they could also own the AAA gaming.
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:24.000]   And I think that there's going to-- AAA gaming, which for a while looked like a niche product,
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.360]   is clearly not anymore. It makes more money than the motion pictures.
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:28.160]   >> Yeah. >> And--
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:32.080]   >> Right. >> --it ties in neatly with the-- with their AR ambitions.
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:35.520]   >> That's-- like, for instance, it's all-- I don't play anything serious because it would take too
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:37.040]   much of a time commitment. >> Right.
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:39.280]   >> That's all I have. I play Kingdom Rush. That's all I play.
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:40.400]   >> Well, I think-- >> --and get back to it one more time.
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:45.520]   >> --and play something that's not so much a game as an environment that you would play in.
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:47.600]   You know, I mean, I think there's things Apple could do that would be very--
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:48.800]   >> Well-- >> --very interesting.
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:52.800]   >> And again, as we get into closer to AR, you know, that they have the opportunity to define
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:54.640]   a different kind of game. >> That's right.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:55.120]   >> You know, the-- >> That's right.
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:58.080]   >> You know, we've been-- we've talked about even taking-- you can turn physical.
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:02.320]   One of the things we did some R&D for three or four years ago was scan to golf course.
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:06.720]   Actually, my family's golf course. I had an access to it. So we did a 3D-- a LIDAR scan of
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:10.080]   the whole golf course. And one of the things we were experimenting with-- and back then,
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:14.080]   the technology wasn't quite ready to go. But was the idea that we could play different games
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:19.360]   at the golf course that with AR, then we-- then everyone else was playing. So different set of
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:24.560]   rules. Like when you pick up your phone, you can see new targets that you want to hit in the
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:27.680]   fairway or you can see things that are going to-- you know, so there's all kinds of things that
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:32.080]   you can be playing that aren't related to, you know, they're not the traditional golf,
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:36.720]   because one of the problems golf has is that it's aging out. And so, you know, how do you attract
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:41.200]   new players to something that might be interesting? You get out, you get to walk around a little bit.
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:45.520]   And then you also get to-- but you get to play a video game with your golf clubs,
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:48.560]   you know? And so I think that those kinds of things, whether that one works or not,
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:53.520]   I don't know. Again, we were a little ahead, you know, so we're waiting on that one. But the-- but
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:38:00.480]   the-- I think that we're definitely-- Apple is in a leadership position with what they're doing
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:04.800]   with AR. And they're slowly piecing all those together. That's the crazy thing is that they're
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:07.840]   putting in tools that don't make a lot of sense in motion unless you think about AR.
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:10.400]   And they're putting in tools in Final Cut that don't make a lot of sense unless you're thinking
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:16.160]   about AR. So undoubtedly, desktops will go above 64 gigs, but that's the top-- that's how the
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:24.320]   laptops top out, 64 gigs of RAM. In a laptop. In a laptop. Also, it's unified memory. Is that
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:30.320]   adequate? Is that plenty? Is that all you need? Yeah. Yeah, I think for most people-- no, you can do
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:35.760]   more, but I think for most people it's very competitive. Even for a pro. I mean, they showed
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:41.040]   in Logic. They said even more Logic instruments and voices and things.
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:47.760]   And when we get one that's the max, just let me know. And I have the project that we can test.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:51.680]   Good. I will get one. There's a reference project that literally thumps everything.
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:55.680]   Push to the max. Push to November 17th. But I will have it November 17th.
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:39:03.200]   I'm going to throw-- Anthony's got some motion projects that he's-- we know how long it takes on
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:09.040]   various machines. You got to file. I have a file that I run on my-- I got to find out if
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:14.240]   Metasheap actually works on it on the M1 if it's ready to go yet. But I run it in Metasheap and
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:19.360]   on my iMac it will run for three days and then the iMac will just restart. Like in the middle of
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:23.840]   it, it'll just go-- I can't do that. I can't do that. I tried for three straight days and I'm
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:31.520]   trying to-- How important is the hardware ProRes to code it? It's huge. It's massive. Because,
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:36.960]   again, for creatives, it becomes-- it really makes it hard to do anything other than ProRes because
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:42.000]   with a dedicated acceleration, it means that now 4K, 8K-- I can't remember how many streams they
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:47.360]   said, but as I was looking at it-- Seven streams of 8K ProRes video. And they-- I think they said
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:53.120]   4.4. They showed on the screen 4.2.2. But I think that wouldn't be that big of a word.
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:58.560]   Even if it was four streams of 4.4.4, that is incredible. And to be able to do that on your laptop
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:02.880]   is kind of insane. And it's still-- because one of the problems you get into is when you start--
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:06.240]   I've been doing a bunch of 8K work recently and you start playing it back. And the big problem is
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:11.920]   you can't see it playback. It's just-- it's chunky. And so you have to go, "Okay, well, when I render
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:15.840]   it out and when I get it just right." And so-- Here it is. You're able to do all of that. This is
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:21.360]   in the footnotes Final Cut Pro X. One-minute picture-in-picture project. Seven streams of Apple ProRes
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:29.600]   4.2.2 at 81.92x43.20. And 30 frames a second. So it's not maxed out video. But still--
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:37.360]   Yeah, but it's still. I mean, I'd even-- I'd be settling for 4K, you know, 4K 60 or 4K 120
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:41.840]   at four or five streams on a laptop. And this is a freaking laptop.
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:47.520]   On a laptop, you know. And so it's-- A freaking laptop. And that's a mixture of the CPU and GPU
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:52.480]   power as well as that drive speed. So a lot of playing that back has less to do with the power of
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:57.120]   the-- you know, the drive speed combined with a dedicated chip system is going to make--
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:03.280]   it's going to scream. And so again, it really-- as a creative professional, you have to
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:06.800]   really think about what you're doing if you're not on a Mac at this point. And that's been--
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:12.880]   That has not been the case for a long time. And it's-- Apple not just ProRes, it's by the way,
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:19.600]   it's HEVC NH.264. So basically anything you're doing, ProRes, it's got hardware--
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:23.160]   Hardware and T-C-O-V-N-N-T-D-C. That's--
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:23.600]   I know.
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:27.200]   HEVC and H-C-O-V-4, like don't mix your formats. Don't know that they tell you you can do it.
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:29.040]   Don't do it. Don't do it. It's bad. It's horrible idea.
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:29.520]   Don't do it.
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:30.400]   That is a horrible idea.
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:31.760]   Bad idea. Don't do it.
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:34.800]   Everything goes to ProRes, then you edit, then you edit. I'm just-- that's the most important
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:38.560]   thing people need to get today. They'll tell you they can open MP4. Don't do it. Don't do it.
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:45.120]   Just convert. Anthony, I don't think I'm going to give you the laptop I'm keeping it.
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:54.960]   I have no-- I'll be keeping it and I'll be doing like a Markdown files in Notepad or something.
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:57.440]   I mean, it's just-- it really is wasted on me.
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:57.760]   You'll be prepping.
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:41:58.400]   It'll be show fast.
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:41:59.120]   That one's business.
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:01.360]   My E-Max is going to load so fast.
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:04.400]   Oh gosh, the folders. The folders just open.
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:04.640]   The--
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:14.320]   GAN, the power adapter. We've got a little more information on that after the fact is PD3.1,
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:22.000]   the new power delivery spec for Type-C, which is very good. That means it's not limited 100
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:28.720]   watts anymore. What is it? 140 watts. So fast charging. It also is a GAN adapter,
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:33.760]   which is interesting. Apple's first GAN using gallium nitride technology, which means small--
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:40.400]   you could be smaller, faster, lower, heat and all of that. So even the power brick.
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:42.800]   Even that's from water.
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:48.400]   And I wonder how much-- there's so much math that goes into packaging anything
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:52.240]   for manufacturing. I wonder how much-- what the math was on.
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:56.320]   If we switch to this new technology, we can put a smaller power adapter in the box,
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:00.640]   which means we can make the box smaller, which means we can fit more on each container,
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:04.480]   which means it will cost us a lot less money. It will offset the money that we spent
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:07.040]   on this more sophisticated charger technology.
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:12.960]   I give credit to the Verge, John Porter, questioned Apple about it and found out something--
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:19.840]   this was not revealed in the event. 140 watt charger and power delivery, 3.1,
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:25.520]   which is a brand new standard. That comes with your 16 inch, or you can buy it separately for 99 bucks.
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:33.200]   I got the small 14 inch, 67 watt charger, but I have a bunch of GAN 100 watt.
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:38.880]   I don't think I have anything-- PD3, 3.1, but I have a lot of charging bricks. We all do.
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:42.080]   This is going to be a charging brick to remember.
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:49.920]   It's a good time to upgrade. I'm about to upgrade to a new brick that can charge both my laptop
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:51.920]   and my iPad at the same time at full speed.
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:54.480]   That was your pick last order, wasn't it?
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:56.640]   No, I think that was for an ace pick.
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:01.360]   Renee's pick. It got me once again taking a look at a few years ago,
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:06.240]   I've replaced most of my chargers with ones that supported USB-C and PD.
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:10.000]   Now it's like, yeah, but it would be nice to not have to slow charge.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.640]   To be able to fast charge multiple devices at once, and I was like,
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:16.480]   maybe that would be a good $100 to spend.
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:22.800]   After Renee talked about it, I went and searched for it, and I found one from Anker,
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:29.600]   because I like Anker. Same idea. 100 watts, 4 ports, 2 PD, 2 IQ chargers.
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:34.160]   Now I wish I'd gotten one with PD3.1.
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:41.520]   It's a mess. You used to be so simple when you were just going to accept
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:44.960]   that it's going to take five to six hours to charge something. Life was so simple,
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:48.480]   but now that's like, do you have the right charger? Do you have the right cables?
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:51.840]   What do they say? 50% charge in an hour or something like that?
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:54.160]   Just something insane.
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:59.840]   Anything else that you're excited about, anybody's excited about that we haven't covered,
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:05.520]   it seems like there's so much. And again, the strongest impression I get is that Apple has been
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:07.440]   sandbagging us.
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:11.840]   They have really, there's a lot of headroom in this chip design.
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:17.120]   The only other thing that I'd say is that while it's another one of those kind of
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:21.760]   sleeping things that I think we're going to see a lot more from, is that logic dropped with,
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:27.200]   of course, there's a new Final Cut, new motion and new logic. The object motion and Final Cut
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:32.160]   have an object tracking, which I haven't gotten to play with very much yet. But the other thing is
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:40.480]   that logic now supports spatial audio. So it's supporting Dolby Atmos. And you could get a plug
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:49.760]   in and have it kind of run okay before. And now it is just in the app. So it's built into the app
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:55.280]   now. You can design it and they put out some odd choice of music. But they have a little
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:59.120]   Nas X, which is not really safe for work that they used as the example file.
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:00.080]   That's a terrible thing.
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:03.280]   Which I thought, I think Apple works pretty hard at trying to break the
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:12.960]   stereotype of their stodgy. And so they went edgy. But outside of that, it is
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:20.400]   a pretty slick, I can show it to you if you want to see it. I mean, it's, this is,
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:26.640]   oh, I have a new location here. Here's the thing here. Now if we open up the mixer,
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:35.360]   there we go. If you double click on this, you can see this is the designer. So this is the object
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:42.080]   designer. So now you can see, so this is how you can design it. So this is the height.
[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:47.120]   So here's my, the height in the room. And then this is position in the room. And now this isn't,
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:53.040]   this is a Dolby Atmos object. You can tell from the height, those pieces here. And if you look,
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:56.400]   the square ones here are objects. And then the round ones, if we open up this one,
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:47:04.000]   this is a bed. And so you can see how this works here. And so you're able to now design
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:10.800]   all of this inside of logic where it was, you know, there was a plugin to do it in the past.
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:15.120]   That was more difficult. So the fact that it's now just built into,
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:20.560]   into logic is pretty impressive and really well implemented from a user perspective,
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:24.800]   you know, from just the UI is, is really nice. And so we're going to be playing with it a lot.
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:29.920]   I'm going to play with it a lot. And so it's, but that's a being able, again, one of the things
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:33.600]   that Apple is doing when it comes to a lot of their, what they're doing in the future,
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:39.200]   is the ability to owning those apps and developing those apps allows them to constantly be,
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:43.360]   you know, basically have control over their own destiny, you know, that they can say,
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:47.280]   well, we're going to put it into logic. And that presses the whole industry down the path of
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:53.040]   doing more spatial. And the stuff that they're doing with Final Cut and Motion is useful for them
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:57.680]   when it comes to AR, when it comes to content creation. But it's also keeps
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:00.640]   coding the rest of the industry to keep moving forward and take advantage of the hardware.
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:08.800]   It's going to be very interesting. And I actually, I'm glad I'm getting the base model 14 inch,
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:12.000]   just to see, I bet you it will. I bet you it's pretty fast.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:16.800]   Certainly my EMAX will load in lightning time.
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:25.120]   The number of the number of CPU cycles between flashes of that insertion cursor has just gone
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:31.200]   up by like 100. And you can feel it, baby. Yeah, man. I hear, I hear text that it is just
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:36.560]   un-unrelated. You know, it's just, it's just 120 frames per second as those characters start
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:41.520]   coming out. It just feels like you're just thinking them out. I also have to say,
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:47.040]   Unleashed was the right name for this event because it was off the hook. It really was.
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:54.160]   I will say that also the, the production was pretty good. Yeah, they didn't go all over the
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:58.240]   world though this time. I thought they might. I was pretty betched back to Apple campus and up
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:02.960]   and down in the elevator and stuff. If you watched it on, if you listened to it with headphones
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:11.920]   and you watched it, it's Apple's pseudo-spatial. So, so Apple takes everything that stereo and kind
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:16.240]   of goes, I'm going to spread this out a little bit and make it a lot better. I even thought that
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:22.960]   at first it was, you know, that it might be spatial, but it is, and I don't think it was,
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:26.400]   the, we've decided we kind of all conferred within office hours and we've decided it's not.
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:36.080]   But the, but it just sounded really good. The sound design was top-notch and the music coming
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:40.640]   in, the transitions and then the video, they keep on getting better. They just, you feel like every
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:46.240]   one of these is getting better and better and better at this new kind of video production keynote.
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:50.800]   And I, again, I think that we're going to see them come out and announce other videos. Like,
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:54.240]   I think the one that would come back, the transition is going to be like, the press comes in, they
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:58.320]   still get to talk to Apple employees, so good to play with the hardware. But what they're going to do
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:02.800]   is, you know, Cook's going to be up there and he's going to go, and now let's look at this next video.
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:06.320]   They come back and it wasn't that great. Let's look at the next video because I don't think you
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:14.480]   can go back to, you know, these kind of, uh, keynotes. Like, I, I look at, after looking at this one,
[01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:19.600]   I look at other keynotes that are attempting to reproduce the stage experience and it's just,
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:22.320]   it's really slow, you know, and I don't think I could watch another stage.
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:27.760]   No, even the Google Pixel event earlier today seemed kind of dopey and even dumpy with the stage
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:32.640]   experience, I think is just, I think it's important to bring people into the room. It's important to
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:37.120]   have them get, get access to the, to the hardware, get access to the company. Those all still make
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:42.480]   sense. But I think Apple is just crushing the idea for a fortune 10 company. I don't think that
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:47.840]   the stage presentation, it's just so much slower. And the executives aren't good enough to really
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:52.080]   pull it off on stage most of the time. It just feels very flat. And, you know, here, we get
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:57.120]   to see everybody at their best, their best take every single time. And so without, you know,
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:51:01.120]   five, nine people watching, but they didn't bother with Lisa Jackson on the roof.
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:06.800]   They didn't bother with the performance in the Redwood forest or any of that stuff. It was kind of
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:12.560]   tame. Also, the last time production, uh, the iPhones bigger market, then I mean, we, we love,
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:15.760]   we love them actually. We're excited about it. We spent a ton of time talking about it,
[01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:19.600]   but the iPhone is a bigger market with a bigger budget. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:28.480]   Um, anything else we covered? I think we covered pretty much everything. All right. Let's, uh,
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:33.760]   let's take a break. And when we come back, picks of the week, it's great to have Christina Warren
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:40.640]   here from Microsoft senior cloud advocate there and a Mac lover. Let's not forget she spent four
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:49.440]   grand this yesterday on up. Look, my nickname, uh, for is C. Mac. So like, there you go. So as you
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:53.440]   walk around the campus, they don't say, Oh, you know, where's your surface? They go
[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:57.920]   C. Mac. No, they, they, no, yeah, exactly. No, they understand. No, and I look, I like windows,
[01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:01.680]   uh, 11 a lot. And I like the surface devices a lot, but everybody knows like I'm, I'm a Mac head,
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:07.520]   right? Like, I'm a tech head, but, but I'm, I got my start writing about Mac stuff and so, yeah.
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:15.200]   No, and you can, I mean, I think WSL and windows 11 is really great, but, uh, you've got full BSD
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:20.320]   underneath the hood on a Mac. So it's really great developer machine. It really is. It is.
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:25.920]   And I'm looking forward to putting, um, uh, windows 11, um, in, uh, parallels on the, on the new
[01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:30.480]   machine. Will you be able to do that? Don't you have to use the WOA version?
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:35.120]   The windows on the arm version. Yeah. Okay. Well, have fun. Yes.
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:38.640]   I'm interested in seeing what the performance is like on that. Apple really is, uh, honestly,
[01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:44.720]   you know, boot camps gone. They've really kind of decided we don't have to support windows anymore.
[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:53.760]   Particularly. Yeah. No, we're, we're kind of. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Andy and Ico, WGBH, great to have you.
[01:52:53.760 --> 01:53:01.040]   Did you get your pixel six? I just did. Congratulations. I guess, I guess they must have released,
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:05.440]   released people who got kicked out of their cards. Did you get the one you wanted to get the
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:10.560]   black one with 512 gay, black 512 gigs is not going to be delivered until November 6th through the
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:16.800]   ninth, but I will take that. Nice. Congratulations. I can't. Congratulations. You just spent like a
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:22.080]   thousand dollars, but it was an ordeal. I feel, I feel as though I've been tested by fire and come
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:26.000]   out and you earned it. Yeah. Mine went through, but I forgot what I ordered. I don't think
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:31.760]   I keep waiting for the email saying what I ordered. I don't remember. Uh,
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:38.000]   you know, it doesn't really matter. I got a, I got the pro at least, and that's mostly what I'm
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:43.600]   interested in those cameras. Right. Alex Lindsey, it's always great to have you. I'm sure you talk,
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:49.120]   talk this morning a lot about Apple's laptops and where we watched it, you know, like we,
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:52.960]   about a hundred of us in office hours watched it yesterday. So that's what we, that's a thing.
[01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:56.960]   It's kind of a watch party. So we don't, we don't play it into zoom, but we all sit in zoom and
[01:53:56.960 --> 01:54:00.640]   then we sit there. So you hear us all just talk, it's, we're like a secondary experience of a whole
[01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:04.640]   bunch of us all just talking about what we're seeing. And so there's a mixture of, you know,
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:08.560]   talking about the production value as well as like, did they do this thing? And is that really in
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:12.720]   outmost? And, and then, and then the other side of it, of course, is there was a lot of like, wow,
[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:17.120]   that's a, it's a big processor. It's a lot of processing, you know, so, so that was, there was a
[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:20.160]   lot of, uh, it was a good time. But that, that's what we've kind of gotten to the habit with a
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:23.920]   lot of these keynotes is that we just watch them in our after hours because that runs all day.
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:29.600]   Yeah. So whenever they have it, yeah. Uh, that's of course, office hours.global. If you want to
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:34.400]   know more, you can, everybody can have office hours running in the background. Like my radio station,
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:38.080]   when I'm not here, it's like a, take a radio station that every once in a while, but the difference is
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:43.040]   every once in a while, uh, I go, oh, I'd like to participate with that radio station and start
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:46.560]   talking to people about something and then I go back to whatever. Does, uh, is there a limit on the
[01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:52.000]   number of people who can listen live or is that just kind of unlimited? Um, I think we're limited to,
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:58.080]   uh, right now, I think we're limited to like 500. So that, I mean, because you don't want to,
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:02.160]   you don't want that too many people participating. Otherwise it would get to be as well. Well, the,
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:06.960]   we, yeah, we've, we've got a lot of, when you do it every day and you do it all day,
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:11.280]   it becomes kind of, there's kind of a, everyone kind of knows how they want to talk. So we have,
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:15.840]   people raise their hands and they, you know, there's, there's a protocol. And so it, it actually very
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:22.320]   rarely does it, does it get a hectic, you know, it's, it's pretty, um, pretty calm. And people kind of
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:26.400]   queue up when they want to talk about stuff. And then a lot of times it'll, on any given time,
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:29.280]   there's 30 or 40 people in there, but there's only two or three people talking to each other.
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:29.840]   Right.
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:33.360]   And about some subject. And then they, a lot of people are just passively listening and then
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:37.680]   some get active for what's interesting is they're passively listening, but then you, you can see
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:43.040]   them there and say, Hey, is that, is that, are you actually there? And, um, and there, we have one,
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:46.480]   one person I won't call out. I think I might have done it before I got in trouble, but you call
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:51.040]   his name three times and he's got a, he's got a script set up that light turns on in his off.
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:55.280]   Evil juice. So we need to know what we would call his name three times. It suddenly just appears.
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:59.360]   You know, like, hi guys, you know, you're like, so anyway, so,
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:02.640]   there's, that's a great script. That's a good idea. That's really fun.
[01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:07.520]   We didn't actually talk about Monterey, which will be coming out also, you know, on Monday,
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:13.280]   it's kind of the day before the max early, or additions started arriving in people's mailboxes.
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:18.480]   Universal control, which was very exciting. It has been delayed. It'll be launching according to
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:24.560]   Apple later this fall. So that that's one little thing we didn't mention. I'm sure we'll have lots
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:29.040]   to talk about with Monterey next week. Renee Richie should be back. Christine, I'm really glad you
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:32.640]   could join us in his place. It's always a pleasure having you.
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:38.720]   Our show today brought to you by ITProTV. You know, October is Cybersecurity Month
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:46.240]   in the real, in the general world, but also at ITProTV. Cybersecurity, of course, is one of, if not,
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:52.400]   the most vital aspects of IT. And there are a lot of job openings. Last time I checked,
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:57:01.040]   was more than a million open cybersecurity jobs in IT. That's a lot of jobs. And we need to
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:05.520]   get qualified people to fill these roles. If you're interested, if you listen to our shows and you
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:12.160]   like technology, maybe you should check out ITProTV. It's the place to get a job in IT. Start your
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:19.440]   career or keep your career boiling over, you know, getting good jobs, getting promotions with ITProTV.
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:26.320]   It's the place to learn IT to get certified in any area, not just cybersecurity. It's also the
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:32.160]   place to get recertified and get new skills under your bell if you're already working in the industry.
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:38.400]   ITProTV is the freshest possible content. They have seven studios in their Gainesville, Florida,
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:43.440]   headquarters, seven studios in their all running Monday through Friday. And that's because things
[01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:50.000]   change the MCSE, which was a big Microsoft cert going away. They have 5,800 hours of on-demand
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:55.440]   IT training, always up to date. The test change, the software changes, new certs come out,
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:58:01.520]   nobody does it better than ITProTV. Now, let me talk about October spooky month at ITProTV.
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:07.040]   Jam packed with events focused on cybersecurity. There have been a number of events you can go
[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:11.040]   and check those out. They've been recorded and available. There's a webinar coming up at the
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:17.280]   end of the month on the 28th. It'll be Halloween themed cyber second incident response for small
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:25.120]   businesses avoiding the nightmare on Main Street. You can find out more at itpro.tv/webinars.
[01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:31.840]   You're all invited. There's a free weekend coming up this weekend, October 23rd and 24th.
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:36.560]   And of course, there's a special for this month's themes. The following courses will be part of
[01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:45.120]   the ITProTV free membership this weekend. CompTIA's security plus, CompTIA's CYSA plus, CEH,
[01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:51.920]   certified ethical hackers, CITSP. By the way, they're the official video training partner for
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:57.040]   CompTIA. So they have lots of CompTIA courses. All the certs, these are often the first certs
[01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:02.560]   people to get into the industry like the A plus cert. So this is a great place to go. ITPro's
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:09.600]   instructors, they call them edutainers, are experts in the field working professionals,
[01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:14.880]   but they also are experts at communication. They make learning IT interesting. And I have to say
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:19.680]   fun. You're going to get the most up-to-date information while preparing for exams, brand new
[01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:25.520]   content. It goes from the studios to their course library within 24 hours. They've got a great
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:31.600]   pipeline there. Courses are chunked up nicely 20 to 30 minutes. So it's really easy to watch on
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:35.920]   your lunch hour whenever you've got a moment. They have searchable transcripts for all their
[01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:40.640]   courses makes it great to just jump to the part you need to work on. And the edutainers at
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:49.360]   Workfor ITPro TV are on staff. So you can ask them for help anytime. They're also available
[01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:55.120]   no matter where you are. You can watch on the web, in your browser. They've got apps for all the
[01:59:55.120 --> 02:00:00.240]   streaming devices. So it really makes it easy. The Chromecast works with it. So you can watch on
[02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:04.000]   the big screen TV. Then getting the car listed in the car, get to your work, watching a little
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:09.760]   picture-in-picture window on your screen. You could do it all day all night. The IT world needs

[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:54.960]   I don't know. Did you want to do a pick of the week you get to anything you want? If you want to
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:01:01.760]   pick the Surface Pro, go right ahead. Surface Pro. No. Actually, this came out, I guess it was maybe
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:09.840]   last week. The famous diff tool, comparison Mac app, Klyoscope, was finally updated. I think it's on
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:17.680]   its third owner now. It's been updated for a version like 3.08 years since version two came out.
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:22.080]   If you're somebody who does a lot of diffing, whether it's with images, which is what's unique
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:27.760]   about this, the really great tool it integrates with Xcode and a bunch of other things. Just a
[02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:32.560]   really, really happy that the new developers are giving this love and that this tool that I've
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:38.320]   used for many, many years has been updated again. It's M1 Native, which is great or M Native.
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:45.920]   We have to come up with a new description of M1. It's super useful. Oh, you use it too. Nice.
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:51.680]   Yeah, when we're dealing with XMLs and HTML, or XMLs and HLS manifest and so on and so forth,
[02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:56.000]   figuring out what was different from the one that we had before is very nice. I love it that it
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:05.520]   works with image files as well. Klyoscope.app and it is a Mac app. It looks like it's not on the
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:09.440]   app store. You have to get it from the website. Yeah, you have to get a directly from the developers.
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:14.000]   It is not a subscription. It's a one-time purchase. Love that. Although they do have,
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.040]   if you bought, because there used to be in the Mac app store, I think they have a way where they
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:22.000]   can get you an upgrade. The history of it is kind of a story. The original developer was
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.920]   acquired by Facebook and then they sold to someone else and then they sold to someone else.
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:31.920]   And now, again, it's kind of been through a development health thing. But the devs who have
[02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:37.920]   taken over it have been in the Mac app space for a really long time. They put a lot of love
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:43.520]   into it. I bought it last week. I don't know. I like to support good source of tools. I will
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:48.240]   say it's expensive. You can try it out and see if it's for you. But for me, it's one of those
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:53.840]   things where it was an easy thing to agree to purchase, especially knowing that they kind of
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:58.000]   had to go and rebuild it from the ground up based on its older principles.
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:05.280]   Nice. Very good. Thank you very much. It's so good to have you on the show. I always like seeing you.
[02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:10.480]   Thank you for having me. We appreciate it doing good work at Microsoft with a senior
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:17.200]   cloud developer advocate, Christina Warren, Mr. Andy and I will pick up the week.
[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:20.240]   I thought I was going to get zorched out of buying a phone today. I kind of had my heart
[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:25.680]   set on buying a phone. So I bought a phone at the Fisher Price Toy Telephone Classic
[02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:32.000]   Catter Telephone. Oh, but the color scheme is fantastic. But yeah, and also it's a special
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:37.200]   it's only available through Best Buy. This version is identical to the real toy, but it has Bluetooth.
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:44.320]   So it'll actually work as a phone. But you're not joking. I'm not joking. It will, you can dial
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:54.240]   numbers with a little colorful dialer. You can answer calls. You can have this in its own wheels.
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:59.040]   So it's portable. It's on wheels. The eyes go bubbly bubbly bubbly bubbly like the real thing.
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:03.120]   It's got Bluetooth. So it's a you pair it to your phone and then you're using it.
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:09.120]   Working phone. It's a working phone. And also it also has a speaker phone. So just make sure it's
[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:14.320]   a serious business conferencing device. The only the only the only bummer is that well,
[02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:20.800]   I guess it is retro. So it kind of is fitting that it charges via by a mini micro USB, but it
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:26.720]   will like charge and look you get seven hours of talk time like 40 hours of standby time.
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:31.280]   I love this. So you can like push it. Yeah, exactly. That's that's exactly why I bought it.
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:35.840]   It's 60 bucks. It's not like nothing. But I feel as though I kind of want this on my desk and at least
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:41.120]   maybe it'll be less less harrowing when the phone rings. I know that's a voice call like,
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:46.640]   Oh, damn it. And you know, the color scheme goes so well with my Crayola keyboard. So between this
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:52.240]   next time I interview somebody for a job here, I'm going to use that in this.
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:58.480]   Maybe they'll say, I'm not working there. They're there. Don't take anything seriously.
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:04.480]   Wow. 60 bucks. Fisher price. It's available at Best Buy. It's a
[02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:09.920]   good one. Best Buy. They're obviously it's like they just released it today and supposedly limited
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:13.040]   quantity. So they're not going to like restock it. So I don't know whether they got it. It's
[02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:19.280]   actually hard to get in the Pixel six. I got to be honest. Wow. That's it. See, I, well, it was
[02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:22.880]   less. See, the thing is it was friendly. All I had to do was say, Hi, I have money to purchase
[02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:26.720]   this thing that you're selling. And Best Buy said, we will be happy to sell it to you. And then if
[02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:30.880]   you have, and they just simply sold it to me, they didn't have to stick, have me stick by refreshing
[02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:34.880]   a page for four hours. We got to watch the ad for this watch. This is great. The video,
[02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:42.160]   the video is perfect. The past has finally arrived with the horizon bulky design.
[02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:54.720]   Intuitive, it is. Hands on technology. Numbers. Colors. Eyes.
[02:05:57.920 --> 02:06:07.120]   Your first mobile phone is now a real mobile phone. Oh, that's brilliant. Nicely done. Well done,
[02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:14.240]   Visio, bro. You know what they know, kids aren't buying this. His parents aren't buying it for
[02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:18.240]   the kids. They're buying it for themselves. Also, because kids don't know how to dial it.
[02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:26.160]   I use the dial. It's like, I just dial work. The dial works. The dial works. Like I can dial a
[02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:30.480]   number. You can dial it. You can play. You lift the handset, dial an actual number.
[02:06:30.480 --> 02:06:36.880]   Oh, my. It's a good way to teach. It's good to teach our kids about the archaeology. You know,
[02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:42.640]   of the phone, you know, and they'll learn why you should never have a zero or especially two zeros
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:48.880]   in Europe. And I bet you really takes a long time on the Fisher Price one. What is your pick
[02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:56.240]   of the week, Alex Lindsay? So I think it's a ttechie. It's a ttechie. It's a ttechie. And here,
[02:06:56.240 --> 02:07:00.320]   I'll cut to this. This is what I'm. This is my pick for the week. So these little guys down here
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:10.080]   are a, they are the, they basically go into one of my USB-C's and they give me three more.
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:14.320]   This is a little hub for my Mac mini. What I love about it is that I can just stack it with
[02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:18.640]   the Mac mini. So I just plug it into the back and now I've got, I've got my USB-C in the front,
[02:07:18.640 --> 02:07:23.360]   but I've also got three more USBs. I've got a SD card and micro SD card. I use the micro SD
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:28.640]   card a little more. And I've got, I got one for each one of these. And it's just really been
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:38.400]   great. Because I, because I, I, I use, I use a lot of, a lot of stuff and I wanted stuff on the
[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:42.560]   front that I could just kind of plug in. You know, and so I could, and now I need my.
[02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:50.400]   SSD enclosure. So it could even be a drive. It's an M, it's the, it's the, it's the SSS chip. So I put
[02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:55.600]   a one terabyte in there. So it's, it's the card. You know, so it's got a little. So I am not too
[02:07:55.600 --> 02:08:01.440]   set it. I would work. Yeah. Just in case you're wondering, not an MVME. Not an MVME. Not, not that,
[02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:06.160]   not that I bought the wrong ones and tried to force it. Not, not knowing why it wasn't working.
[02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:10.080]   So because it doesn't have the two set and grooves. Yeah.
[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:14.080]   That's sad. They're not the same. So anyway, so I did, I did go through that process. I'm
[02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:19.680]   sending, I, well, I can't even keep them because I'll just use them anyway. But the, but anyway,
[02:08:19.680 --> 02:08:25.280]   so, so I, it's a one terabyte drive. It's not as fast as the, as the S, the S, thes are capable of
[02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:29.680]   be good time machine driver, something like that. It's like 360 megs a second. So it's not like it's,
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:35.200]   it's not, you know, I can't believe that I'm going. I built raids. I spent lots of money on raids that
[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:39.440]   would go 180 megs a second. You know, 15 years ago. I know it's an amazing. I'm like, well, it's not
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:44.400]   that good, but it's only 360 megs a second. But, but as a, you know, just, just to hold my iPhone
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:51.840]   library, because I, my photos library or whatever. But the, the thing is, is that the, my Mac
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:55.520]   Mini's don't have very much drive space on it. So having something that just, that's just an extra
[02:08:55.520 --> 02:09:02.240]   that I, that I have just another, another terabyte on it is pretty nice. I'm really happy with it.
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:05.920]   I mean, other people make hubs. It's just that what I really wanted was hubs that would just stack
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:09.360]   with the ones that I already, you know, with the thing that I had. So that's what you're looking for.
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:12.240]   It's a, it's a really great little little device.
[02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:17.280]   Sateki does good stuff. So that's nice. Yeah. Very cool. I'm going to do a pick. It's,
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:22.960]   it's actually been one that's been lying around in my, my bin, my pick bin for a while, but it's
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:29.120]   slowly expanded bit by bit. Will Green is doing something very interesting at systemtalk.org.
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:36.720]   He's doing a Macintosh history in a very interesting way, not like Andy Herzfeld, not
[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:42.640]   anecdotal. He's actually taking Mac user magazines and one by one,
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:48.960]   synopsizing them. So this is the first Mac user. Remember this came with your Mac,
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:55.120]   the subscription to Mac user when you first got a Mac. And so he's just kind of talking about the
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:10:02.640]   various things, summarizing little page grabs here and there. Here's a suspect advert
[02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:12.640]   from info.com. Yes. Love info.com and suspect. And so this is, I think this is really neat. He's,
[02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:20.400]   he's just begun this journey. So he's only got four issues so far. The October 85, November
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:27.360]   85, December 85, and January 86 issues of Mac user. I hope he keeps doing it. It's a great idea. And
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:34.720]   I have to say it's really fun going down memory lane. There's John de Vorex, the devil's advocate
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:45.760]   column in which he said, why would anyone want a mouse? So it is, it is, it is really a trip down
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:50.640]   memory lane. And it's, you know, it's just nice little idea for a blog, systemtalk.org.
[02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:55.840]   And I thought I'd give him a little plug. Nothing, nothing to buy here. Just Will Green,
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:59.920]   going down memory lane. He has other posts.
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:08.080]   Four of them now, but more to come. Thank you, Christina. Great to see you. Anything you want to
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:15.280]   plug? Anything you want to say? I apologize for the quality of my internet connection. I play my
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:24.320]   own networking setup. That's my fault. But no, I mean, I own my own network. It is. I do, I do.
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:32.000]   I just do a podcast called Rocket Relay.fm/rocket. And I do another one called Overtired. So if you
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:39.920]   want to listen to me talking over tired, brilliant. That's a brilliant name for a podcast. Christina
[02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:46.880]   is over tired. We talk so much. Exactly. Is that also in relay? It is not. That's an independent
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:52.560]   one that I do with my friend Brett Terpstra. And that's an over tired pod. Yeah, that's an
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:58.480]   over tired pod.com. Very nice. That's great. I'll be listening to that.
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:09.040]   Two ADHD nerds with lots to talk about. Over tired pod.com. And usually Taylor Swift. So
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:14.800]   a little tatie. It's a little tatie. Always a little tatie. Everything in for tatie.
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:24.400]   Mr. Annie Naco, when will you next be on GBH? I'm on at 1 p.m. on Friday. Go to WGBH news.org,
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:29.360]   live or later distribute. I'm also actually going to be on WGN in Chicago tomorrow. Oh,
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:34.880]   at a little before 10 a.m. probably talking mostly about about apples and almonds yesterday.
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:38.640]   Oh, good. Back to your old stomping grounds.
[02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:44.640]   Yeah, I've been allowed back into Chicago. Back into the trip. It was a temporary.
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:48.000]   Yes. My Chicago privileges have been restored.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:55.040]   And Alex Lindsey, of course, some great stuff always on offers hours.global. I still haven't
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:13:00.000]   made that shy recipe, but I can't wait to do that. So good. We talked about it on Sunday. Alex was on
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:04.960]   Twitter. Anything else coming up on office hours? We're really getting focused. Next week,
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:11.280]   it'll be a lot of fun to watch. We're switching to what we call office hours 2.0,
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:15.840]   which is that it won't look as much like a Zoom and it'll look more like broadcast. They're
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:21.120]   super sources, but those, much like we have here, but except that those super sources will largely
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:26.560]   be driven automatically. So we have a bunch of stuff that's watching all of that. And then
[02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:29.920]   people will be able to run it from anywhere in the world. So imagine switching between all the
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:33.920]   different things, but you're on an iPad connected to the cloud and you're just sitting there going,
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:38.080]   I want the super source and I want this person and I want to go back to the gallery. And so,
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:43.040]   so we're kind of experimenting with a new way to build shows. And so next week will be horrible.
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:50.000]   That's my prediction. But the week after that will be great. So, we'll be basically figuring it out.
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:54.720]   So we've got some great guys from liminal that are coming out to that have been working on it.
[02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:59.040]   And so basically we're, you know, you'll just see us kind of turn it on and the whole thing will
[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:05.440]   swing back and forth. But oftentimes people enjoy those shows the most. So this is really
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:10.160]   inventing the future of media here at office hours is really interesting what you're doing.
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:14.160]   It's fascinating. Office hours talked about logic this morning.
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:17.680]   I see that. We were showing earlier. Yeah, we're just a little excited.
[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:24.800]   Surround sound and all of that. You can also find Alex if you're looking for a company to help you
[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:33.280]   with your next big production at 090 dot media on media dot com 090 media dot com.
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:37.680]   There you go. I got it. No dot wait, oh, no, no, no, see, I got it.
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:42.000]   I know media. It's on. I know dot media. It was right the first time. All right. Oh,
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:48.080]   nine oh dot media. Huh, it was exhausting. I'm over tired, Christina. That's the problem.
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:56.800]   I always say, oh, because that's what they say at 090. We thank you all for joining us. We do
[02:14:56.800 --> 02:15:03.920]   Mac break weekly on Tuesdays, 11 am Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC. I will be back next
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:09.120]   week to do the show, but then I'll be taken off to Mexico for a week. But it'll be kind of my
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:17.680]   farewell appearance next week. Maybe if if Apple and UPS get the job done, I'll have a new laptop
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:22.640]   to show off. I know Renee will. I'm sure Renee will will have him next week. If you want to watch
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:27.520]   live, go to a Twitter TV slash live. There's live audio and video streams there. If you're

[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:38.240]   If you're interested in joining club, Twitter really helps us supports what we're doing here.
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:42.000]   And I think there's some good benefits, including ad free versions of the shows and access to the
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:47.760]   discord and special feeds. Lisa and I will be doing a inside Twitter on Friday for the club.
