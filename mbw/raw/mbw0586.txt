[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   Time for Mac Break Weekly. Andy Anacos here. Renee Ritchie.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.560]   We dissect Marco Arman's article on how to make the perfect MacBook Pro
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.960]   a little hint. It's not anything like the current MacBook Pro.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.000]   And then breaking news breaks out all over
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.800]   a massive security flaw in the current version of Mac OS.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.680]   We work our way through it and find a fix. It's coming up next
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.840]   on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.840]   Apple's latest. Join me right now from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.840]   Andrew Inakko in his new studio.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.840]   No, not yet. You're just seeing the angle of camera kind of screwed up a little bit.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.840]   That's okay.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.840]   But it is the new studio or not?
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.840]   It is not the new studio.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.840]   It was, but it's far enough along in the new studio that the old,
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.840]   the old sciping podcast and computer has been sort of packed up
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.840]   and I had to at the last, I had to make a substitution.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.840]   So as a result, a lot of things, I don't want to scare you,
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.840]   but there's a lot of things I've never done before in the hard.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.840]   You're doing it right now.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.840]   Let's just be happy that I'm getting video and audio.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.840]   It's working.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.840]   It's working.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.840]   I'll leave it at that.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.840]   Also with us from the Eimor family of blogs,
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.840]   the mobile nation's family of blogs, including iMore.com.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.840]   Renee Richie, he's wearing his Apple Tuke.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.840]   Yeah, it's up to a balmy zero degrees here, Leon.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.840]   I'm impressed that Apple makes Tukes.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.840]   They used to. This is from the old infinite loop store.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.840]   Now I have an open radar with them because expected behavior is Tukes.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.840]   And I'm just not seeing them anymore.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.840]   But I wanted to say it feels like a period of transition.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.840]   I helped, I sold this place, this place that I mean now, I sold this on Friday.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.840]   It was like Black Friday.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.840]   Congratulations.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.840]   You sold your home on Black Friday?
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.840]   I didn't give them a discount though.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.840]   Oh, good.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.840]   Well, no, they actually they asked me for a really small reduction,
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.840]   like in a couple hundred dollars reduction.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840]   And I thought it was so weird.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.840]   I offered them pie.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.840]   All right, but I'll give you a hundred dollars worth of pie instead.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.840]   No, like the mathematical pie.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.840]   I did like the Google rock star, Bill Co.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.840]   and they accepted it.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.840]   I'm not cherry pie.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.840]   So you said here's $314 in 95 cents.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.840]   Yeah, 50.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.840]   Yeah, whatever it was.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.840]   Yeah, it's really $14.90.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840]   Wow.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   They were okay with it.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.840]   So yeah, so I'm going to have to remodel.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.840]   I'm going to have to talk to you and Andy and Alex about remodeling podcast studio.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.840]   Nice.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.840]   6,000 wins moving day.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.840]   Not until January.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.840]   No one wanted to move over the holidays.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.840]   No.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.840]   Except Georgia.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.840]   I helped Georgia move this weekend.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.840]   So no one, but Georgia wanted to move over the holidays.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.840]   Do you have the new place yet?
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.840]   I don't.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.840]   I can't multitask Leo.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.840]   So I was determined to sell this place, get it done, and then start paying.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.840]   Well, the clock is ticking.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.840]   I know.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.600]   So here, if anything, let me know.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.640]   I tweeted an article a couple of days ago that got more comments, more back and forth
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.160]   on Twitter than perhaps anything I've ever tweeted.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.400]   And it is a fairly controversial article, but I would thought we'd bring it up.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.640]   It's from Quartz, Steve Blank.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.640]   Headline is probably more annoying than the rest of the article.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.640]   Steve Jobs' worst decision was promoting Tim Cook.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.640]   Oh, that's kind of mean.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.640]   That's kind of mean.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.640]   And Apple number 374.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.520]   Most of the article seems to be about Steve Palmer, actually, and why despite the fact
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:03.640]   that he doubled profits, tripled sales at Microsoft, he was considered a failed leader,
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:13.120]   mostly because he missed all of the, you know, he maintained the fiefdom at Microsoft's dominance
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.360]   in operating systems, but he missed mobile search.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.080]   He missed mobile.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.880]   He missed the cloud.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.360]   And as a result, his successor, Satya Nadella had to really work hard to play catch up and
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.840]   has done to his credit a very good job.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.920]   And I think, you know, if you take off the Steve Palmer stuff, Steve Blank's point in
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.960]   this article is that there's two kinds of CEOs.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.360]   There are operations guys who keep the trains running on time.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.360]   They keep things working.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.800]   They continue to build value.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.120]   They continue to, you know, build the company.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.280]   And then there's the visionary.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.960]   Of course, Steve Jobs is the king of visionaries.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:02.560]   And Tim Cook is an operations guy, but not so much a visionary.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.560]   Agree or disagree?
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.560]   Disgust class.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.560]   I don't know.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.800]   I mean, these articles go ahead, Andy.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.360]   I think it's okay for them for there to be an operations guy at the very, very head because
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.720]   that means that the people below you who can be the visionaries, who can be the let's
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.840]   make a banana shaped laptop computer, let's do an operating system that's all based on
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.360]   round pixels.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.360]   It's okay.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.640]   So you can let those birds like fly free throughout the campus.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.760]   And then at the head, there's an operations guy that will say that there is no way we
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.000]   could ramp up production on screens with round pixels.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   There's no way we can supply it.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.680]   There's no way we can manufacture it.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.720]   At the end of the day, it becomes any company is about taking ideas and putting them in
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.280]   the hands of actual people.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.200]   So so long as the operations guy isn't saying that I don't understand this idea and therefore
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   we can't do it.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.000]   So long as he's the person saying, this is a great idea, but we can't do it for three
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.040]   years to make sure that we can actually build enough.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.840]   We can actually do this correctly and we won't have to reject like one out of every three
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.840]   panels that we buy with this strange banana shape.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.840]   I think it's okay.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.760]   And also we can have lots of debates.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.960]   We certainly have had lots of debates about whether Apple is being daring and innovative
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.960]   enough.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.040]   However, you can't deny that they are hands down making products that people like and
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.760]   people will line up to buy.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.240]   So I find it hard to find failure in his tenure so far.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.880]   We should mention this was originally an article in the Hartford Business Review.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.880]   Go ahead, Renee.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:31.880]   And then I'll play the Steve Jobs video that Blank includes in his article on his blog
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.000]   because it's Steve Jobs talking about this very thing.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Go ahead.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.400]   So the thing about this is a lot of people just don't understand Apple.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.040]   I'm not saying that as an insult.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.040]   It's just you have to do a lot of very, very hard work to get a baseline understanding of
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.120]   how Apple operates as an organization because it's not built the way many other companies
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.120]   is.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.120]   And that's not an excuse.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.120]   It's just you have to do your homework.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.440]   And a lot of these are bad at perspective taking.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.080]   And somebody who has an opinion about how things should be done.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.960]   And when things don't conform to that, they're obviously wrong.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.480]   You can see that a lot of the times when people blame Tim Cook for things that were
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.440]   started and shepherded under Steve Jobs.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.560]   Like these were decisions that Steve Jobs made that came to fruition under Tim Cook in
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.920]   largely the way that Steve Jobs wanted them.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.040]   And Steve Jobs would never have done that.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.640]   The nice thing about this is there is no other Steve Jobs.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.200]   We've heard Jeff Bezos called Steve Jobs, but he made the fire phone.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.160]   We've heard more recently Evans being called Steve Jobs and he made the spectacle.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.920]   I mean, everyone is quick to an win and you Steve Jobs, but there really isn't one.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.240]   And there was certainly nobody at Apple who had product vision who also wanted to run
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.240]   the company.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.240]   Steve Jobs wanted to run Apple because he believed the best way to be a product visionary
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.120]   was to make every decision himself.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.400]   And a lot of other people just don't want to do that.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.880]   They want the freedom like Johnny Ives to be able to go and build a building for a year
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.360]   or two years and not have to worry about the day to day running of a company.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.980]   And that's just not anyone at Apple right now.
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:58.720]   So you have Tim Cook who's the person famously Steve Jobs, a lot of the iPads, Steve Jobs,
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.920]   sorry, Tim Cook got it so they could sell it for $500.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.440]   And that's the person you have running the company.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.000]   And to Annie's point, that allows everyone else from Johnny Ives to Phil Schiller, to
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.400]   the hardware and software teams to dream all the dreams they want because they know the
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.360]   bottom line is taken care of.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.200]   And these articles are always just stupefying to me because I read them and my eyes literally
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.840]   cannot roll hard enough.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:25.480]   Yeah, I'm not sure I fully agree with you or disagree with him because there's no question
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.240]   Tim is a different kind of manager.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.920]   And I guess to your point, Andy, maybe that the Johnny Ives was supposed to take that
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.600]   role as visionary.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.120]   So maybe you blame Johnny Ives for not.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:45.200]   And I have to say, I mean, Johnny has a particular point of view that has served Apple but may
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.080]   not serve in the future.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.120]   That's hard for me to always a blessing and a curse.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.120]   Your culture is always a blessing.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.040]   I think here's the Steve, let me just play this.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.760]   People get confused.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.880]   Companies get confused.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:05.840]   When they start getting bigger, they want to replicate their initial success.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:11.760]   And a lot of them think, well, somehow there's some magic in the process of how that success
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.760]   was created.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.360]   So they start to try to institutionalize process across the company.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:23.600]   And before very long, people get very confused that the process is the content.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.280]   That's ultimately the downfall of IBM.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.160]   IBM has the best process people in the world.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.920]   They just forgot about the content.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.360]   And that's somewhat happened a little bit at Apple too.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.920]   We had a lot of people who were great at management process.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.000]   They just didn't have a clue as to the content.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.120]   And in my career, I found that the best people are the ones that really understand the content
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.200]   and they're a pain in the butt to manage.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.360]   But you put up with it because they're so great at the content.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.640]   And that's what makes great products.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.840]   It's not process, it's content.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:04.880]   So I think that that's actually, I really liked that quote from Steve Jobs.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.840]   It's funny because it sounds like Apple went through this in the very early days when the
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.240]   success, and I bet they did with the success of the Apple too.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.800]   And then he made Apple University in Toronto.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:20.840]   Well, but what also happens is Steve celebrated and understood destruction.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.080]   He celebrated chaos.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.200]   He created quite a bit of his own chaos.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.200]   Ask Scully.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   Ask anybody.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.200]   Ask anybody.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   Ask anybody.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.760]   Any good CEO?
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.960]   Well, I don't know.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.520]   It depends on the measure of good.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:41.080]   But many CEOs consider that to be a bad thing and want to push that out.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:49.600]   Well, first of all, you have to understand, when I listen to that, I also think about
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.880]   the context of what the time of Apple, he was talking about that sort of stuff.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:58.320]   He was talking about a time when really the kind of boring computers he was talking about
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.680]   were Apple's lifeblood.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.080]   Apple was still making all of its money off of the Apple 2E.
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.240]   And it was industry, industry leader was where all the action was happening.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.600]   He, when they launched Macintosh, it was a colossal failure.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.080]   Financially, for a number of years, he went off and started next.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.240]   And that was a colossal failure until they were bought out by Apple.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:25.360]   All the ideas were good, but those ideas had not proven themselves to be a good business
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.640]   at that time.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:32.300]   So I would just have to, it just reminds us all to think about how you really do have
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:36.680]   to maintain a sort of a yin and a yang to be a good CEO.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.080]   I think the best ones will have one foot in that sort of, well, what if we do this?
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.080]   And isn't this an interesting idea?
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.920]   And well, there's no market for this, but this is a great idea and we need to explore
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.920]   it.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.040]   And also, here is what people are buying.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.040]   Wheat bread.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:55.040]   And we can start making some sort of weird liver flavored ciabatta because we think that
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.040]   that's innovative and that's new.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.440]   But meanwhile, people are lining up to buy wheat bread.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:05.440]   So maybe we should try to have a line of breads that have the weird stuff, but also address
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.640]   what people actually want and they think they need.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:17.040]   Yeah, I think though, there are a lot of Apple fans and Apple lovers who look at what
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:24.240]   Apple's goals are today and they are less than enthused.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:30.240]   I think that from the inside is probably horrible to have the chaos, but from the outside,
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.240]   we'd like to see the product of the chaos, maybe.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.600]   Well, also your memories, like now is always painful in the past.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.600]   It's always rosy.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.600]   Yeah, we're going to start.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.280]   And we go back and you think about mobile me and you think about, you know, just some
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.600]   of the things that happened under Steve Jobs, like, oh, this would never have happened.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.000]   I mean, he was, what I think you have here is similar to what happened to Pixar where
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.640]   you get a normalization where you don't have the highest highs, but you also don't have
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.920]   the lowest lows.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.960]   And some people really miss those giant highs, like the iPhone introduction, the iPad introduction.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.440]   And it's just not the same.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.080]   And Tim Cook isn't sort of the singular, otter, line item, veto guy.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:08.520]   He lets Eddy Q and Phil Schiller and Craig Federighi and Dan Ritchie and all those people
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.800]   run their organizations almost as if they're little companies and Apple's gotten so big.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.040]   They really are like Angel, Aaron's Apple store really is a little company in its own right.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.360]   And he more kind of shepherds a process.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.680]   And whether you need that because Apple is so much better, bigger or not is debatable.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.160]   But they are very different people.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.640]   They have very different management styles.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.120]   And the partnership Steve and Johnny had was not replicable.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.280]   You couldn't just slot anybody else into that.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.680]   So I think it was a sort of, you know, Tim is really good at this.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.320]   And the other people will, at least the hope is that they will fill in around him.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.920]   Sort of like when Steve Jobs famously came back and made that grid, you know, personal,
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.760]   professional laptop, desktop.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:52.280]   Tim very famously said software services, hardware, you know, and put everything in its
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.280]   place.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:00.960]   So you're, both of you guys agree that there's nothing to worry about, nothing to see here.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.040]   This article doesn't really describe a problem.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.720]   And that was by the way, the consensus on Twitter.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:10.800]   In fact, I think people were kind of angry by Steve Blank's article.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.600]   Probably the point.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.040]   Certainly generates views.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.240]   But the original version was in the Harvard Business Review.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.480]   I don't think the Harvard Business Review is looking for a clickbait.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.440]   Well, also they have a different perspective.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.440]   They don't understand.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.440]   It's about business.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.440]   Exactly.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.200]   They don't necessarily understand how technology is built and how science goes forward.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.520]   But they do understand how businesses are run.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:37.400]   And so if they perceive that Apple's success is based on X and a CEO delivers Y, they have
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.360]   to wonder why X is not Y.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:46.600]   In fact, Blank's original article, which was a year old, appeared last year, October 2016.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.440]   The original title was why visionary CEOs never have visionary successors, which is
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.680]   a very different and much less linkbaity.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.040]   It's hard enough to have one.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.040]   I mean, the idea of that.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.240]   Well, I think that's my, I mean, AirPods came out and that's, that's a really Apple
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.000]   product and that came out entirely under Tim Cook.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.680]   But that was my takeaway of it.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.120]   It's really is there's only one Steve Jobs.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.880]   I mean, the likelihood of a second Steve Jobs is pretty low.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.680]   And no, and by the way, and this is the blank points is that as well, had that person been
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.560]   working at Apple under Steve Jobs, he would have been fired.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.960]   And they can't have to.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.440]   Steve Jobs didn't want to go work for IBM.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.760]   He wanted to make his own trail.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.880]   And the next Steve Jobs probably wants to do his own thing too.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:31.880]   Exactly.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:32.880]   You want to come work for Apple?
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.880]   No thanks.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.880]   I'm busy inventing space radar.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.880]   I have that same problem here.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.040]   I'm trying to find my successor.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.280]   Nobody wants to do this, wants to work for me.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.280]   That would be dumb.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.440]   That would be dopey.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.560]   You need to send out seven golden tickets to all the podcast downloads.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.200]   What, you know, what'll end up happening with Twitter is it'll go away when I go away
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.800]   because you'll be in A.I.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.280]   Leo, you will impart yourself that well, I would like to do that.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.880]   I'm crossing my fingers at that can happen by the time I head head off.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.880]   Leave the little walk in, she'll say, "Hey Leo, and the whole show will begin."
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.920]   Push the button.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.960]   But that's one thing.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.600]   I mean, this isn't a, this isn't a, not a publicly held company with shareholders in
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.600]   an ongoing, it doesn't need to be an ongoing concern.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:18.240]   And when the time comes and in the normal court, I mean, it kind of, if it weren't, if
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.680]   Apple weren't a publicly held company, it didn't have all these, you know, all this market
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.760]   share, blah, blah, blah.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.240]   It could reasonably have said, "Well, no.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.240]   Steve's gone.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.240]   It was nice.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.240]   Let's pack it up."
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.480]   Giving the money back to Michael Dell.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.480]   We're done.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.720]   And yeah, and just, you know, good luck.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.280]   Good luck.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.640]   And maybe it should have, I don't know.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.640]   You're right.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:42.160]   There have been products since Steve left, including the Apple Watch, which I think you
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.040]   despite my negative points of view over time has gotten better and better.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.040]   And it is at this point.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.360]   Maybe poorer for it, I think.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.360]   I think Apple wasn't still a part of it.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.560]   At this point, there's a, well, we certainly would.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:59.960]   Although it is in the Apple, you know, the scrappy Apple that challenged IBM, the challenged
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:04.240]   Microsoft is not, is, now they've switched roles.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.080]   There's not, there's no need to be scrappy when you're the largest company in the world.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.080]   The technology is ruthless.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.440]   I mean, you look at Microsoft, you look at BlackBerry, you look at Palm, former Titans,
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.440]   you can be on top.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.440]   It doesn't mean it's permanent.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.880]   So you should always keep that.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.040]   Is that Muhammad Ali thing after he got knocked out?
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.080]   You know, that's, that's when you have the true, uh, and it has to come out.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:25.280]   Wouldn't Google, I mean, you mean, nostalgic about the early days of Google with Sergi
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.560]   and Larry, Sergey and Larry running the running the show or, you know, the early, you know,
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.120]   I mean, you can do that with almost.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.920]   It's phenomenal, but you know, yeah, you're right.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.320]   It's not the founders anymore.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.320]   Exactly.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.360]   The only I'm concerned about is that Apple becoming sort of a monoculture where that
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.800]   is one of their biggest assets that they do think as one organism so that they can focus
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:47.520]   all of their energies in directions that in the same directions.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.640]   The weird, the, the only worry that I have is that the, the Macintosh project was the
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.520]   project in this backwater building with a pirate flag hanging over it.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:01.360]   That was not afraid to totally ruin the lunch of other people at Apple and put other people
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.760]   out of business within their own company to build the thing they wanted to build.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.960]   Um, I mean, I, I can't think of anything that Apple, any piece of hardware that Apple makes
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.440]   that isn't a lovely object, but nonetheless it's okay.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.360]   Here's another rounded rectangle with very, very little differentiation.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.360]   Oh, what's the news thing?
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.880]   Oh, it's a rounded rectangle with very little differentiation.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.880]   Oh, but how about their speaker?
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.800]   It's a slightly more bulgy rounded rectangle with no differentiation.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.080]   And that's why when like the first time I held the first time, the first time you, you
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:37.420]   take a look at the, like the, the pixel phone version two, I say, wow, they made something
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.640]   as stupid as they made the power button, the sleep button, an orange color.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.920]   That's, you know, you mean the back has two colors?
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.920]   Not.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.920]   Wow.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:51.880]   I mean, it's like, and I'm just here, we're just talking about physical, physical product
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.880]   design.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.200]   I'm, when you talk about what if someone came up with this really cruel, but weird idea
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:02.440]   that doesn't fit anywhere else, do they have the ability to get some oxygen inside of Apple
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.480]   and then feed other products for all we know that's actually happening?
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.920]   But we do have, you do have to say that the same power that they have is also their weakness.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:16.680]   There's, there's no one you hear that you, the bug scientist always talk about how there's
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:22.400]   a mutation in certain ants that makes them not follow the, the group sent to the, to
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.560]   the sugar that they are just mutants and they can't follow that path.
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.720]   So they just keep erratically going off in random places, but they find incredible things.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.200]   That's the only way that the rest of the group finds these incredible things because these
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.400]   mutants that are not going along the herd.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:41.200]   It is also the plot of one out of every 1.3 animated features being released today.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.320]   If I don't go with the herd, everyone's telling me to go with the herd.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.320]   You know, yeah.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.480]   I think, I think you have that though, because you had projects like Titan, which was, was
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.480]   not an infinite loop.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.640]   It was often sunny veil.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.640]   They reimagined everything.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.920]   They didn't use next frameworks.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.920]   They didn't even use radar and they were, they were working on what, what could be next.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.440]   And special projects group has several of those.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.680]   There's AR projects and VR projects and all sorts of things going on.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.960]   So I think you have those little incubators and whether they're all successful or not,
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.320]   at least those ideas are percolated up and, you know, people in the exact committee get
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.760]   to see them and the company as a whole marches forward.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:18.500]   Well, one thing Apple does have in spades is a lot of people telling it what to do,
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.500]   including us.
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.500]   Yes, right now.
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:27.400]   There, you know, there's no lack of advice for Apple and Marco Arman has written a follow
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:33.240]   up to his piece about the perfect MacBook Pro with how Apple could go forward fixing the
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.240]   MacBook Pro.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.960]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.480]   Andy, I not go from the Chicago Sun times or an A Richie from iMore.com.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.640]   Our show today brought to you by WordPress.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:49.240]   You know, I really, I, I, I would say I consider myself an expert in content management systems,
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.640]   CMS systems.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:59.680]   I started blogging in 2000 or 2001, 16 years ago, early days of blogs.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.120]   And I used, I started with Blogger before it was a Google property.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.240]   I used something called by Noah Gray called Gray Matter.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.840]   I used Typepad, moveable type.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:17.480]   I used all of the blogging platforms, all the content management systems, including a
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:23.920]   scrappy upstart guy named Matt Mullenwig had been writing called WordPress.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:30.480]   I ran a WordPress server on one of my, I had bought a server from a software and ran that
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.800]   for many, many years.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:37.480]   And I have to say it was the most beautiful.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.800]   It just was elegant.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.720]   It really made sense.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.120]   It wasn't many of these others were buggy, were security issues.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.320]   WordPress was fantastic.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.920]   I'm back with WordPress, but I'm not running my own server anymore.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:56.000]   I'm using WordPress.com and that takes the same great software, but they maintain it.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.600]   They keep it up to date and it's part of a larger community at WordPress.com.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.800]   You get all the benefits of, of WordPress without all the headaches of running your
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.680]   own version of WordPress.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.960]   I am really a fan and I'm not alone.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.280]   Turns out WordPress now runs 29% of all the websites.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:19.760]   It is easily the number one content management system in the world, rightly.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.680]   So why do we call it a CMS, a content management system?
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:28.640]   Because WordPress is an engine that runs your website.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:33.280]   It takes all the styling, all of the information, the database and everything, merges it all
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.600]   together, creates a beautiful webpage.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.800]   Your responsibility is just one thing, content.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.200]   It takes care of everything else.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.800]   And that's all, believe me, that's all you should be worried about if you're doing a
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.800]   blog.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.480]   If you're a business and you want a website, whether it's to sell stuff or just to talk
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.080]   about your product, maybe you're a band and you need to let people know where your next
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.320]   gigs are, that's what you care about.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.320]   That stuff.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.880]   You don't want to worry about the engine, the database, all that stuff.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.160]   So WordPress takes care of the backend.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.280]   You take care of the front end.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.360]   It's a content management system.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.600]   And man, it is the best.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:11.240]   Because it's so broadly used, the WordPress API is a standard supported everywhere.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.640]   That means there's lots of third party apps, lots of people who can help you with your
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.800]   website.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:23.280]   But I would bet if you go to WordPress.com and start up right now, we're actually go to
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.320]   our version of it because then we'll get credit.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:31.440]   WordPress.com/Macbreak, you'll also get a 15% discount on your new plan purchase.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.320]   Start a site and see, you don't need experience.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.080]   You don't really need to hire anybody.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:40.040]   They can guide you through the entire process from start to finish because they do all the
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.200]   hard, heavy lifting.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.200]   You just do your content.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.160]   Hundreds of beautiful designs to choose from.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.840]   Built in search engine optimization.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.600]   It's automatic.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.960]   Plug-ins like AMP that make your page load faster on mobile.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:57.800]   HTTPS, everybody's got to have that secure browsing.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:04.280]   Social sharing so that your readers can boost your traffic by sharing it on there.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.280]   Social networks.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.040]   And the business plan lets you access hundreds of plug-ins and themes you can even bring
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.040]   your own.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.400]   Plan started just $4 a month.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:16.400]   If you're a business and you don't have a website, your Facebook page doesn't count.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.920]   Your Twitter feed doesn't count.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.240]   You need your own website.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:26.040]   I use WordPress every day and I am always, every day saying, "Wow, this is good.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.040]   They've really got it."
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.480]   I've always pleasantly surprised.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.480]   Wow.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.480]   That's a nice feature.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.080]   And by the way, I've used the customer support team.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.080]   They're the best.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:37.920]   24 hours a day, Monday through Friday and on weekends too, they really are there to help.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.880]   You can do it and you must do it.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.880]   You must have your website.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:47.560]   Everybody needs a website with its own domain name, a place you call your own on the web.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:52.480]   If you don't make it for yourself, somebody might make it for you and that's not a good
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.480]   thing.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:58.800]   Get started today, 15% off any new plan purchase at WordPress.com/Macbreak.

[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.400]   Macbreak Weekly, we're talking about Apple.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.680]   We're talking about the Mac.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.360]   We're talking about Marco Arment.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.160]   Now, Marco is very well known.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.160]   Got his start at Tumblr.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.120]   By the way, did you see David Carp, the founder of Tumblr?
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:28.760]   He said, "After thinking about it for a few months, you know what he was thinking about?
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.760]   December 31st.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.760]   December 31st.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:31.760]   December 31st.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:37.840]   Because of course Yahoo bought him in 2013 and I guarantee you he was locked in for four.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.360]   Does that cost more made of gold?
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.560]   Four exact years.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.480]   Yeah, I've been thinking about it for months.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.200]   He's been thinking about December 31st.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.760]   Just let it get here fast.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.040]   So he quit Tumblr.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.480]   Marco had quit a long time ago but made some money on Tumblr and then did a lot of other
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:56.120]   great things including, by the way, a really good blog.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.720]   He did InstaPaper first and then he did, it's doing a lot of stuff.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.720]   And over magazine.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.720]   Magazine was neat.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.320]   That kind of didn't, he sold it to Glenn Fleischman and then I think Glenn Fleischman
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.720]   ended it a year or so.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.560]   I think it was expensive, wasn't it?
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.560]   Isn't that the issue?
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.800]   It's hard to do that business.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.800]   They paid authors well.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.400]   They took a lot of time on design.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.280]   It was a very well crafted product.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.280]   That was it.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.720]   Well, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it's
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.920]   some, the thing is they left behind something beautiful that people are going to want to
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.240]   just keep taking a look at as opposed to a website.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:33.840]   What was the news news or website that was the daily, I think they called it where no
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.320]   one is thinking about it or talking about it.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.320]   No, I know what you're saying.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.320]   Well, well done.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.320]   What happened to that?
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.320]   The daily, I remember that.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.320]   That was the one they hired a hundred journalists.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.320]   Birdoff took it out back.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.320]   Birdoff took it out.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.320]   Okay.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.320]   But out of its misery.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.480]   So Marco is still around.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.560]   He's a regular blogger.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.800]   We talked about his post.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.880]   Was it last week that I think we talked about it of, of the best Mac last week.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:00.720]   The laptop, which is this still on the site came this close to buying it.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.600]   The 15 inch MacBook minus touch bar.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:09.640]   So I guess somebody said, well, Marco, okay, you're so smart.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.520]   What should the next MacBook pro do?
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.200]   And he's got a new post went up on the 24th fixing the MacBook Pro.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.160]   I like a lot of this.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.400]   I know Andy will like the first part.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.960]   Get rid of the freaking butterfly.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:27.720]   I don't know if he suggests using the magic keyboard and I really like the magic keyboard,
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.680]   but we've established that I like almost every keyboard.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:33.680]   So you're the wrong thing about the magic keyboard.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.560]   Crazy about the magic keyboard to travel on.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.360]   That's pretty short as well.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:41.480]   It's better though, certainly than the butterfly keys.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:46.040]   He says, go back to Cesar keys, which is I agree with that instead of the butterfly keys.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.800]   They feel a little wobbly, right?
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.920]   But they give you more tactile.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.680]   The point is tactile keyboard doesn't.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.000]   The magic keyboard does not feel as wobbly to me as the old.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   I agree.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.760]   I use a Lenovo ThinkPad that has lots of key travel.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.600]   It feels like an old fashioned keyboard doesn't have the click.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.440]   I can live without the click, but it's great to type on.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.960]   I use an IBM Selectric.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.200]   I wired it right into that.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.200]   That would be the way.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.080]   So Andy, what so you told me and I bought it and I agree with you.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.680]   The DOS keyboard, I think was your favorite.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:20.720]   Yeah, as a matter of fact, I've got the only times I don't use this keyboard are when
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.240]   I'm podcasting because it's way too loud.
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.000]   But it is, oh my goodness, it is lokshri.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   It is lokshri for me.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   I know.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Is that the code keyboard?
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Which one is that?
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Is that DOS keyboard?
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   I think this is a, I'm sorry.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.680]   No, this is a, this is a code keyboard.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.040]   I looked like a code and I love my code keyboard.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:41.480]   Now one of the things about code is they use the cherry as the DOS keyboard does.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.440]   Cherry switches.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:47.120]   But the DOS keyboard, I think, is cherry brown, which is not clicky at all.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.160]   I think but with a lot of these, you can actually choose.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:55.520]   I don't know if I don't have it near the desk, but before I, before I bought this because
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:00.400]   it's a hundred and fifty dollar keyboard, you can buy for ten dollars, like a flight,
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:05.520]   literally like a flight of keys where it's just one, two, three, four keys on a, on a
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:10.400]   board that has each the cherry red, the cherry brown, the cherry black, the cherry blue,
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.800]   and a set of different like a, a last summer bands you can put underneath it so that you
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.240]   can actually test out the feel of each one and say, yes, I think I will have the cherry
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:23.040]   brown switch, but I want you to put like the white elastomer bands on the underneath it
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:28.160]   for the for the for the key pressure switch and for the bounce that I want.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.160]   If you're if you're at all particular, but basically, I mean, I think that anything could
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.520]   be better than both the magic keyboard and the keyboard that's on the MacBook Pro.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:40.080]   We've been through this a hundred times, but I'll just repeat that it is so hard for me
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:45.120]   to give up this Lenovo ThinkPad that I bought again on a lark because it was cheap.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.600]   I just wanted to have one in my in my library of hardware because everything about it is
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:55.200]   full of creature comforts and things that don't feel like a pain in the butt.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:01.040]   And this keyboard is again, it's not the it's not the it's not like a 19 1989 brand
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:05.360]   transportable compact with a huge huge like marshmallow like switches.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:09.280]   It's just thick enough with enough of key travel to make you feel like you're actually typing on
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.480]   something other than a slice of processed American cheese.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.040]   Do you remember which switches you got on your code keyboard?
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:18.720]   I think they were brown and I don't think I put in any.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.560]   The brown doesn't doesn't click.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.920]   Brown is a little bit quieter.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.520]   It's not that quiet.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.280]   Yeah. Yeah. But this is code keyboards.com.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.120]   You know, it's funny because I bought the DOS keyboard.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:35.840]   One thing I like that you recommended on the DOS keyboard, it has media controls on it.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.080]   But so you can turn the volume up and all that stuff.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.000]   But I but I have now two code keyboards, one at home and one at work,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.480]   because I love the code keyboard.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.240]   It's just simple. There's no number key.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.040]   It's not I'm not a.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:47.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.360]   I don't need a number keypad.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.320]   It's so compact.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:55.200]   This is called a plus I think it's called the plus 10 configuration.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.760]   Where it has a separate keypad, which means it has separate page up, page down keys.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.360]   It does have a row function keys, but it doesn't have like the Saratoga
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:08.880]   aircraft carrier style flight deck of extra keys.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.640]   But it's I don't think. And if you're an e-max user, you'll love the fact that you can hit
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.640]   nine keys simultaneously.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.280]   You can card like crazy on this thing.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:26.640]   You know, just last month, my my my my my freshman cop side professor at RPI told me that I still
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.520]   had an APL project that I didn't come in for. It's perfect for that.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:33.840]   So it has you can make a switch to APL. But but but the things I'm getting at it though,
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.360]   here is another one of my favorite keyboards.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.120]   And this is like the old like Apple.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.880]   It's not bad. It's not bad.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:43.360]   It's actually I mean, basically what they did was they took their their MacBook keyboard style
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:47.840]   at the time and simply made it portable, which is okay because these were actually very,
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.600]   again, not not as luxurious as your code keyboard next to that.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.400]   The difference there is key travel.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:59.280]   So you could see the the thinness of that Apple keyboard means that the keys can only move a
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:03.680]   few millimeters. The code keyboard, the keys move in like a quarter of an inch.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.520]   I mean, it's just I mean, it's going.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:10.880]   And you might worry and think that, Oh, well, gosh, isn't that kind of tire up my my my
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.520]   fingers? Well, no, it doesn't. It's it's different. It's it's why it's why when people said, Oh,
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:19.520]   you only do the only reason why you think that the the Mac new MacBook keyboard is garbage,
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.760]   because you're just too used to your old one. And I had to say, excuse me, I switched between
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:29.680]   this code keyboard and this old Mac keyboard and this logic tech keyboard and the keyboard
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.360]   cover off keyboard. Look at that one with round keys. That looks to yeah.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:38.480]   I don't. Yeah, it's it's I bought this on my way to getting the Logitech K 811, which I think is
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:41.840]   the best transportable keyboard you can get. Yeah, but that's different. If you're looking for
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:46.880]   affordable, that's different. It has a it has a really good feel to it. Yeah. And I and I
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:52.000]   also think that the Logitech K 11, even though it's small enough that I can actually just transport
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:58.400]   it around a test on my backpack, it is it would be probably amongst my top three or four most
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.080]   comfortable keyboards I have in the office. I would have no problem doing it. What makes a keyboard
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:07.920]   comfortable for you, Andy? For me, you just have to have some sort of positive feedback on your
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.920]   fingers so that I don't have to keep looking down to see where my fingers are placed. I don't I need
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:16.320]   some sort of tactile feedback that says that yes, you have pressed down hard enough and far enough,
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:20.560]   and now you can move on to the next key. When you have something that is flat, when you have
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:26.080]   something that is flat as this keyboard or as most keyboard covers, the thing is your my fingers
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:31.520]   walk just a little bit. And it's not until I notice how many typos I'm making that I have to go look
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:38.080]   down at my keys to resenter myself or rehome myself. And the amount of it's it's okay with
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:43.200]   something like a keyboard cover, because it's miraculous how how nice a keyboard apple will give
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:48.560]   you in an iPad keyboard cover that is barely thicker than the non keyboard version of that
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:53.840]   cover. It's like you may as well just have a keyboard cover with you at all times. It's almost
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:35:00.640]   offensive when you have a laptop that costs $2,000 that I'm meant to be using all day every day as my
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:07.280]   primary machine. It's even kind of offensive for $1,200 or $1,300. That's that's such an it's such an
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:17.120]   a extreme design, extreme and design, divisive design that it like I've like I've said a few
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:22.960]   times before in the show, it's like I have to take a step back and wonder where their heads are at
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:27.200]   because that's such a crazy, stupid design that I just don't know what they're thinking.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:33.120]   So obviously, if you've been listening, you understand that there are people who care
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:39.360]   about keyboards, and then there are people who couldn't care less about keyboards and all of,
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:44.720]   you know, both of those. I do have preferences like if I if I prefer the new keyboard to the
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:49.680]   old one, I enjoy typing on it more when I go back, I don't like it as much, but I can still use it.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.360]   But when I hear people who can't use the new one, I think that's where the problem lies,
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.520]   like a keyboard should be adaptable. It should be enough that yeah, it might not be my favorite,
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:02.160]   but it's still great. And other people really love it as opposed to I like it, but everyone else
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.840]   thinks it's hot garbage. You know, that's that is a huge problem. You cannot have a divisive,
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.840]   like Andy says, often you can't have a divisive keyboard when there's one manufacturer in one
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:14.240]   model of a computer available. Yeah, and I can I mean, I can't it's not like I can't use a Mac
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:20.480]   book. I can't and I actually really I understand, especially the Mac book, which is so thin and
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:24.400]   light and that you know, there's not going to be a lot of key travel on that. But I also have very
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:31.680]   thin and like you laptops like the HP Spectre that's thinner even in the Mac book and has and for
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:37.200]   some reason, to me, it comes down to accuracy. And how many times after retype my gosh darn
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:44.640]   password and on the Mac book, I have to tie off I guarantee it's like tennis where you try a really
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:48.880]   you try an ace first, but you hit the net. Then the second time you're going to carefully
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:54.000]   hit it so it goes over the net. That's kind of how it is with me entering passwords on the
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.840]   Mac book. I'm trying to do it fast, but inevitably screw up. And then I have to go
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:06.960]   whereas something like the code keyboard with more travel more tactile feel. I agree with you,
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:11.520]   Andy, somehow it makes it more accurate. I'm not sure why. And I also think Renee, you may be right,
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:19.600]   it could just be I'm just used to a certain style. I'm an old school kind of guy. The really
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.680]   sweet thing about these code keyboards is dip switches on the back that let you make a Mac
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:30.160]   layout or a Windows layout, let you use Devorac if you want or was it Colmac? There's other
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:36.000]   keyboard layouts as well as Quirty. You can even and this is the main reason I really I love it.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.160]   I know you could do this in software, but you can in hardware use a dip switch to disable
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.720]   caps lock to make it a control key, which is what it ought to be.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:49.280]   Who's it to put the caps lock just have a MacBook just have a glass surface with a with a texture
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:53.360]   mapping surface. Yeah, it will all be fine because the keyboard can look like anything and
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:57.040]   your fingers. But that's that is where we're headed. And it's one of the reasons I understand
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:02.560]   the touch bar now having read that interview with Johnny Ive who said the thing about software
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:09.040]   that's so great is it can be anything. Yeah. And and and so that's where kind of like the
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:12.400]   iPhone 10 is an example of that member wants to even introduce the iPhone. He said the problem
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:16.000]   with them are all in the lower 40 because the keys don't change. And it's like you add a new
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.480]   feature you can't ship a new key. We talked about this last week, didn't we? And Andy pointed out
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:25.760]   quite rightly that there's an advantage to knowing, you know, for instance, the iPhone still has a
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:31.840]   mute switch, a physical, un-reassignable. So you'll still have a caps lock, Helio, but all the rest
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:40.320]   will be. God damn it. Well, see, that's that's again, every Apple has its strengths and weaknesses.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:45.440]   One of its weaknesses is that there is a culture of arrogance that can come into play and saying,
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:50.400]   we know better than the user does. And oftentimes they do, but sometimes they say that the thing is,
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:55.360]   believe me, once we get rid of all the vowels on your keyboard, you'll get used to it. People very
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:00.240]   rarely use what you really should be using Siri for typing anyway. We've given you something better
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:05.920]   than a keyboard. You're welcome. Well, we've gone on too long. I didn't mean it because we're talking
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.640]   about Marcos. But there are a lot of very good points in his article. Well, let's continue on.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:17.920]   Ironically, I got to the model 100 with the that's a good keyboard. Where is your Apple? Your
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:23.680]   Apple extended to Andy. Come on, just whip it out. Ironically, what's so weird is during this
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:30.640]   discussion, this crap Microsoft wireless keyboard died on me. I'm trying to go back.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:35.600]   I said, no, you don't like me. And I just had John put new batteries in it. That didn't
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:40.720]   fit. Can you bring me just a plug in? I don't like wireless voice. It had the comments about
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:46.480]   Steve Ballmer. And it just would not have it. So Marco starts with, and I'll get back to it as
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:52.800]   soon as I can. Turns out without a keyboard, you're pretty much used to be. Well, he talks about
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:57.280]   you only see your head of touch. Yeah, well, oh, that's right. There you go. Now we'll go back
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:04.320]   here. Okay, to Marco. Thank you, Andy. I did turn on the tablet mode. I've seemed to have lost
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:11.840]   everything. Okay, no more windows. Let's go back to the Mac. What is going on? I've lost all control.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.000]   I can't even do the touch. I think I need to reboot.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:19.120]   See, now is the time for me to tell you that the big change that I made for this session is that
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:24.640]   this is the first time I'm skyping in a Mac break weekly on the ThinkPad. Oh, you see
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:30.480]   it on the one of them? Because the Mac because the Mac because the Mac book has a bad battery,
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:35.840]   has to go to Apple to be to be fixed. And I finally got around to like actually doing. Yeah, so
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:42.400]   you're recording in on that in an audition and Adobe audition is happening. I do you know what?
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:49.920]   I love my ThinkPads. I like my X one carbon yoga so much. I bought a T four 70. These are the
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:58.240]   greatest laptops ever. I would all Marco really had to write is just put Mac OS on a ThinkPad and
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:05.680]   we'll all be happy. Anyway, moving on. He he matches the keyboard. He says the magic keyboard
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.960]   only needs one change to be perfect for the MacBook Pro. We're reverting to the inverted
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:14.400]   T arrow key arrangement, which you have on your Lenovo by making the left and right arrow keys
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:20.880]   half height again, which I disagree with. I like full height. But so okay, oh, because you can
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.880]   align your fingers by feeling the T ship. That's actually true, but doesn't need half height keys
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:31.520]   for that. Great first party USB C hubs. Apple doesn't make a USB C.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:36.560]   Well, they don't even put on a down like they put a 3.5 millimeter adapter in the iPhone box
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:40.480]   because they knew that change is hard and they didn't bother to put a USB A adapter in the
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:46.880]   MacBook box and changes equally hard with USB C. I use the other one on the box.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:52.880]   I use the other one on the dock, which I really, really like. That's Thunderbolt 3 to that so it
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:59.360]   can drive a Thunderbolt 3 device. You can drive it drive multiple monitors. It has type A 3.1
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:05.040]   connectors, several of them. It has a full size HDMI. It has ethernet. It's not portable,
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.280]   but when you sit down with your MacBook and you dock it, that is very nice.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:12.720]   The thing is you should never unbox something and not be able to use it with your system.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.760]   And that's just one of those things where like with the iPhone, you can't use your headphones.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.440]   Yes, you can. There's an adapter. Oh, you can't plug in your webcam or you might guess you can.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:23.360]   There should be an adapter. Well, we said it's funny. I can't remember who it was, but we said a
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:30.640]   USB type A connected headset as we often do to a future. Yeah, oh, guests and the guy I can't
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:34.240]   remember who it was didn't use it. He said, well, I have a MacBook. I can't.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:38.160]   And that's a real I mean, that's something that Apple should solve for.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:44.720]   Is it there's an afters? I can't do it. That is part of it. It's galling after you spent $2,000
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:49.680]   for a laptop that oh, by the way, here's an extra 60 bucks for the USB-C adapter. Here's an extra
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:55.520]   amount of money for this and that and the other. It's it's it's yeah, it's again, it's it's galling.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:59.360]   It feels like you have enough money. I don't know how much money you're making off of each one of
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:05.920]   these MacBooks. It is enough that you can bulk buy and have manufactured a bunch of USB to USB-C
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:13.440]   adapters and give me one. Give me a yeah. It's web 75794 says in the chatroom, if they shipped an
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:18.480]   adapter, the transition to USB-C would never happen. So people need to accept the transition
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:24.240]   and move forward. No, you lose a dongle and you have to buy more dongle. So it what all it does is
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:28.400]   make the transition less of a brick wall and more of a speed bump. And it's not like manufacturers
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.640]   are falling all over themselves to make us stop. That's the problem. Yeah, if I could go out and
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:38.720]   buy everything. So this is the this is the T four to 70s thinkpad. See, if if I could run Mac OS
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:46.960]   on this, I would die a happy man. Maybe I shouldn't say that anyway, full size ethernet, one USB three
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:57.920]   to USB three, a a full size HDMI, a Thunderbolt USB, you know, type C connector that can charge it
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:06.640]   as well as be all the Thunderbolt three stuff. And then on the other side to another USB port
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:14.560]   and SD card slot. This is and it's no fatter or heavier than a MacBook Pro. This this would be
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:21.680]   the ultimate MacBook Pro. If if only we could get Apple to just buy thinkpad. Oh, the keyboard is
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:29.120]   not flat enough Leo. I mean, come on. Oh, I love this. You know, because it's it is it is it more than
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:36.000]   point five two millimeters of travel? Probably. You can get rid of the track point. I'm not wildly
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.880]   crazy about the little nub. It's a signature though. For that. Some people love it. Some people love
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.880]   it. You can and if you get rid of that, then you can get rid of the physical left, right, middle
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.600]   button. You could just have a big glass Apple style trackpad. Apple does make the best of those.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:56.400]   I'll I'll grant you that real function keys and escape key that you press. Just little things like
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:03.200]   that. I just this would be maybe I should can I hack and touch it? Well, not when they got an
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:09.040]   arm chip in there, Leo. Oh, yeah, I know. That's coming. I probably am going to buy a man. I was
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:13.440]   thinking about it. $5,000 iMac Pro. And I thought, well, I kind of have to don't if I spend that
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:17.680]   much money on this. You see that all over Twitter? It's like, I really don't want to, but I sort of
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:24.160]   think I need a Mac and iMac Pro. No one needs it. Audio editing. No, it would speed up my production
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:29.840]   so much. No, if you're using the solid works or you're launching rockets, maybe, but no human
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:35.440]   needs it. No, but Leo, these are the lies we tell ourselves. All right, he says, let's see more ports.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:39.440]   Yes, this basically agreeing with what I was just saying.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.880]   Alex, the last week about keeping the right side the same and changing the left side is a
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:50.480]   transition machine. Okay, but look at the all the what's wrong? See, yeah, yeah. Okay, so you're
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:57.040]   right, our chatter. It's not going to force people to just eat it and go with USB-C. But,
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:02.640]   in the meanwhile, it works with everything. I would like USB-C on both sides, at least,
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:05.920]   though, because so many times I've gone to college. The nice thing about this is I can charge on
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:09.760]   either side. No, I agree. That's one thing you've been saying on this. It also has a slot for an
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:14.640]   LTE chip. That's another matter. That was going to say. It's just see the difficulty with a lot
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:21.440]   of those arguments is that that's fine. So long as you force the rest of the world to stop along,
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:26.240]   too, the rest of the world to stop using ethernet and the rest of the world, because it's...
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:31.200]   I love Type-C. Apple should put it on their freaking iPhone if they care that much about it.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:38.640]   Stop using lightning, Apple. Yeah. It's just that, again, it's... I'm sure a lot of people,
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:42.720]   with good reason are complaining that we've just spent a lot of time talking about a Windows Notebook.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:47.120]   But we're talking about it within the context of the ways that I personally am disappointed with
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:54.240]   the MacBook, that you can have... Once you start using a Notebook where you realize that, "Oh,
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:59.360]   there is a world in which I don't have to travel with this Donville. Oh, there's a world in which I
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:05.520]   wouldn't have been totally screwed in this situation." Yes, start to wonder why doesn't Apple want me
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:09.520]   to live in a world in which I'm not totally screwed in multiple situations? Especially when they can...
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:14.640]   Especially when... Here's an example of it's only a tiny, tiny, tiny bit thicker, not enough to
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:19.200]   make it a protest about everything. It's about the same amount of money, if not cheaper. It's...
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:23.920]   Yeah, it's different. Apple's about people moving in their direction, not about accommodating. It
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:28.720]   used to be... You know, when Apple was a minority and Windows was the majority, Apple had to accommodate
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:34.000]   everybody. But once... And I knew this would happen. I even said, you know, when we were talking about
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.640]   the monopolistic behavior of Bill Gates and Microsoft, "Hey, if Apple had the market share
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:45.520]   Microsoft had, they'd be worse." And now we know. It is all about skating to where the puck is going
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:49.520]   to be. But the flip side of that is that you're forcing everybody to go to where you are with the
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.960]   puck as opposed to going where they want to go. There's an advantage to that, and I'm glad that
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:58.560]   that exists. It's such a... I mean, like, there's... USB-C is also problematic because USB-C and
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:03.360]   Lightning and Thunderbolt 3 look the same, but the points aren't the same. Not all USB-C ports are
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:08.160]   Lightning... are Thunderbolt 3. Not all USB-C cables are the trouble. How about this? I got one for you.
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:13.040]   So I have an HTC phone that has... I have two phones without a headphone jack, the new Pixel 2
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:20.000]   from Google, and an HTC U11. And the HTC came with a USB adapter for headphones. I thought,
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.400]   "Oh good, I've got one. You type C it." And it doesn't work on the Pixel because there's no
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.800]   standard for digital audio. And the Pixel doesn't come with one. I opened mine. No, the Pixel does...
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:35.840]   No, it has one. Yours didn't have one? My Pixel 2 didn't have a USB-C to... 2.5 millimeter headphone.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:41.680]   Oh, you got robbed, dude. Maybe it's the Canadian version. Check the packaging. I'll do that.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.240]   Yeah, I bet you it's in there. I saw a lot of people on Twitter complaining about it, too.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:49.760]   Maybe... Maybe I'm mistaken. In any event, you need that. Always put the adapters. Every
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:53.360]   company out there, please, if you're going to change something, at least for a generation or
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:58.080]   to include an adapter. Especially if it's not a standard and you have to have the adapter that
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:02.240]   works with that phone. By the way, I know my Pixel... Now, you didn't get an XL. You got the
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:05.600]   little one. So maybe the little one. I got the XL. I did get the XL. I did not get the little one.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:10.480]   The Pixel 2 XL came with an adapter in... Double check. Check. I think you threw it away.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:15.920]   No, I told the wall, I'll go check right in the spring. Mine had an adapter. I keep boxes.
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:21.040]   Good. Smart man. Oh, I could see them. Yes. How about this? This is going to be controversial.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:27.120]   Back away from the touch bar, says Marco Arment. Sorry, it's a flop. It was a solid try,
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:32.960]   but it didn't work out. No shame in that, but Apple needs to recognize it and move on.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:37.040]   See this, I think there's a third option because some people say keep it. Some people say ditch it.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:41.200]   Steve Aquino, who's a really popular accessibility blogger, was saying how important it is for him
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:45.440]   because it made the keyboard. He just can't do a lot of things with keyboard and it made that.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.320]   More right. Totally. But the third option is just make it better.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:54.240]   Put force touch in it and work on the idea. Maybe give it a generation of improvements or two
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:59.200]   and then decide whether it's pass-filling. I agree with Marco that keep touch ID and keep the
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:03.200]   secure enclave. I don't find it useful to have a... The screen is a bonus.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.520]   It's a bonus. You can leave it in. It probably costs 100 bucks or something.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:14.480]   The problem with it is you can't touch type and have to look down at a screen that never is the
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:19.760]   same. Yes, that's that example of software is more flexible than physical, but it's not as
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:23.280]   useful for touch. And it's devices because some people just never use the function keys or they
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:26.880]   only use them for brightness and they saw no point in it. Some people who are video or audio
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.760]   editors love it because they can scrub through it. So it's one of those things that's highly
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:34.640]   divisive. And it depends on how much. And I don't know what Apple stats are on usage for it either.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:38.240]   Yeah, they may know better. Go ahead, Andy. Sorry. I just think that the problem... It's a much
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:43.040]   bigger problem than that. I think that Apple put it in without deciding what it means, what it should
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:48.240]   do, what it should represent. So as a result, it's just a second screen that adds clutter and removes
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:53.040]   something that people find useful. It has the same... I think it has much the same problems as the
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:58.480]   first generation of the Apple Watch software. We know that we want to have a tiny little screen
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:03.280]   on someone's wrist. We know it. We want it to interact with the phone in some way. We have no
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:07.200]   idea what the relationship should be between that watch and the phone and the watch and the user.
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:14.800]   Even a year later, I don't think that there is any consistent message on here is what the touch
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:20.640]   bar is for. And here is why we took away our... Here's why it replaces a row of function keys.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:25.920]   There is no common sense to its implementation. And the only things that are interesting about
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:32.080]   how it's being used are when people decide to do a night writer flashing a strobe effect on it
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:37.840]   or decide to a version of doom that runs entirely in that little bar. I think... I mean, if the next
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:43.920]   version, they decided to make it just one-third the width of the keyboard. They will put hardware
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:48.320]   function keys to the left and the right and keeping a space for Touch ID. And they simply said...
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:55.040]   They simply said, "This is the Siri bar. This will always be a place where Siri
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:52:00.080]   owns this real estate. Siri will be talking to you through this spot so that when it needs to
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:04.160]   remind you of an upcoming appointment, instead of necessarily interrupting you, it will simply
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:08.320]   put you... Give a piece of advice you might need right here at the time when you need to use it
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:13.040]   and give you actionable buttons that will not distract you from whatever user interface you're
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:16.960]   focused on on the main screen." That's the sort of stuff I'm talking about where it has to have a
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:22.160]   reason. It has to have a point of view as it is. It's just a thing they decided, "Wouldn't that
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:26.320]   look cool? We could just sort of stick it right there. Great. Let's ship it." I know... I know... And
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:29.200]   of course, I know they went through a lot more thought than that. But from the point of view of
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:34.080]   someone who can only see the finished product, it looks like freshman design student asked
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:39.520]   as a midterm project, redesigned the MacBook Pro, thinking, "Wouldn't it be awesome if we put
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:44.880]   another screen above the keyboard?" It does feel like a fan design, doesn't it, a little bit? Yeah.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:53.120]   Looks like a sticker. Anyway, going on, the rest of it is less important, although I think the
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:58.080]   points are well taken. And I see a charger. He says, "Put the light back on the charging cable...
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:01.040]   Or those little horns that you could wrap things around. Or the best thing for the
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:05.600]   cable extension cord." They took away MagSafe. Okay, but you took away my extension cord as well.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:09.040]   Yeah. To go buy an extension cord. Yeah, that's so weird that they did that,
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.600]   because I don't want to plug that brick into the wall. That just is not a good thing. But that's
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.720]   the thing is, you can change things. But if you change things and take them away too,
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:19.440]   you're just telling me not to like you. And that's the sort of consumer psychology I don't understand.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:24.880]   You have to have a reason for doing it. You took away my clicky keyboard on my phone,
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:28.240]   but you said, "Here is why we took it away because we can give you something much better,"
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:33.120]   which is a keyboard that admittedly is going to take you a little time to get used to.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:37.280]   But it means that we can give you a full screen experience so we can replace the clicky keyboard
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:41.840]   with music playback controls, when music playback controls make more sense. With this one,
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:45.120]   they just said, "We took away your thing because we thought it would be awesome to have a tiny
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:50.160]   little strip right there." That's what gets me upset. Well, so for this, with the charger,
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.680]   the whole thinking was, "I Macbook should be more like iPads." Where you charge them,
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:57.040]   then you go out for the entire day, the battery lasts, whatever, eight hours,
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.920]   and you come home and charge it again. So you don't need MagSafe, you don't need the extension
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:04.640]   card. Just treat it like an iPad. But Macbooks are iPads, and at least our traditional usage of
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:09.280]   them aren't iPads, and that transition is not instant. So give me that buffer.
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:15.120]   This is where Apple screws up. Tim Cook famously, when talking about PCs with touch screens and
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:20.400]   PC laptops and tablets with touch screens, they talked about the toaster oven fridge that sometimes
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:24.560]   you put one thing on another and it just doesn't make any sense. I think that they are toaster oven
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:28.640]   fridging the Mac line by trying to make it as much like an iPad as possible,
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:32.320]   not understanding that there's a reason why people buy a MacBook instead of an iPad.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:36.400]   And of course, as people are pointing out in the chatroom and I pointed out,
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:41.120]   Apple had the best quarter they've ever had. And they sold a ton of those MacBook Pros.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:45.200]   But we don't know, because there was no A/B test. If there was a brand new version that's
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:51.520]   2015 MacBook Pro that had KB Lake and it versus this, and maybe the mainstream actually prefers
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.720]   these. Maybe that's true, but there's no way we can actually say that.
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.280]   Because there's no metrics for it.
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:02.560]   So I mean, the chatroom says he works in a bank and every MacBook Pro has a touch bar.
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:08.880]   But to do what I did, which you have to step down on your MacBook Pro, I got the 13-inch
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:14.480]   without the touch bar. And actually, John points out that we have lots of the 2015
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:21.200]   inches, because that was what we were buying for a long time. I don't see actually a lot of
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:24.880]   touch bars. And Apple is a huge MacBook customer. And people at Apple are very fussy about their
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:28.240]   computers. So you have to believe they're getting a ton of internal feedback. And again, maybe
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:33.840]   most people at Apple love these. But you have that MacBook at one end, that MacBook with the
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:37.840]   function keys that's lower end with only two ports. But there's nothing at the high end.
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:41.760]   There's nothing for people who want, even though it's not power efficient, people are like,
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:45.120]   I sit at my desk and I just want to move it once in a while. The Alex Lindsey's that
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:49.680]   here's better, more RAM, better graphics. Even if you don't sell a lot, it's inspirational.
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:54.720]   It's aspirational like the Mac Pro. You got to have that Lamborghini at the top for the 10 people
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.680]   who want to buy it fine. But it makes a statement in your product line.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:03.520]   Timothy Buck, of course, immediately posted a blog post, why Apple will never do.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:12.000]   Marco, once them wants them to do. And I don't think we even need to read that article to know,
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:17.680]   of course, they're not going to do it. The last thing Apple would, I'm not that they haven't
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:23.120]   admitted mistakes, like the Mac Pro. The fatty nano, the buttonless iPod shuffle.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:28.800]   But losing the touch bar would be, I think that's a horse of a different color.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.880]   I think that would be a challenging thing. You could project a future where
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:37.920]   Face ID oblivates the need for a touch ID. Oh, they could explore the excuse.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:42.880]   And also, there's been rumors for a while that Apple is working on and all what's paper,
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:47.200]   what's the technology they use in the Kindles. I forget the display.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:52.720]   Yink. Yeah, E and keys that could actually be dynamically re-lettered as they go to.
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:56.400]   And that would give them an excuse to rev the end. You can find an excuse for anything Leo.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:01.440]   Yeah, that's true. I repeat. Courage. It's courage.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:07.280]   Yeah, I mean, that would be interesting. It would be super interesting if they did something like
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:11.440]   E-ink on the cover of the MacBook. That would always tell you, here's what your battery status
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:18.160]   is. Or here is, we know that there is the technology so that it can keep aware of incoming messages
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:22.480]   and incoming status things without alerting the entire system to light back up again.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:28.160]   To simply, as you're carrying it to not just simply give you Instagram alerts, but to tell you
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:34.880]   that just to tell you that, okay, your battery is at 20%, yes, you do need to take your only
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:38.480]   going to the coffee shop for a couple of hours, but you do need to take a charger today.
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:43.520]   Stuff like that. That would be interesting. I still miss the idea. Actually, that's one thing
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:49.040]   I still super miss. The ability to simply answer the question, do I need to take my charger today,
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:54.880]   or do I not? And it kind of bumps me out that they did a really cool, very simple, subtle way
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:58.320]   of having a battery indicator on the edge of the MacBook, but they decided, nope,
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:03.440]   give some people joy. We must be eradicated. We are the joy killers of Apple.
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:10.800]   So he actually, Timothy actually goes through a piece by piece. And by the way, we should
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:16.240]   point out as he does the butterfly switches, those new switches have had some reliability issues.
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:21.920]   You don't want to get any dust in there, but he says it's 40% thinner, it's more stable. I don't
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:26.960]   know if I agree with that. Those code key keyboards have a steel plate behind the keys,
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:31.360]   which is about as stable as you can get. Well, they just mean that they don't wiggle like
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:34.320]   there's no wobble on the actual keyboard. I don't know what's wrong with that. I mean,
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:39.520]   we're talking to type is need tactile feedback. Well, they want they want it to be up and down
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:44.800]   feedback and not wrote like not almost like an axis feed. I mean, some people might want that,
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:48.880]   but what Apple's design goal was was to keep the piece flat and not let them move, you know,
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:54.880]   yeah, that's what they off angle pitch. Yeah, you may be enough just to have a longer throw.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:59.680]   I don't know. None or on generation two already, maybe gen three will be.
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:07.440]   Well, that's what Buck saying. Well, I, you know, I guess we've kind of gone through.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:14.880]   Gone through the touch bar provides value for those who haven't memorized keyboard shortcuts.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:21.440]   Okay. I would submit anything with the word pro in it is for people who do memorize.
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:25.600]   Yeah. So those are the two issues that sort of you hit on straight here is that there are
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:29.040]   people who are traditional Mac users who know all this. They've been using keyboard shortcuts
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:33.120]   for 10 years and it's not a problem for them. But then you have the massive halo market of people
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:37.200]   coming from iPad and iPhone, which is way bigger. It's not hundreds of thousands or millions,
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:42.080]   it's tens of millions to hundreds of millions. And but maybe this should have been the air pro
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:46.320]   or something and not the Mac book pro and it should have had affordances more towards the
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:51.280]   mainstream. Well, you kept a line that was for the traditional market. Well, it is the Mac book
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:56.720]   air pro. They just didn't call it that. And once again, we get to the issue of what is the
[00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:02.000]   purpose of the touch bar? What is there to represent? What does it mean? And I can't, I personally have
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.400]   not been able to come up with an answer to why are you putting this button on the screen above the
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:10.880]   keyboard when you could also you could instead put it on the actual screen itself where it's
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:15.280]   more visible and where I can act on it without having to take my hands off of the key. It's
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:20.880]   again, it doesn't Apple has never made the case to me either through its products or directly when
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:27.920]   I'm asking them rude questions. Like why, why should I put something in the touch bar as a developer
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.480]   instead of on the screen? And as a user, why should I instinctively look for an answer on the
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:36.800]   touch bar instead of instead of keeping my eyes on the screen where it is right now? I just don't
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.600]   think it's again, it's a sticker. It's not a feature right now.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:45.280]   So Renee wrote a great article. I've actually was part of the vector podcast. So listen to his
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.520]   vector podcast, the most divisive Mac book pro ever in which he went through all of this. But I,
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:54.160]   I kind of wanted to do a Ray Priest. And I have to say, I agree with your final conclusion,
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:59.840]   which is merely this is the most divisive Mac book pro ever agree or disagree that it's a great
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:06.640]   device. It's divisive. And yeah, maybe it's for different market. Maybe there's an opportunity
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:12.960]   for Apple, which will certainly ship the reason I didn't buy Marco's favorite, the 15 inch 2015
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.520]   Mac book pro, but says the fact that we turns out we have a bunch of them here.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:26.320]   Is which is so funny. Yeah, is that there's going to be a new Mac book pro this year, right? Or 2018
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:30.080]   this year. I mean, it depends on Intel getting there. I don't know what they're doing now. Coffee
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:35.600]   Lake coffee like yeah. Yeah. And there's some good things about coffee lake, including, you know,
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:41.200]   multi eight cores on the die and four cores on the defer laptop, a quad core. Those things might be
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:48.880]   something Apple would very much want in a pro device. So yeah, so let's take a break and then
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:54.800]   come back. There's lots of tidbits to talk about. There's also cyber Monday deals, which continue.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:01.520]   Apple usually keeps its sales going for a while. We'll talk about those. And I want to talk about
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:07.600]   the iMac pro and maybe the Mac pro because we expect to see the iMac pro sometime next month.
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.760]   And the Mac pro or will it be the middle next year early next year? When we're going? Well,
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:17.440]   let's talk about it in just a second. First, let's talk about what to do with your old phone
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:24.000]   now that you've got an iPhone 10 on the way, right? Right? Right? You got to go to Gazelle. We just
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.560]   sold Lisa gave me. She said, Do you have a drawer full of phones? I said, yeah, she said, you know,
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:38.000]   can we just sell those and move on? I said, yeah, I guess so. I kept my iPhone 8, but everything
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.840]   pre-iPhone 8, I went to Gazelle, the trusted online marketplace, not just for buying your old
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:49.200]   electronics, but for not just for selling your old electronics, but for buying new, well, or
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.480]   slightly used electronics at a very good price. Trade in your old device for cash. It's the
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:59.360]   greatest place to go to kind of help you keep that gadget up to date, get the latest and greatest
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:07.600]   thing. But you can sell your iPhone, your iPad, your MacBook, your Macintosh. You can even sell
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:14.800]   other systems like Samsung Galaxy phones, get fast payment shipping is free. Google Pixel,
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:22.240]   you get in the Pixel 2 XL, sell the old Pixel, getting a Note 8, sell the Galaxy S8. But all the
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:28.080]   great stuff that Gazelle buys is then for sale as a certified pre-owned device. And they have a
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:34.000]   wonderful 30 point inspection where they make sure everything's working. They even check physical
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.880]   things like screens, scratches and so forth. They back it with a 30 day return policy,
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:44.480]   works with all the major US carriers, but there is no carrier contract. And they even offer
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:50.240]   financing through a firm at checkout, which makes it very, very simple to get.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:55.840]   Don't miss out on getting the best value on certified pre-owned devices and selling your
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:04.800]   existing devices for the top dollar at Gazelle.com. G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, Gazelle.com.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:10.000]   It's the greatest way to recycle is to sell it, right? Get some money for it. Gazelle, give
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.760]   new life to use electronics traded for cash or by certified pre-owned at Gazelle.com today. And by
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:20.240]   the way, our experience selling our stuff to them was great. It was really great. What they do is
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:28.320]   they, you say you estimate how worn it is in the situation. So I had a crack in my iPhone 7 plus
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:32.880]   screen. And then they will say, "Nope, we're going to give you more money." Or, "Yeah, you're
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:37.680]   right." Or sometimes, "No, it's worse case than you suggested." But they're very generous. And I have
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:43.600]   to say, many times now, I've got more money than they quoted us initially. So I really like Gazelle.
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:48.080]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com. It's where all my old stuff goes. Maybe you'll get one of my own phones.
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:58.320]   Go to Gazelle.com. So before we talk about what we're going to buy next year, can we talk a little
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:04.400]   bit about the deals? These were Cyber Monday, Black Friday deals, but do they continue on?
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:12.720]   Apple Insider has a list. 13-inch Touch Bar Mac 1999. Loaded that.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.040]   They will see them come and go throughout the holidays.
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:19.760]   Yeah, I think that they, and a lot of times you get, Apple's not known for the best deals ever,
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:26.400]   right? Should you go get gift cards? You got gift cards. Would it be better to go to Walmart or
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:31.760]   Best Buy and try to get a deal? Walmart was offering the iPhone X with a $300 Walmart card.
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:38.480]   Both Best Buy and Walmart both had the AirPods at a discount, which I've never seen before too.
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:41.520]   So I think often resaleurs give you better deals.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:47.200]   Yeah. Just keep your eyes open because sometimes it's because they really want to sign you up.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.120]   They want to get your address and your phone to burn stuff for some sort of a buying club.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:56.320]   I don't know about the Apple deals, but there are other Google deals where we'll give you a crazy
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:03.200]   deal on the Google home where it was basically like the cost of an AOL sign-up CD. It was so cheap.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:07.680]   But only it wasn't a rip-off, but it was basically if you link your account to this,
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:11.280]   which is certainly worth the cost of acquiring a new data for them.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.640]   So just keep your eyes open.
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:19.680]   And then, oh, actually, I'm just getting some breaking news. I'm going to go to the Twitter
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:27.520]   right now. And Lemme Orhan Ergin, who has just tweeted something kind of scary.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:33.600]   This is a security flaw that affects high Sierra, the latest version of Mac OS.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:39.920]   Be assured the bad guy would need physical access. And of course, when somebody has physical
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:43.680]   access to your machine, lots of things, bad things can happen. But this one's a bad one.
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:48.880]   I'm sure Apple will push out a fix very quickly. If you go to users in group in the system preferences,
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:56.640]   you know, it's locked, right? Click the lock to make changes. Use the word root as user name,
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:01.520]   no password. First time might not work. Second or third time it will. You're going to get.
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:05.920]   Yeah. And that's not the worst of it. He's just using that as an example. You can actually log
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:09.360]   in to a locked machine according to him using the same technique.
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:16.480]   So if you come up to a machine that's locked, enter the word root, and then apparently the root
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:25.520]   password is blank. And root, by the way, just so you know, is a super user in Unix operating
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:29.360]   systems. It means you could do things that I'll give you a little. Here's a little tip.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:35.040]   If you do get in as root, go to the terminal and type R and I'm like, I'm glad you'll switch to
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:41.040]   Windows. All right. Well, maybe it's going to keep this Windows machine for things out of the
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:47.440]   bot. RM dash RF star. I just hit return and the entire hard drive will be erased.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:56.160]   And there you go. That feels good. I mean, famously, the original iOS, it was root Alpine for everybody.
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:03.280]   Yeah. This is, first of all, I'll say it again. I'm glad let me found this. I'm glad he tweeted it.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:08.720]   I guess might have been nice to tell Apple before he's clean. That's kind of the rule in the
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:15.120]   security field. But Apple will certainly push out a fix to this fairly quickly. And
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:20.400]   remember, if somebody has physical access to your system, you're screwed in many ways,
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:26.320]   although this is a particularly bad one. Listen, this is about as bad as we were,
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:31.760]   we were all having great fun talking about the calculator bug. Yeah, no, this is kind of bad.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:35.680]   Really super. I'm sure Steve gives and I have some fun with this later in this show.
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:40.000]   I, I didn't try it yet because I'm podcasting, but I, but there's so many people who said that
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.320]   they got it working. Yeah. I think I tried to see Patrick De LaHandy tried it at work.
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:49.760]   We're going to see that's that secret, unannounced feature of the new Apple campus,
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:53.520]   where they can flood the middle of it for like mock, sitting in mock naval battles,
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:57.360]   like the old Coliseum. And we're going to see a bunch of product managers and engineers in
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:02.160]   Gladiator gear as part of their punishment for letting this happen.
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:08.400]   Now granted, we will not you don't, you will not die, but you will be escorted out of the building
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:14.640]   if you lose this mock seat up this, this is bad. This is very, very bad, not good. Because,
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.720]   of course, if you work in an office, you feel very bad about this. Yes. Apple should have
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.800]   it. There should be an email. There's, there should be like some sort of announcement saying that
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:28.160]   we acknowledge this is a, this is pretty horrible. We have put measures into place to ensure that
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:33.600]   this is a problem of this magnitude is unlikely to ever happen again. This is just bad.
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:37.760]   If, if you bet the good news is if you forget your password,
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:41.920]   there you go. Just log in as root with the no password and
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.400]   there was a, an iCloud keychain bug a little while ago too, where it would,
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:50.320]   it would mislabel the files and you could get the, it would mislabel the fields and it would
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:53.360]   give you the wrong, it would just show the password. There seems like there's something
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:56.960]   went really goofy around the I see era security at some point.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:02.240]   Wow. High Sierra has been, I have to say iOS 11 and I see era both have had
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:06.240]   non, non trivial number of bugs and problems.
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:13.120]   More than, is it more than before more than you know, I think iOS 11, it's, it's, it's mostly
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:17.760]   again current pain, but I see era when you add in the window manager and some of the security
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:21.600]   stuff. And when you factor in that it was supposed to be a stability release, you know,
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.960]   that was a big marketing thing that they were, they were going to correct a lot of the problems.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:29.200]   I think that's when it becomes problematic. iOS 11, I think, you know, there's bugs every
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:34.160]   version of iOS. I'm never happy with them, but high Sierra seems to, seems to have quite a bit
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:38.960]   more issues than Sierra did. By the way, after you log in, maybe the first thing you want to do
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:44.160]   is launch keychain access. Again, it works on keychain access and you can see in, in the clear,
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:49.760]   all the passwords stored in the apple keychain. You might want to write those down for future use.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:55.040]   But hey, have you, have you seen how thin our new, our new MacBook is? Look how thin that is.
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:01.840]   You might want to take with you when you leave the office, take the power supply. I don't know,
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:06.240]   what could you take with you? There's take it all. Don't leave your computer at the office.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:11.520]   It turns out that the place where the puck is going to be has no security. So before you,
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:16.880]   before you jump those case, this is really bad. I'm sorry. This is really super bad.
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:21.440]   It is. It's taking fun of Apple for this because this is super bad. Well, the only way it would
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:28.400]   be worse is if you could log in over the internet. Now, okay, here's a workaround. Somebody suggested,
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:36.880]   and I think this might work before you leave work, go into the terminal on your, on your Macintosh.
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:44.720]   Log in is root, which is the command is sudo sudo, S-U-D-O space, S-U. You would go and log in as a super
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:52.640]   user. You will obviously use a blank password to do so. And then create a password, use the word
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:59.120]   P-A-S-S-W-D. And it will ask you for a new password. You can use blank as the old password
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.000]   and create a new password. Let's see if that works. Patrick, will you try that? Patrick, don't you?
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.680]   I wonder if it's a terminal bug that was just in the GUI because otherwise you'd still need
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:14.080]   the root password. Well, let's see. Let's see if that works. Could you also do a firmware
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:18.640]   password? I don't know if that would help with this. Yes, well, that might be another solution.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:25.200]   If you have to go home from work today is to turn on a firmware password. Here's a,
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:32.000]   here's a, here's a GIF of it working in German. Oh, there he goes. Nice. Let's start over. So,
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.040]   the first time it rejects the blank password, which makes me think maybe it isn't a blank password.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:45.440]   So, he types root as the bonazer name and bonazer nama and then blank and that works.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:51.200]   And now he's got full admin access to the, that's terrible. That is, you write in, it's as bad as
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.520]   it can get. The only thing worse would be if it worked over the internet. So, that's the breaking
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:01.760]   news and we will look for a response before the show's over. We got a half an hour. Maybe Apple
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:07.280]   will have a, can you keep your IP yield, Patrick and others, chat room and see if Apple,
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:12.880]   ah, doesn't want to give him root in terminal with a blank password.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:17.840]   Hey, would you bring me my Mac book so I can just play with a little bit. It could be a go,
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:22.960]   it could be a gooey, gooey flaw, which is bad because if you could just change the root password
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:34.880]   that would fix it. So, we're going to buy it, maybe not now, and I'm a Mac Pro. And I'm just
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:40.320]   going to get a lock in my office. Um, $5,000, you'll get one Renee, right?
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:46.240]   You know, I so badly don't want to spend the money. I don't either. I look at it and my
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:50.160]   internal rationalization engine, which humans are so great at, just starts pulling up. But
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:54.640]   it's space gray is like the most superficial of those reasons. Oh yeah, there you go.
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:59.760]   Well, because it's space gray, but I mean, it's the first gen and then next year I'll want
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:05.360]   iMac Pro 2. And I mean, it just it never ends Leo. Yeah, never ends. So let me,
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:12.960]   let me see if I can, uh, log in is how do you get, how do you get a, uh, I have to have to get a blank
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.840]   thing on the log and switch user.
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:26.640]   Hmm. Okay, now I'm logged in as myself. Actually, let me, while I'm doing that,
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:30.400]   let me just see what I could do in the terminal. So, uh, all right. So everybody,
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:35.920]   I think everybody's now distracted trying to get the, uh, get the Apple response to this,
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:42.800]   um, or a workaround. But good news for people wanting an iPhone 10, the shipping updates,
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:49.360]   shipping estimates are now being shortened as, uh, uh, the Fox con factory, uh, ramps up.
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:54.880]   They can now do according to, uh, Ming Chi quote, KGI securities, they can now do half a million
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:00.880]   iPhone 10s a day, which according to my careful calculations is about 15 million a month.
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:06.320]   That should, uh, while that probably wouldn't fill 100% of the pipeline. It's a pretty good chunk
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:11.520]   of it. Right. Apple sold what, uh, 75 million phones last quarter.
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:18.240]   Everybody's busy. I'll fill it. I'll fill while you're all checking.
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:26.640]   I'll fill. It's all right. I was just, I was just here pouring out a 40 for the, to the memory of
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:33.440]   back security, a little bit in cover. Oh God. This is bad. Let me just change to root here.
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:39.760]   This is live radio people live radio. I am now in his room and I'm going to do P a SSWD
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:46.880]   flash from Dallas. Apparently official. Apple's recommend Apple reputation as a maker of fine
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:53.120]   while working die today at Parkland hospital at three minutes past three PM. I have assigned,
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:58.480]   I have assigned, I was able to assign a password to the root account. So now I need to exit out
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:04.480]   and see if that might fix it. That might be good news. So I was able to do the process I described.
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:12.800]   Let's restart here. Some people are saying enabling root and setting a password mitigates this.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:17.200]   Yeah. Well, that's, that's basically what I've done is a, if I don't know if I'd enabled root
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:22.000]   before, but I was, but I, pseudo does work. Su do works on my machine. So I was able to
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:28.080]   su do, I pronounce it pseudo, but I know people get mad at me. So do to my machine.
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:33.520]   You do the pseudo that voodoo that you want. I like pseudo. I like pseudo. Do it. Yeah,
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:39.200]   pseudo. I don't want to say that's doppy. Language is, language is evolving. We don't talk like
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:44.240]   the clean Victoria. Just get over it. There is, by the way, a new beta four for developers. So it
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:51.040]   might be beta four fixes it. So coffee house max says, holy crap, I just use root without a
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:59.120]   password to get in. So you have to be an administrative account. I was an administrative account. I did
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:05.600]   su do that is that's switched to a different to switch to root user. And when if you do su do
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:10.720]   and you have pseudo permissions, you can do su do su, which means switch to root, you'll get that
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:16.400]   weird root pound sign for your password in your terminal. That means you are root. And then I
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:20.960]   type P a s s w d, which assigns a new password, it does not ask you for the old password,
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:26.960]   which tells me there isn't a password. Right? What I think I think I have to remember how password
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:32.320]   works. But my memory is if you have an asset assigned password to root, it will say, well,
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:38.240]   what's your old password? First, maybe not because I am root. And but I was it said new password,
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:49.120]   I was able to type a new password in. We'll see. We'll see. Very and don't forget your root password.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:59.840]   Yeah, I'm sorry. I was distracted. I don't. Yeah. And this is yeah, I felt I felt the need to
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:06.560]   tweet out to my followers that yeah, be aware of this problem. If you. Okay.
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:10.720]   This is bad. Did I say this was bad? This is bad. This is bad.
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:18.560]   Hey, I still see the the iOS auto correct bug a lot, and especially with celebrities.
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:25.360]   You see it, Leo? Now there's a new one. There's a new one. So Lady Gaga, just the other day,
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:31.600]   tweeted instead of the letter I capital I, she got a question mark. Well, there's a now a new one that
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:41.280]   turns it into it short for information technology. This is probably the same. You you explained the
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:48.160]   mechanism, Renee, which I thought was quite interesting. Yeah, it's machine learning gone rogue.
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:52.560]   The idea behind the new QuickType keyboard was that if let's say Leo and Andy and I decided that
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:57.360]   we're going to make sway, the new popular Batman Beyond derived cool word, and we all start using
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:00.880]   it and other people start using it. You don't want to mark that as a spelling mistake and maybe
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:04.960]   you want to start offering that as a suggestion. So you learn from all these people typing it and
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:10.080]   you improve you, you create like this cloud based system that then shares it. It sort of propagates
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:15.200]   through the QuickType keyboard ecosystem. So the next time Alex Lindsey types is going to type,
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:20.320]   this is really it'll offer sway as like one of his choices. But when you get something wrong,
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:25.680]   like that Bitmoji break character or this I dot T, it starts propagating and it's like,
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:30.320]   oh, everyone typing it really means it. We'll just offer that as a helpful correction.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:36.880]   And it's just it's there needs to be something in there like a an ML sanity check maybe that
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:41.840]   says, no, no, not this one. This one's bad. Revert it. Otherwise, Stephen Colbert is going to come
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.480]   up with something hilarious to do with this. And I just don't want that.
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:53.920]   All my followers replace hi with the poop emoji. The fix is to go does it work? Now,
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:58.080]   I on this article, I see that sometimes it works as does to go in auto correct.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:02.560]   And what do you do? You enter something for options. You can you have two options. Yeah,
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:08.320]   you can go into text replacement, which is settings, general keyboard, text replacement,
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:13.200]   and then just type in the regular word it so that it replaces it. Or you could some people are
[01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:18.400]   just resetting the auto correct dictionary. And again, some people are saying it works and people
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:23.360]   don't I've had luck doing the text replacement version. I've also had luck just being hilarious
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:34.560]   on Twitter. So yeah, well, good on you. Where I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. I still see
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:39.280]   that a question mark. So that but like I said, it tends to be with famous people who obviously
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:46.080]   on update, aren't updating and because they're an Apple, I guess, will push 1113, right? Or is it
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:51.760]   four? Where are we now 1112, right? So we get 1113. You don't know because you're on
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:56.640]   you're on the beta. All the beta. Yeah, but I mean, the beta the last time the beta got
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:00.880]   I don't know. Do we call this machine learned poisoning? Maybe Steve Gibson love a name for it.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:05.920]   ML poisoning, but it infiltrated the beta eventually to it's really interesting. I mean,
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:09.840]   on the one hand, you do want that. I don't know how you fix this. I mean, you
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:17.040]   I think I think kind of collaborative auto corrections an interesting idea, but it clearly
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:25.040]   raises issues. Apple says we're not done spending very famously earlier this year. They announced
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:31.920]   they were going to spend $1 billion on original content for Apple music to which Netflix said,
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:39.200]   we're going to spend $8 billion. Now, according to Loop Ventures analyst Gene Munster, oh, Gene Munster's
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:46.960]   back in variety, he says, Apple is going to spend by the year 2022, $4.2 billion.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:50.880]   It's just something about Apple and television that Gene Munster finds so compelling.
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:54.240]   Yeah, he's the guy who kept saying Apple's going to do a TV, honest.
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:22:01.440]   I think anybody I predict by the year 2024, Apple will spend a trillion dollars on original content.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:09.760]   Anybody can say that. What does it mean? Well, they kind of sort of did because they made
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:15.680]   final cut and final cut and made three movies on it. If you haven't ordered your 4K Apple TV,
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:21.520]   64 gigabyte version, you're probably going to miss Christmas delivery. It's only 100 bucks more
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:27.760]   for the doubling the RAM as storage rather. So might as well do it, right? I got the 64. Who knows,
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:32.080]   you know, what if I'll ever use all of that storage? If you put a lot of apps on there, maybe.
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:35.840]   Yeah, I still can't get too excited about the Apple 3D.
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:39.600]   That's pretty good. You know, if you have a 4K TV, it really looks good. I'm really happy with
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:45.280]   how it looks. And the ATR is so good. Yeah, I don't know. It shares really good. But I mean,
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:50.640]   as opposed to getting value for money and I would at least look at the Roku instead. I certainly
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:55.920]   wouldn't look at it. The Android TVs are nice too, but not as big an advantage if you're running
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:00.800]   Apple. Only reason that you would want an Apple TV is if you buy stuff on the iTunes store.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:07.600]   iTunes store and Apple music and a lot of people do use like their big living room TV as sort of
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:11.680]   an extension to their phone screen or their Mac screen. So that's nice too. Yeah, AirPlay.
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:15.760]   But Apple really came out the gate with a lot of HD content. Like Netflix has seriously ramped
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:21.040]   it up. Amazon is okay, but Apple just had so many of my movies were automatically updated to 4K
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:26.160]   HDR. And I could watch them right away that if you were an early adopter, you got a huge benefit
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:29.440]   of just having that iTunes stuff available, even just a rent if you really wanted to.
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:34.560]   Renee, I bet you want to file on this Mac flaw. So I'm going to take a break.
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:39.360]   So you can write one of your famous 10,000 words in one minute article.
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:44.800]   And but no, I'm sure you want to file on this. And Andy's already tweeted. I've already
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:47.600]   tweeted. So you're behind. You got to get. I tweeted. No, I did tweet.
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:52.880]   Everybody's tweeting to their followers. God dang it. Don't leave your Mac alone.
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:59.120]   And then unfortunately, I rebooted but to see if my fix worked, but now it's updating.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:06.160]   So I'll because it got the new beta on the developers, but I will let you know if that if that fix
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:13.200]   worked. Has anybody in the chatroom tried that the the S-U-D-O space S-U
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:20.560]   trick to switch over to root user and then assign a password to root user. Does that fix the problem?
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:25.120]   If that does, then that means that there is like a root that somehow a root user account was
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:30.640]   created on them because correct me if I'm wrong, I don't think Apple doesn't use the root account
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:35.360]   at all. Does it or is there always a root account on there is on on Unix machines? Is there always
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:42.400]   a root account? There must. I mean, I believe it has to fail. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it could be
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:48.640]   that they shipped out an update, maybe even the high the original high Sierra with a root account
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:52.320]   that had a blank password. That would be a very easy mistake to make. Not a good one.
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:57.120]   And then some people just discovered it or it could be some other issue. And as you say,
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:01.520]   it could be a GUI issue as opposed to an actual lack of root password. I
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:05.120]   were busy testing all the things. Yeah. I'm I assigned a password to the root account.
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:08.960]   And as soon as this is done rebooting, which is going to be a little while.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:17.680]   Let's take a break. Let everybody everybody can test. I shall continue on. I shall soldier on.
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:21.520]   Well, everybody scrambles. Well, you run through your rumbles. I'm not
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:30.960]   a little bit of a problem. I'm going to take this back home with me today.
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:38.080]   Wow. It locks with the administrators account password by default. Yeah. That doesn't solve
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.400]   the problem. The problem is if you switch users to the root user, you can unlock it.
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:51.120]   Wow. Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage quick and loans. Best lender in the country.
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.400]   Fabulous folks out of Detroit. Just really,
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:26:01.680]   techie smart, sophisticated. And by the way, beloved by their customers, number one,
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:07.600]   according to JD power and customer satisfaction as primary mortgage originators and for mortgage
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:14.640]   servicing every year. You know, I noticed they just added a 2017. We just got the 2017 award.
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:20.400]   So that's eight consecutive years since 2010, number one in customer satisfaction. Thank you,
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:25.520]   JD power. So I don't have to even say it. It's, it's a given. They're great.
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:30.720]   But I like them even more because they also have a product for us geeks. See, some people,
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:37.280]   maybe even you like when you're getting a home loan or refinancing, like going to meet the lender,
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:42.480]   go to the bank, like to put on a suit and tie and say, or, you know, a nice dress and say,
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:49.840]   I need money and, and love it when the guy pulls out a mortgage calculator. It's so fun to watch
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:55.280]   him go through all those, you know, the papers with all the mortgage products and do the calculators.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:59.600]   Say, well, it looks like your payment would be this if you took this one. How, oh, you want a
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:03.760]   different down payment? Well, then it would be this. I went through that a couple of years ago.
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:08.800]   That doesn't end the process. May I point out that once you've settled on loan going through
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:12.800]   those sheaf of papers, you don't even know if you got the best one, just whatever was there.
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:21.200]   Then he says, okay, nice to see you sign here. And now go home and send me your bank statements,
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:27.440]   your pay stubs, your proof of ownership, your all sorts of stuff. You're up in the attic,
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:31.040]   you're calling banks, you're getting all sorts of stuff. You're faxing it to them. Yes, faxing.
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:35.760]   You have a fax machine at home. Oh, well, then you're going down to the office depot and faxing
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:41.280]   it or I mean, it's crazy. Four years ago when we bought our house, it took a month. We thought,
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:46.960]   well, it'll be done. We're going on vacation in a month. We were on vacation. We had to call Lisa's
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:52.320]   sister Debbie and say, could you fax them this? Could you send them that got to the point? It
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:56.000]   took so long. And this is from the number one lender in the country, by the way, the one
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.680]   everybody knows the big bank. It took them so we almost lost the house. The seller said, guys,
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:10.000]   are you going to buy this or what? Rocket mortgage. Come, this is welcome to the 21st century. First
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:17.360]   of all, you could do it at the open house. You don't have to go see the banker. You go, you just go
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:22.480]   to rocketmortgage.com/macbreak. You answer a few questions. They have trusted partnerships with
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:26.240]   all the financial institutions. So you don't have to find your pay stubs or your bank statements.
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:30.960]   You just say, yeah, that's me. I give you permission. Access my financial information.
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:34.480]   But boom, they crunch it. They've got all the different loans in there.
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:38.480]   You tell them it's completely transparent. You say, this is what I want for a down payment. This
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.640]   is the term I want. This is the rate I want based on your income, your assets and credits.
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:47.200]   Within minutes, they're going to analyze every option available. Find the run that's right for
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:52.720]   you and say, is this the loan you want? You say, yes. And bada bing, bada boom. You're approved.
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:57.920]   Just like that. Within minutes, you could still be at the open house and show the realtor. Yeah,
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:03.680]   we have the loan. So we'd like to make an offer. Rocket mortgage from quick and loans. This is power.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:09.280]   This is modern. Apply simply. Understand fully. And then mortgage confidently.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:14.800]   Equal housing, lender, licensed, and all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org, number 30, 30.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:19.920]   Thank you, quick and loans for bringing this mortgage approval process into the 21st century.
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:25.280]   No paper. Just your phone, your tablet, your computer and rocketmortgage.com/macbreak. Rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:34.080]   We thank them so much for their support of Mac Break Weekly. This is a product for all of us geeks.
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:42.800]   Okay, guys, the results of your research. They're typing. I mean, right now it's in it's
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:45.840]   in turbulence when people are saying if you set the root password, it works. And people are saying,
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:49.760]   no, it doesn't. They're saying, yes, it absolutely does. No, it doesn't. Firmware does. No, it doesn't.
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:55.680]   Well, I would certainly try that. Yes. That would be the first thing to do is to put it,
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:59.600]   probably putting it in concrete and just pouring over it. Let's keep it secure. Also,
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:02.640]   unless they have a jackhammer. Yeah. Also, that's a good thing to do.
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:07.440]   I mean, there are all sorts of weird little things in high Sierra, but this is not a weird
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:10.800]   little thing. And by the way, I'm sure Steve Gibson, who watches this show,
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:18.000]   and he has an hour before security now begins. No pressure, Steve. No pressure, Steve, but we need
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:25.120]   a fix. I'm going to all the Apple sites. Nothing. Nobody knows anything yet.
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:30.000]   In fact, I don't even-- Literally a zero day. It's just happened.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.400]   And I'm glad it happened during Macbreak Weekly, so we could, at least the people who watch live,
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:40.480]   can get warned. And if you're just listening now, maybe there's a fix by now.
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:44.320]   If you are listening and you discover a problem like this, please go to Apple first.
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:48.720]   They have a bug bounty program. They will give you actual cash money to tell them before you tell
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:53.040]   Twitter. Yeah. I'm a little-- I'm sorry that the lemme, the guy who-- Well, I'm not sorry.
[01:30:53.040 --> 01:31:00.400]   I'm glad he revealed it. Because frankly, it's okay. So let me see. So, I'm going to switch user,
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:06.480]   right? And I should be able to get a blank. I want a blank. You see, I guess this is part of it.
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:12.480]   It depends how you set up your login, right? How can I get a login to a blank? Oh, here's other.
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:18.480]   Maybe if I do other. Oh, yeah. Let's try it. Uh-oh. Root, blank.
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:24.720]   It's-- No, it didn't like it this time. Let's try again. One more time.
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:30.240]   Nope. I think setting a root password might be the fix.
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:33.760]   Let me try-- I think you set a root password and then you disable root is what they're saying now.
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:38.000]   Well, let me-- but I'm not getting into the blank password. Let me try the root password I entered.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.400]   God, I hope I remember it. Although some people have to enter, like, the blank over and over and
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:47.120]   over again. Yeah, I did it three, four times. And now logging in with the password I assigned.
[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:55.520]   So, at least on this-- now this is the developer, the latest developer beta. I just updated.
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:32:01.600]   Yeah, it's now doing setting up your Mac. So, I wasn't able to get in with a blank,
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:05.840]   root blank. Tried four times. Maybe you have to try five times. I don't know.
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:10.640]   But as soon as I entered the root password I had assigned in terminal, it worked.
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:17.200]   So, that my sense, at least from this, I could log out again. Maybe I'll log out again.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:20.960]   So, you think it's using the root password as the login password?
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:25.280]   Well-- And that if the-- if root is blank it will accept a blank password.
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:30.560]   Exactly. So, my guess here is that the root password is blank on this machine. And then as
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:36.880]   soon as I logged in as root, I issued to root and gave it a password, it fixed it. But let's try
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:43.360]   again. I'll do it again. Root and blank. Root and blank. How many times do I have to hit it?
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:51.760]   Uh-oh. Spinning. Nope. One. Two. Still not doing it. Three.
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:33:00.000]   Four. I-- you know what? I keep hitting root blank and it's not working. So, look, at least try this.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:06.080]   Go to your terminal. Don't be afraid of the terminal. It's the best thing the Apple Mac OS
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:12.160]   offers. Just don't say pseudo wrong. Get the terminal. Get to your terminal. I think
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:18.320]   SUDO is enabled on all Mac attaches. I don't think I turned it on. So, what is pseudo is is to
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:24.800]   switch users to a different user. And to do that, you need to be a in the pseudo-er's
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:30.320]   file as-- we're permission to do that. I think Apple does set it up that way. And then you would
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:35.920]   give your-- normally, you would give your password and you would be switched to a root account which
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:40.160]   you could then do root things. But what you want to do here is give your password your
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:43.840]   normal login password. You have to be an administrator. This won't work if you're not a
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:48.960]   administrator. So, log in to your administrator account. Go to the terminal. Type SUDO. That's
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:56.160]   pseudo space SU. Which means the command you're going to execute as root is SU, which is to switch
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:03.740]   to root. So, sudo, s-u, enter your password, your administrator password, and then you're
[01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:10.180]   going to get dropped into a new looking prompt, it will be a hash sign, a pound sign, which
[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:13.620]   is the root account. Now you are in the root account, and the only thing you need to do
[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:21.400]   here, in fact, the only thing you should do probably, is pass would, p-a-s-s-w-d. P-a-s-w-d,
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:26.260]   which is the password change command. And on my machine anyway, it didn't ask me for the
[01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:29.300]   existing root password, which I think is the normal case of this.
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:32.740]   Yeah, so Twitter is saying that root is supposed to be disabled by default. It's there, but
[01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:36.140]   it's supposed to be disabled by default on macOS, and for some reason it isn't on the
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:38.140]   phone high-sare. It's enabled by the blank password.
[01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:41.860]   Yeah. Okay. So now you're not disabled. That is the error.
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:46.760]   Probably the best thing to do would be to get rid of the root or disable the root user.
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:50.060]   So you have, I believe you have to set the root password and then disable it. You can't
[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:53.080]   just leave it blank. You have to set it and then disable it.
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:54.080]   So as you space...
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:56.020]   What's your D?
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:57.020]   I'm making a sausage here.
[01:34:57.020 --> 01:35:03.080]   Let me say it again. I want everybody to do this. S-u-d-o, space-s-u. Hit return. You're
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:07.880]   going to get a pound sign. P-a-s-s-w-d, hit return again. You're going to get asked for
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:13.640]   a new password. It doesn't have to be complicated, but make sure you remember it, and it'll
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:17.760]   ask you to repeat it. If it matches, you've now changed the password. That seems to mitigate
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:22.420]   this problem. I have not been able to log in with a blank password. But then you might
[01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:27.080]   want to go further. I would actually, I would just do that much and then see what Apple
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:34.060]   does. Yeah. There is a utility app. You can do this if you like a GUI. Don't. This is
[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:35.940]   fast and easy. What's wrong with doing?
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:39.980]   I think there's a one in seven chance that the first official like response back from
[01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:44.620]   Apple when Gizmodo or whoever asks the question saying, this just points out how useful Touch
[01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:49.380]   ID is on the new MacBook Pro without compromising logins.
[01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:58.540]   Yeah, but even if you have Touch ID, you could still go through it. That is not good. I'm
[01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:05.300]   glad we have a mitigation that at least worked on this MacBook. The one thing I would say
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:10.260]   is this isn't running the current version of High Sierra. It's running the current
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:15.140]   version. Public not developers. Sorry, public beta version. So it could be that there's
[01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:20.500]   a fix that that makes this work. Wow. Well, you know what? I'm glad this happened during
[01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:26.060]   the show. Yeah. I'm also going to say this last week because everyone at Apple's their
[01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:30.100]   entire Thanksgiving vacation. Oh, would have been ruined. Yeah. Wow.
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:35.180]   Well, I'm less concerned about their Thanksgiving, frankly. But I'll still. Yeah, no, I get it.
[01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:38.820]   I mean, this should have happened like a couple of months ago. But like for me, and I say
[01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:42.380]   this for every company, their mistakes will happen. They should never happen. It's horrifying
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:46.260]   that they do happen. But mistakes will always happen. So it depends on how they react to
[01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:50.740]   them. If the company is not installing their own root kits or or doing their man in middle
[01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:54.740]   attacks on their own users, that's one thing that's deliberately being malicious. But if
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:59.300]   there is a bug or an error or a problem, it is how they react to it, how fast and how
[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:03.980]   you know, responsibly they react to it that I completely agree. Although this is such
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:08.780]   a bad bug. This is so terrible. Yeah. It's it's it's also another data point for people
[01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:13.340]   who wish to argue that Apple's taking keep taking their eyes off the ball on the on the
[01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:18.140]   little things that contribute to the big things. This will not help people answer that argument.
[01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:21.900]   This I mean, they have a whole security team whose job it is just to not let stuff like
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:26.060]   this happen like beyond the Apple's increasingly moving to core OS where a lot of the things
[01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:34.700]   are shared between iOS and Mac OS. And this should never happen. But at least we're together,
[01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:38.740]   Leo and he but everyone who works at Apple who's listening to this. Yes, we've been
[01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:42.580]   having fun at your expense. Yes, we've been even saying mean things. We know that this
[01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:47.580]   is like a gut shot to you. We know this. We've got seriously, we know we know you didn't
[01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:52.500]   intend for this to happen. And so for everything you're about to do to fix this, we thank you.
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:57.180]   And we know that we have been in positions where we have screwed things up mightily and
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:38:03.180]   realize that all we have left for us to do is to turn off the water flow to the toilet,
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:07.780]   get out the mop of the bucket of the Lysol. It's going to be three days of hard scrubbing.
[01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:11.580]   And we feel for you. We're still going to have we're still going to make fun of this,
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:20.020]   but we feel for you. I'm just taping a tweet real quickly. Exactly. Well, I do this. Andy
[01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:23.940]   and I go to you have a pick of the week. Yes, actually, I have a tip more of a tip of the
[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:29.140]   week. And it does involve the terminal once again. We're all familiar with an annoying
[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:33.060]   part of the finder where let's say you've got a bad block in your SSD or something,
[01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:38.060]   you try to like copy an entire folder full of stuff. And if like one file is compromised
[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:42.180]   of the 1000, it won't just skip over that one file will say, Oh, I'm sorry, one of
[01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:45.860]   these 1000 files has a bet. You know, I can't copy this. So therefore, I'm terminating
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:53.020]   the entire copy operation. And I had that happen to me because I was for reasons. And
[01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:58.900]   the way around it is to you go into the terminal and use the r sync command. That's r, s, y
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:05.780]   n c command. That will let you basically you just there better instructions on the web
[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:11.140]   than I can give you that can give you through the magic of voice r sync, then go into the
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:16.700]   finder, drag the folder that you want to copy into the terminal, it'll copy the entire path
[01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:22.220]   to that file. Make sure that it ends with a a slash and a star that would mean everything
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:26.660]   that's inside this folder, then a space and then drag in the destination folder. And then
[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:31.300]   once again, make sure it ends with the with the space, excuse me, ends with a slash. What
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:35.540]   our sync does is our sync will copy the entire contents of that folder, or that directory
[01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:40.940]   or that entire volume. And it will do it much more slowly than the finder will do. But the
[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:46.340]   wonderful thing is if it encounters a problem copying a file, it will skip over that file,
[01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:50.660]   get through the rest of them, and then try to reach try once again to copy any files that
[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:55.260]   it couldn't do. And then if it doesn't simply say, okay, here's the here's the 18 18 files
[01:39:55.260 --> 01:40:00.100]   that didn't work properly. So you might not be able to get back the 18 files that were
[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:04.620]   on bad blocks, but you will still be able to copy everything else. So for instance, with
[01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:11.540]   an SSD, sometimes block route happens. And the way to fix it is you just erase the you
[01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:16.820]   just reformat the volume, and it will format around the bad blocks. And then you can restore
[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:21.740]   it from everything else. So if you if you do need to do an evacuation like that, our
[01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:26.540]   sync is the way that will help you out. Once again, make sure that you do do a Google
[01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:30.420]   search for our sync to look for a couple of guides will show you how to do this. It really
[01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:36.100]   is no more complicated than what I explained to you. But like many like many terminal commands,
[01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:41.060]   if you misspell something or if you miss remember something, it can cause really horrible things
[01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:44.700]   to happen. As matter of fact, I just I'm just remembering that forgot to tell you to use
[01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:50.420]   the do is the hyphen AV switches that tell it to keep all the file permissions that were
[01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:54.940]   there originally. And also go recursively through any sub folders. Like I said, if you
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:58.580]   go through a web search, you'll be able to actually cut and paste these commands. It
[01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:01.820]   will be a lot safer. So it's a good thing to have in your hip pocket whenever you run
[01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:07.940]   run into these problems. We've we've learned a lot today, SU password and our sync. Today
[01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:14.420]   is episode brought to you by the letters. Su our sync is a fabulous tool because it only
[01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:20.020]   updates the changes. So it's very network. Right. Savvy, which is really good. If they're like,
[01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:24.220]   I should that gives me a deal for doing a column just basically here are six units commands
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:29.580]   that you keep in your hip pocket. Our sync is one of the line at Unix commands that it
[01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:34.420]   doesn't just doesn't just do copies. It can also do things like it can be like your backup
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:39.140]   utility, because like you say, it will just keep these two directories in sync. It will
[01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:44.780]   just update changes. And oftentimes you find that you can use it for just being your regular
[01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:48.300]   network backup. You have a network volume, for instance, in addition to time machine
[01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:52.140]   and a difference in addition to super duper, maybe there's a directory that's really, really
[01:41:52.140 --> 01:41:58.660]   super 12 times super important set up in our sync, our sync so that will automatically
[01:41:58.660 --> 01:42:03.500]   keep those folders in sync across the network over every day or several times a day. Like
[01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:07.380]   I said, just keep looking look for more information on our sync. It will be it's the difference
[01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:12.300]   between being the guy in your or the woman in your family who knows a lot about Max to
[01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:17.500]   the guy or the woman. Oh my God, she's a wizard problem that even the guys at the Apple store
[01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:21.740]   didn't know how to fix it, but she fixed it. It's one of the reasons I love the Macintosh
[01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:26.260]   and I miss it is that that command line interface that terminal I use I term instead of the
[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:27.260]   Mac terminals.
[01:42:27.260 --> 01:42:30.900]   You have Unix at your fingertips. One of the very first things that Apple engineer told
[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:36.020]   me about a Mac OS 10 before it was released was that we feel as though if the Unix is
[01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:40.140]   there and if you don't look for the Unix and you find it, we will have failed. But if
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:43.260]   you look for the Unix and don't find it, we will also have failed. And that's why the
[01:42:43.260 --> 01:42:45.980]   terminal is such a really great part of the experience.
[01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:52.300]   I should mention that a lot of these command line utilities on the Macintosh have GUI
[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:56.860]   front ends for hand break, for instance, is a front end FFmpeg, which is a very useful
[01:42:56.860 --> 01:43:01.500]   command line utility. There are a number of tools that give you GUI front ends to our
[01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:06.380]   sync. Chrono Sync is the one for me con technologies that I use. Somebody mentioned carbon copy
[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:10.940]   cloner. I'm not sure if that uses our sync, but I wouldn't be surprised because our sync
[01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:14.620]   is such a great tool. So if you're if you're a little put off by the idea of going to the
[01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:19.300]   terminal and then it commands, take a look at Chrono Sync, which is by itself a little
[01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:22.500]   challenging. It's you know, it's a kind of a heavy duty tool or something a little easier
[01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:26.740]   like carbon copy cloner, which will do many of the same things that our sync will do using
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:32.060]   our sync. And now my friends, I give you, you can always type man our sync, just read the
[01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:39.700]   manual pages and you should be fine. Now it's time for Renee Richie's pick of the week.
[01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:43.260]   So mine comes courtesy of Serenity Caldwell, because this time of year, like I said at
[01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:47.940]   the beginning of the show, it goes down to freezing. Like it was, I forget what the Fahrenheit
[01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:52.460]   was. It was minus six minus 10, most of the week, which is below 30 Fahrenheit. And it
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:58.100]   was just so cold. And we have touchscreen phones. And usually you have to have your fingers
[01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:02.420]   or capacitive gloves. But one of the other things that you can do, and what's popular
[01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:06.500]   with some people, because sometimes they find the capacitive gloves to be fidgety, is just
[01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:10.900]   to bring a stylus with you. And yes, you know, if you saw a stylus, you blew it whatever.
[01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:15.620]   And there are one more thing to carry and lose. But when it is freezing and frigid outside,
[01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:20.260]   and you just you don't have capacitive gloves, or you want to wear mittens or whatever, having
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:23.540]   a stylus is a really convenient way of still using your phone while you're waiting at
[01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:28.260]   a bus stop or a train stop. Or, you know, for an appointment, anytime you have to be
[01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:32.300]   outside, which bless you if you have to be outside. But if you do, and she recommended
[01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:36.860]   the Jot Mark, I just asked her what she thought the best stylus for using in winter would
[01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:39.980]   be. And you don't want anything that's too fenicity or too, like you're not looking
[01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:44.140]   for pinpoint technical drawing accuracy here. All you're looking for is something that will
[01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:48.980]   push the damn button when your hands are frozen. And this does a great job of that. It's easy
[01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:54.420]   to hold even with gloves. It's got a big fat tip at the end of it. So it's easy to just
[01:44:54.420 --> 01:45:00.780]   jab at the screen. So whether you are again, like you're checking Twitter, you know, while
[01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:05.700]   you're at the bus top, or you're out doing a bless you a ho ho Pokemon go raid, because
[01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:09.940]   that just launched in the middle of no at the end of November for no particular reason.
[01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:14.060]   And you just you need to keep your gloves on while you're using your your iPhone, your
[01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:21.780]   Android phone, your tablet, anything. Why are you using it outside? We have to go outside.
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:28.180]   I mean, I like you say inside if it's below zero. We try to avoid it, but we I mean, because
[01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:32.580]   Canadian, because it doesn't matter how old you are, sometimes it's so cold, you just
[01:45:32.580 --> 01:45:37.660]   want your mom to come pick you up from hockey practice. I don't want to walk. It'll get
[01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:42.900]   to minus 40 like once or twice a year and then you go outside in your face hurts. And
[01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:47.060]   that that I understand you can if you can possibly help, I don't go outside, but you
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:49.820]   we just couldn't function if we didn't go outside when it hit zero. You just have to
[01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:54.340]   do it. So this is a way if you again, capacitive gloves are great. I think I have North face
[01:45:54.340 --> 01:45:58.580]   ones. They're terrific. But if for some reason they don't work for you, or you find that
[01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:02.980]   the capacitive tips were off or fall off or whatever, a stylus is another option for you
[01:46:02.980 --> 01:46:04.540]   to try.
[01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:09.780]   My pick of the week comes from 1988. It is the Apple extended keyboard with fully
[01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:15.740]   depressable buttons and they in the complete function key row. I would open it up and show
[01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:19.100]   you, but that would completely depreciate the value on the market.
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:26.380]   Is it mint in the box? Is it mint in the box? It's mint in the box? New old stock 1988.
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:31.100]   It's new old. It's new to you. John Grupper is salivating right now. Oh, look, of course,
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:35.740]   you know who it is. It has all this. Alex Gumpel, who is up like the number one Windows user
[01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:42.460]   in the studio, our studio Flowmaster. But for some reason he collects antique Apple gear.
[01:46:42.460 --> 01:46:48.340]   This one's so old that the plastic is yellowed everywhere except where there was apparently
[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:53.140]   a template over the function keys. You need the proxy treatment. There you go. There
[01:46:53.140 --> 01:47:00.260]   is there is a chemical you could put on this to on yellow. Oh, look at that. That's what
[01:47:00.260 --> 01:47:08.660]   typing used to sound like. Go go go go slower. Close to the microphone and slower. There you
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:18.060]   go. There you go. Alex, thank you for bringing out the goods here. This is beautiful. You
[01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:23.020]   know what? I would use this if I had this. This is kind of comparable to the old IBM
[01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:29.340]   keyboard or the North Star. What was it? North Star Omni keyboard. Those great buckling
[01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:34.860]   key switches. Now those were switches, my friends. That's what men were men and keyboards were
[01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:40.540]   afraid. Ladies and gentlemen, we have concluded this edition of Mac break weekly in the nick
[01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:47.420]   of time. I thank Renee Richie freezing in the Great White North for you. Yes, he's got
[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:52.940]   his apple. Yes. Nice to have you, Renee. And I hope you'll come back again this week to
[01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:57.900]   join us. Don't forget you can find lots more Renee at i'more.com and the new vector podcast,
[01:47:57.900 --> 01:48:02.220]   which talks about that article. Marco was talking about who's with you on that vector?
[01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:05.980]   Oh, I do it alone. And sometimes it's just me, but I often have two or three guests a
[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:09.220]   week. It's a daily show. I don't know why I was silly enough to do that, but it's a daily
[01:48:09.220 --> 01:48:14.700]   show. Today's guest. It just went live as Matt Drance, who was the evangelist at Apple
[01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:18.620]   during the Xcode transition and the original iPhone launch. And he talked about both and
[01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:24.500]   it's super cool. Very, very nice. I'more.com kids and it's a little harder to find the podcast,
[01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:28.660]   but I think if you just Google I'm more vector, you'll probably find it. I'more.com/vector.
[01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:34.660]   We're putting everything there. Nice. Thank you. Yeah. Mr. Andy Inaco, his work at the
[01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:39.860]   Chicago Times sometimes is never done, but you'll find many of his goodies on his website,
