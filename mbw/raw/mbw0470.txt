[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.040]   Before the storm. I'm excited though. I brought my iPhone with me
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.040]   So I'd be ready when the time comes if I get a call at any point from apple inviting me to the event
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:14.440]   What a 3g or a 3gs. I don't know it's really old you have one of those rare white ones
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.040]   How long you have to wait for that?
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.440]   Only 16 gigabyte god only this is a 32
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.720]   So this was probably max it out when I got it
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.080]   Look at that. That's a that's a four by four icon array
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.680]   The word iPhone is shiny on the back is a 3gs it is shiny on the back. There you go. Wow. That's how you tell
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.800]   Yep, that's Renee Richie for I'm or he knows everything really knows everything everything that's jindall rimple from loop insight
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.560]   Anything Renee doesn't know Jim will fill in I just asked him to say the same all the work Jim does the guitar fills
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.120]   And all the shows also here Andy and I go with his shiny pink phone
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.440]   Indeed it just came from
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.240]   There you go
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:14.600]   It is a very is that what you wanted that's exactly this is exactly the phone that I wanted
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.120]   Everything you imagined it would be in more I wish I wish you could see this in person is such a cool color
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.960]   It's like I took it out of the box and like my god
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.320]   I'm going to so enjoy carrying this around
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.560]   This is and the fact that this isn't a case. This is this is this is the identity of the phone
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.560]   Awesome, is that an HTC?
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.920]   That is a
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.920]   Motorola Moto G
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.600]   So it's like the hundred and seventy nine buck of the phone and with the personalized message from I've heard
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:54.040]   It says it yay, I've heard good things about the HTC ones have you tried those?
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.120]   I've tried the HTC's there. I don't like what the skin they've put on to Android
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.040]   But they're built really really well
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.120]   They're part of a generation where they figured out that maybe we should actually make these things like feel good in the hand
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.960]   And how is that HTC can do that build you know a decent quality?
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.800]   Device but yet not sell anything
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:22.480]   Samsung owns everything Samsung is the apple of Android where people who don't really know or care about phones are like
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.240]   That's the name that they recognize. That's the one that they gravitate towards
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.160]   Which is not to say that Samsung makes terrible phones, but it's hard to get people aware of when they go into a phone store of
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.560]   HTC, which it makes nothing there
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.760]   I wonder if people actually come in thinking well they make a good they make a good TV and refrigerator that we use
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.600]   Let's have their phone as well
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.680]   Billions and marketing budget which HTC can't afford sadly. I feel like we started them. We did a Mac podcast and Android broke out
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.280]   Sam Samsung every time Samsung has a brand new phone
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.600]   I always I always know almost ahead of the press releases that I get or the phone calls because I will like take the train into Boston and
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.800]   every available
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.640]   Marketing surface in South states and has been covered with a Samsung
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.040]   I don't know if this is still true now that they're in a little bit more financial trouble than they were
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:18.000]   But it used to be that they had a a formula that they would take a certain amount of the profits on the phones and reinvest that in
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.840]   Marketing so as the phones took off
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.760]   Mark the marketing dollars did too. Well, they believe in brand marketing
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.040]   They want you to be thinking Samsung said if you ever decide you want to buy a phone Samsung so you think of well
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.040]   I have this this this phone
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.360]   I got this phone the last time I got an invite to an Apple event and and I'm not gonna give it up
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.640]   until it's working
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.720]   Well, there's no there's no service
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:48.280]   I guess I guess Apple is saying that there's only enough phones without inviting you. Yeah, baby for sale who got an invite
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.280]   Did you get the invite?
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.400]   Andy did you get an invite? I did not get an invite. Oh, see I'm worried because I think your association with me might be tarnishing your reputation
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:03.000]   No, no every every time I've either gotten invite or not gotten invite every time I did not get one if I sent an email
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.200]   I got an invite and like I've been saying for them
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   It was so you wanted to go you could go I could go and also I've been saying for weeks that I'm sorry
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.280]   I've got tickets to the tickets of the Stephen Colbert show that night
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.840]   there's probably nothing that's gonna make me not see Elon Musk and
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.880]   You're not even seeing me
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.880]   Let alone Elon Musk
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:29.800]   Let me just try this and Leo the port Siri give me a hint. Oh wait a minute. This phone doesn't have there is voice control
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.360]   Oh, it is it we can't it's something happened wait first phone with voice control. Well first iPhone with voice. Wow you are good
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.760]   See
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.840]   connection
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.840]   She even sounds like Siri
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.360]   Let me try again. It was a series beta. Give me a hint
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.280]   The time is 11 a.m
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.220]   She sounds like she sounds like Siri if you're calling her over T mobile phone
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:58.720]   Well, I'm go ahead go ahead you do it Renee. I'm trying
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:05.580]   You have signed you have signed the series I hear there's something big happening on September 9th
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.600]   Yeah, that was a nice touch I thought
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.500]   There's like nine of them. I know Renee and Jim are coming to
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:18.120]   This the Bill Graham Civic Center of all places on September 9th. Am I right? Yes? Yeah
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.120]   Oh
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.520]   It was you who posted the the invite first Jim. Yeah, we know you got one
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.280]   I'll be there with a case of Heineken and
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:34.000]   I'm sure he got one back in July. I'm pretty sure yeah, yeah, so
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.160]   I unprecedented
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:43.880]   First time he's ever had anything at a venue this big that I can think of even Moscone West is half the size of the Bill Graham Civic Center
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.660]   1,000 seat arena. What are they doing in there? And if they had 7,000 invitations, why didn't they send me one?
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:57.280]   We don't know how many invitations they send out. Yeah, they're not gonna fill it. Yeah, I doubt that they that it's
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.160]   You know all invited guests and yeah
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.720]   Can't say demo area you said Renee the new Apple TV
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.380]   Yeah, I mean that's that's one of the rumors going around that they're gonna use a lot of space to have actual televisions with the new Apple TV
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:15.300]   setup and areas where people can go and see all the new functionality including the Siri control and the
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:23.460]   The orientation aware Apple TV controls and that takes up a little bit of space orientation or where Apple TV control kind of like a we-mo
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:28.180]   You mean yeah, although it doesn't have like the front facing broadcasting sensors
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:34.320]   It's more like an iOS device where it has Bluetooth accelerometer and access around gravity at the six access
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.060]   How with the TV Bluetooth? Yeah
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:45.460]   The back of the back of the house area and Apple events has just been getting bigger and bigger because they need spaces for meeting areas
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.580]   They need spaces for VIP areas. They need you know
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:55.420]   Soundproof areas for when the video starts to walk out and so people can't hear people shrieking. Yeah, that's what stuff
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:04.300]   Christina Warren at a Mashable pointed out that 7,000 seats removable. Yes, so it's it can be a arena style and
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:11.660]   Can have a giant mosh pit. I'd like to see a mosh pit and I and that I want to see you Jim Dowerable moshing with Johnny
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.740]   I've well now you ruined the surprise
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:21.860]   He was the one more thing how about this one? I think Christina in her article said what about cars you can
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:29.980]   They've had auto shows in there. You could drive cars in there. Well, the funny enough the the Apple TV connects to the
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.180]   Television via Bluetooth and so does my apple car. Oh wait. Oh
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.420]   Jim Jim
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:42.260]   You remember your NDA. Yeah, I don't I don't think we'll see anything like that. I mean
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:49.940]   Apple is is going to have a focus and they always do and they have to have a focus because of
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.300]   the the upcoming
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.540]   fall sales and
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:59.900]   You know, that's what they lead into Christmas. So it's gonna be big push
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.460]   Somebody somebody said
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.940]   Well, if Apple
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.940]   This is from Mac Observer
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:13.540]   Probably Dave Hamilton. No John Martellaro said well if an iPhone 6s can record 4k video
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:18.540]   Well, then that means a 4k Apple TV does he mean a TV set? I
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:24.700]   Sure did the Apple TV before K capable what it doesn't work that way. Yeah, I mean like just because yes
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.420]   There will there could be an Apple TV that's 4k, but it doesn't have anything to do with the iPhone
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.740]   It has to do with the chipset that can handle it. Yeah, both have similar chips right?
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:38.420]   It's the same the same reason why 4k video is getting so important for consumers not because consumers have been clamoring 4k TV sets
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:44.880]   but in within two or three years time the panels that are in the TVs that they're gonna want to buy anyway will be 4k
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.940]   Right, so it's so well. That's just it's they can't they keep shipping
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:54.100]   It's I think it's one of the reasons why you see a lot of Apple devices that have really high power CPUs in there
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:59.200]   Partly because do we are we gonna keep this limping a long third three-year-old CPU in there?
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.780]   Or we're just gonna say let's just make a whole bunch for everybody now that we have now that we can make him in capacity
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.780]   We'll just put it on everything
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:11.980]   I don't think 4k display. Oh, you just mean crazy like yeah the new Sony well the rumor is and we're gonna find out tomorrow morning very early
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:17.060]   I think it's 7 30 our time. We'll be covering the yes Sony streaming conference from IFA
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:21.260]   So the rumor is the next Xperia will have a 4k screen insane
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.960]   Well, if anybody could do it Sony could do it. I hate to say that every life although they're famous for great battery life
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.940]   so
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:32.520]   Who knows they also have what is it a 20 28 megapixel ridiculous number of megapixel camera?
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.620]   I was not impressed with the Sony cameras in the past
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.780]   But I'm think we're gonna have to sit up and pay attention anyway to these new Sony phones
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:44.820]   But again, we're this is an Apple podcast and and Android has broken out. Well just the point of the future
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.740]   I mean Android phones for a while have been it
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:53.140]   Previously was Windows phones. I remember when the first HD at HD HD came out and that was an insanely large display for that time
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.620]   And then he started making 1080p the HTC both 3d a yeah
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:03.300]   a phone with two cameras a jot 3d video some companies compete on specs and as much as it's not the same as competing on experience
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:08.660]   I love that because those specs are what we're gonna get in the future and someone has to be willing to try them first and see
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:13.140]   What works and what doesn't work and and all those things we've had 4k in the the Samsung
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:19.960]   Galaxies for a couple generations now, but see I think that's that's the big difference between some of these other companies and Apple
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:27.100]   Some the the Android company Samsung HTC whatever will put these features out there even though there's no
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:33.420]   Real market for it. There's no there's no way to use it like NFC was a perfect example
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.860]   Apple waits until they've figured out a
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:43.340]   Problem to solve and then put it in there and you know we said for for years at NFC is a checklist item
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.340]   And that's all it was
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:53.100]   But when Apple released Apple pay then NFC had some meaning for people only an Apple enthusiast say that by the way
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:59.060]   That's ridiculous and if she has huge meaning for people in all sorts of ways Android has had payment tapped
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:04.700]   A pay for more than a year before Apple pay came out. I use NFC on my Android phones to tap my Sony
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:09.980]   Camera so I can copy pictures over I can't still can't do that in Apple because Apple's locked the NFC down
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:15.180]   Apple is late to the game often and because Apple lives in its own universe
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:19.460]   They get all this praise for being oh look it's 4k video
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:25.880]   No, look I like Apple. I'm not saying anything. I'm just against Apple
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.980]   I'm just saying you guys got to live in the real world here. This is not new and
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:37.580]   Video has been on YouTube. How long has it been on YouTube for two years since no kid invented it in 1812?
[00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.220]   It is useful just because Apple doesn't do it doesn't mean it's not useful
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.460]   It's almost like you believe what you're saying, which is
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:51.500]   I just throw this in to give you guys a hard time
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.060]   It is like a lot some companies think in terms of chipsets
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.260]   They get a piece of technology and they try to think of all the amazing things they can do with it
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:01.540]   And some companies think in terms of feature sets and they try to find the technology look at all the video those features
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:07.460]   This is the five look at all the video formats and supports VGA HD full HD full HD 60 frames per second
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:13.940]   quad HD 25 60 by 1440 you HD 38 you know what that means like 21 60 course you do
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:18.860]   You know how many pixels that is that's not crazy talk and you can their effects
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:25.980]   You know like stabilization that don't work if you're in these higher ranges VGA for why is that still there for sending small videos
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.980]   via smart phone
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.460]   I don't think that these are I think that that's not true
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:39.620]   Not to be a reactionary Jim, but I feel like that's not true that NFC had utility before Apple did it just because Apple didn't didn't make it suddenly useful
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:46.060]   Well, I think that NFC particulars is a good example of how it's just it's not good or bad
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:52.820]   It's a difference in philosophy Apple is doing exactly the right thing by saying that we're not gonna put a feature in and then just simply
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:58.620]   Not do anything with it. It's true that Google Wallet was available about a year year and a half before Apple Pay
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:06.380]   But even I as a full-time Android user had never used it until Apple reminded me that the phone that I had in my pocket
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:12.220]   Had the ability to do NFC payments, but the other side of the coin is that I do like the idea of saying well
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.220]   We're gonna put NFC in there. We're gonna put apps app support in there in it for it
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:22.100]   So that it won't bother anybody won't confuse the phone for anybody who doesn't want it or doesn't care about it
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:28.420]   But for people like me who realize that oh gee what if I put it this NFC sticker in the in the carrier for my
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:34.220]   In the carrier for my phone so automatically when I lay it down someplace or put it in this holder or put it in this car
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:38.860]   Dash it can say oh by the way you are physically inside the car now and here's all the settings that you
[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.420]   Awesome. Yeah, yeah, and those things like that
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:49.940]   So I like a balance of the two and realize that Apple does benefit from being able to look at how people are using these these features
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.980]   That's how that's one of the reasons why they were able to call their shots. So effectively
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:16:00.940]   It's I think it's one of the reasons why they're doing a 12 megapixel camera not a 12 20 megapixel camera for instance because you can definitely see that
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.940]   They're falling behind an image quality
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:07.460]   Compared to this years and even many of last years Android phones, but you go
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:12.140]   There are also too smart to say well nobody even cares about 20 or 40 megapixel image sensors right now
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:18.260]   It's not worth making the sacrifices we would have to make to enable that so I'm glad that they're both these different philosophies in play
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:25.900]   Yeah, although one of the things Apple enthusiasts often say is well Apple waits until they could do it better
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:29.980]   I've heard you say that Andy and I'm not convinced that Apple has done it better
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:34.500]   Again, it's always it's it's not right and wrong. It's yin and yang. It's it's
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:39.780]   It's philosophies that define each other where with one platform
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:45.020]   It really is about we're gonna let you screw this phone up and make mistakes and create a terrible experience for yourself
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:51.500]   With the advantage being that you can create a really customized tailored experience that you will like more than whatever we can
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:57.060]   Try to plan for you. Rest Apple says that this phone. It's stable. You're not gonna have any security issues
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.220]   You will not have a thing
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:02.580]   We're gonna want to have to reflash it because you screwed it up so badly again
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:07.780]   I'm glad that there is this range of choice out there because both points of you are equally valid as far as I'm concerned
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.340]   I for instance you can tap
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:15.140]   Bluetooth speakers to pair them with NFC these are there's also the things you can do with an
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.380]   They've seen tap your Apple TV to pair it with your iPhone to set it up. Is that you think that'll be enabled?
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.540]   Well, it was it was the current one you can do that you can hit your it's not using NFC is using Bluetooth
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.540]   But you can hit them together and they'll pair yeah
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.820]   So I mean it's interesting like if you look there were early phones like thunderbolt that had early LTE chips
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.340]   And there were large phones like the original note
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:36.740]   But Apple Apple tried to make a large iPhone 4 and they didn't like pen tile displays and they thought that was not a good
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:43.220]   Yeah, they waited until they had next generation lower heat lower size LTE chips
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.700]   And they had LCD screens that could scale to that size
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:50.380]   But you understand that one of the reasons there were there were progress was made in all this stuff is because there was a large
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:55.240]   Enough market thanks to these other phones that used pen tile. Absolutely in the market so that Apple could say
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.620]   Oh, thank you. We'll take those now
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:01.700]   There were ten years of tablet PCs before the right for the iPad Apple look Apple really believes and they look at the market
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:06.500]   They see what mistakes they think are being made and if they can if they can figure out way to solve problems that as they see
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.820]   Them they enter the market. Yeah, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you Jim
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:17.020]   I don't feel like you're this a scarable person. So I I let you have it and I apologize and then what happened after Apple put a
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:24.540]   The iPad everybody copied them because Apple did it right and that's what it comes down to. Yeah, well
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.260]   Any I'll let you take this one
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:38.340]   I'm sorry go ahead I'm going to interrupt. No nobody ever said that Apple invented the phone or invented the the tablet
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.940]   Or the mp3 player, but Apple did it right?
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.420]   they they brought a
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:49.180]   technology that the rest of the market was trying to make popular for years and
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:56.380]   They made it work. You don't think that's well old hat ancient history that is Apple still doing that
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:02.380]   I mean I'll grant you absolutely iPod iPhone iPad all well all took existing products and
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:07.460]   Made them beautiful again, right and that's what they're trying to do with the watch but
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:13.820]   Trying might be the operative word there sure. Oh, we don't know yet. Yeah, I mean, it's it's version one
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.820]   We didn't know that they were gonna do that with the iPod when it first came out
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.820]   As a matter of oh, I beg to differ that first
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:26.860]   I very vividly remember in my experience of the first iPod because I had tried every crap mp3 player ever and it was
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:31.860]   Immediately obvious they had fixed the UI issue that you could actually use this though
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:37.620]   A lot of people were against the iPod when it first came really sure they were they said it cost too much
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.380]   It would never cost too much you're right. That's the continual complaint about Apple cost too much
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:49.820]   But you know what whatever Apple is working on now is what's gonna change what we're doing today and
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:56.940]   Whether absolutely I agree with you absolutely and and as soon as they do that then those
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.860]   copying
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:06.660]   I think that's all had also I don't know Sam's on you still copy can I respond yes, I'm
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:14.660]   This is this is why I'm not as upset as maybe I could or should be about Samsung copying so many things off of Apple
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:19.420]   because I do believe that all technology and to an extent almost all creation there is
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:26.580]   eminent cross pollination that benefits everybody if we were to take apart the iPhone and we were to say okay
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:30.620]   Well here is a notification system that Android had a couple years before that
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:35.500]   Here's a camera system that they had a couple years before that you can't really go bits and pieces and say that
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.820]   This one company absolutely
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:44.620]   Innovated it and this other this other one copied sometimes you have to see something in this in the metal to see exactly how it works
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.380]   My I've always believed that the iPad
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:52.860]   Was the one that really cracked tablets, but I'm not sure if Apple would have figured that out
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:21:00.780]   Had they not had a generation of really badly made netbooks not to copy but to look at say chief people are you these are terrible
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.380]   Notebooks. They're cheaply made the screen is terrible. They barely run apps
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:09.500]   They run not nearly as long on battery as they should and yet people are buying them in droves
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:15.260]   This is teaching us something about how people want to use computers in the mid in the early 2000s now
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:21.940]   And that is going to inform how they make finally there the the tablet that they wanted to make before they started to make the iPhone
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.980]   So I just I just think it's counterproductive to simply say that
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:29.460]   Apple or any company fixed a problem that everyone else copied the problem
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:34.500]   It's it's iteration iteration iteration you told something in your hands you say this is really really good
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:40.820]   I wish it worked better this way or this doesn't work for the way that we want to design things and then you take the next step of it
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:46.380]   This is why Apple Watch is going to benefit from Android where and Android where it's going to benefit from Apple Watch because neither of these
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:52.620]   designs have really locked it and the only way that the consumers are going to benefit is if Apple says you know what
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:56.240]   The user we are asking to use it interact way too much with this
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:02.220]   I really like the way that Google that the Android where just puts information when they need it Android where it should be able to say
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:08.900]   Our watches look like crap. They do. We should make stuff that doesn't look like crap
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:14.900]   Okay, there are some you know the new Samsung which is based on tit ties in on Android looks a lot better
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.900]   I
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:23.580]   Said it. I'm just gonna give a little quote in here if I have seen farther than others is because I have stood on this the shoulders of
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:30.900]   Geniuses, it's this is how this is how things evolve and Apple absolutely is genius. I'm not denying that
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.620]   I have to address one thing here the the issue with netbooks
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.420]   Netbooks did sell well
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:44.420]   but there were were studies at the time when netbooks were selling so well that showed that there were also
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:48.500]   and in order to amount of returns on netbooks and
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:57.060]   The studies also showed that a lot of people were buying netbooks and didn't know what they were buying up to 70% of people
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.800]   Were buying netbooks and thought that they were notebooks
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.900]   So they were being
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:08.340]   Oversoled and they under delivered which is why they were being returned so to say that that Apple did
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:13.580]   The iPad because of netbooks I think is a bit misleading because that what I said
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:19.660]   But
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:28.500]   You can't you can't do you can't base a product on something that people didn't even know that that they were buying
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.820]   You know, I know what you were trying to say and I
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:35.720]   Just think that the whole netbook argument in that is
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:41.620]   Is misleading because people didn't know what they were getting in the first place and once they did they took it back
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.180]   well
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:51.260]   I'm trying I wish I had notes in front of me. I don't I was also looking at a lot of different studies that were being done in
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.500]   2005 2006 2007 about how
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:24:01.020]   I'm sorry 2007 8 9 how netbooks are being used that was a huge problem and that basically people
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:06.020]   There was there were a bunch of studies that said that if you asked people why they bought these a lot of them thought
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.620]   This was a really inexpensive notebook a lot of people
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:12.420]   However, we're buying them because they already have a notebook that wasn't serving their current needs
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:17.560]   They wanted this sort of a shuttle craft and that's so I don't I certainly don't think that
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.900]   Netbooks were responsible for the ushering in of the multi-touch tablet revolution
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:29.820]   But nonetheless, I'm very very confident that there was a wealth of data being provided about how people are using mobile devices
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:36.540]   That there's something better than a phone that people want at that particularly at that point given the devices that were available at the time
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.260]   so I
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:43.060]   I'm confident that the iPad benefited from the presence of netbooks even though
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.060]   I don't believe that they are the cause and result of
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.460]   Netbooks being a successful product for a while
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:53.380]   By the way net with I have two points on netbooks not that this has germane to our conversation really
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.780]   But one I think that they got the price so low. It was an impulse purchase
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:00.220]   That's what there were so many returns people didn't even care what they were getting in the box
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:05.660]   That was a good example of the drive to the bottom that yeah, there are
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:10.580]   That's the second their phone their phones right now that are hundred seventy nine bucks and they're built really really well
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.780]   And they can make most people happy is that the net book of phones that Moto G
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:18.940]   No, I wouldn't I wouldn't say I would say it's a nasty thing about about inexpensive Android phones
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:25.140]   But the the problem with the netbooks was because partly because they stopped being inexpensive at four hundred dollars
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.980]   And they stopped started being well now the only feature we can deliver is cheap
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:34.580]   So how do we knock another 20 bucks off of this right until you want the fun things every time I got one of these netbooks to review?
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:40.180]   There'd be one out of every four or five would be decently built the other one the first thing
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.500]   I would do knowing that these are so cheap that the manufacturer doesn't even
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:49.020]   Practically doesn't want them back is just hold the edges and go like this and see how much I can flex them
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:53.020]   You know before before I think the screen is gonna break or something
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:57.480]   They're just so poorly made that once you have them in your hand they look okay at
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:04.340]   Online when you buy one click to order then when you get it and you're over the first couple of days
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.020]   You start to realize that you really have a junky piece of junk
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.660]   and
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.500]   You're you are double checking to make sure I can return it within how many hours great
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:19.380]   Let's not even wait the other point. I was gonna make about netbooks is it they severely damaged the wind the PC market because
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:28.860]   the price point became suddenly this the standard and the and the quality really turned people away from computers in fact
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.580]   I you you could make it. It's a tenuous article
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:41.220]   Post-hoc a propter hawk. I'll throw in a little Latin that maybe the success of apples max lately is because people have been so burned by
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.560]   Netbooks for so long that they decided you know maybe I should spend more and get it
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.300]   That's the one that says I think Mac books are selling so well because they're making such great Mac books
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.640]   They're great Mac books, but I think I don't know if you've learned been burned right
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.300]   Like me though that apples not gonna announce a net book next week. I think we can
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:27:02.080]   Really apples gonna have a challenge though, aren't they because they're gonna continue to charge
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:06.180]   You know between what six hundred fifty and a thousand dollars for these phones
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.380]   Yeah, I think that's a conart
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:13.940]   I think people keep saying that but I don't think like there is so much invested in selling phones at retail in the US and through carriers that that
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:19.540]   The that whole thing is gonna be so well hidden. It's not gonna matter whether it's fifteen dollars a month or twenty five dollars a month
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:24.940]   They are past your master's at selling and making everything and anything you buy seem insignificant upfront
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:29.060]   Yeah, I don't hear people complaining about the prices of Apple watch it. Okay, but are we really good to say?
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.820]   Oh, that's no problem Apple is really good at making people not
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:38.300]   Okay, the carriest stores are different people go to carrier stores. They can sell you an eight hundred dollar galaxy
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:45.500]   No, they can sell Leo two or three of them. I mean they're I am not pleased the post-life boy for a normal consumer
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:50.700]   I don't want to buy these I have to buy them. It's a huge expense and it's getting worse
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.900]   They do have the option of expense
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:57.180]   Thing is like there are there are six hundred and seven hundred eight hundred dollars Samsung phones - it's not an Apple only thing
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:04.840]   It's a premium phone thing and it's in everyone everyone but the consumer's best interest that though that that money gets hidden as well as possible at point of sale, right?
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:10.300]   Well, but I I take pride in speaking for the consumer
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:16.800]   But well in some ways it's better though Leo because before if you bought the phone and you paid it off
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.800]   You still kept paying the same amount that you did
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:24.680]   And now theoretically once you've paid off that phone your bill goes down
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:29.240]   Yeah, but it's no accident that both sprint and T-Mobile have this keep paying $15 a month forever
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:34.120]   Because then you'll always get the new phone past master's Leo. Yeah, they know what they're doing
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.160]   Hey, let's take a break come back with more. We got a great panel and
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:42.760]   Jim you are every show if you want you are welcome here. We love having you
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.840]   Well being here. Yeah, loop insight.com Jim Dow rimples the greatest
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Has Lisa contacted you
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.520]   My partner because I really want to I want to make some sort of packed no
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:00.320]   Maybe like some sort of ACD side see style deal with the devil
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.240]   That's a different show title
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:08.020]   Leo is it ACD see a deal with the diameter AC DC
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:12.680]   We have a band out here Jim you probably heard of him ACD she
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:21.560]   It's an all haven't seen them. They're great. They're all female tribute band and actually go they're really good
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.880]   I'm I'm going. They'll pull you up on stage. Oh
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:33.520]   Running with a notebook
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.160]   Also here with us from I'm more Renee Richie you guys
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:52.200]   Okay, I'm you're starting this I'm more podcast, you know, you're gonna steal all our viewers now
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:59.480]   We've been doing it. We've been doing it for five six years seven years. Oh, yeah, I watched it, but it's great. Oh
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:04.080]   Thank you. Yeah, we're like we caught up to you somehow. I don't know how we started it
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.920]   I think 2008 because I'm lazy. Do you do it? Do you do it now with?
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.800]   Have how long have you been doing video?
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:15.440]   We've started doing video when you stream came out. Okay, so you have been doing it a long time
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:20.080]   We had four different windows and then we tried to screen cap for four windows because we didn't have a switch
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.080]   Right, and then we went to when Google Hangouts came out. We were using
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:29.040]   Broadcasting all you never really worked because when it failed it wouldn't save the file which was horrible
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.840]   Ascent we just use Google Hangouts
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.880]   also here
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.880]   Let there be a nacho
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:40.560]   Andy a nacho from the Chicago Sun times and his beautiful
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.200]   Pink what color is that?
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:51.480]   I don't think I think only the metal highlight is officially pink. I believe the casing is some sort of purple berry color
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:58.240]   By the way, if I if this if this were if this were Alex Lindsey's camera, then you'd be able to see the difference better
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.040]   But this is a and you not go to a ported camera. So
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.760]   By the way, I should mention
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.800]   Jim that
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:13.480]   ACD she and I think you'll appreciate this is a tribute to the bond Scott era. Yes. Yes. I do appreciate that. I thought you would
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:20.200]   They are that guitarist he's freaking awesome
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.000]   Their Angus see he's even got the she's another shorts
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.680]   All right in the hair in the hair
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:34.680]   Maybe I could fill in for a song or something and I want them to pull you up on stage
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:39.440]   You'll have to like make you like the the widow or the bride have a veil to cover the beard
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:45.280]   The beard might be a little bit too much or or maybe just glue like fake like elastic straps to the side of it
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:52.320]   So that's hard. Yeah, the beard has its own man. Why did you start growing that beard?
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:56.560]   About six years ago, that's all yeah
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:01.040]   His life on launch beer and if I could get a beard like that in six years, I would start today
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.840]   You know and then we can do a ZZ top tribute band to be awesome
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:10.480]   I threatened to cut it and then it smothers me in my sleep. No never cut it
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:17.880]   Never cut it. It's no. I can't cut it. No of course. That's your trademark. Yeah, it's like a Peter O tool in his green socks
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:22.840]   You just you got to go with it now or potentially this is a dread pirate Robert situation
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:35.080]   I love that idea. I showed it. They brought to you by Linda calm great place to go if you want to learn

[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.560]   SDK and SQ light
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:36.000]   The code clinic which I you know, I just watch for fun. It's a great multi-course series
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:44.240]   Linda comms coding experts look at the same they all do the same code challenge in get this C++ or C# or
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:49.160]   Java or PHP or Python or Ruby and they've just had a JavaScript
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.320]   plain old C my favorite language are
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.920]   brand new and
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.560]   Swift now. This is great if you're a coder
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:02.720]   Watching these really is a great way to learn really a great way to learn
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:07.720]   I've got to tell you you got to go Linda.com. We got a 10-day free trial
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.800]   You can you know take one course begin and end or my suggestion dip into
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:17.560]   A few courses to get a sense of how great they are you'll see there's transcripts for every course
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:22.880]   And you can search them searchable transcripts so you can jump to the part you want if you if you're one of those people that jumps around
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.440]   If you're a breed watch beginning to end type of person you could do that too
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:31.600]   Here's a here's a screen. I haven't seen it a while Wow
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:38.360]   Oh boy, oh I'm glad enough to worry about that anymore. We're looking at the PHP
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.160]   What is the what is the name of that command PHP?
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:48.400]   Report I can't remember no it's like to know info info. Oh my god. I blanked that out
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:53.200]   Yeah, don't ever want to see that screen again, and we should blanket out. Yeah, I wish
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:35:00.120]   Anyway, if you're learning PHP in my SQL, that's a great course. You're gonna see that PHP info command
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:05.240]   Linda LYNDA comm slash Mac break. This is what I like about Linda calm. They don't hold back
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:10.480]   They celebrate this stuff in all its infinite detail and geeky glory
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:15.360]   LYNDA comm slash Mac break 10 days free that should be enough to give you an idea of
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:21.120]   How great Linda comm can be for you as little as $20 a month if you bill annually
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:25.760]   That's really a great deal, but free for 10 days. Thank you Linda for your support
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.120]   What is this deal Apple and Cisco?
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.720]   Can somebody explain?
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.960]   Apparently if you are an enterprise and you have Cisco routers, I would guess
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:45.600]   Apple has work is working with Cisco to for BYOD purposes you can better I don't know
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.840]   Communicate on corporate networks where Cisco gear is used if you have an iPhone or an iPad
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.840]   Maybe we should get the enterprise experts on here. I'm not I'm not
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:58.640]   John Chambers and of Cisco and Tim Cook
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.440]   joint press release
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:06.120]   We spent 10 months working on collaboration. This was at Cisco's
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.040]   yearly sales gathering in Vegas
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.800]   Yeah, enterprisey
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:15.440]   Fast lane basically so you'll get the best right
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:22.320]   QOS for iOS. Yeah, you'll get the bill if you have both Cisco and iPhones and iPads in your enterprise
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:26.920]   You will have the absolute fastest you'll have you warp tunnel a hyperspace conduit through your business
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:31.240]   This is really just a measure this and the IBM deal measure of how
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:37.160]   The enterprises have gone kicking businesses have gone kicking and screaming into the bring your own device world
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:43.880]   It started, you know, it was probably a big part of the downfall of BlackBerry was as employees started bringing they said no
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:48.840]   See, I'm not gonna use that crappy phone CEOs. Yeah, that's because the IT didn't care at all about employees
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.760]   They would just say no and then the CEO said hey
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.800]   I want to run my iPhone and all of a sudden my T's like oh, yes, sir
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:59.200]   We'll get this figured out sir, but it also conversely shows especially with iPad that Apple is still looking
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.360]   And Jim has written a lot about this is still looking for opportunities where the iPad can grow
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:08.680]   Right, and they've got a very widespread in enterprise but not a very deep spread yet and things like IBM and things like Cisco
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:10.280]   Hopefully we'll let them get deep
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.280]   Repentation into the departments in the enterprise
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:18.080]   Urban daddy, that's one of the apps on here
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:25.840]   I also think that I don't understand much about enterprise, but I think this is such a smart partnership because
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:30.560]   If Apple's gonna continue to make five six seven eight hundred dollar iPads
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:34.480]   They have to compete against four five six seven hundred dollar
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:41.800]   Windows tablets and they're so much better than the then less expensive Windows tablets for real hard work like that
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:46.600]   So if they can find a way to make sure that here we will give you the apps that you want with our partnership with IBM
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.880]   We will now give you better network support throughout your entire internet
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.320]   And it's only gonna cost you maybe a hundred bucks
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:59.160]   Maybe hundred fifty dollars more than maybe the Dell or the Asus tablet that you thought that you're gonna you're gonna want to get for Windows 10
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.760]   It's just nothing but win-win for everybody except for anyone making Windows tablets
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.200]   I I agree. That's exactly it
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.600]   Okay, well then we're done moving on we fixed it
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:19.080]   I'm trying to launch the Craig Mulaney shift key software. Who's in our chat room will appreciate this who didn't he said
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.960]   I'm trying to launch the twit app from what year was the 3gs?
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.360]   2009
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.960]   The one before retina
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.720]   Are you getting a thunderstorm or is that a truck going by?
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.720]   Jim truck. Okay
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.080]   I was worried it was gonna suddenly pour
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:44.920]   But are not gonna thunder. I'm actually disappointed by this. I hope they come up with a replacement Apple says they're going to retire one-to-one
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.720]   Training in the Apple Store at the end of the month
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:51.880]   This is a mark I think that I think that makes sense
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:57.720]   Really I was just I was in the Apple store just the other day a mall Apple store not one of the big
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:02.200]   You know football field size one and the entire back half of the store no joke
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:08.600]   the tables of one to many instruction and people waiting for waiting for service and
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:13.400]   It's not that it's a bad thing for you one-to-one instructions a bad thing for users
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:19.680]   But it's a bad use of both a limited space and the limited people that Apple has if they can continue to help out six people for free
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:24.960]   For the amount of personal they're gonna be spending to spend to take care of one person for a small amount of money
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.560]   That seems to make sense. So the one to one was you'd make a deal
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:33.160]   You'd actually go in early a lot of times before the stir open and you'd get one one with a genius
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:38.800]   Which was I know a lot of people who did this it was really great for people who were a little technology adverse or just
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.680]   Little them. Yeah, my mom
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.320]   Actually my ex-wife
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:50.920]   Very valuable stuff, but the Apple says fewer people are signing up for these so we're gonna do we're gonna instead do more workshops
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:51.600]   Yeah
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:57.040]   It was $99 and it was bound to the Mac for a long time and the audience is increasingly iOS and they would do iOS stuff for you
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:03.480]   But they didn't sell it traditionally to iOS people and it was also exactly what you meant Leo is for people who found computers and accessible or intimidating
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:03.880]   Yeah
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:08.160]   wanted a little bit of help to get over that initial awkwardness and then they would fly but you know
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:13.600]   There are so many people going to Apple stores now those creatives have limited time and they're gonna apparently use these resources to have more
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:18.000]   multi-person workshops that they have Apple watch an iPhone and iPad and iMovie and
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:26.080]   Garageband they've all this great free instruction and we we keep getting emails from people like took a final cut pro course and now we're video editors
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.080]   But
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:36.520]   Unin and moon munin thought and memory he sends them out to collect information the exchange for one eye for wisdom
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:42.300]   Does that make Jim Odin in this story? Oh, you got you see you read the same comic books in my
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:51.000]   One of them blame blame the guy with the one big eye
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:57.800]   So maybe here's another reason why I still think
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:04.880]   The Civic Center thing is there's something there because you don't want to have a six or seven thousand seat venue
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:09.200]   Filled with 500 journalists. It will just look bad. Well, okay
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:15.400]   But real two things number one trivial thing and maybe the real answer to this the trivial thing is that remember?
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:20.280]   This is where the first west coast computer fair was held. Yes, so this is where the Apple 2 was introduced
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:23.000]   So there's a there's a bit of a nostalgic connection
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.920]   But I think that it'll work out that this was simply the best venue that was available at the time that Apple needed a venue
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:37.560]   Yes, and we're so a we are so good at trying to now the curvature of that fraction of the leaf of the Apple logo
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:42.520]   In the background of the invitation is a little bit rounder. We don't think
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:49.560]   I agree with Andy I think it's just a matter of
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:55.360]   This was the best venue for what they wanted to do and they can always invite more employees
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:59.400]   You know, I mean that's one thing that's always I think called a little bit as employees
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.120]   Can't usually go to these events because there's not enough room for them
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:08.920]   Right all by any means still not enough room for them all but it would be nice if everybody in Cupertino could could you know fill those extra
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.160]   It could be the grand tour of Tulio. I mean they're gonna have campus too soon the events will move there
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:15.520]   They're just they're going through their greatest hits on the media to the Flint Center last year, right?
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.680]   What is the campus open?
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:24.720]   2017 wasn't yeah, I think didn't it move to 2017. Yeah, I think so so we got a couple of years more of
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:29.760]   You know renting places and then they have built a facility inside
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:34.320]   About civic centers that if they hold things at your Berwena
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:41.680]   The the press doesn't get to see as much human urine and feces that they normally you obviously have been to the civic center
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.640]   I have taken detours around the civic center
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:50.080]   I needed to get to the library that is at the civic center said why don't I just plot myself a course that adds an extra half a
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:56.000]   Mile but will be much so sad the San Francisco Center is truly beautiful
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.520]   You know these neoclassical buildings are gorgeous the city hall the library the old library
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:09.040]   They're just really beautiful the Civic Center not so much but the auditorium, but the but the it's a plaza
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:14.320]   It's got poplar trees lining. It's just it really is beautiful and events have been held there the black and white ball
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.040]   Used to be there and you know, but unfortunately
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:22.600]   It's become a kind of a homeless encampment and I don't think the city really wants to
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:30.000]   Chase people out of it, but it's not a pleasant place to go to unfortunate now until the next big event. They're holding their puts so
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.520]   What's the is it a?
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:40.600]   Political convention I've been seeing the news where the mayor's getting flagged for basically saying that if you are homeless
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:44.600]   You have no place on Market Street. Oh, no is for the NFL experience that they're gonna be setting up for
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.280]   Oh, yeah, the Super Bowl is a Super Bowl. Yeah, and saying sorry
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:53.480]   We got to get you guys out of here because we need to have executive suites and drunk people with cheese hats walking around with open beers
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.120]   Yeah, it's really sad very unfortunate. Yeah
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:04.480]   Yeah, I mean, I don't know what you do and one thing San Francisco is pretty humane place and a sanctuary city and all that and so
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.560]   they're very reluctant to
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:16.240]   Chase people out, but I've been to cities where I've had three hours to kill between getting from here and there and there is
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:23.080]   No place to even sit because they're so aggressive at making sure that you cannot that no homeless person is gonna want to even pause here
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:30.440]   And that's not and that is such a crew. I don't necessarily think that you help people in those circumstances by making it easier for them to be
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.600]   homeless but nonetheless there is a
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.600]   There is a such an easy line of compassion that you have to stay behind at all times
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:40.080]   And I think that that kind of crosses that line anyway, you'll all get to see it
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.480]   Next week good luck have fun
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:49.020]   I'm gonna be in New York with the with Andy actually I wish I were going with Andy to the Colbert
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.840]   It's the first week of the new late night, right?
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:55.080]   It's a second show Scarlett right and then Elon Musk
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:45:00.800]   And I will and I will be I will be shocked and I have no inside knowledge, but I'm making this prediction
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:05.600]   I will be shocked if there isn't somebody from Apple that has a briefcase
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:09.720]   It's gonna be standing by and as soon as it is announced in in California
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:12.800]   Mr. Colbert will receive his iPhone 6s
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:19.640]   And oh man, you're right you might be the first that's right. You might actually be in the ground zero the right place to be
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:26.880]   I might say is there anybody in the audience who can help me set this thing up knows how to use this and you can leap to your feet
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.800]   Well, that's that's what that's why I'm making sure I'm wearing my twit t-shirt
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:34.040]   No, don't whatever you do
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:38.360]   I'll run across the top of the chairs like Ed Parker. I just jump on the stick. Yes. Yeah, well guys
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:47.040]   Do you have inside information I all my all my interactions with Apple are very very friendly
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:51.640]   No, it's a fact to go there actually they've been very friendly to me too. I don't I don't I'm just because I'm you know
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.600]   I like to fuel the rumors don't don't read into it
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:59.680]   You know I'm not reading anything as I say as I say every time I'm invited every time I'm not invited
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:04.320]   I can ask you is not an entitlement and you do your job where they get invited these things are not
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:09.600]   They're streaming to the entire planet exactly and this is there it does not limit anybody's access exactly
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:14.440]   In fact
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:21.080]   And you know she's a psychotherapist and she said have you just talked to them you should talk about it with them
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.520]   So now
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.720]   I want to talk
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:28.160]   You should write a letter and you want to be right where it's not a lot of you words
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.760]   And you're not gonna send the letter but I will help you to understand the parameters
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:37.280]   I hear that you don't want me to come to your events is that is there any I think it's one to share about that
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:41.360]   I want you to know how it may feel tell you how it may be I was just I
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:46.200]   Don't want to be angry. I can't go you know the real truth of it is
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:49.880]   I haven't been able to go even if I were invited because we cover it here live
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.840]   Thank you apple for streaming it that makes it a lot easier for us. We cover the stream
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:59.880]   We talk about it. I won't be here this time because sad to say I'm gonna be in New York City for some meetings and
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:03.400]   You know and a meetup
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:08.280]   In fact if anybody wants to bring the apple phone to rattle and hum between three and five p on September 9th
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.640]   I'll be there
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.520]   Mr. Colbert if you're listening if you're listening
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:18.760]   But we're gonna meet up that afternoon and then if they're true to form will be able to order it Friday at midnight
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.200]   Pacific right
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.640]   Is that right? I
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:27.200]   Mean it can vary but it'll be some point at midnight cappuccino time usually it's that Friday
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.040]   Yeah
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:33.200]   Because I'm thinking it's gonna be three that's three ames cuz what do you these coasters do you get up at three am?
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:39.440]   An alarm. Yeah, get up or if you're meeting you're so nervous. You can't sleep anyway, so you with the watch
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.320]   I said in alarm fell asleep ten minutes later was sold out. It was like
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:47.960]   Just a hit the snooze button
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.920]   No snooze button
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:54.680]   Never hit the snooze never hit the snooze button. Oh, no, no
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:59.120]   It's that part of the marketing campaigns like there's something thousand dollar watches
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:04.680]   Maybe if we just release it at a time where most of the people with the money are gonna be dead tired and not not thinking clearly
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:08.000]   Well, it's to convince them they don't have enough for people if you did it during the day
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.280]   So they do it at a time where the least amount of people possible will be willing to do it
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:14.560]   $1,000 I'll get the gold one
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:20.720]   For my dog because four would be ostentatious. Oh, man. I just had the weirdest dream
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:27.480]   I dreamt I spent 18 18 thousand dollars on a watch. I've never actually seen or held before wow what a oh my god
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:34.440]   My pillow was gone and that was the least amount of money they spent on something they'd never seen before that week. Yeah. Yeah, really
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:39.720]   What I want a purple one
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:43.240]   Purple phone I want a pink one
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.240]   Oh
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:48.840]   Pumpkin spice iPhone that was a joke. Ah
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:55.640]   Pumpkin spice. It's that time here again. It does our cartoons. You made a pumpkin spice iPhones for today. I'm selling gangbusters
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:49:02.040]   There really is it's really it's very binary. You either love it or you hate it. Don't you pumpkin spice? I
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:08.640]   I'm in the I like I just don't like I saw I saw a bag of pumpkin spice Oreos
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:12.720]   Like three days ago, and I'm just saying it's still technically August
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:17.720]   I don't want to see anything that's artificially colored orange unless it's a traffic cone or craft dinner
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:23.680]   Otherwise, don't remind me that the cold days are coming. I think there's pumpkin spice Wheaties now
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:27.480]   It's a great marketing thing. I mean they probably sell a bunch of them
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:33.840]   Complain and then they'd be upset they were sold out see now you head dimension craft dinner now. I'm hungry
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.360]   The pull of the homeland. I don't know what they call it craft dinner in the US Jim
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:46.180]   We call it just did isn't it is it macaroni and cheese? Yeah? Yeah, we call it craft macaroni and cheese
[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:50.720]   But it's a sexy. It's still dinner as soon as I heard Canadians referring to as craft dinner
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.360]   That's perfect because it doesn't have the words macaroni or cheese in it
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:50:01.320]   It is a food-shaped item that you can ingest
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.520]   It's dinner. So what was that comic? Oh?
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:11.280]   Yeah, well rich Stevens is it every week for us. Yeah diesel sweetie is it's amazing diesel sweeties rose gold wait
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:15.840]   Let's see you have I can't read it from here. You hear the rumor
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.680]   Thank you. I need glasses
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:21.960]   You hear the rumor about the new iPhone color this fall is it pumpkin spice?
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:26.760]   She's wearing a pumpkin on our t-shirt more of a coppery rose gold pumpkin spice
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:29.760]   rose gold pumpkin spice
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:36.400]   You don't even care about apple rumors do you know, but if I keep yelling maybe I'll get coffee
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:39.840]   And if t-shirt has changed
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:45.120]   Do you just a show of hands pumpkin spice yay or nay who likes pumpkin spice?
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:49.120]   I like coffee flavored coffee in a pump in a pumpkin pie. I like it in a pie
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:55.400]   Fabulous Wheaties baby coffee. I'm very I like craft dinner. You do like craft dinner. I do know that
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:51:00.280]   Regardless political article about Apple
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:03.480]   And its lobbying efforts in DC
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:08.720]   Is it true that Steve Jobs famously de stained DC?
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:13.880]   That's the same thing you cannot get rid of what you see has most of them
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:19.440]   But Tim Cook apparently thinks otherwise as does by the way every other tech company
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:24.280]   Which for a long time did disdain politics and then suddenly realized Google Facebook Apple?
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:30.200]   Oh my gosh, you know what happens in DC does affect us Apple is super interesting because like we talk about Apple
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.120]   Doing a bunch of charity now with Tim Cook, but Apple always did charity
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:38.160]   It's just Steve Jobs would never let them say anything about it because he believed it was unseemly that they that you know
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:43.040]   All that that's I did not know that yeah, no, they would he absolutely would not let them talk about it
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:47.120]   I love that massive amounts of charity and but now they believe that by doing it
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.960]   They can set an example and have other people do it
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:51.440]   So I mean like there's two sites that argument and the political one
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:56.040]   It's not seemly to get involved in politics, but it can be to a detriment of your company if you don't right?
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.040]   Yeah, those things that yeah
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:03.720]   Because they all need to pay off in Washington, so well and there are issues that
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:06.320]   besides the simply you know
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:12.000]   Pork barrel stuff there are issues that are important to all of us geeks things like encryption policy
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:19.560]   And apparently that's what Tim Cook talked about when he had a meeting with the Attorney General Eric Holder a couple of years ago
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:23.640]   Net neutrality
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:30.280]   There are lots of issues that represent that don't merely represent Apple's interest, but represent all our interests privacy
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:35.680]   And I don't think you have to even have to go that far because this is the currency of
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:41.000]   Operating a company at that level and if you decide that you do not want to have a president's and what a presence in Washington
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.580]   That's like saying I'm going to enter a gunfight without a gun in my hand right you don't have the option
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:51.240]   We're gonna take a break when we come back. I do want to talk a little bit about iOS 9 and it'll cap it on
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:55.360]   I'm like I love saying sounds look great when you say it that way
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:53:01.680]   You're like a local newscaster trying way to
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:10.080]   Go to call a movie channel to news our show today brought to you by Mac break weekly no no that's way
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:16.240]   But that's our show brought to you by gazelle now is the time we know new iPhones are coming new iPads
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:22.280]   Almost certainly coming maybe even new Apple TV now's the time to take your old gadgets and at least get a quote
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:27.680]   Because one of the nice things about gazelle is they is they lock those quotes in for 30 days?
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:35.200]   That means you have 30 days to decide if you want to sell your phone for the price quoted
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:40.440]   And I think that's a great idea because I could tell you one thing your iPhone is it gonna get more valuable
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:48.360]   After the announcement it's gonna get less go right now to gazelle.com get a free offer for your gadget and by the way
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:54.320]   Doesn't just have to be iPhones they buy a lot of stuff old Samsung phones blackberries even they buy
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:58.480]   Tablets from Samsung Windows surface tablets. They'll buy
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:02.840]   Nexus tablets and of course iPads as well one thing that's nice about gazelle
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.760]   They'll even buy broken iPhones and broken iPad
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:09.240]   So if you've got a broken one you won't be as much as you get for a fixed one
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:13.040]   But it's certainly better than nothing better than sticking in a drawer throwing it out
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:17.320]   gazelle.com once you decide to buy
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:22.760]   That new iPhone you can absolutely check out and they'll send you a box
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:29.640]   They pay the shipping on anything worth a buck or more and then you'll get a check a PayPal credit or an Amazon gift card
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:34.960]   And they bump the knowing that you know the Amazon gift card. Maybe some people say well, that's not as good as cash actually
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:41.360]   It's better. It's 5% value add on that nine out of every ten gazelle customers has had a great experience
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:46.320]   To more than two million trade-ins for a hundred seventy five million bucks paid out to customers
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:51.120]   It's a great service and now gazelle sells as well as buys
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:55.280]   They have a buy certified program
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:55:02.360]   That is fantastic. They have pre-owned devices. Some of them are as good as new you get to choose obviously
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:09.800]   Some of them are maybe a little bit not good as new slight signs of wear, but you're gonna save even more money
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:14.640]   You want an iPhone 6? That's gonna be a lot of money, but you can do it you select the carrier
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.600]   Or you can get an unlocked phone
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:20.520]   I'm gonna take an IT and T iPhone 6 and then you have a variety of choices
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:23.240]   You can say I want it to be excellent condition
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:31.040]   Cosmetically as if it's new good condition fair condition you get to choose the color and so forth and so on
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.040]   You're gonna get a great price and
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:39.280]   Every single device that gazelle sells goes through a 30-point quality inspection to make sure it's fully functional
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:43.960]   There are no scratches on the screen things like that and you have a very easy 30-day
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.680]   Return policy which makes it
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.480]   completely
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:53.920]   Safe to buy this way and they all of course include cables and charger and all the things that you would get if you bought it new I
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:56:00.000]   Am a very very happy gazelle customer. I know you will be to whether it's to buy or to sell
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.520]   Gaz
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:04.360]   Elle gazelle
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:08.000]   Dot com and don't put it off to get that quote in your old stuff
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.240]   You don't you know getting a quote is not a commitment from anybody except them
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:15.880]   They commit to to buy it at that price so you might as well get that quote right now gazelle
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:20.480]   Dot com now in pumpkin spice flavor
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:25.280]   Is it the case that we will get iOS 9
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:29.280]   When they have then when they when will we get an iOS 9?
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:33.560]   Maybe I should ask that's a gold master officially you get the gold master the day of the event and then it comes out
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:38.520]   Not this that Wednesday, but the Wednesday after two days before the new iPhones and you've been you that makes sense
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:42.560]   Yeah, the 16th. Yeah, you've been using the beta. I'm sure yeah
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:45.160]   What do you think is it ready?
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:52.000]   So they stopped putting out betas for about a month before the events they can put all their their muscle behind the gold
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.440]   Master release and that one is usually incredibly solid
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:58.400]   I've had no problems with the most recent beta has been working really well for me
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.560]   I did have to set my phone to America
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:03.480]   So I get all the new news services because it's not available in Canada yet
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:07.120]   So I get these things called miles now and I want directions is very confusing
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:12.960]   But other than that is working perfectly nice one of the things it's controversial in both El Capitan and
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:17.760]   iOS 9 is the Apple is going to allow content blocking in
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.520]   Safari
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:23.360]   And already a couple of companies have announced they're gonna put that out
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:27.840]   It'll be in them and they you could you you first turn it on the ability you turn on in the phone
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:29.760]   And then you have to download a third party
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:35.160]   It's what's like every extension so you download an app that's a container for that extension that extension doesn't
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:38.560]   Go on automatically you then have to go into settings Safari
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:43.720]   Content blockers and enable it and you can have several of them because content blockers aren't just ad blockers
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:46.400]   There are all sorts of things they can limit bandwidth if you're traveling
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.400]   They could have a list of known
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:52.000]   Virus sites to eliminate the ability for iframes to be buried into websites
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.600]   You could they could use things like change the font for accessibility reasons
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:58.400]   There's a whole bunch of really cool things they can do and you can have several of them
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:02.400]   So you go in and enable the ones that you want and then when you go back that once they're enabled
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:07.880]   They compile down to bytecode they start off as a JSON file that has a set of rules if you see this then do that
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.560]   That gets compiled to bytecode
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:15.440]   And then that's run when Safari renders a page and Apple wants to make it super efficient and super fast because often plugins are as
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:19.720]   Poorly performing and sometimes as creepy as what they're purport to block
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:23.480]   So I was preventing any of that because they make it all happen in advance
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:30.040]   Then once that runs you just get those rules almost like a filter actually exactly like a filter applied to the website and all you see
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.040]   Is the content that you've asked for?
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:36.640]   It's pretty cool and and that's the the the freaky part for a lot of people is that
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:39.560]   These these content blockers
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:47.120]   You know do we trust the company that's making them because that can be just as bad as you know not using anything
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:49.160]   so
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:54.560]   Like when he said it's it's all about getting the content that you want so you know this is a case where
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:58.960]   Like NFC and fingerprint reading where Apple
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.240]   May make the content blocker
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:08.520]   You know the big thing and everybody in advertising is terrified about this
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:14.240]   This may be a case where Apple promoting content blocking is a I'm calling it ad block lips
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:20.840]   No, I mean it's it's you got it. It had to happen. I mean we
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:24.760]   Oh, it's so horrible like like I keep I keep thinking about this
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:31.640]   This is like the battlefield in France and World War one at where it's everything's just been rendered down to mud and
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:34.920]   Ditches and no standing trees of any kind right because
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:40.760]   Gazzas as as users have become increasingly desperate to avoid ads and
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:45.400]   Advertisers have been increasingly desperate to make people see ads that they clearly don't want
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:48.080]   That's what has that's the result that has happened
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:52.640]   We have to have a great burning before things can grow on that land ever again
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:55.800]   And it's gonna be really really hard for a lot of people but
[00:59:55.800 --> 01:00:02.840]   The things are capable of growing in that new environment will come and over the next year expect a lot of trouble because
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:07.400]   It's not just people being evil about trying to get around ad blockers
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:10.720]   It's because here is exactly where all my money is coming from here
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:14.840]   Here is where the salaries of the people that I'm paying in my company are coming from they're coming from advertising
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:19.880]   So until we figure out how to live within these new rules if the rules allow us to get around the rules
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.480]   Then we will try to get around the rules while we try to figure out something brand new John
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:27.960]   What we can say in his Monday note is calling it kind of the end of the the world
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:32.520]   In fact he has a picture of buildings
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:38.040]   Well, I'll show you the Apple echo chain really because there's been ad blocking on desktop and has been ad blocking
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:42.920]   Although it's really hard on Android like you still have to root your device to get an ad blocker in and is now that it's coming
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:43.600]   iOS yeah
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.360]   I wonder if Google will ever really support ad blocking
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:51.700]   Yeah, because most of the ads being I mean by far most of the ads being blocked by these things are Google ad exchange
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.320]   Yeah, and there was a guy on Twitter today
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:58.680]   I think it's how to geek he's he's fighting back by if he detects a content block and he switches the typeface to comic songs
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:02.880]   That's a that's I kind of like that
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:09.320]   What is that how to geek calm? Yeah, I believe so I don't know if it's enabled or not yet
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:15.160]   But he was tweeting about it this morning. So let me just let me just go there and see if yeah, yeah, yeah, not yet
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:20.560]   not yet, but you know this is a great site that deserves everybody's support and
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:25.000]   I'd hate to see it go away because they can't make money because people block ads
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   Renee you wrote you know we talked about this on security now
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.840]   We're gonna talk about again in just a little bit on security now because Steve Gibson is going to talk about
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:38.360]   An ad blocker called you block origin. Yeah, and you had a great response to Steve
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.520]   I think you and he had a great dialogue. So tell us a little bit about that
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.520]   I think you wrote a piece an eye more. Yeah
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.440]   How is this affect mobile nations?
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.560]   So I mean originally my mobile nations was founded
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:54.280]   We've made most of our money off selling accessories because you just couldn't go to the mall and get a case for your trio
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:59.240]   Or your black area you really had to order them online and we had no ads on the sites for a long time
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:02.080]   But now every mall kiosk, you know everywhere
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:06.000]   There's iPhone cases and there's Android cases so that we make very little money on that anymore
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   so over time we transitioned to
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.560]   advertising and the problem with
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:15.440]   Advertising is that companies do not want to deal with a million small websites content is a commodity
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.440]   There's just so much of it. So there's companies like Google ad exchange
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:24.680]   There's another a couple other big ones and they basically handle all of those things and they assign these units and then the advertisers
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:26.640]   Basically, this is how much we want to run
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.560]   This is where we want them placed and those ads go into your system
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:34.840]   And then there's premium ads that run for a little while that are gorgeous really well designed and when those impressions go away
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:40.880]   What's called remnant ads take over and those are ads of lesser and lesser quality because having that space empty is inefficient
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.920]   And you don't control that in any way. No, we get a tag and that tag just inserts the ads and we set policies
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.820]   We say no autoplay audio no autoplay video not this and that but nobody
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:55.260]   Polices them Google doesn't have people sitting there and checking every ad so it's an honor system and companies do lie and say
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:03:00.120]   We don't have this we don't have that and then they do and we have to go and protest and we watch them try to find it
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:05.740]   And they have no idea because ads are regionalized and they appear differently for different people and it's very hard to find them
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:10.840]   And now there's there's clickjacking to where companies put in ads that try to cookie you for app stores or for
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:14.520]   Amazon referrals so they can get affiliate revenue off of it and Tandy's point
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.480]   It is a giant mess and ads right now
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:21.580]   Especially on mobile because you know ads went from magazine to online and they made less money online
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:24.480]   And now they've gone to mobile and people don't want to be shopping on mobile
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:30.040]   They want to they want to do what they want to do so they don't convert so people who are more desperate for attention and the ads get more
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:35.100]   Annoying so they don't serve the publisher. They don't serve the reader and I don't even know if they serve the ad exchange anymore to
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:43.200]   To Andy's analogy this we're just being forced to use gas masks as we enter the trenches these days
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.200]   That's all an ad-blacker is
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:49.440]   But I do worry because I think a lot of sites are gonna have to suffer
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:57.760]   Jim how about the loop in sight you guys I think you don't do Google ads or do you no no we don't do any
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:02.640]   Any ads like that we have one small ad on the sidebar of the site
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:10.520]   I'm not stunned through the deck and then we do sponsorship so so that does so this wouldn't have impact you really no not really
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:14.480]   Is that how people is that where people are gonna go?
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:21.280]   Well, I mean, you know people can try that but there's only so many of those available to you know
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.760]   it's gonna be interesting to see what happens because
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:30.800]   People will use the ad blockers and and like you said before ad blockers have been around Rennie said it
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:34.320]   but Apple is gonna make it pretty easy to use and
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:39.640]   You know people will just be able to turn it on. I think that they will like it and
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:45.080]   You know what companies do to advertise from that point on
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:52.160]   It's gonna be tricky. Yeah using myself as a guinea pig cuz we're gonna do this you block origin story next
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:57.320]   I put it on last week and the real problem with ad blockers is once you start using them
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:02.560]   It's hard to go back. I tested two of the iOS 9 ones and it makes Safari so fast
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:03.640]   I don't want to call anybody out
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:09.320]   But someone wrote an article about how slow mobile Safari is and I think this in part is Apple's response saying you guys are just
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:13.240]   Well as far as fast you're junking it up and we're gonna make it absolutely clear
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:18.640]   You know where the junk up is occurring and when you turn it on you see the people who are complaining about performance
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:23.400]   Are the people who are overloading it not just with ads but all sorts of other janky grab is it crystal?
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.640]   What's the
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:28.240]   Crystal is one of the well-known ones. That's gonna be one that people will go out and try
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.040]   That's a fairly binary one right now
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:34.280]   So you turn it on and it blocks it basically references a list of known ad providers and blocks them
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:38.200]   But there are a lot of other ones that I've been trying that that have all sorts of options because again
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:42.480]   Ad blocking is gonna be the biggest use of this but not the only ones like some of them might block
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:47.440]   Large downloads again like if you're traveling you could say I don't want to download anything that's over a megabyte
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.120]   And it'll just block out web fonts. It'll block out large images
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:54.480]   It'll block out videos and they'll save you bandwidth and there's gonna be a lot of creative uses for them
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:56.480]   Murphy apps
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.200]   Dean Murphy
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.600]   Has put this is he's crystal right?
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:06.480]   Yes, he's put some benchmarks up and remember he's trying to sell a product which will be available as soon as iOS 9 is
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:13.440]   But he shows for instance. I'm more going from a load time of 11 and point five seconds to 1.99 seconds
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.560]   Macworld even worse 16.72 to 3.4
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:21.760]   Seconds Kotaku you explained that Leo like you explained that with Steve really well
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:24.760]   It's because the ad people don't want to serve the same ad to the same person
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:27.560]   So they run trackers on multiple sites not just to be creepy
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.280]   But also because if you've seen it seven times
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:34.160]   They don't want to pay to show it to you for an eighth time and then all of those scripts because they don't know what other ads are there
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.240]   You could have nine ads all running the same script
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:42.040]   So you have nine versions of this big JavaScript running all in the same site at the same time is terribly inefficient people
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.240]   There's a lot of misunderstanding some ads are click to pay
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:51.680]   But most ads if you're a smart content company you do by impressions the you get paid for seeing
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:55.120]   The ad so people sometimes people say well, I don't click them
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:07:00.480]   So what does it matter? Well, it's not that's not how you get paid you get paid because people see this brand awareness
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:05.480]   They like Samsung wants you to see the Samsung name on all these websites and the other thing that's important about the content blockers
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.480]   That a lot of people don't know is that there's 64 bit only
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:09.520]   Technically they can run on 32 bit
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:15.440]   But Apple's only gonna release them for 60 for 50 because they get pre compiled and Apple the whole point of this is performance
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:18.440]   So Apple doesn't want to release them in a way that's gonna slow down performance
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:23.480]   So you've got to have an iPhone 5s iPad air iPad mini 2 or higher to run them
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:28.160]   Now another reason now some have accused including me Apple of being a little cynical on this because
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:31.200]   They don't get money for the ads that show up in Safari
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:35.040]   They do get money for I ads in apps and Apple is not blocking app ads
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.480]   They have they've done a lot to curtail ads and apps too
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.960]   Like they stopped you using UD IDs
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:42.040]   You can't universe like right now if you have two different if your company has two apps
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:46.440]   You have no way of knowing that the same person is running them because they prevent the developers from accessing
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:50.840]   That's interesting ID. They've done a lot to curtail like they don't let you track across ads
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.880]   If you look at each new release of iOS
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:56.800]   They've progressively clamped down on privacy inside of ads inside of apps as well
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:02.440]   There's also another thing about it that I was very pleased to see
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:08.080]   at WDC Apple come in favor of creating in at block ad blockers for
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.560]   Excuse me technology that would support ad blockers and iOS because
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:14.520]   When Tim Cook did his big comment about how well
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:18.200]   There are the we believe that other companies are trying to exploit your personal information
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:23.680]   We don't we don't we're not in that business and we don't care about that and the thing is given how much traffic is being consumed on
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:29.560]   iOS devices and given how much how I think Google is just a fraction of the danger that
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:33.360]   The people are exposed to when I run ghostry on every single browser
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:40.760]   I have and every time I hit a site and I see it just blocked 18 different ad trackers making profiles of me that unlike Google
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.200]   They're willing to sell my personal information individuals. They're willing to sell
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:48.320]   It's all a bogus profile of me that might prevent me from getting a job
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:54.240]   It was between three different people and there's an accompanying uses one of these services to say tell me everything that you think you know about
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.840]   Andy and Opco that could that could mean that I don't get a loan or I don't get a job or whatever
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:03.880]   So for them for Apple to be talking about this but not give people a way to avoid
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:06.840]   Companies that are not Google that are stealing your information
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:11.600]   Seemed like it wasn't it wasn't at best an incomplete thoughts. I'm really glad to see it
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:17.160]   So it's not it's not just about not wanting to see ads. It really is about wanting to protect your existence
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:22.200]   Online and that's why it's absolutely necessary. I mean I'm doing and it's tough too
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:27.160]   You really have to make that conscious choice as a developer. I'm developing a brand new blog and
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:32.440]   One of my goals is to make sure that there aren't really trackers and stuff like that on there
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:38.600]   And every time I want to add something to it's a WordPress install and every time I want to add something that adds a really cool feature
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.600]   I'll find out that oh, there's a reason why this plugin is so cheap
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:46.000]   It's because it installs it adds two or three new trackers every time I embed something from Flickr
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.120]   Which is what I like to do it will adds a tracker to it. I don't think I can get around
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:56.200]   But the solutions are going to be people are just going to try to avoid them if they don't if you're creating an experience
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:59.400]   They don't want that's why I'm so inspired by stuff like the loop
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:04.680]   I'm so inspired by during fireball and other sites that if you are a smaller sort of
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:12.360]   Shop you can simply say we're going to find a way to get advertising and sponsorships that doesn't damage the experience for readers
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:16.520]   It doesn't affect load times. It doesn't affect their security and their privacy
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.000]   It's not for everybody
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.040]   But as Jeff as noted scientist Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park, you know life finds a way
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:28.400]   On the other hand, you know, I mean not daring fireball and looper small operation
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:32.200]   I doubt you could I'm more with two ads on the page right
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:40.520]   You know the loop I don't have the overhead that that a lot of these companies have so
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:48.960]   It makes it a lot easier for me to have a much simpler business model and I I like that
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:52.720]   You know, it's it's easy to run a business like that
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:58.360]   But you know when you start getting into some of the bigger sites, you know, you look at at scene editor
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.960]   You look at I'm more
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:07.120]   You know that it's a lot of overhead a lot of employees, you know, there there has to be a way for these companies
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:10.400]   To make money there has to be a way for Renee to
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:13.160]   To pay his writers
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:18.360]   Or else, you know, it's it's going to be Renee every day trying to pump out a hundred stories
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:24.040]   And you know that that kind of stuff just isn't feasible and I think users want an I'm more
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:29.920]   Of course they want the loop they want an I'm more and and I think that the majority of you
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:31.040]   users
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.040]   Don't mind
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.120]   Seeing a few ads they don't mind
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:43.880]   You know buying things from from advertisers on a site like I'm more what they do mind is
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:48.720]   You know that the years of abuse that a lot of sites have put into
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:54.960]   These advertising and the advertising networks that have tried to take advantage of that and you know
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:12:00.920]   You remember years ago Leo and I'm sure that Andy and and Renee remember this to where you would see those
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:03.400]   Monkey ads and stuff
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:09.240]   Monkey, thank God those are gone, right? You know, you would see all that and that was just that was just pure abuse
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:14.320]   by people pop ups pop under's, you know, and
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:20.920]   That was abuse and that's what people are tired of I think if you talk to a normal person and said
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:24.760]   You know, would you mind supporting I'm or or the loop?
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:32.160]   They would say no, of course not. We don't mind at all, but if you show, you know crazy ads, you know
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:34.160]   Blinken all the time, you know
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:42.200]   Then there no I don't want that and you know, I've gone to sites where I tried reading a story and had to scroll
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:48.560]   Just so that I could block the ads that were you know blinking going crazy in my in my eyes
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:55.120]   And that's what people don't want I don't want that we've been through this before all browsers include pop-up blockers
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.880]   And they have for years the reason
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:02.240]   pop up ads and pop under ads which were even more offensive
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:06.000]   So this is not new but blocking all ads really
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.680]   Causes some concern and by the way, it doesn't in many cases won't just block ads
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:16.760]   I don't know what crystal will do but you know you and I Jim both have Google analytics on our site
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:21.880]   So we know how many people visited. Yeah, those will be blocked as well in many cases that's another issue
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:26.000]   I mean whether you're small or large. It's not just about targeting ads to people
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.160]   It's I want to know when are people visiting my site? So I'll time things correctly
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:32.680]   I also want to know that if I put up a blog post about this
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:37.360]   Pizza that I made of this thing called this big sheet of battleship steel
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:40.840]   I've got in my oven and suddenly that's got that got three times the amount of
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:45.760]   Attention that anything else I've did well guess what maybe I'll be feel like if people want to see more stuff like that
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:46.760]   I'll make more stuff like that
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:53.440]   So it's gonna be a really complicated thing as we find out if this really does become something that everybody wants to have on their systems
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:56.680]   Again, we're gonna have there's gonna be some adjustments. They're gonna be made
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:01.160]   I think that it's it really is going to be the sort of thing where you have to
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:08.160]   Show your love for the content that you're the sites that you're visiting either by because it's a little mom and pop
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:13.480]   Sort of shop and you realize that if if Jim has a sponsorship inside his site
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:18.320]   By reading that and maybe even considering using that sponsor
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:23.720]   You are helping this site and helping your good friend Jim that you really whose work you really really like and the people he also
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:30.340]   Host on that site or a New York Times sort of thing where the the body of content being delivered is so good that
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:35.520]   I'm willing to spend ten bucks ten bucks a month in order to do it and I'm sure that there's gonna be third and fourth and fifth
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:40.200]   Solutions that are gonna come up from this as I said, it's a it's a it's a
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:45.460]   Battle has been a long time coming and we don't know what the landscape is gonna be like next year, but it has to happen
[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:49.640]   What are you guys doing at mobile nations Renee? What is are you worried?
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:55.160]   Well, I mean like we have to consider anything that happens in the future and I'm lucky that I work at a toil
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:58.640]   We have a separate team that does ads because you don't have to worry about this. Yeah, I mean like
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.600]   Yeah, exactly like to get paid at the end of the month
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:08.360]   Yeah, but we have a whole team of people who are working on this as hard as they possibly can like I put in the chatroom
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:12.360]   We have a new template now that takes off a lot of the ads and it means we don't earn as much revenue
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:16.640]   But we've we've made a conscious choice that we want to be able to offer that kind of service
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:21.360]   And maybe we won't be able to do everything or hire everyone that we would otherwise be able to do or hire
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:25.840]   But the other thing is that if someone goes to a terrible site
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:30.640]   Any site is now at the mercy of the worst site because you're gonna go to a site that's horrible
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:33.000]   And some of them will let you block just one site
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.840]   But some people might just turn it on and never turn it off again
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:40.280]   And then it doesn't matter how good your or bad your ads are you're just gonna be caught up in this
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:43.040]   Yeah, we could talk every ad blocker says allow this site
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:47.440]   We could talk about that but the tyranny of the fault is if you once you insta I
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:53.400]   Look, I I'm very conscious and aware of this and I turned on you block origin
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:57.480]   I don't ever want to turn it off ever ever ever and it's not just us if you can't give off
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.900]   For example recently like variety was almost unusable had an invisible
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:02.720]   Yeah, I thought that I couldn't tap a link
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:07.640]   I didn't know why yeah in the corner because there was a pop-up that didn't let me move the X by the way
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:12.080]   That's what really annoys me sometimes it's there sometimes there because they don't want you to they want you
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:15.960]   But now that's what the other thing that happens that you know, we've had this escalation
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:20.880]   Well, the next thing is they go underground they do native content or they do super cookies with ISP
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.880]   Yeah, they're gonna start doing now. I have to tell you
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:26.280]   For a
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:29.280]   It doesn't affect me. It's good for me in fact if all of you guys
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:33.940]   Went out of business to be good for me because you can't block her as you can fast forward through him
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:35.880]   But you can't block it yet Leo. It's coming up
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:42.560]   Safari listener is but notice I'm fighting because I really do feel like we want we want to support good content
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:47.760]   And I want people like Renee and Jim and Andy to get a paychecks so
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:50.280]   We got to find a way to do this
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:55.120]   Maybe there is a humane way to have advertising but people seem like they really not like advertising
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:59.000]   That's the truth, but they also I can tell you what else they don't like they don't like to pay for content either
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:03.560]   But there's there's so many layers to the that's just part of the problem, too
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:07.640]   I was a there's a couple sites that have really good long-form content
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:10.920]   And I'm reading it and I'm enjoying it, but it will not this this site
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:18.040]   It will not allow me to get my brain to lock into this content and focus on it because as soon as I start scrolling
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:20.800]   I might get a pop-up saying oh, but if you like this here's a
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:25.160]   And then the worst thing is that now I'm down to like the last 300 words
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:28.720]   And suddenly there's another slide in saying once you're done with this here for other articles
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:34.040]   For you to read and I guess it's not it may not be an advertisement, but it is an advertisement no no no no
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:39.400]   But top content stuff that's an ad boy. That's not not not that well not in the
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:43.280]   How we're talking about in this conversation. Okay, I'm talking about is the penalty part of that
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:49.720]   I my eyes cannot avoid going like this and seeing this and now you've taken me out of the flow and the rhythm of this what this
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:54.720]   Wonderful writer and editor worked together to create this sensation in my brain that you decided to shatter
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:00.520]   Because you were not content with the idea that handy is reading this and thinking good things about my site
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.520]   There must be a way we can disrupt that
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:05.520]   Right click Andy get a second click
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:11.760]   People sometimes say I pay for content and everybody does pay probably for some content
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:15.160]   I buy consumer reports the Wall Street Journal Ben Thompson's trajectory
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:21.520]   The information Jessica lessons there are content I'll pay for but that's a handful of things
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:24.920]   And then you don't get the broad diversity the ecosystem we have right now of
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:32.240]   Websites and do you really want to concentrate all the power in in a few hands? That's not a good idea either
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:37.720]   The people that can get you pay it's like unbundling Leo. Everyone says they want to be able to buy all the cartel
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:39.720]   Right, but when you realize every channel cost $10
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.280]   You have much less much for you
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:45.040]   We're a nickel maybe micro payments will finally get solved. Maybe that's a way to do it
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:50.600]   I don't my experience is that you know because for the first two years I said to it will not have ads and
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:58.920]   We asked people to donate 1% donated. Yeah, I was only I said, you know any amount you want two dollars a month to be nice 1%
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:03.960]   Macworld tried ours technica tried. I mean there's been a lot of don't want to be I think we know that already
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:05.280]   Yeah, and it's not nearly
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:09.480]   I mean like you like a traditional magazine you would start reading through it and then your article get interrupted with an ad
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:15.400]   You'd have to go to page 325 to read the end of it and the marketing company behind the magazine would sell all your information
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:21.240]   To people who would send you pamphlets for vacations and hotels and I think we might as well accept the fact that the current model is going
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:22.240]   to end
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:26.440]   That apple is going to be the last nail on the coffin the content blocking on safari
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:28.440]   By the way, they're doing it on desktop - right?
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:29.960]   Yeah, so it's the same API
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:34.640]   It's content blockers for el kaptan and iOS 9 and they worked as they used it
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.880]   They've had it for a long time in on the Mac
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:40.520]   But it was a plug-in and it ran in real time and the plug-in could track you
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:44.920]   So now it's the same as iOS where it's pre-compiled
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:50.560]   It has no knowledge of what you're doing because the nice thing about this is that they made sure that the content blockers are private and secure
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:53.400]   So that no one can use a content blocker to spy on you because people do
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:20:00.960]   We'll see something something big is happening. What about what Google did? Did you see that that the I don't really understand it?
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:02.200]   Maybe you do
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:08.640]   somebody Renee Jim Google no, I love contributor. I think this is a good idea Google apparently
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:12.280]   Gave out some code that will bypass
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:15.320]   App transport security is that two-pops?
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:21.120]   It's yeah, so app transport security is is a is one of the new features in iOS 9 and el kaptan
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:23.880]   And it's a forward-looking feature it wants to promote best practices
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:29.840]   So it wants to make sure that if you're communicating between an app and an online service that you're using TLS 1.2
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:35.440]   And that you're using shot 256 or better when better versions come it's gonna encourage you to use those better versions
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:38.280]   And the problem is that people often have websites for example
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:45.200]   They can use SSL or can't sorry can use HTTPS, but the ads can't and Google solution initially was to tell them just to turn it off
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:50.680]   Nick Arnott who writes security for iMoral did a blog post on this at WWDC time
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:58.320]   And he presented a bunch of strategies and what you can do is serve your web page securely and just leave tunnels for the ads that operate outside of it
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:01.760]   Yes, and that's actually what we do. Yeah, that's a much better practice
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:04.320]   Yeah, Google was criticized for not providing that as an option
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:09.120]   They kind of appeal although I should point out Apple provided the Google option first it's in their iOS
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:14.560]   Developer library under app transport security technology. It's one of several steps that you can use if they don't work
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:17.280]   Right, right the nuclear option right right yeah
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:21.520]   No, we that's exactly we do because we have an HTTPS page, but it
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:24.600]   Anyway, I don't need to get into this. Let's cheer up
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:29.840]   I feel like we need to cheer up and since Andy next week you are going to be seeing Colbert
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:37.200]   In person as the brand new show. I thought we just pass along these Colbert tips for using ways better
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:41.040]   They're here about to go for a drive with the help of my ways app
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:47.840]   Ways the app you should look at while driving I can even change the settings to get directions from a voice
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:51.440]   What am I getting here? Is this I'm sorry even Colbert there we go. You're ready
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:56.400]   I am I thought somebody took over my computer. I am to me. Let's go to work
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:03.040]   And we're off feel free to bring some of the hood of my car
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.880]   Keep left good idea. I'll just put my turn signal on and to save time
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:11.040]   I will leave it on for the rest of the drive
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:22.000]   I love ways. I use it wherever I go post office tattoo parlor bank tattoo parlor liquor store tattoo removal clinic
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.560]   heavy traffic reported ahead
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:27.600]   Traffic my least favorite kind of jam
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:32.400]   Followed by apricot and tow. I guess I'd better reroute
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:40.320]   Let's have some fun and mix things up changing route turn left buckle your hood belts
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:49.520]   Is there any chance that we're going to get a Colbert voice on ways at some point because of this? I would love that
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:51.680]   I would use it. Yeah
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:53.680]   You see this is lineups like
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:58.480]   They also released the the guest for the next week too. He's having a supreme supreme court justice on
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:03.600]   More authors more that's like my god that the level of discourse. He's aiming for it
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.960]   He's definitely not chasing after the Jimmy Fallon audience. That's for sure
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:09.040]   But he's got but he's got um
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:16.320]   He's got cred, you know, I think he's got a lot of respect from a lot of people so and you can make anyone entertaining like he's enough by himself
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:20.480]   Well, but what's interesting is this going to be the Colbert of the Colbert report? No, it's going to be
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:22.800]   These steve is he going to use Colbert?
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:26.160]   Wait a minute does say you can't get steve Colbert's voice on ways
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.960]   Yep, this was an ad
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:32.400]   Like it. I'm gonna have to figure out how to do that. I want ozzy
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:38.880]   There I had and I think I had an ozzy voice on my tom tom
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:41.600]   Sherrod which why should I go no?
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:44.080]   Oh
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:46.080]   That's what I want
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:49.280]   That call seems to be inside a swimming pool
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:52.880]   Sherrod
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:54.880]   On the left
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.720]   That shared me after add block opalips
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:05.520]   Uh malware infecting jailbreak and iphones if yours don't jailbreak you knit with
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:09.200]   Right, I'll leave your door open if you can't protect your house. Yeah, netwit
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:13.760]   There's a reason why apple locks up the phone. It's not to prevent you from having fun
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:18.720]   Hey, are we worried uh about uh
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:24.640]   This the uh one of the one of the executives who was behind Ian rogers who was behind beats
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:29.440]   Leaving apple and in fact leaving the music industry entirely
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.760]   Um
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:38.080]   Is that does that mean anything or is that just somebody moving on? I don't think it means anything to be honest
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:43.360]   Okay, you're the music guy. I'm gonna listen to you. Have you come back to apple music? Good jim
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:49.120]   Um, I have been working with it. I've also been trying out a lot of other
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:54.240]   Music services. Uh, I've looked at title
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:57.120]   Desar
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:59.120]   Google music
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:07.360]   Rhapsody all kinds of things you leave spotify out of there for a reason or had you already know spotify as well. Yeah, um, rdo
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:14.480]   Um, I heart radio. There's a lot out there. Isn't there? Oh, yeah, there's a ton of music services out there
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:17.920]   Uh, so yeah, I've been trying a little bit of everything but
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:23.920]   Uh, the fact that I couldn't get apple and music to work properly really kind of upset me
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:26.560]   So I wanted to turn that back on
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:30.880]   And just kind of try and figure out why I couldn't get it to work. So
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:37.360]   Uh final note before we go to our tips and picks of the uh, week james l flanigan
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:44.880]   A name not widely known. I think among modern computer users, but you ought to he was the guy who taught computers to
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:49.200]   Speak at uh bell labs in the 1970s
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:55.360]   If you use siri, uh, you can thank uh, mr. flanigan passed away at the age of 89
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:26:03.520]   0.9. He was he was the day before his 98th birthday, but he he was a pioneer in um, acoustics
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:07.360]   He created the technical foundation not only for speech recognition
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:10.320]   But for mp3's for teleconferencing
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:14.000]   For the digital transmission of human conversation
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.720]   unfortunately the article that uh
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.040]   Uh launched this computers that talk and listen man made
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:28.560]   Man machine communication by voice from 1976 is behind a paywall of the i triple e gosh darn you. It's like 30 bucks
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:32.320]   Um, and I I really would love to read this and you know
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:37.920]   1976 i triple e you could probably release this article now. I see paywalls. Nobody likes it
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:44.000]   Uh, but anyway, uh, I just wanted to mention this he created he patented the artificial human larynx
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:48.800]   He patented a typewriter activated by a push button phone tones
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:51.680]   Uh, that was for a deaf people
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:55.200]   Um, uh, he also was on the committee
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:58.640]   That uh was listened to the watergate tapes
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:04.880]   And judged that uh that 18 and a half minutes had intentionally been erased from those tapes
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:07.040]   Um
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:10.400]   Back in 1974 leading to the resignation of richard nixon
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:14.400]   So, uh, just a note, uh sad passing
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:17.040]   Uh james l flanigan
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:21.280]   Important computer scientists. I want to I always want to recognize these guys because uh, you know, I think
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:26.560]   I'm a younger people think this all just sprung out of nowhere like
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.880]   Zeus's head
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:30.400]   Uh, no
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:32.400]   You're as tall as
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:36.880]   Hey, we I just I love this panel. I just want this show to go on and on and on and on

[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:24.800]   Digital's it
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.520]   Renee gdc has the top selling
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:31.120]   Album the second top selling album of all time

[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:48.800]   That's kind of sad. I love michael jackson, but that's killer

[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:59.520]   Packbell park. I'm sorry 18 deep bark. Yeah, i'll be there nice
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:08.560]   Mr. Renee richy from imore.com, which will thrive in this modern ad free era somehow
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:11.200]   interesting times lee interesting time. Yeah
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:18.160]   It's actually one of the reasons we do twit the way we do it. I tried other models and I really I like the I
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:22.880]   I've always worked in ad supported free media. I like that because it means everybody can listen
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:26.960]   Without a barrier means you have to sell ads, which is a pain
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:34.240]   Um, but if you I think if you do it judiciously with an eye towards the user and that's what we've always tried to do
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:38.480]   You know trying to try to give people something that's not offensive
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:44.960]   Uh products that we use uh products that they might like we don't have to track people because it's such a narrow niche
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:48.720]   I don't need to know anything about you. I know you're a dreamlios
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:53.520]   Hopefully we'll get bought by disney and our content will be used to entertain people while they're waiting in line for rides
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:56.000]   Thank you. Wouldn't that be nice
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:01.120]   Wouldn't that be nice by the way, um this I you know I said
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:04.240]   I I knew I was gonna get the new iphone
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:08.880]   Uh in a couple of weeks. I'm very excited about it. I think I'm gonna get the big one we talked about last week
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:10.960]   And then today
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:14.560]   Uh, they announced that there's an android where to uh app for iphone
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:18.080]   I've already sent my iphone to my son. So I can't try it. I even have the right watch
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:20.640]   You're getting rules gold right leo
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:22.080]   Uh, yes
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.120]   Yes
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:25.600]   Because i like pink phones. I cannot lie
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:28.160]   It's the only acceptable color this
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:33.200]   Everybody's gonna want it. That means I probably won't be able to get it even if I get up at 3am
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:37.600]   I'm a thought leader and a brand influence. Yeah, you are you are
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:42.080]   Best there was best there ever will bandie and echo from the chicago ton times
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:44.880]   And for and for the record like rene
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:48.560]   If if what's required to keep peter and serenity on staff is for me to
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:53.600]   Click on that one simple trick to refinance my home that warren buffet is telling me about
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:56.240]   I will frickin do that because I'm more so good
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:01.200]   But see that's the beauty of it. I don't do you do a cost per click or you probably do still do cpm
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:02.560]   I don't know
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:05.760]   Uh, it's because you don't have to deal with that. You shouldn't know that you shouldn't know that. Yeah
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:09.440]   Um, but but you sit there quick and on them anyway
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:11.440]   Click anyway
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:13.600]   It's click no don't that's click fraud
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:18.240]   Um and if if a java pop-up comes on just go ahead and install it
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:21.280]   What could possibly go wrong
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:23.920]   uh, I personally, um
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:26.480]   Would pay for i'm more?
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:31.360]   Absolutely. Thank you and as you as you know, I do pay for sites the problem is I want to see a lot of
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:36.000]   I pay for the new york times. I pay for the new yorker. There's apple news and iOS 9 leo and they're gonna
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.560]   That's what worries me for you to monetize
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:41.440]   Right. That's what worries me. This pushes people toward
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:44.080]   a strategy that pays apple
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.880]   And uh, I don't know if that's you can use your own like
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:52.000]   So I adds is an option for people who don't have their own advertising. So you could use there are other uh mobile ad network
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.920]   Believe you have yeah, I believe you can set it
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:57.440]   It's not like they haven't released that yet. So like the whole bunch of stuff is still coming
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:01.280]   But I believe that they say at least the documentation that it's your choice what you use. Yeah
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.400]   Yeah
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:06.880]   Also, it's easy to get promoted by by apple my my anacos.com blog is
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:11.520]   Has been accepted into the news app try to get promoted by facebook into the newsfeed
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:16.320]   That's where they need they want they're only going to do the big huge partnerships with huge media mobile to do that
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:21.920]   I should point out we do pay for imore.com right now the way we pay is by seeing those ads
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:24.080]   Attention and data
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:29.440]   That you pay with attention. I would also pay for i'm more. Yeah, thank you. I pay for the loop
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:34.960]   I would too, but see that there comes a point where you go. I can't pay for one more thing. Yeah
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:36.880]   Yeah, no, it's true
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.960]   But then at that point you have to make a decision
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:45.120]   Uh, do I drop something do I want this bad enough and you know or do I want those ads and for me
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:48.800]   You know, if if Renee came out tomorrow and said okay, i'm more
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:51.520]   Is going to do this
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:53.840]   You know, five dollars a month or whatever it is
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:56.320]   And we need everybody to pay
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.400]   I would pay
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:03.840]   Yeah, especially if if my attention were called to it by simply saying that you get 10 free articles a month
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:08.960]   Guess what you've just read your eighth here is here is a click this button and watch it post it
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:11.120]   Really painlessly. Yeah, it's all your times does that
[01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:13.600]   Yeah, that's not a bad way to do it
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:16.800]   That's what converted me to be a new your time subscriber that I cut
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:20.400]   It was it wasn't just odd. I stopped thinking. Oh damn it
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.960]   I'm ended my free articles and I started thinking oh damn it
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:25.520]   I don't get to read any more of this great content better isn't it?
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:30.080]   So when I go to the financial times and I can't read anything or I just like I did go to the IEEE
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:34.240]   Journal and I can't read anything that is not an inviting experience
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:38.880]   That doesn't that's not a you got a sample first right before you get 10 bucks a month out of it
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:41.920]   We just hope that Elon must apply as I said people have something to read on their way to Mars
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.240]   I mean, that's well, that's another by the way
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:50.000]   I hate to say it but that's another not so nice trend that could come out of this look Jeff Bezos has bought the washing and post
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.480]   Uh, even though it's there's no no reason to believe that print newspapers have any
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:57.040]   business model at all in the future
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:58.720]   Uh
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:02.800]   Chris Hughes bought the new republic you start to see these rich guys by
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:06.720]   Newspapers and you have to think it's not for the profit
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:13.120]   It's for a pulpit and now you're gonna pretty soon. You're gonna only have we're going back to the days
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:20.560]   Uh of the plutocracy of the people only the rich man could could own a media outlet and that's not what you want
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:23.200]   That's that's why we need to support Renee
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:25.440]   That's right
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:30.320]   No, it's fundamentally free ad supported media is fundamentally democratic and I don't think people
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:33.440]   I think people won't appreciate that till it's gone and I hope it's not
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:35.840]   I agree
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:37.840]   Our show today brought to you by
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:40.480]   Oh, I love smart things

[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:50.080]   It's a great way to turn your home into a smart home if you've dabbled with home automation in the past
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:53.920]   You know the issue really is that each device has its own app
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:35:02.320]   And its own protocol. There's no way to talk to everything smart things really pioneered this concept of having a central hub that controls everything
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:10.240]   One app on your iPhone on your android device on your windows phone that can control your lights your locks your security your honey

[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:26.480]   We use smart things at home to control everything and now that I could talk to my uh echo and say turn the lights on
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:29.200]   Turn the heat down. It's so cool

[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:08.000]   smartthings.com
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.600]   Slash mac break andy and not co your pick of the week my friend
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:18.000]   My pick of the week is kind of enough. This is more of an Alex pick almost literally. Uh, this is the dx01
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.400]   camera
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:23.920]   And what a weird looking camera you say and yes it is weird looking you
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:28.400]   Pull down the lens cover and you can aim it at stuff and take pictures
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:32.000]   And this is the only display that you get and hey look at that
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:37.200]   I've just taken a 20 megapixel picture that's stored on a little a little micro SD card
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:40.560]   but you push the thing down a little bit more and
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:43.120]   Oops. Yeah
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:47.920]   And a lightning connector appears and now you plug it into your iphone
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:51.040]   And just like that
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:57.360]   Suddenly you have your iphone is now the viewfinder and user interface for this entire camera
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:01.840]   Uh, now the cool stuff about it is that this is a
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:09.360]   It's a 20 megapixel camera has a like real four real one inch sensor back. So the backside illuminated max aperture of 1.8
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:15.760]   Uh, it will absolutely kick the butt of whatever this built-in camera is going to take also again
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:20.240]   It shoots a raw it actually writes a dng files in addition to a jpeg
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:24.320]   So if if they're blown highlights as soon as you get into
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:29.600]   Uh, the photos app or anything else you can easily push some sliders around and get those highlights back
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:33.600]   Change the color change all these edits you can't really do with a jpeg
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:38.160]   Uh, and the resolution is again 20 megapixels instead of eight or 12 as what's going to come
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:41.280]   So you have a lot more control over cropping and stuff like that
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:43.600]   Uh, it does do video as well
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:47.920]   Uh, and also if you of course put it around backwards it becomes a selfie camera
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:53.600]   And so now you can you know take really high megapixel selfies of yourself with this thing
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:38:00.560]   Um, so the ouch factor of it is that it costs $599
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:02.080]   Uh
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:07.200]   It is but it's it's their dx. I was going for a really specific sort of audience
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:12.080]   They're certainly not going for someone who wants to buy an iphone accessory to take to take better pictures
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:16.080]   It's for people who already have a $1200 or $2,000
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:20.480]   S l r but they want something that will also take good pictures when they're not carrying a
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:26.160]   Uh, a camera around and this is so small and because there's so little power drain on the actual battery itself
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:29.440]   You can the one charge will last kind of forever
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:34.000]   So you can just basically put this in your pocket as part of your daily carry along with your keys
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:39.360]   Uh, and it will again it will allow you to take the sort of pictures you absolutely can't take with any sort of a phone
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:45.360]   Also, it doesn't just work with the iphone six plus it'll work with any iphone that has lightning it'll work with it
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:48.080]   It'll work with ipads. It'll work with pretty much anything like that
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:52.160]   So they're going for people who want to have the ability to take really really good pictures
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:56.720]   No matter where they are even if they just went out with the phone and also with the added advantage
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:01.520]   On that that's amazing. Yeah, and i'll say again. It's like this is the idea sample photo
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:06.480]   Yeah, I have I haven't taken my usual like walk to take pictures of squirrels and inside the
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:09.440]   Uh, boss public labry at this happening on thursday
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:14.480]   But already i've been doing side-by-side pictures between the normal camera and this one and you can definitely see
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:20.320]   The the iphone the iphone camera is never anything less than good, but it really shows the difference between
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:25.200]   A real camera and something that was built to accommodate all this trade-offs
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:31.280]   You have to have when you put a camera inside a phone. So definitely not something that everybody is going to appeal to
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:34.480]   uh, but for people who like me who
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:41.120]   Often regret not having a real camera with them and saying okay. Well, this snapshot was a very nice
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:46.000]   approximation of what I was seeing uh, this will really uh, this this is going to appeal to those people
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.400]   Particularly if you're taking pictures in low light
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:51.440]   Beautiful sunlight in the beach
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:55.120]   Almost any camera can take a good picture there, but what if you're indoors somewhere?
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:40:00.320]   Uh very few phone cameras will do that and certainly the iphone can't do that, but this will handle that nicely
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:06.320]   So, uh, the other bonus is that it does come with uh, dxo has a suite of standalone apps and filters
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:13.840]   They've been selling for a while that have really good professional raw processing and photo enhancement that are nearly cost two or three hundred bucks
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:18.320]   Of in and of themselves and for at least for a limited time if you buy the dxo one camera
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:24.720]   You will get that suite of apps for absolutely nice. Oh, and so is great. I mean these are the guys I go to for lens reviews
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:30.960]   They really know their indexes are they and they did apply a lot of that knowledge towards the design of this camera
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:35.120]   Because there's a lot of it's not just the sensor. There's also it's also the image processor that's built into it
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:38.080]   Are you wearing the lightning? Um connector breaking off
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:44.080]   No, and I did ask them specifically about this. This is a med made for iphone certified product
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:50.800]   Uh, so this is not something they just decided to what to to whack up and then take their chances with so apple has signed off on
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:56.080]   This being mounted on the side of an iphone and it will not break the iphone when you do that
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:01.200]   I'm more worried about breaking the camera at this point. Well, I mean I have I haven't I haven't tried to break it
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:06.080]   But if you felt this in your hand, I mean, it's pretty solid. It's not it feels like it's made out of metal
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:11.360]   It doesn't feel like it's made out of plastic of this. So a lot of this is a is I'm not even sure what these those remain
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:16.960]   I know maybe it's a beats sort of headphones designed for this put some lead weights in it to make it feel more feel more solid for you
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:19.920]   Uh, but it is a little bit awkward to hold certainly
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:27.040]   But uh, you can pivot it as your as you're aiming things on the phone and you kind of get used to it and it becomes really good
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:31.920]   And of course the the last thing I didn't even talk about was that the thing you can't do with your slr
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:35.440]   Where they can do with this is that you take a picture and then instantly put it on facebook
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:37.840]   Take a video and instantly do something with it
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:42.560]   If I were going to the apple event next week, this is exactly the sort of camera
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:46.720]   I want with me like at the to be posting stuff to twitter and posting stuff to my
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:50.640]   To the sun times and stuff as almost as soon as I take this sort of stuff
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:53.520]   Uh, so I it just underscores why I love
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:56.800]   That cameras have not become homogenous yet
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:01.440]   Uh, it's not like you just like phones are pretty much kind of one design and laptops or one design
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:07.360]   People keep coming up with different ways of making a camera that's not perfect for everybody but exactly what certain people are going to want
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:11.360]   I think this is very intriguing one inch sensor. So it's much better than most point and shoots
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:15.920]   It's comparable with a high end point and shoots from sony and fuji and exactly there
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:19.520]   They're sort of they're sort of targeting the people who again people who have a nice
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:24.880]   $2,000 like mirrorless compact but also have a s like an irks 100 like a six hundred seven
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:29.760]   Air dog pocket camera for something who when they don't want to have something slung around their necks
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:31.760]   They want to have something in a jacket pocket
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:35.760]   Uh, and it takes pictures that as far as I can tell so far again jury is still out
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:43.520]   It definitely earns the they they they again they took a lot of guts on the box. It says professional quality camera
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:46.400]   And I think they're really dx. Oh
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:52.640]   Really want me to think of it as a proff- okay, you you said it so i'll try to think of it as a professional quality
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:57.440]   Uh, and so it's it hasn't been disappointed me yet, but then again, I haven't really tried to make it cry yet
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:02.320]   600 bucks, but it does include $300 worth of dxos software, which is
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:09.760]   Christ i've cameras and it's it's great. Is it you have one too? Oh good. I do. Yeah, I've ordered it
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:12.320]   There's more and more reasons for me to go back to the iphone
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:16.000]   I'm and I can't wait to see what this and iphone six s they're gonna get me
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.040]   I think you know
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:20.720]   I'll tell you the most interesting thing and i'll have these next week my hearing aids
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:27.120]   I've ordered hearing aids and uh and the kind that it got from starchy the halos work with
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:33.120]   Uh iphone particularly well they have an android app, but you can listen anything on your iphone
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:37.120]   Which molly wad who has usher syndrome. She has a molly wad blog
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:42.800]   She was talking about having the iphone and the apple watch with the new hearing aids. Yeah, the watch was transformative for her
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:47.600]   Yeah, my my hearing's not that bad, but uh, I thought it might be gonna be be proactive
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:53.920]   Say what and hearing and so like the ability to have both the accessibility things is really beneficial. Yeah. Yeah
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:57.120]   Yeah, we don't talk about it the accessibility features of the apple watch enough
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:02.320]   I have a friend is blind uses it as a talking watch and he loves it and even just apple pay
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:05.040]   Stephen Aquino who does something accessibility writing for us
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:09.040]   He has partial paralysis and he said it's very difficult to even get a wallet or a phone out of his pocket
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:14.480]   So just to be able to put the watch next to the payment receiver and have it happen is amazingly empowering for him. Yeah
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:17.520]   Jim dowel rimple you got a pick for us
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:19.520]   ACDC right on
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:22.400]   Bon Scott
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:28.320]   Anything anything. I think you're right. I think you're right. I think I feel that uh
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:34.240]   It doesn't it's brian or bon. It doesn't really matter doesn't matter as long as you got angus

[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:56.320]   um
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:02.000]   joe joplinsky who does teleprompter plus and they've made a band they've been chronicling um how the band works
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.000]   Wait, that's clinton morris. Yeah, so this is shot on iphone six in new york city
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.680]   They got a bunch of friends together clatin morris is in it christina warren is in it
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:13.840]   Uh, jonathan man the song of day man is in it and they just went out and had a bunch of fun
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:17.440]   And the song is super catchy too. So it's a lot of it's in clatin is terrific
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:19.520]   He is so
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:23.600]   He's so fox in that. I love that. I think he's gonna pull open the shirt and i'll be a superman somewhere
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:25.600]   Yeah, yeah
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:29.520]   So it's just again. What's the name of the band? airplane mode
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:34.400]   I love it shot on an iphone six edited on a final cup pro. There's christina warren
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:37.840]   airplane mode
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:41.280]   You know it's I had I was interviewed by a television reporter
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:44.880]   She works on the east coast and all she had was an iphone
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:47.040]   And I said, don't where's your camera crew?
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:49.200]   She said no, no, I just shoot everything on the iphone
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:52.000]   She said it usually looks better than the stuff the camera crew brings back
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.680]   I did a bunch of interviews from marketplace and they they did not want me using skype
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:59.600]   They wanted me to talk into the recorder the microphone on the iphone and send them the waveables
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:03.280]   They said it was better than anything else they'd use unbelievable look how good that looks
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:10.240]   And they said they in the very beginning they used hyper last because they were worried about the stability
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:13.680]   But that ended up being 720p and they wanted the ability to move around a bit more
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:18.640]   So they switched to an iphone six plus with the optical image stabilization and they got really really good result
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:22.080]   We live in amazing times. I mean you could do this with your phone folks
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:25.920]   I'm looking at pictures on the three gs the old pictures
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:29.360]   Yeah, we've come along we've come a long way
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:34.160]   They have a very short like it's like a 15-minute podcast for each of the videos they put up and they describe how they use it
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:36.720]   And they were saying that they don't have a drummer. They're still looking for a drummer
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:40.640]   But they're using garage band and logic now to simulate the drummer while they're looking for one
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:45.360]   Be careful guys. They may decide that they don't need a drummer. It's just amazing what you can do. Yeah
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:49.360]   Really is if you want to laugh today, I'll smile. What's your other pick?
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:55.760]   I just had this because like it was such a full show. Oh good. Yeah. Yeah, no, we're I'm very happy to wrap it up here
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:59.760]   We will be back next week on a different day. We are going to delay
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:07.120]   Mac break weekly till Wednesday September 9th so that we can come back and talk about what Apple announced at the event
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:09.120]   I don't know how we're gonna get you in
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:13.520]   Renee we may not be able to although we are sending a camera down
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:16.720]   So what I'd love to do I'm not gonna be here
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:21.440]   But we will have live coverage of the event and as you guys come out, I'm sure there's gonna be a massive demo
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:26.240]   But as you guys come out if you can if we can find you we'll try to hook up
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:32.480]   And get your comments and thoughts Jim and Renee after the event Andy you're gonna be home
[01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:37.120]   I'm probably at the time of the oh you're gonna be
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:41.920]   I'm gonna be in New York City. So we're gonna have a Mac break weekly with all new people
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:47.600]   Have we thought about this yet Jason do we know that universe Mac break
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:51.200]   Yeah, we're working on it. Mike is going to be on and Alex is
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:56.960]   So we have basically we have yeah, we have a few bookings to me. That's not bad. That's I can handle that
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:01.600]   Problem is of course a lot almost everybody's coming to the event which means they won't be available
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:06.400]   Right, but we will have live coverage of the apple a keynote and right after mac break weekly set

[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:14.160]   1 p.m. Eastern time 1700 UTC. It's the best way to watch an apple keynote
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:17.680]   We try to give you most of the audio and video
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:22.720]   But we also give you the background the content the analysis and I think it's a nice way to do that
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:24.960]   Sounds like it's gonna be an incredible show
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:29.040]   I am really a little disappointed that I'm not gonna be in town
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:34.800]   We we arrange these meetings around the interactive
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:43.120]   Advertising bureaus new fronts the up fronts for next year. See they should know that apple does the event that weekly. Oh, yeah
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:46.960]   Yeah, yeah fronts the day after but I just there was no way I could do this or meeting
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:52.160]   Anyway, I won't be here sad to say I haven't missed an apple event since 2001
