[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Where is he? He's somewhere in the world.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   We don't know Albuquerque.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Yeah, he didn't.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   He didn't give us a location.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I have a feeling he had something to do with that guy jumping out of the weather balloon.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I have a feeling too.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   So maybe he's still there.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   So it'd be New Mexico.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   New Mexico.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   But good news.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   We got Renee Richie from iMour.com with us.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And this is the guy.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   If there were anybody you'd want to have on in a day like today, it'd be this guy every day.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Renee Richie, good to have you.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Thank you for having me back.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I appreciate it.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I got a box.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Is it a mini?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Is it an iPad mini Leola port?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Well, I'm looking and it's from AI, which I used to think in Elk Grove, California, I used to think
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   it was the artificial intelligence company.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And then I realized, no, it's Apple Incorporated.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   They don't want to put the word Apple on a box because it would get stolen.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   What's about the right size?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I'm thinking, well, there's three possibilities.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   It could be an invitation to the Apple event coming up next week.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Sounds a little solid for that.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   It could be maybe Apple's related and sent me an iPad mini just like it as one of the very
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   special people.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   You know, the ones who, you know, are ahead of the pack.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Or let's just open it up and see unboxing live.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   It could be an iPod touch.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Could be, I think it might be.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I've ordered a number of things from Apple.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   You know what?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I did order the new iPod Nano.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Could be the Nano.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Those are coming out, right?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   The rule is the bigger the box, the smaller the computer side.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   It's a bunch of connectors.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Well, hey, it's least they're out.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   The lightning 30 pin adapters are starting to ship, I guess.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And you can see I've spent $120.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   There's three of them.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   What are they?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Are they 30 or 40 bucks each?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   They're ridiculous.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I got the tiny, tiny little one of those.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   These aren't the adapters.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   These are the cables because I have all those docks.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Is that going to work?
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   So I could put this on a dock, right?
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Yeah, you could that you can just stick into your computer and those are the adapt.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Yeah, the cables.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   You put that on a dock.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Can I get to your iPhone and it's as if you live last year again?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   It's a city in the chat room and said, "Leo, you fool!"
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   It's all about airplay.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Not on the renew clock.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Of course, I gave that to Chad, so I don't need that anymore.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   But that's a 30 pin adapter.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Battery packs?
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Battery packs?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I have a ton of those.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And then also the main thing is my Sono stock.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And actually, if this doesn't work, and one of the things I see is,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   will this work to allow me control of the-- because as it stands right now in the Sono stock,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   it used to be.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I was able to tell the Sonos, you know, look and see what was on the iPad or iPod.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I found touch with that kind of thing.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Any media or car needs one of those connectors because they all have the legacy box?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Explain to me, because only you know we're in A.Ritchie in a few and a small few Dan Frakes and you.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Explain to me, does this have what iPod controls?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Or iPod controls on it or not?
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   The Apple had this thing on their website where it said that it did not support the iPod control
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   protocol, but then they took it off, which has made me terribly confused and mine literally
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   just arrived this morning, so I have not a chance to try it either.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I have an either.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Fam photographer in our chat room says, "I got the cable and I used it in my car, it worked
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   perfectly.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Worked for audio, yes, but did it work so that you could use-- if your car is one of those
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   like a Mercedes or BMW that then puts on the screen the contents of the iPod, were you
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   able to do all that?"
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   That's the question.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Now, the nice thing on my Mustang with Fort Sink is I have a USB connector, I put the lightning
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   cable in that and it did.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   It had all the iPod controls on it.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   And there's no video yet, that's the other big thing we're still missing.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Yeah, that's freer.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   I think AirPlay has superseded on that in that, right?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   You'd use an Apple TV.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   If you have the Apple TV, so the Apple TV then becomes a go to accessory.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   That's what you need.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   You need that $99 accessory.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   That's a good angle.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   So we're learning a little more about this cable.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   More and more people are taking it apart.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   The latest is that this accessory has security in it, some logic in it that protects it.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I'm always happy.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   I'm going to bury the lead, by the way, because Apple did not send me an invitation or an
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   iPod or a mini.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   I'm not going to talk about anything else but this cable because that's what they sent
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   me.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   I've spent over $200 on lightning cables so that I can use my damn iPhone 5.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   So tell me, so there's always been security?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Yeah, I think a couple of generations go, they added the security chip.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.600]   The old 30-pin docks, they had so many pins, they could have separate pins that would detect
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.000]   what kind of accessory you had plugged in and then a chip inside the cable.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   And now it's a pure digital signal so they can assign the pins dynamically and they still
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   have the security chip just to assure the quality of the workman and craftsmanship for us, Leo.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Just to assure, yeah, the chip works has done a little analysis of the, they say, just enough
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   security.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   In other words, it's not huge security.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   It's just kind of minor security.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   They could put more in, I guess, is what chip works is saying.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   It's not, for instance, the kind of security that modern printer cartridges have so that
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   you can't use third-party printer cartridges.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   This is the old security, the old printer cartridges used to have that kind of thing.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   The more interesting thing is they've also changed the licensing agreement for the docks
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   so that previously you could make small manufacturers could get licensed to make small batches of
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   very obscure cables or scientific instruments.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   And now it looks like pretty much you have to be a big supplier to make dock accessories.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Yes, that might be a shame.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   That's a shame because that was a kind of cool use, little-known use for these was scientific
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   instrumentation.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Absolutely.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   So this means, well, a couple of things, lessons for this consumer.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Probably you should not try to buy those USB cables on eBay that are real cheap from China
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   because those will charge but not to anything else, right?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   They have cracked.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Apparently they have cracked the security.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Oh, they have.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   You will be able to get, or secondarily, manufacture them and you will be able to get some, but it's
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   a quality issue for me.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   I'd want to test a bunch of them and make sure that they, at least we're supplying the same
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   quality cabling at Apple Loose.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Well, at this point I'm testing Apple's cable to see what we can do.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   We're not sure yet.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Obsidian, or who was it that said, who was it that said that he could use this in his
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   cart, a photographer?
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.880]   Were you able to control the iPhone with this, as you did the old iPhone or do you just get
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.480]   audio out as the question?
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.000]   Fam photographer, thank you.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   We'll wait and see what fam photographer has to say.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   The crazy thing, Leo, is they can put the iPhone 5 in a million countries on day one, but it
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   takes 30 days to get those adapters to US stores.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   And although some have said it's okay, but oh yeah, I have to try it with the camera connection,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   kit too.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And it's a little pricey and the question as well is it to have to be this pricey or is
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Apple making a little killing?
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   They are doing it because the chip, the cable changes dynamically so you always have logic.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Yeah, and there's an idea.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Okay, so we have it from fan photographer.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Yes, I was able to control the playlists with the adapter at work just like before.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   So that's really good news.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   And I had the same experience on an iPhone 5 and 4 sync just using the regular lightning USB
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   cable.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   So it does sound like iPod control out is in here.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Thank goodness.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Oh, that's right.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   The camera connection kit never did work with the iPhone.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I had only iPad only.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   That's right.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   All right.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   All right.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   I buried the lead.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   I was a bad boy.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   When we come back, Renee is with iMore.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   They know more about everything that you have become the key blog for Apple rumors beating
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   everybody.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Everybody like from nine to five Apple insider Mac rumors, they all quote you.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Somehow you've got a source.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   So and it looks like you nailed it again.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   So we'll find out what's coming from Apple.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   We do know there's an event.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   The invitations are out.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   We'll show you that that invitation and talk about the invitation doesn't say what they're
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   going to talk about.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Well, Renee will know this though.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   We'll ask him in just a bit.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Also, as I said, Alex Lindsay will be joining us for any minute now, I think, as we continue.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So I'm going to take a break so that Alex, you could try to get Alex.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Okay.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   The show brought to you.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   I might as well talk about Ford Singh since I've been talking about it, right?
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   You know, I kind of go on and on as most Ford sink owners do about my Ford sink and my
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   2010 Mustang.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   It is awesome.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   And yes, I'm here to report that the iPhone 5 works great with the A2DP.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   That's the Bluetooth.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   So when I get in the car, you know, if I've got the audible app running and I'm listening
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   to my book, I get in the car and it starts where I left off.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Love that.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   It also works the, they have a USB connector in the car that connects up to your iPod or
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   iPhone.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   So I've got a lot of devices, Android phones.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And depending on the device, certainly the iPhone and the iPod gives you control of it.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   So I can see, I can browse the playlist on the sink screen.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   I have a big screen in my car.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I can, you know, all of that control is still there.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Oh, and most importantly, I can voice control my iPhone and I do love that.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   So I could say, I could press the button.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   So I have a little button on my steering wheel.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Like a boom.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   And I talk to the nice lady and I say, you know, sync USB.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And I can say play Niles Rogers.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   And if I have any, I'll try to song on my iPod or iPhone.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   It will play or metall-- it doesn't have to be, it doesn't have to just be Niles.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   It could be Metallica.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Could be anybody.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   It even, I tried this.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   It even understands Colby, Colby, I don't even understand it.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Colby, Kiat.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   It knows and it plays it.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Amazing.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.160]   Ford Sync lets you browse your music collection by genre, album, artist, playlist, or song
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.480]   title, all with voice commands.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.000]   You can use Sync to activate your media player.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.440]   I'd even say play my, you know, moody playlist.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.440]   Or I love this one.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.440]   Play similar music.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.440]   So you listen to song.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.440]   I like that.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.440]   Play more.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.440]   You can use iTunes tagging.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.200]   So if you say, I like that song, this is on available Sync with my Ford Touch and HD radio
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.000]   technology with iTunes tagging.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.960]   If you hear a song on the HD radio or the player, you could tag.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.360]   You can tag it, transfer it to the iPod and purchase a song later from iTunes.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.360]   It likes it.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.360]   You tag this song.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.360]   You want it?
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.360]   Really, really cool.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:03.160]   And of course, you get voice control on your smartphone via Bluetooth streaming, on your
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.160]   USB drive.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.960]   You could put a thumb drive or a USB drive in there.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.320]   Of course, on your MP3 player as well.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.920]   Ford Sync is now available.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.920]   This is really the best news.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:19.680]   On every 2012, 2013 Ford vehicles sold in the US, including that great 2012 Ford Focus.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.840]   Equipment on some, but definitely get it.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.200]   In fact, I got an email.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.520]   I was just talking about this from somebody who says, "Hey, I just bought a Ford because
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.560]   of your Ford Sync ads.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.560]   Who do I tell?"
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.560]   Tell me.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.880]   I think he wants us to get credit from Ford.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:43.040]   Like, "Hey, by the way, Ford, I just want you to know," let me see if I can find his
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.040]   Jason.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.520]   I won't say his last name.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.400]   I bought a Ford, who do I tell, bought a 2013 Ford Escape because Leo's ads for Sync were
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.880]   a big factor in my decision.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.400]   Jason, you're going to love that escape, by the way.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.400]   Let me know how you like it.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.000]   You just told me that's good enough.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.960]   I think that's a stir.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.840]   I got this morning.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.200]   Learn more about Ford and all the technology they're putting into their cars.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:09.560]   They really see the vehicle now as a consumer electronics device for the 21st century.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.560]   I want you to...
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.720]   Niall Gregory Rogers.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.440]   That's him.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.720]   I want you to try it.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.720]   You could do that.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.200]   Is it at Ford?
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.200]   You could tweet it.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.240]   That would let him know.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.240]   At Ford.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.680]   Scott Monty would keep...
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.680]   He probably...
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.520]   I think Scott has a little clipboard in his office.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.040]   When he sees a tweet that says, "Oh, yeah, I told me to buy a Ford," and he just puts
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.960]   a little checkboxer.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.960]   Or visit Ford.com/technology.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.600]   There's no offer code.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.800]   Get 20% off.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   No, I see.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.600]   I don't even want to say that because nobody will believe me.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.480]   Hey Leo said you'd get 20% off.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.920]   No, I don't think so.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.160]   Colby Kiat.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.520]   Is that right?
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.520]   Or Kailat?
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.760]   I don't know who you're talking about.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.240]   Oh, you don't know her.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.240]   No.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.600]   Yeah, you're not hip like me.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.600]   I guess not.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.480]   You young people don't know the good stuff.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.480]   No.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.480]   No.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.480]   No.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.480]   No.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.920]   Ladies and gentlemen, there is an announcement to be made.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.120]   October 23rd, Apple will be having a special event.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.920]   Jim Dalrymple got the invite.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.800]   Did you get your invite, Renee?
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.800]   I did not.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.800]   Alas, I did not.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.800]   I mean, it's just maybe the box.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.800]   You know, I didn't look.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.560]   It could have been checking my trunk drawer.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.560]   Nothing.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.800]   No, just a bill.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.080]   So no, I didn't get an invite either.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:29.960]   We don't know if Andy did.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.960]   I'm sure Andy did.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:40.600]   It is a one of those little things at the Apple campus, not Erbobuina Center.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.600]   This will be at the...
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.840]   No, it says the California Theater.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.000]   Is that the one in the theater?
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.080]   Is that somewhere else?
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.080]   I don't know.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.760]   It is a smaller venue.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.760]   It's not the yearbook.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.920]   Win a venue.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:54.920]   And what now?
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:59.160]   They all they say in the invitation, we've got a little more to show you.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.160]   A little.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.160]   A little.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.160]   I love...
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:09.080]   On Loop Insight, which is the loop, which is Jim Dowerimple's blog, I just do notice
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:15.880]   that his HTML tag, the title for this is Apple iPad event.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.880]   But that's Jim.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.240]   But you know, he did that on purpose.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.880]   You know, Jim doesn't mess around.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.880]   He's...
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.880]   He's a little...
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.640]   This is a little way of saying, by the way, that's the iPad event.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.960]   So we do expect a 7.85-inch iPad mini, right?
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.960]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.440]   It's going to be an iPad and Mac event.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.640]   I think the Macs will be the smaller of second course we iPods were last month with the iPhone
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.200]   event.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.760]   We hear, and I'd love to know if this is accurate according to your sources, of a 13-inch retina
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.760]   MacBook Pro.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.320]   Yeah, I believe that to be accurate.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.320]   It also...
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.320]   I like...
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.240]   The rumors are one thing, but I like it when they sort of make logical sense.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:56.240]   And if you look at a retina Mac, the 15-inch MacBook is almost maxed out on the GPU running
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.160]   that retina display, and you have to add a GPU to the 13-inch MacBook to get it to run
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.160]   a retina display.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.680]   And there's no room for that kind of battery or that kind of GPU in a MacBook Air.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.600]   And when you get bigger, like the iMacs, the displays are just too big to have good pricing
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.600]   or good yields yet.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.560]   So the only logical next retina Mac is the 13-inch, and that's the one they're going to
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.560]   go with.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.400]   It should be easier to run, too, because it's a small...
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.400]   It won't have as many pixels as the 15.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.240]   Yeah, a little bit smaller.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.080]   Not quite as demanding.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.960]   But they will have to put an NVIDIA or similar GTX card in there.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.960]   Yeah, I imagine.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:30.960]   Just quite a heavy load.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.320]   If you imagine it's 800 now, it's going to be pixel-double to 1600 vertical height,
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.320]   which is...
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.920]   That's a lot of pixels to push.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.560]   I love my retina, but I do see lag from time to time.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:45.040]   I've mostly eliminated it, but occasionally I'll see lag, especially when I'm using the
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.160]   expose to slide the windows back and forth.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.760]   Or when you go full-screen mode.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.760]   Right.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.760]   That's what I mean.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.200]   So what I do is I do full-screen mode, and then I swipe back and forth to different screens.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:18:01.000]   And that's when you see a little bit of lag in drawing the screen.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:08.280]   The rumor is, according to Mark German in 9-5 Mac, it will be sold at a higher price,
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.720]   and they'll continue to sell non-retinoc 13 inches.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.200]   It should be identical to the way they handle the 15-inch MacBook, where it comes in at
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.360]   a higher price point with the retina display, the new body without the optical drive, and
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.520]   with the USB and the Thunderbolt connectors.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.440]   And then they'll keep the lower end ones on the market until they transition the retina
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.000]   max to become the new normals.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.520]   So we will lose the...
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.760]   Because it has a thinner form factor, we will lose the superdrive.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.760]   I believe so, yeah.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.000]   I think it's going to be almost exactly like a smaller, more compact version of the 15-inch
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   MacBook.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.920]   Do we know how well the retina's sold?
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:43.920]   Do we know...
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.280]   Now Apple's quarterly report is coming up, quarterly results are coming up soon, but
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.320]   they never do break down the individual models, do they?
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.320]   No.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:57.600]   And the first day they announced it at WWDC, they were lineups every day at that Apple
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.040]   Store, and they didn't have enough to meet demand.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.200]   So it's probably one of those situations where they're literally building and selling everyone
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.000]   they can.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   I bet you, if somebody could...
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.520]   I mean, I don't know who supplies these retina displays, but there can't be...
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.720]   I think was it sharp or LG?
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.120]   There can't be that many sources for it.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.680]   I bet you if you could get in, wangle your way in there, maybe get...
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.320]   I don't know, somebody from Saturday Night Live to go in there, but tend to be a Chinese
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.320]   worker, you could...
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.840]   Will Farrell can do an exposite?
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.760]   You could find out how many of the displays.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.560]   LG supplies displays, but I think they have a second source.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.560]   I can't remember if it's Samsung.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.640]   F3 now for iOS devices, but with the new Macs, they're laminating the panels.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.360]   So they're doing everything they can to get the pixels closer to the surface, and that
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.920]   makes it more expensive and more arduous process.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.920]   I just... I love the... I have to say, I love the retina MacBook.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.920]   Me too.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.400]   And my next project is to buy an external Thunderbolt display to go with that.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.640]   So now really is a desktop.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.640]   I'm using that.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.440]   There's a couple drawbacks because the Thunderbolt's not retina, so the pixels do scratch your
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.440]   eyes a little bit.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.440]   Wait a minute.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.440]   And if you... what?
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.080]   So the Thunderbolt display is not a retina display.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.880]   It's still a regular panel, the 2070-20-0.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.240]   Well, of course not.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.560]   You couldn't do a 27-inch retina.
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.880]   So if you drag a window, the minute it hits halfway between, it switches to non-retinous.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.320]   And then if you drag it back, it switches back.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:19.480]   And you also can't do the high-res mode on the retina Mac when you're driving the panel,
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.080]   because it's too much for the GPU.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:25.080]   So it goes into the ideal mode on the computer, and then you have the Thunderbolt display as
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.080]   well.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.320]   You use the... Wow, I'm impressed.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.600]   You use that high-res mode?
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.360]   I do for Photoshop because it lets me get...
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.360]   For Photoshop, I have a...
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.000]   Because Photoshop's not retina aware, because aperture is.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.200]   So we will just automatically use the pixels.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.280]   But Photoshop's using 1440...
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.280]   Yes.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.080]   Because it doesn't know that there's more to be had.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.480]   So I max out as many pixels I can get in Photoshop.
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.480]   Mostly for Photoshop.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.480]   Okay, but you can't do that on a 20...
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.920]   So the 27 is basically like it's attached to an older Mac.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.920]   It's in retina mode.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.920]   It's just not in the big retina mode.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:58.920]   I don't get it.
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:59.920]   I don't know for retinous.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.920]   It's not in...
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.920]   Okay.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.360]   Do I get more pixels out of the 27 or not?
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.880]   You get the additional display.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.880]   You do.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.160]   So it goes back to the default setting on your retina Mac, and then you get the additional
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.160]   display.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.160]   Okay.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.160]   It's an okay solution.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.160]   It's not the idea.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.160]   It's not perfect.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.760]   Well, thank you for letting me know that.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.640]   And I was going to use a...
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.240]   The nice thing about the MacBooks, everybody knows this is watching this show, but I'll
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:29.760]   just say it in case you don't, is that you don't have to open them up.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.920]   You just slide it...
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.920]   They have three connectors.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.800]   They have a thunderbolt, a power...
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.280]   I guess it's just two for the thunderbolt.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.280]   Yeah, there's two now.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.680]   Because the USB gets go through the thunderbolt and power.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.680]   The Mac is sitting there.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.440]   The keyboard is being charged, the thunderbolt.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.560]   And then you have your keyboard.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.200]   If you use Bluetooth or if you have a wired keyboard, it's plugged into the display.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.760]   And you're using it as a desktop without even opening the laptop.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.760]   It just knows.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.760]   It just stays in clamshell mode.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.760]   Clamshell mode.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.760]   It's really nice.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:55.760]   And you can plug ethernet into the back of the display now too.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.760]   And it's basically got everything you need.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:57.760]   Ah, that's the reason...
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.760]   Because that's the reason...
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.200]   Yeah, because I have the old 27 inch.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.600]   That's the reason you get the thunderbolt.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.600]   Very good.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.760]   A thousand bucks.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.720]   It's only money.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.720]   Should I...
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.720]   Okay.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.360]   The 13 inch, you'll be able to do something similar.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.360]   And if you buy it, Leo, that means the new one will come out faster.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.880]   It's just good for all of us.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.880]   No.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.040]   I got that.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.640]   But I might buy a Mac mini.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.480]   No, no, I'm not going to do that either.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.680]   Because that's the other rumor that we'll see a new Mac mini.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.920]   New Mac mini is an iMac.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.800]   I think the new iMac's too.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.800]   Yep.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.800]   I didn't see that.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.480]   The Mac mini will probably just be updated as the latest specs or the latest whatever the
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.880]   latest Intel chips that they use in there is.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.920]   USB 3, thunderbolt, probably the same configurations we've seen previously.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.920]   The Ivy Bridge.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.120]   Because that way you can USB built into it.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.120]   Yep.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.120]   And it'll still be unibody aluminum.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.120]   Yep.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.360]   I don't think we're in radical redesign stage.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.840]   We're just in and up with the components.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.840]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.680]   New logic board with new processors.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.480]   And USB 3 is actually really nice.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.880]   I like USB 3.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:07.720]   In fact, a good thing that USB 3 is you can get inexpensive USB 3 thumb drives and external
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.720]   hard drives.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.920]   And they're pretty darn fast.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.400]   I was getting right speeds of 230 megabytes of megabytes.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.400]   Not bits.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.440]   Megabytes a second on the I had a HyperX from Kingston USB drive.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.080]   They're almost transparent now.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.040]   You can just use them as like normal drives.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.240]   Yeah, really nice, especially if you have an SSD.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.080]   Will they put SSDs in the Mac mini's?
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.080]   I think so.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.800]   I think Apple, because you want to use stuff like power nap, a lot of the new features
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.760]   in Mountain Lion require the SSD drive to work.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.200]   And I think Apple's clearly said we're going to have an SSD future.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.200]   I didn't know that power nap requires an SSD.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:50.000]   So it's only available right now in the retina max and the newest MacBook Airs, I believe.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.920]   Why does power nap require an SSD?
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.920]   Because it's kind of a hybrid.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.800]   It's like a dark wake mode.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.880]   It's a hybrid between sleeping and awake.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.040]   And the power consumption on a spitting drive, I think, is too high for Apple to do what
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.040]   they want using power nap.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.240]   So an SSD, it's a much lower power grant.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.360]   Well, that would be perfect.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:13.280]   How do I know if power nap is working, by the way?
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.080]   It no longer just robs at me.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.880]   You know, the redness sits there quietly.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.960]   I don't know if it's not throbbing anymore.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.880]   Yeah, it kind of just spools up checks things and then spools down.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.560]   So if you open your computer and everything is updated, it's working.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.880]   Otherwise you can just go and...
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.800]   Is there a power nap button?
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.960]   I think I believe it's in settings.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.960]   Okay.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.400]   I'll go back and look.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.640]   How are saving if memory serves?
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:41.560]   I was somebody who said you can't get SSDs in the current Mac minis.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:47.640]   You can get a 256 gig solid-state drive for 600 bucks premium over the 500 gig serial
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.640]   8G.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.440]   The difference is that you don't want the kind that are made like laptop drives, almost
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.320]   like plug and play replacements.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:59.640]   Apple, I think, requires the ones that are actually real SSD chips built into the machine.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.360]   So they're not going through the old standard.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.360]   It's not...
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.160]   They're not just taking out the drive and putting it on the SATA bus.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.480]   They're doing like they do with the retina, which is it looks like a little...
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:10.600]   In fact, I have it because I did the upgrade, so I have the old one.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.080]   I should bring it in and show everybody.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.280]   Other world computing sells for a kind of prohibitive price, but...
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.280]   Hey.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.880]   It's your retina.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.880]   You've got to give it the good things.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.200]   If you want to race cars instead of a street car...
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.120]   But it looks like an SODIM, like the old...
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.600]   But the connectors on the side.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.600]   And it's actually...
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.600]   We did it on the know-how.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.600]   It's a trivial upgrade.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.120]   In fact, I told I, as I said, this isn't a 30-minute show.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.120]   This is going to take me three minutes.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.040]   You remove six screws.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.160]   You take off the thing.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.640]   There's one more screw, a Torx screw in the computer.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.640]   You do have to...
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:49.320]   Other world computing says remove the battery connector.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.320]   And I don't know exactly why.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.720]   I guess maybe a little corner of it is over the SSD, but it's a simple thing to do.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.720]   You pry that off.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.160]   You remove the Torx screw.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.160]   Take out the old drive.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.160]   Put in the new drive.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.160]   Screw it down again.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.360]   Put back the battery connector.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.360]   Return the...
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.360]   They're penelope screws.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.680]   But other world computing gives you both the screwdrivers you need.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.000]   And you return the back to its position.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Screw down the...
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.280]   Six, maybe eight screws.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.280]   And you're done.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.280]   Takes no time.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.280]   And it's a nice upgrade.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.920]   It is a little bit faster.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:22.720]   And so currently in the Mac Mini, they're using that kind of hard drive, not a SATA drive.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.280]   No, I believe they're using SATA.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.280]   They are in the current Mac Mini.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.560]   So you'll get better.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.040]   That will be a nice feature.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.840]   It'll also be able to make the Mac Mini smaller.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.920]   I don't know if they'll do that.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.720]   But if they use SSD, then you really could even make it thinner.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.720]   Yeah, I'm not sure how aggressive they're going to be with the Mac Mini upgrade.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.720]   They usually announce the new body and then they do a couple years of...
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.360]   You know, it's a TikTok upgrade model.
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.640]   They do the new hardware, then a couple years of Trivio...
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.400]   Not Trivio, but incremental upgrades.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.680]   And then they do the next version.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:51.520]   So you're going to see if they do go to the full on SSD model this time.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.840]   Who uses minis?
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.480]   And what do they use them for?
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.040]   A jack from Mac Mini Colo.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.280]   Oh, Alex Lindsey's here.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.280]   Hey, Alex.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.680]   Yeah, the Mac Mini Colo is cool.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.680]   But let me...
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.880]   We'll talk about that in a second because that's really cool.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.400]   But let's say hi to Alex Lindsey.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.400]   Where are you today, Alex?
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.800]   I'm in Washington, D.C.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.160]   I want to thank you because you set us up on Sunday with an interview.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.160]   I'm back now.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.160]   Went great.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:25.360]   Scott was the technical director for the Stratus Skydive, the Felix Baumgartner's 24 Mile High
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.440]   Skydive.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.880]   And you got us hooked up with Scott.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.880]   He was very generous.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.160]   He gave us about five minutes of his time.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:35.440]   In fact, if you haven't heard this Sunday's Twit, listen or watch because you can...
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.200]   Right at the beginning, we interviewed Scott.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.200]   He was great.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.360]   Now, he says he knows you.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.600]   Is he a pixel core guy?
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.360]   I worked with Scott on a couple other streaming projects.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:51.760]   So we generally when the project is nearly impossible, Scott and I end up on the project.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.560]   I can't think of a more impossible project than that one.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.200]   And it went off flawlessly.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:01.480]   And one of the things that I thought was really interesting, the video was so crystal clear.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:06.520]   Felix Baumgartner sitting in that capsule and then he just kind of pushes himself out.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.880]   And if you missed it, it was amazing.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.760]   I thought I was watching that going.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.480]   I don't know if he understands, but that is the distance from Petaluma to San Francisco
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.520]   and he's jumping out of...
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.520]   That's a long way.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:22.640]   I understand that part, but what's amazing is I guess he was in a very highly directional
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.120]   microwave links up there, but they got...
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.120]   Hello?
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.120]   Sorry, I'm in a hotel room somewhere.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.120]   A big hotel room.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.120]   You want to go get...
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.120]   Go ahead.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.120]   You got breakfast.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.120]   No, no, no, no.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.120]   There's people out there.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.120]   This is another room part of it.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.120]   It's a big hotel room.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.480]   Lisa's cell phone makes that sound as a ring.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:43.000]   So anytime I hear a ding dong, I don't know whether to answer the door or answer the phone.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.240]   So he told us, I didn't know this, that they had a red camera up there.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.240]   It was not the 5K epic, but the 4K.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.240]   Scarlet, I guess that is, right?
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.240]   Yes.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:56.920]   So they'll have 4K video.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.280]   I was just blown away at the quality of the coverage.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.720]   Anyway, it was a great conversation.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.720]   They needed amazing.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.720]   It was great about it.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:10.080]   I thought maybe you were there because it was also an amazing record for YouTube.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.800]   And I know you do some streaming stuff.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:18.360]   Eight million live views, simultaneous views, which is not just a record, but it's like
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:24.360]   blowing it out of the park, the previous record was set during the Olympics, half a million.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:29.760]   Yeah, it was, I can feel like when I was trying to connect, I could feel YouTube.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.080]   You could, there was some connection errors and so on and so forth.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:36.160]   And I was like, wow, this must be really pushing the envelope of what that system is
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.160]   designed to do.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.120]   And sure enough, it was, I mean, that is nothing been close.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.120]   I don't think.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.560]   All right, that's, well, and Chad pointed out, I think this is a really good observation.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:51.720]   Maybe it was John that, that now you could say with, you know, there's a certain amount
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:58.360]   of parity between streaming and broadcast because yes, it was always, you know, I remember
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.000]   when 128,000 was the most, it was an AOL concert event.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   And then we did, we pushed 180,000 during the iPad launch.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.960]   And I think that was a record briefly.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.280]   And then 500,000 during the Olympics.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.280]   And now, wow.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:17.960]   I think one of the things that that proves is that people will show up in the millions
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.440]   for the right project, you know, for the right stream.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.120]   People are, you know, live video streaming has really reached critical mass in a way
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.360]   that we all knew it would.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.200]   I think a lot of us thought it would happen 10 years ago.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.400]   And now we're kind of finally there.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.400]   So anyway, it's welcome.
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.400]   It's good to have you.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.400]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.400]   We appreciate it.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.080]   Renee Richie is here from I'm more.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.520]   Andy is, is somewhere in the air.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.520]   He's flying.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.520]   He's going to have to go again.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.760]   Obviously pick the wrong flight.
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:43.760]   Yes.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:47.320]   He should have been an a virgin and he would have, he would have been flying in.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.200]   He's getting ready to reduplicate the jump.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.200]   I love, I'd love to set a space with the hat.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.520]   I just would love to see that.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.520]   And then he jumps out and the hat goes flying.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.520]   Did you see the tweets where they called it a hoax?
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:03.080]   And they said the myth, myth, myth, myth, myth, mythbusters has to, yeah, recreate it.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.640]   Unless Adam Savage does it, I don't believe it.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.640]   Exactly.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.120]   No, no, I believe it.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:16.960]   So, we were talking and I don't know how much you're wired in, but apparently invitations
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.560]   have gone out for an Apple event on October 23rd.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.600]   I don't know if I mentioned that.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.040]   That's next Tuesday.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.480]   And what I didn't mention is how we're going to cover it.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:32.600]   We always do cover these Apple events and we'll have, we'll move TNT an hour earlier,
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.160]   be 9 a.m. Pacific, 12 noon Eastern, then at 10 a.m. we'll go to live coverage of the
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.160]   Apple event.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.160]   That's 1 p.m. Pacific 1700 UTC on Tuesday the 23rd.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.560]   I followed that by a special Mac break weekly.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.360]   So thank you Apple.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.720]   We don't have to move things around.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.160]   Usually they do these things on Wednesday.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:57.760]   I know why they didn't because on Friday, Windows 8 ships and they thought, well, we'll
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.320]   give them a couple of days to.
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.440]   There's also the sound sign next big thing event.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.480]   So again, I have a name.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.400]   There's a Samsung next big thing event in New York on Wednesday.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.400]   Primarily.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.400]   I know what that is.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.400]   Already got it.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.400]   That's the note.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.400]   Note two, which is ginormous.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.400]   You know, it's so.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.600]   I think it's actually, oh yeah, it is on Wednesday.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.280]   It's so funny because the screen of the note two, the whole screen is actually bigger
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.960]   than the iPhone.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.080]   You could hollow it out like a tonton and use it as a case for your iPhone.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:33.280]   That would be a circle to have a case that looks like a note two.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:38.640]   Anyway, I do need a case, but I'll talk about that in a second.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:46.080]   So yeah, and do you now, I completely discredit this, but somebody in the mainstream media,
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.160]   I think was CNN, posited.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:53.840]   Oh, see, Apple's trying to zing Microsoft as if Apple could care less when the Windows
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:54.840]   event is.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.920]   Do you think this event, the week of this event was set back?
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.240]   I think around the time of the iPhone launch, they've been doing this for about a month
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.240]   out.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.440]   I'm sure they have a general awareness of other companies, but I don't think they have a general
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.520]   care of when other companies are doing their events.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.440]   Couldn't care the least.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.440]   Couldn't care the least.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:16.360]   And for the idea that Apple would be trying to torpedo the Windows RT launch gives the
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:20.160]   Windows 8 RT a lot more credit than Apple's given it.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.760]   We do know some numbers for Windows RT.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.760]   Interesting.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:29.760]   Priced almost identically to the iPad.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.760]   Yep.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.760]   G starting price.
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:38.120]   So, the CNN was saying that they thought that the reason Apple was paying attention is that
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.120]   they were worried that our team might cannibalize the iPad.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.320]   Alex, does that seem credible at all?
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:49.640]   I think that, I mean, I definitely think that Apple has to pay attention to that.
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.480]   I mean, I think when you look at the change in the use of tablets and how popular, I think
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.800]   that Apple has pay attention to it.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.840]   I think the iPad mini, whenever it comes out, is a reaction to that.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.840]   It is.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.840]   Okay.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:00.840]   And so, I mean, I definitely think.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.880]   Apple did the same thing with the iPod.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.160]   They had a very, very expensive product.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:11.200]   Other people started to fill in below them and then they took away most of that air.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.760]   You know, it made it very difficult to move into that market.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.520]   And so, I think that that's probably what they're attempting to do here.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:23.560]   And I think that, and I think that the, I have to admit, I use a Nexus 7 as well as
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.560]   my iPad.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.640]   And I have to admit that I like the form factor of the Nexus 7 better.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.440]   I want to carry it around more.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.640]   I'm very much looking forward.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.120]   I'd rather have an iPad as far as the operating system.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.720]   I just want the smaller form factor.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.160]   It's more portable for me.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:41.800]   So I'm very, regardless of the price, I'm just excited about having a smaller iPad.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.200]   You know, something a little bit bigger than my iPhone and something slightly smaller than
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.200]   what I have now.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:53.400]   Elle Kelly from our chat room said something, but I forgot what it's weird.
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.480]   It moved so fast.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.640]   I remembered his name.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.040]   That was impressive.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.880]   What did he say that it was good?
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.880]   Oh crap.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:01.880]   I'm sorry, Elle.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:09.120]   I was, oh, the seven inch tablet proves Apple cares a lot about what others do because,
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:14.040]   remember, Steve Jobs spent 10 minutes on that earning call two years ago, dissing, saying
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.880]   nobody wants a seven inch tablet.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.480]   But the question there is that he's spent a lot of time dissing things that they were
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.480]   working on before.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.800]   I mean, you wonder whether that's something that he didn't believe in or whether something
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.800]   that you want to know.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.800]   Do you?
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:26.800]   You never know, do you?
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:30.440]   Influence to get everybody looking the other direction and not going that direction so
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.960]   that Apple can go that direction.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.360]   If you look at the wording he used to, he never, he didn't really say, like he said,
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:41.240]   seven inch tablets are a DOA because they run smartphone software blowing up.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:46.640]   And Apple was really deliberate in going for a 7.85 inch tablet that runs iPad software.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.520]   And everything about that conversation Steve Jobs had with analysts was about the different
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.200]   class of software that the iPad let you run.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.480]   It's two columns that have one column and it's more sophisticated apps.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.640]   And I think that I think it's true what he said because a lot of seven inch tablets haven't
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.640]   been more than big iPod touches.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.640]   And at least from what I've heard, this is going to be something very different in the
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.640]   mini tablets space.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:09.000]   But really is iPad software any different than iPhone software?
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.560]   How is it different?
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.880]   It's using it more of the real estate.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:18.600]   I mean, the iPad software is definitely iPad only apps that are using, you know, it's
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:23.280]   so screen aware, but but but it's the same OS, isn't it?
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.280]   Pretty much.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.280]   And the iPhone version layer is different and what they, the amount of control and the amount
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:32.000]   of information they show and the quality of the apps, if you put an iPad version and
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.360]   an iPhone version of a really good optimized app next to each other, the iPad version is
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.360]   way more functional.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.360]   It's not really a computer.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.360]   I can't call it a computer.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.160]   It's still the car, not the truck.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.280]   But it's more of a, if you look at the iPad mini, it's really designed to remove two barriers
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.280]   of entry.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.160]   One is cost for anyone who the iPad was too expensive for.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:53.880]   But the other one is just size for anyone that the iPad was too big or too heavy for.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:57.160]   And the eye, the original iPad is really designed for people who want to get stuff done but
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:01.080]   don't need a computer where the iPad mini is going to be exactly what Alex said, that
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:05.800]   easier to carry around to read in bed, sort of a less former, formal, more educational
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.800]   kind of device.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:15.520]   And what Google has done with Android is instead of doing that kind of, distinction
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:21.600]   is made Android more kind of universally compatible or more screen, less screen aware.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.640]   Although there are tablet apps and there are non tablet apps also on Android.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.040]   I love Android Central's headline.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.840]   Apple to invent smaller tablets.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.520]   October 23rd.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.920]   That's Phil Nickinson at work.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.400]   I love you Phil.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.800]   But it's interesting though, he says it'll probably be really, really good.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.360]   Frankly, it'll probably be better built than the Nexus 7.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.520]   That's true.
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.800]   And he says, that's a good thing.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.440]   Google has a gem in the Nexus 7, but it's not perfect for 200 bucks, our favorite Android
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.440]   tablet.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.360]   But having Apple in that game, well, up everybody's game.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:56.320]   Apple, there's no way Apple can charge 200 bucks for an iPad mini.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.880]   There's a way.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:58.880]   They can?
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:03.440]   They could if they decide that they, I believe an Apple initially was going to target something
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.960]   close to $200, but they, the perception was maybe that the fire or the Nexus 7 would
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.120]   do better in the market than they have.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:13.560]   But because Amazon limits their distribution to countries where they have Amazon stores,
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.560]   which is a very small amount.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.560]   Yeah, they subsidize that.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.320]   They still haven't figured out how to sell those things in a mass scale yet.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.640]   So there's not as much pressure on Apple to do a low price point.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:27.360]   But if they wanted to, they could do 200, they can do 250 fairly easily for an 8 gigabyte
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:31.080]   bare bones, iPad 2 kind of spec device.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.000]   They're rumors that Apple's making millions of these.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   What was it?
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   5 to 8 million?
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.960]   They intend to make this 100 million selling device.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:43.640]   Some even said this will be a better iPad than the big iPad.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:49.200]   Well, I think that I think again, I think they're going to make a lot of money this fall selling
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.760]   probably 5 to 10 million of them.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.320]   I think there's going to be a huge push.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.560]   And I know that I sound like a broken record.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.200]   I've said this almost every time we talk about it.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:39:01.840]   But I think the market to watch in the spring is Apple pushing into the educational market.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:08.960]   Whether that's workforce development, education or with iBooks or the K through 12, I think
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:09.960]   that this is the--
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.960]   This is their education.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.880]   This is the device.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:19.040]   This is the one that goes up against OLPC, all the inexpensive laptops.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.680]   This is the device that solves that problem.
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:21.680]   You might be right.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:27.580]   You've been saying that ever since the iBook author came out and the next web Matthew Pans
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:31.680]   Arena writing in the next web says, "Apple's hypothetical iPad mini event to have strong
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.840]   iBooks focus.
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:39.480]   We've heard from multiple sources that it will be aimed at those who wish to partake
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:44.800]   media on their tablets but also to schools and education."
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.800]   I Book Street will be announced perhaps.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:51.760]   I think one of the arguments I can imagine Apple sales folks talking to schools saying
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.320]   this is a very inexpensive product.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.000]   There's already a huge market and it's also very controllable.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.720]   It's an ecosystem that a school can deliver and have a lot of control over what's being
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.040]   put on it, how it's being used.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:12.600]   And for many school IT professionals, that's something that they probably want to hear.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:18.680]   It's probably going to give them an advantage over an Android solution in that area.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:24.440]   Apple up $12 today, by the way, still under $700 though.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.440]   It's a buy-o.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.440]   It's a bargain.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:29.600]   I wish I bought it yesterday.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.640]   No, I'm not allowed to own Apple stock.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.240]   My own screwpoles prevent that.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.240]   We're going to take a break.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:41.960]   Let's talk about 9 to 5 Macs as there will be 24 iPad models.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.560]   Let's find out more about what we can expect with an iPad mini.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:48.280]   And you said Renee something that I haven't seen anywhere else.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.600]   You said there would be new iMacs too.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.760]   It makes sense.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.080]   But I've seen only MacBooks and mini.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.120]   So let's see what iMore knows when we continue.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.720]   Renee Ritchie from iMore.com is here from Montreal from Washington DC.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.320]   Alex Lindsey of the Pixel Core.
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.400]   And the Inako has the day off.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.400]   He is traveling.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.440]   We're talking Macs.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:11.640]   Finally, on Macbreak weekly.
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:15.360]   Brought to you today by GoToMeeting, which is a great product for your iPad.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.560]   GoToMeeting, especially with HD Faces now.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:24.440]   It is a powerful way to meet with clients and colleagues when they are not in the office.
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.760]   And this is more and more of the case.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.880]   People are doing business all over the world now.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.280]   You can't necessarily get to where your clients are.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.400]   Those team meetings are harder and harder to have.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.640]   GoToMeeting is a great solution.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.000]   You got to still have meetings.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.160]   I thought we could get rid of them.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.960]   But I realized, no, you got to have meetings.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:48.800]   It's essential for an efficient workplace, an opportunity not just to kind of lay down
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.920]   the law and say, here's what we're doing, but also for different voices to be heard,
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:56.600]   to share ideas, to problem solve, develop creative solutions.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:59.920]   Games are really where, sometimes where the work gets done.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:03.000]   But with your team spread out, perhaps you're thinking, I don't know how we're going to
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.200]   do a meeting.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.600]   GoToMeeting.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.320]   And now, so GoToMeeting has always had this great screen sharing, the fastest, most secure,
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.320]   easiest to use.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:14.400]   But now with HD Faces, you also see the people in the meeting.
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:20.120]   I'm trying to remember, we've had, I think, as many as eight people in a GoToMeeting with
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.160]   HD Faces, eight cameras.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.320]   If you have a Mac or a PC, you can use that camera.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.080]   It can even use the camera on the iPad.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.760]   Of course, the headphones too.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.400]   So you're wireless.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.880]   You can walk, you could go out in your garden or be at an airport.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:38.640]   And if you've got a decent connection, man, which LTE, by the way, is plenty, you can
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:43.520]   attend a meeting, you can be seen and see others, build rapport, build trust, get to
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.040]   know each other.
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:48.560]   So important with coworkers, even more important with clients, nobody's going to buy from
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.320]   you unless they know you.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.920]   And having that visual, in fact, clients love this.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:53.920]   It saves them time.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.120]   They don't have to travel to meet you.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.480]   You don't have to give you a cup of coffee when you come to visit them.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.480]   You just have the meeting.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.480]   You get it done.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.480]   You get the sales done.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.480]   Show them that presentation.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.480]   They're seeing it on the screen.
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.480]   They're seeing you.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:05.480]   They're building trust.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.000]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.280]   By the way, it's very affordable.
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:13.240]   If you've looked at these teleconferencing solutions, people are using with tens or hundreds of
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.840]   thousands of dollars.
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:16.760]   You've already got all the essentials.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.040]   You've got the great internet.
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.560]   You've got a camera on your laptop or your iPad.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.200]   You've got everything you need.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.080]   All you need is GoToMeeting.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.000]   $29 a month.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.360]   Flat rate for as many meetings as long as you want.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.600]   And free for the first one.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.320]   So I want you to try it right now.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:34.320]   Visit GoToMeeting.com.

[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.960]   Use Mac break as the offer code or the promo code.

[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.800]   Go to meeting.com offer code is Mac break.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.920]   We thank them for their support.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:04.040]   The Mac break weekly.
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.200]   This is Jordan Kahn writing a 9 to 5 Mac.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.600]   Apple to launch 24.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.080]   This is from an Australian retailer.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:15.520]   24 new SKUs of the iPad mini.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.600]   Good better best.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.600]   Good better best.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.240]   Good better best.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.640]   There are four variants of people.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.880]   This is again, this is a rumor.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.200]   P101, P103, P105 and P107.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:32.600]   So it looks like Apple is going to launch four different models with the mini in colors,
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:36.920]   in three memory capacities.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.480]   Lightning connector.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.880]   Renee, is this all credible?
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:45.960]   It's a 9 to 5 Mac has very, very good retail connections for Apple products and they're
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.800]   usually spot on with this stuff.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:50.160]   It's hard to kind of, it's almost like anthropomancy.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.480]   You look at all these SKUs and you try to figure out what they are.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:57.560]   I think some of these might be, we've heard for a while that the iPad 3 might get a very
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:00.400]   small update to include lightning.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:04.760]   And I think recently people have been saying LTE for outside the US, just like the iPhone
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:05.760]   5 has.
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.640]   I don't think that'll be a big deal.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.080]   Apple wouldn't want to anger people who just bought them.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.800]   So we'll just say, oh, here's the iPad 3 with lightning and you can use it in the UK
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:17.360]   and Australia and wherever.
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:24.560]   But if you multiply three or four different capacities by two colors, by the Wi-Fi and
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:28.560]   the Wi-Fi plus cellular, then you start getting into every, I mean, those are, that's what
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.360]   you get every time with new Apple products.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.960]   And what color is misleading?
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:32.960]   Black and white?
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:33.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:34.960]   Not red, not purple.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:35.960]   Not orange.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:39.040]   The iPod Touch got colors and moved down to the consumer sort of space and that kind of
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.880]   opens up the pro space, which is the white and black space for the iPad mini iPad.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.120]   I would buy a red iPad though.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.120]   I really would.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.320]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.320]   Product red.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.200]   Do that.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:59.160]   Here also from Apple Insider, SKUs for the iPad on women for the mini, wait a minute,
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.160]   what is?
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.040]   I think it's a similar source.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.040]   Same SKUs.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.000]   So this two sources, same thing.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.040]   I think this is pretty good.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:12.840]   24 SKUs is kind of amazing, but that means black, white, so forth.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:13.840]   Three memories.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:14.840]   30 and T.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.920]   That's not, that's really not so amazing.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:26.260]   One person familiar with the company and product inventory said the company's initial
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:29.800]   shipment suggest availability of the presumed entry level.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:35.440]   That would guess Wi-Fi P101 will be the biggest at launch.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:39.440]   Inventory list from a retailer last weekend suggested.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.200]   And this sounds credible.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:46.680]   And entry level Wi-Fi only, 8 gigabyte model, 250 bucks.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:47.680]   Does that sound correct?
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:48.680]   We said that back in March.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.600]   I believe it was one of our true.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.840]   I'm more set.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:53.840]   That's pretty competitive.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:47:00.840]   Now that's 50 bucks more than the Nexus 7 and the right and the Amazon Kindle.
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:06.720]   But I think if I remember correctly, the Nexus 7, the big 8 gigs was 200, right?
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.800]   Yeah, but I think most people were buying them at 16.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:11.680]   I think they had really, they had a lot of supply issues at $250.
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:15.200]   It didn't seem like people really, $199 was a great press event.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.560]   Right, but people are willing to pay $250 for more memory.
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.120]   Right, right.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:24.560]   Yeah, so I think that 250, I mean, 250, I think puts an incredible amount of pressure
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.560]   on the tablet market.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:27.560]   I mean, just a painful amount of pressure.
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:32.000]   I think that $199 is, again, just wipes the market out.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.560]   I don't think Apple's going to go down that far.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.760]   I think it'll probably be $249 or $299.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:43.080]   So are we saying four memory levels, 8, 16, 32 and 64?
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.080]   I think three is more left.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:50.640]   I think the same as iPod, 8, 32 and 64, they probably want to do 8 just to get the low
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:51.640]   price.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.640]   And I think Alex has been saying this for years, but if you look at Apple's advantage,
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.880]   it really is iTunes because they can take credit cards and sell content in more places
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:47:59.880]   than anybody else.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:03.240]   They have the iPad in 90 countries plus already.
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:07.000]   And if you look at that compared to where you can get a Nexus 7, the Nexus 7 is okay in
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   Canada.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.160]   It's really bad in a lot of countries.
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:11.800]   The Kindle Fire is a paperweight in Canada.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:14.760]   And that sees your market.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:20.040]   If you have to rely on selling content to get your product in there, your product always
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:23.920]   lags behind your content where Apple can sell an iPad anywhere because they're selling
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:24.920]   it at margin.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:27.560]   And then when the content's available, people just start buying it.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:32.360]   And remember that all the press ever says is, and all the ads ever say is starting at
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:34.000]   $249.00.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.680]   And that's what you, that's the number that you want.
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:39.240]   And I think that's a good number.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.480]   That's a hell of a number.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:42.480]   Gets me interested.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:45.120]   I probably buy one at two, I probably, now here's the other thing.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:48.480]   I don't think you need as much memory as you used to because you're streaming everything,
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:49.480]   right?
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:54.000]   I think that the only, the only issue is we're working on a lot of iBooks right now.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.840]   And the one issue you get into is books.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.640]   You know, so books are big.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.040]   People forget books are five gigs, six gigs are huge.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.640]   Well, some of these iBooks can be very, very large.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:06.160]   You don't need a couple of them to fill up an eight gig.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:11.360]   So it's something that, I mean, we're back to in a lot of ways content size management
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:15.560]   again, which is what we had to deal with with CD-ROMs and the web and everything else.
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:18.800]   So just really how hard can we push a lot of these videos to get them to fit that much
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:21.440]   into a given product?
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.440]   They are redown laudable.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:23.440]   Those are a few deleted book.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:26.080]   You can redownload it from iBooks and then put another book on.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:28.320]   So it's easier than it wasn't previously.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:32.360]   And I believe in that product list, there was a skew for Apple's, you know, by 20 at a
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.880]   time education bundle.
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.800]   So I think they're really meaning us.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:36.800]   They really are.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:37.640]   Memory serves, yeah.
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:40.640]   How interesting.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:46.240]   Now you said iMacs and I have been getting calls on the radio show every weekend now.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.200]   People saying, should I buy an iMac?
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:52.960]   And I, my answer was, well, wait till this event, because this is the last chance Apple
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:55.480]   has to announce anything this year.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.520]   You think they'll announce an iMac?
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.120]   I've heard that there's an iMac.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:01.120]   I'm not the only one.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.760]   There've been several people who've heard that there was an iMac.
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:06.840]   A Chinese site recently published that it will be a redesigned iMac that'll use the same
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:11.040]   lamination technology in the panel that they use in the retina Mac books to make it really
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.560]   like almost Tony Stark thin.
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.960]   I don't know if they'll do that this year, though.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:19.440]   At worst, it'll probably be the spec bump where they put the latest chipset in there
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:22.160]   and the latest internals and the latest connectors.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.520]   They've got to do that.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.520]   They've got to guess.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:27.120]   Ivy Bridge in there, USB 3.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:30.240]   I think Apple's done with larger hardware.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.080]   I think that what we're going to see is performance increases.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.760]   I don't expect form factors to change for the iMac or the Mac Mini.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.400]   I'll probably live to regret saying that.
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:41.080]   Doesn't the iMac sell really well in the home?
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.520]   Isn't this a great home computer?
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.880]   Don't people really buy a lot?
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:44.880]   I don't know.
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.360]   I mean, I haven't looked at the numbers.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.800]   A laptop with a connected to a monitor.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.800]   Before you came here, that's what we were just saying.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.360]   I'm about to get a Thunderbolt display.
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:57.240]   We have a lot of-- I don't know how many Mac Minis we have.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:58.240]   We have a lot of them.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:02.440]   We use them as utility tools.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.520]   A lot of times we want to put monitors in places.
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:07.520]   We'll have a raise of 20 or 30 monitors on a location that show--
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.520]   I've seen your setup.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:10.520]   So like NASA.
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:12.520]   So a lot of them--
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.520]   Do you use Minis for those?
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.320]   Yeah, we use Mac Minis for those.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.320]   Okay.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.320]   That's what you were saying, Renee, the colo.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:22.960]   I don't know if there's only one that I know of, but maybe there's others hosting companies
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.880]   that you just have Minis.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:27.440]   It's a mini back mini based hosting company.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:32.280]   And now that the performance for a lot of these chips have gotten so fast, I mean,
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.640]   what we really-- I don't need a Mac Mini to change in the size.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:36.800]   I don't want it to get any bigger.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:40.920]   I just want it to be-- just put the newest chips in, make it a little bit faster, and
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:41.920]   I'll buy them.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:42.920]   You know, because--
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:43.920]   I'll be--
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:44.920]   You know, for render farms especially.
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:45.920]   For that.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:47.920]   It's just a really great solution.
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:51.160]   And you'll be able to connect external drives because those SSD won't be very big, but you'll
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:54.760]   be able to connect external drives to give it massive capacity, right?
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:57.680]   Well, you have Thunderbolt connectors.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:02.120]   I think we can assume if one comes out, we'll probably see two, like we see with the retina.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:07.280]   And the retina, you know, which is really our workhorse at this point, you know, the
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.280]   two Thunderbolts.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.720]   You've got a lot of retinas?
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:12.720]   We have a lot of retinas.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:13.720]   I think we have-- I don't want to talk about it.
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.440]   The 13 must make you happy.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.440]   Sorry?
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:18.280]   The 13 inch must make you happy.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:21.120]   If it comes out-- yeah, I mean, we don't care about the-- I don't care about the--
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.120]   the screen resolution.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.200]   In fact, you know, I just care about the connections.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.320]   And having two Thunderbolts and an HDMI out is just--
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.320]   Ah.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.320]   Yeah, we should.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:33.320]   You know, that's-- to us, that the CPUs, I mean, our retinas most of the time are outperforming
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:37.520]   our towers, which were best in class when we bought them.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.520]   You know, I mean, 16 cores.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:43.520]   No, my Mac Pro is underpowered compared to my laptop.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.520]   And so--
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.520]   I'm giving it to my son.
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:51.000]   The important question is, how do we just-- I just-- I got a 15 inch Mac retina Mac
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.680]   Pro and I now have to justify getting the 13 inch because--
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:54.680]   Right.
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:55.840]   No, it's your job.
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:56.840]   This is just my excuse.
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:59.120]   Um, hey, I got him.
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.320]   You've heard of that site, imore.com?
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.480]   That's me.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.480]   That's all.
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.480]   Done.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:05.480]   Done.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:08.800]   You just have to think of some project or some group of projects.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:12.600]   Alex is great because Alex just buys every-- I have never seen-- it's so funny because
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.600]   I don't know when people know we share studio space.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.440]   Alex has a portion of the brick house.
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:18.640]   And there's boxes every day.
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:22.120]   It's so disappointed I come in and I see FedEx and UPS boxes.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:25.120]   My oh high and my heart goes bit of pat, I think, oh good, oh good.
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:28.280]   And it's all pixel core, pixel core.
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:30.120]   We have a lot of needs.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.120]   We're growing--
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.120]   We have needs.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.120]   They're busy.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.520]   Come on, tell us, how many retinas?
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:36.520]   Do you know?
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:37.520]   Half of them.
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:38.520]   Half of them.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:41.120]   I think we have 18 right now.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.120]   Wow.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:48.120]   And they're not-- and they're like totally the ones that are like totally maxed out.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.400]   And you don't open them, probably.
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:50.400]   You just got them plugged in.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.560]   No, no, no, we use them.
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:52.560]   We use them all the time.
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:54.280]   In fact, I don't know where they all are at this point.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.280]   They're all spread all over the world.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.800]   We have operators using them all over the world.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:01.400]   So they are literally the core of our production pipe.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:02.400]   Dang.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:08.560]   So you know, they-- you can't-- I mean, it's just I've never-- there's never been as functional
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:09.760]   a computer for me.
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:17.440]   What if they make an iMac that has exactly-- it's not retina, but it has a 20-- because
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:21.320]   you have to buy a display for your-- I guess you don't use the retina display.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.320]   We use them when we need to.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:26.000]   I mean, we output-- because you have an HDMI out, it's just so easy to plug it into anything
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.120]   that you need to connect it to.
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:30.320]   I have absolutely no interest in iMacs at this point.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.920]   I mean, we have a lot of those two, but the--
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.720]   No more.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:40.680]   But I really-- we like the Mac Mini's because we can customize our display systems and really
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:42.200]   decide where we're going to put those monitors.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:46.080]   Having the monitor attached to the computer is not necessarily, at this point, advantageous
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.080]   to us.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.080]   It just limits what we can do with it.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:54.240]   Do you really think that Apple will kill-- I mean, what if Apple made a almost bezel-less
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:55:01.040]   super-thin iMac with-- I mean, wouldn't that be a big seller?
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:05.640]   If they made it 46 inches, I would just call it a TV, and then I'd be happy with it.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:09.480]   I mean, I think that's making a really big iMac and calling it a TV would-- that would
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.320]   be useful to me.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:15.960]   But you know, I have a-- because I have an iMac connected to my-- I have a TV at my
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:16.960]   home office.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:20.600]   I have like a conference area where we can teleconference with folks.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.120]   And a big TV.
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:27.920]   And I have an Apple TV and a Mac Mini kind of beating into two of the HDMI inputs.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.280]   And it's just-- to me, that's the way to go.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:34.240]   And I have-- so I have the Mac operating system on this big TV, and I'm able to do whatever
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:38.280]   I need to do and download stuff and access stuff and do the conferencing that we want
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:39.280]   to do.
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.720]   And I think that-- so Apple-- if they really want to get into TVs, I think thinking about
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:44.440]   iMacs as TVs I think is great.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:48.520]   I think that that 27-inch form factor-- I don't think that's-- I only guess the solution for
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.520]   the future of schools.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:52.480]   I think a lot of them are going to have-- again, are going to be tablet-based.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.800]   No, I'm thinking purely as a home computer.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:56.880]   I still think a Mac Mini is better.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:58.440]   I mean, here's the deal.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:00.360]   Your iMac goes bad.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.360]   Your screen goes bad.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:04.880]   And now you're going to deal with-- it would cost you-- like, we buy the cheapest mon-- I
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:08.280]   mean, we have a couple of like, color correct monitors that are $1,000.
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.280]   Right.
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:14.400]   But the rest of them, you know, what we do is we get a-- we buy really cheap Samsung
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:21.520]   or Asus monitors that, you know, that they're $250, $200.
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:24.560]   We then use a spider, the spider, little color corrector.
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:29.080]   And you pop that thing on, you plug it into your computer, it gets very close to a very--
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:33.840]   to a good accurate picture or accurate enough for what we do.
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:34.840]   And it's fine.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:37.920]   Like, it's-- it just totally works.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:38.920]   And so-- and they're cheap.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:44.320]   And when they go bad and we ship them, and I mean, you know, they're just-- they're
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:49.360]   the monitor end of it is-- I wouldn't say disposable, but-- but, you know, you-- the
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:54.240]   core of your computer is all, you know, is-- continues to work and you continue to do
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:55.800]   whatever you're going to do with monitors.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:00.200]   And I just-- I don't like the idea that I could take really good care of my-- my iMac
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.280]   screen, you know, that type of thing.
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:04.760]   And I just got sent to Link.
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:09.320]   Clayton Morris from Fox News had the new iMac rumor up on September 7th.
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:12.360]   But it doesn't look like retina for the reasons we discussed earlier.
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:13.360]   It's just a big--
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:17.840]   It's just an update to-- that would be the easiest thing.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:21.200]   Make it Ivy Bridge and just leave it at that.
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:27.040]   And of course, Tim Cook pushed the Mac Pro story down the road said next year.
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:31.800]   And I'm sure conveniently next year they'll forget it and push it down the road some more.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:32.800]   I think you're right, Alex.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:34.840]   I don't think they want to make big ones anymore.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:35.840]   But--
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.200]   But they ever said they were going to-- was there ever really-- I mean, Steve never said
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.200]   we're going to make a TV.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:40.200]   He said we've licked it.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:42.000]   But he never said we're going to make a TV.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   Did he?
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.800]   The original TV rumor ended up being the 27-inch iMac.
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:49.200]   And we heard that when the original rumor started.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:52.360]   And because they were buying large panels and people thought TV, but the large panel
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:53.360]   was for an iMac.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.000]   And maybe there'll be a 32-inch iMac one day.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   And I think Alex is right.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.800]   That's a much more attractive solution.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.720]   But the television is an interesting market.
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:02.720]   And--
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:03.720]   I don't think they want to be in that market.
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:07.160]   It's not an Apple-type disruption market at this point.
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:11.600]   Why do TV-- yeah, just do a media device, maybe.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.600]   Or the Mac mini?
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.360]   Airplay goes west to a lot of TV problems.
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:17.880]   Yeah, I mean, I still think the Apple TV-- I mean, I think that Apple could add some.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:23.480]   So I know that I still hate having to deal with the process of a TV, even just to get
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.640]   to my Apple TV.
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:34.200]   And so that whole controller, mix model, VOD, all of those things are just annoying.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.360]   And I think it is a weak market.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.420]   I think it's like a phone where everyone was adding all these features and no one was actually
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:39.420]   using them.
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:45.860]   I think that the TV is a very, very weak market and could be disrupted fairly quickly by
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:51.620]   people who are willing to pay a little bit more for a larger or sharper screen or something
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:54.020]   totally integrated where they don't have to plug it in.
[00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:55.020]   I don't know what Apple--
[00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:56.020]   I don't know what Apple--
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:59:01.940]   I think they have to get this-- I think they get the Apple TV 3 or 4 or whatever totally
[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:09.260]   piped in and totally working as a TV replacement before we see any kind of actual TV.
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:11.220]   They have no reason to do it right now.
[00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:13.020]   We're all using our Apple TVs.
[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:17.580]   I think most people I know at this point have-- and we're in Northern California, so it doesn't
[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:18.580]   really count.
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:20.260]   But a lot of people I know have Apple TVs.
[00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:25.660]   You just kind of think about that as another small device that gets you some of the content.
[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:31.260]   For me, I probably use Netflix on my Apple TV more than anything else on that it provides.
[00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:32.260]   Yep.
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:33.260]   I have fine.
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:34.260]   I have fine.
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:35.660]   I English from Kicking Bear had a really good-- it was a really interesting concept about
[00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:40.220]   the TV because no one wants to line up at an Apple store and buy a new TV every year.
[00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:42.980]   He thought they might just separate out the two products.
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:44.580]   You would keep getting better Apple TVs.
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:48.220]   You'd have the option to buy an Apple panel when and if you ever wanted to replace the
[00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:49.820]   actual panel in your living room.
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:52.740]   But then instead of going to buy the next one next year, you just get the updated box
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:53.740]   that sits next to it.
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:56.140]   It's all the guts and the software on it.
[00:59:56.140 --> 01:00:00.780]   I just think that the only thing about it is that the iOS is so small and so easy to
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:01.780]   package.
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:05.180]   If you're going to build a panel, you might as well build it into it.
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:10.420]   It doesn't seem like you get a whole lot out of not building the whole panel or building
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:14.900]   a little hole in the back or a little thing where you can just attach your Apple TV.
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:16.220]   That might be the way to do it.
[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:23.340]   But to have it, it just seems like it's so easy once you have that much real estate to
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:24.340]   make it work.
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:27.180]   It seems like that would be the easiest thing to do.
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.180]   Maybe not.
[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:29.780]   Here, I forgot-- and we started talking about it.
[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:34.300]   I didn't give you the final information on the price on a Windows RT tablet.
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:39.780]   But finally, you can replace your iPad with something that's powerful and modern.
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:47.300]   Windows RT is strikingly priced at $499 for the Wi-Fi version without keyboard.
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:53.820]   Oh, yeah, that's $129 more if you want the Surface type cover.
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:57.420]   That only comes apparently in black.
[01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:59.580]   I guess I have to pre-order this.
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:09.340]   So I'm going to spend $530 basically on the 32 gig Windows RT pre-order for now for delivery
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:12.340]   on 1026.
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:13.340]   That's the price.
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:15.260]   And it goes up from there, 64 gigs.
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:19.820]   If you want to max it out, 64 gigs with the Surface type cover.
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:21.820]   Don't confuse the touch cover with the type cover.
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:24.580]   Touch cover is like Apple Smart cover.
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.620]   If you want the keyboard, you got to get the type cover.
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:27.620]   Well, you have two.
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:30.140]   The keyboard that's actually flat on the cover.
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:31.140]   So it's not real.
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.140]   It's a virtual kind of keyboard.
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:35.340]   And then you have an actual clickety-clackety keyboard for more.
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:37.060]   There's a clickety-clackety keyboard?
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:38.300]   I think it's slightly clickety-clackety.
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:39.300]   So the touch cover--
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.300]   I'm confused.
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:41.300]   It's like a logic tech.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:42.300]   It's like the--
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:43.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.300]   The touch cover has a keyboard.
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.300]   But it's just a little chicklet thing.
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:47.300]   Yeah.
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.300]   Well, it's virtual, I think, on the touch.
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.300]   It's not even real.
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.940]   It's just got keys on there.
[01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:51.940]   Okay.
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.940]   And then if you want the type cover, then it's a little more clickety-clackety.
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:57.580]   I don't think clickety-clackety is probably the word.
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:58.580]   Take any talkety.
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:01:59.580]   Not sure.
[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:02.180]   The touch cover you could type on.
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:03.180]   Okay.
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:04.180]   Got it.
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.180]   But if you want a type--
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.180]   That's the thing that's so complicated.
[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:08.180]   I can't--
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:11.180]   I'm in the business and I'm confused.
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:13.100]   I know people are going to buy something they didn't want.
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:14.260]   I really do.
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:15.260]   All right.
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:16.260]   And you can only get--
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:19.220]   By the way, the base price is--
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:22.340]   This is now-- this is really kind of stupid.
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:24.460]   You get a black touch cover for the base price.
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:29.660]   But if you want any other color, you'll pay 120 bucks more.
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:32.580]   So if you want red-- this is like apple pricing.
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:35.580]   You want red, you have to pay 120 bucks more.
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.780]   Apple wouldn't give you the free one.
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:38.780]   That's true.
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:41.140]   They pay-- but it's 30 bucks for this market.
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:42.140]   But you can't type.
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:43.140]   Yeah.
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:44.140]   Yet.
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:45.140]   Yet.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:46.140]   No.
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:47.140]   Mm.
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:48.140]   Mm.
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:49.540]   You know something I know?
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:51.260]   No, I don't even know if Apple would do this.
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:52.260]   Apple tends--
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:53.260]   Apple doesn't just think--
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:54.660]   I want you to do that.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:55.660]   No.
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:56.660]   Apple is very smart.
[01:02:56.660 --> 01:03:00.940]   They never mistake their products for their business, where I get this feeling that Microsoft
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:05.140]   really thinks that Windows is everything and has to tie everything into their-- often
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:09.380]   that creates the confusion and convolution that we then have to try to explain to people.
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:10.380]   Yeah.
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:11.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:13.100]   Come back with more.
[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:16.140]   We got Renee Richie here from imore.com.
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:21.660]   Also, Alex Lindsey from Washington, D.C.
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:23.260]   The nation's capital.
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:25.420]   Is there a debate coming up?
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:26.420]   There is a debate tonight.
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:27.420]   Tonight.
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:28.420]   It's not here in D.C.
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:30.500]   I think it's in Kentucky, I think, or in--
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.500]   Uh, OK.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.740]   So you're not there for that?
[01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:33.740]   I'm not.
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:34.740]   You are wearing a jacket.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:35.740]   You look very sharp.
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:36.740]   I am.
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:37.740]   Well, I thank you.
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:38.740]   I'm in D.C.
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:39.740]   So this is kind of the--
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:40.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:41.740]   I felt like I just felt like walking around the street.
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:42.740]   I felt like I should be really wearing a suit.
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:45.860]   I know there are people watching right now who are thinking, OK, I really think I might
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:48.020]   want to buy, but I'm not sure the new iPad.
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:49.220]   I want to see the details.
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:52.420]   They're trying to decide what to do about it.
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:57.780]   Maybe the way to get the new iPad would be to sell your old iPad, or maybe you've got
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.500]   an old 3GS lying around.
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:02.820]   This is the way to do it, gazelle.com.
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:06.100]   And this actually takes all the pain out of it, because you can get a quote now that's
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:09.340]   good for 30 days and decide next week what you want to do.
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:11.700]   You don't have to mail it right away.
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.300]   I don't think that's-- I don't think that's wrong.
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:19.300]   I think that's just taking advantage of their business model.
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:24.780]   30-day free quote right now, non-binding, if you go to gazelle.com.
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:25.780]   You got the-- you know what?
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:31.020]   I think there are a lot of people sitting there with a second generation Wi-Fi iPad,
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:35.620]   and they bought it a while ago, and they're saying, I want the new one, 280 bucks.
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:36.820]   How about that?
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:40.540]   For the Wi-Fi version of the iPad 2.
[01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:44.380]   Now you've actually paid for your new iPad.
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.740]   Throw it in a box.
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:48.140]   They pay shipping.
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:49.540]   You don't have to pay extra for shipping.
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:51.620]   Anything worth more than a buck, they'll ship it free.
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:54.500]   Might as well throw more stuff in the box.
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:57.540]   They send you a mailing label, and then when you're ready, when you want to pull the trigger,
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:59.260]   when you've looked at the new iPad, you say, yep, you know what?
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:01.180]   I do want to get that.
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:02.340]   Then you can take advantage of it.
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:05.540]   So get that 30-day quote right now, because I got to tell you, the prices are not going
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:07.900]   up on any of this stuff.
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:09.420]   It's going down, down, down.
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:12.220]   But while it's still a rumor, you're going to get the maximum price.
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:16.860]   iPads, iPhones, if you've got a BlackBerry, they'll take it.
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:23.380]   If you've got a Samsung Galaxy S3 or S2, a Nokia, Motorola, an LG, an HTC phone, they'll
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.820]   pay you for it.
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:26.820]   Even old iPods.
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:28.860]   I just ordered the new iPod Nano.
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:33.340]   I was thinking, though, it would be good to have an old touch if I could then use my
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:38.100]   Sonos stock and just make that part of the Sonos system.
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.820]   By the way, that's what happens to this.
[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:42.460]   Gazelle resells this stuff on their special eBay store.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:45.900]   So you might check that out if you want to do what I was thinking.
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:49.220]   Just keep that 30-pin connector using old iPods.train.
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:55.100]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, Gazelle.com.
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:59.020]   Now's the time to get that 30-day quote, lock it in.
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.060]   And by the way, you could even wait.
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:06.620]   You could get the new quote, order the new iPhone or the new iPad, wait till it comes,
[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:09.580]   transfer it over then send it in.
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:10.860]   That's the way to do it.
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:18.180]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, the place to get money, get cash for your old gadgets.
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:21.660]   Don't let that messy drawer build up stuff.
[01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:28.020]   Sell your used iPhone today at Gazelle.com and get that new iPhone 5 or the new iPad,
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:29.020]   we think.
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:32.900]   You reminded me of something, Leo.
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:33.900]   What's that?
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:39.220]   I'm not wrong, I believe the iPad Mini, if they do the cellular option for $130 extra,
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:44.140]   will be the only prominent 7-inch tablet with Wi-Fi and cellular.
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:48.580]   And I know I have an Nexus 7, too, and I really miss not having LTE on it because it's so
[01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:52.420]   portable, I take it everywhere and then I'm not on Wi-Fi, I can't use it and I get sad.
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:53.420]   Good selling point.
[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:57.420]   I stopped buying the 3G because I use it so minimally and then I always have a hotspot
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:58.420]   on my phone.
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:01.700]   So I just figure, well, I'll just pay for it once.
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:04.780]   iPhone 5's got LTE on it and I'll just use that.
[01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:08.300]   I use the hotspot on my iPad instead because it's so big, it's such a big battery and then
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:09.300]   it's phones for the month.
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:10.300]   Battery life.
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:11.300]   Yeah, battery life, you're smart.
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:12.300]   Yeah.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.300]   Same thing.
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:19.020]   I find that I use the 3G, I've traveled a lot, so I use the 3G so much.
[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:22.380]   Just needing to be somewhere trying to find directions in a car or I don't want to try
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:26.340]   to figure out how to connect it and so I tend to get some kind of connection.
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:30.500]   4G, LTE, that type of thing.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.500]   Awesome.
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:35.260]   Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.260]   just looking down.
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:37.740]   I want to make sure I get all the rumors.
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:40.380]   Don't want to miss a single rumor.
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:41.500]   Has anybody got the new Nano?
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:42.500]   I ordered it.
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:43.500]   I thought it would come by now.
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.620]   I see the Verge has their first review of it.
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.140]   Renee, do you have your Nano yet?
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:48.140]   Yes.
[01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:49.140]   I'm in the middle of reviewing them.
[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:50.140]   Oh, look.
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:51.140]   Look.
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:52.140]   It's pretty.
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:54.140]   I bought a red one too, product red.
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:55.340]   What do you think?
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:58.580]   They're totally renanowed according to the copywriters at Apple.com.
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:07:59.580]   Totally renanowed.
[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:00.580]   Whatever that means.
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:01.900]   They must have a great time.
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:03.460]   No, I mean, it's really nice.
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:07.340]   It looks, they made it look a little more different than iOS because it doesn't run iOS.
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:08.340]   It runs the same operating system.
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:10.900]   So, round icons that way, you know, the difference.
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:11.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:12.900]   But it's really nice.
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:13.900]   It's got a built-in pedometer now.
[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:14.900]   It still does videos.
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:15.900]   There's no iCloud.
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:19.220]   So, I've gotten so used to just setting up iCloud and having all my stuff there.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.140]   The idea of syncing with iTunes feels so...
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.340]   You mean there's no match?
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:23.340]   I guess not.
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:24.580]   They'd have to put a radio on it.
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:25.580]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:26.580]   Well, it's got Bluetooth.
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:27.580]   It's got Bluetooth 4.0.
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:33.380]   You notice, but on the iPhone, on iOS 6, under privacy, there's this setting that has nothing
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:35.460]   in it yet called Bluetooth sharing.
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:37.700]   And it said there'll be a list of things that share your...
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:40.380]   That can share application data over Bluetooth.
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:44.260]   So, I'm hoping that there'll be a way to beam stuff or just connect stuff eventually
[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.260]   there.
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:46.260]   But they're really nice.
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:47.260]   They're super thin.
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:50.860]   They look like tiny Nokia 920s.
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:53.100]   Very interesting devices.
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:54.100]   Interesting.
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:09:01.700]   I just seem like such a retro move, but...
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.860]   I think they're for retro people though, Leo.
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:04.860]   They're still carrying my iPads.
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:05.860]   Who buys iPads?
[01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:06.860]   Yeah.
[01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:07.860]   And kids.
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:08.860]   Athletes.
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:09.860]   Athletes.
[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:10.860]   I'm not that expensive.
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:11.860]   Yeah.
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:12.860]   I mean, I...
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:17.620]   Do you think that the wearable one is still to come next year?
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:20.540]   Was that Peter Rojas, I think it was, who said that on gadget?
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:23.300]   That don't assume Apple's leaving this wearable market behind.
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:29.180]   They're replacing the old sort of wearable nano with this thing that's clearly not wearable
[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:32.980]   so that they can release a wearable iPod next year.
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:33.980]   Or wearable iPhone.
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:34.980]   Why not?
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:36.900]   Apple's not often at the forefront of...
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:41.580]   They tend to let other companies do the crazy trial and error period of technology.
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:42.580]   And then they come in and...
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:43.580]   You're right.
[01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:45.580]   Yeah, their secret is taking crazy NFC.
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:47.140]   That's never going anywhere.
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.860]   That crazy NFC stuff.
[01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:49.860]   Why bother?
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:50.860]   Yeah.
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:56.900]   But the original iPhone had no 3G, had no GPS, it had no apps, it had almost nothing that
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:10:01.380]   a Trio 680 had yet it had a compelling user experience and it took their time and added
[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:02.380]   features.
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:03.380]   It's like with Fordly.
[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:06.660]   You know, you go to CDS every year and Ford says, "Yeah, we have cars that can do crazy
[01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:11.540]   things but people would be scared so we have to introduce one feature at a time very slowly."
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.540]   They actually do...
[01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:15.260]   Apple does not have this luxury.
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:18.300]   One of the things they do is they say, "Well, we figure you'll have a new phone every few
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:19.940]   years, let that thing be updated."
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:23.660]   As long as we can talk to that, we give you an API for people who can develop apps and
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:25.740]   put them on the phone so they can talk to the car.
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:28.660]   We'll let that be the agent of change.
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:30.140]   And Apple does that.
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:31.980]   I mean, their design is just getting more and more refined.
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:33.380]   There's no radically new iPhones.
[01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:37.740]   They're just going closer to that original iPhone prototype from 2005 and Apple keeps
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:42.220]   saying that software is the key and iOS 6 is nothing but a big gamble on software being
[01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:43.220]   differentiated.
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:44.220]   Right.
[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:48.060]   I do have to say, and I just a word of warning as beautiful as the iPhone 5 is and it really
[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.980]   is like a fine watch.
[01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:50.980]   It's delicate as hell.
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:56.620]   I at first poo-pooed the scratch and Nick crew, but I have literally all...
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:57.940]   You've been destroying yours.
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:59.420]   And I haven't dropped it or anything.
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:02.260]   I have nicks all the way around the bezel now.
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:03.260]   Do you...
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.660]   Like somebody's been in your pocket with keys?
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:06.820]   No, I keep it in my breast pocket.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:09.020]   I don't drop it.
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:12.140]   It's too bad because you don't really don't want to put these in cases because they're
[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:16.420]   beautiful but it looks like somebody's been gnawing on it and it's only been two weeks.
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:17.580]   And I put mine in.
[01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:22.500]   I've had to admit my iPhone 4 as I put in my pocket with keys and change and everything
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:25.940]   else and it doesn't look like it's lost much at all.
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:26.940]   Yeah.
[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:27.940]   Maybe I'm just told...
[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:29.300]   Maybe I'm hard on it but I didn't...
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:35.180]   I have no nicks, dings or scratches on any of the old iPhones.
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:36.180]   It's anodized aluminum.
[01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:40.660]   It's a thin sheen of black over aluminum and it's going to chip.
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.660]   I mean, that's just physics.
[01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:42.660]   It's mostly the bezel.
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:43.860]   The back's fine.
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:44.860]   It's this little...
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:47.180]   In fact, it's all the bezel.
[01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:48.940]   That must be particularly soft.
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:51.300]   I don't know what it's made of but it's kept out.
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:54.580]   My first one came shipped and I took it back to the opposite and they exchanged it for me.
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:55.580]   No questions asked.
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:59.580]   You're the reason everybody's going crazy at Foxconn.
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:05.620]   I don't know if this is accurate or not because Foxconn's denying they've been any work stoppages
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:10.180]   but there are reports of work stoppages by workers who say you're asking too much of
[01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:11.180]   us.
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:13.220]   We cannot make these perfect.
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:15.420]   It's too hard at that speed.
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:17.100]   Yeah, at that speed.
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:22.100]   Yeah, and it's unclear what's happening there but it does appear that if there is a work
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:24.580]   stoppage, I think we talked about it a little bit last week.
[01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:31.060]   It is an issue that's related to conflicts between the QA folks and the folks that are
[01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:38.500]   making it that at this point the level of detail required for these phones is just insane.
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:42.540]   And of course, people are working very, very long hours and having them sent back, I'm
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:47.740]   sure that there's a lot connected to their pay and their comfort and the amount of trouble
[01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:52.780]   they get into related to how many of their phones come back to them because they weren't
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:54.740]   completely correctly.
[01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:55.740]   And that seems to be-
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:13:00.540]   There were lots of reports of like yours, Renee, of Ding, Diaphone 5's.
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:02.620]   Apple, of course, replaces them, right?
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:03.620]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:04.620]   Yeah.
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:08.660]   Somebody in the chat room says, "I sound like a grumpy old man."
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:12.140]   So what am I supposed to say?
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:13.140]   I love it.
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:14.140]   It's so beautiful.
[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:15.620]   It's perfect in every way.
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:21.060]   This is a wonderful phone and you should all buy five to match the number of the phone.
[01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:25.140]   My problem is I put them down on a dark table and then I can't find them for even minutes
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:26.140]   and minutes.
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:31.940]   It does disappear.
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:36.180]   Only buy an iPhone made on a Wednesday, says Stryker, which like cars because workers
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:41.980]   are hung over on Monday, they're just barely coming back on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday
[01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:42.980]   they leave early.
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:46.500]   So Wednesdays today to buy an iPhone 5.
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.340]   But how do you know when they were made?
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:49.340]   How would you know that?
[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:51.980]   You go through the boxes but they don't-
[01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:53.980]   It's not like they just wander through and start going through the-
[01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:57.100]   There's no eventually code on the box.
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:02.420]   Excuse me, I'd like to make sure that my iPhone was bought on Tuesday, man.
[01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:03.740]   I peruse your boxes.
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:06.740]   How do you like this?
[01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:14.820]   But according to Business Insider, the $12 billion dip, which is a new dance move, the
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:19.980]   $12 billion dip in Apple stock seems to have started with anonymous tweets from a single
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:23.340]   source in China.
[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:26.460]   And it's that strike that we don't know about.
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:30.140]   Bloomberg's Adam Mintner actually comes from Bloomberg, not Business Insider.
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:36.180]   Let's give credit to Adam as the original source of this.
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:40.020]   First of all, he says no one really knows if this strike happened.
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:44.300]   But the tweet about it, some say, is the reason for Apple stock.
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:46.220]   I don't think it's the only reason Apple stock went down.
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:49.140]   I think there's the sell on the news.
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:53.860]   I think that there's perhaps is concerned that despite the fact that this is selling
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:57.060]   better than any iPhone in prior history, Apple can't make enough of them.
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:59.460]   There's a supply chain issues.
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:00.460]   It's like that.
[01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:01.460]   It's drama.
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:05.060]   It happens all the time before an event, after an event goes up and down in waves.
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:06.060]   Exactly.
[01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:08.540]   Apple doesn't meet the numbers expected by analysts who don't understand how the business
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:10.580]   works and then it's an apocalypse.
[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:11.580]   Yes.
[01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:16.340]   One thing that I think the real problem is that Apple is so close to the ground.
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:21.420]   Their cash flow and cash supply of liquid assets is so tight.
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:22.420]   That's what they want.
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:23.420]   Yeah.
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:27.620]   They have to make sure that the stock market's happy because if there was a run, they'd
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:31.140]   of course run out of money because they don't have any in the bank.
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:32.540]   Wait a minute.
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:33.540]   They have $100 billion.
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:34.540]   Wait a minute.
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:35.540]   I'm sorry.
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:36.540]   I'm being a little sarcastic.
[01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:46.740]   I think we're going to see that they're now at $125 billion in the bank.
[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:52.020]   A $100 billion of it probably somewhere overseas.
[01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:55.460]   I think that they don't really need to pay attention to anyone at this point.
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:16:01.260]   I think that they do need to pay attention a lot to, again, to the building competition
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:02.780]   around the tablets.
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:06.860]   I think that's the one place that they have to deal with, but what the stock market thinks.
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:11.340]   These people, they sell on Pixar right before a movie is released because it hasn't made
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:12.340]   a lot of money in the market.
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:13.340]   Right.
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:14.340]   Right.
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:15.340]   Because they were making the movie.
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:17.700]   It was going to make a quarter of a billion dollars.
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:21.660]   People assume that stock market is somehow magically accurate.
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.860]   Here is the wisdom of the crowd's notion.
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:27.180]   I think over long terms it might be, but not over short term.
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:28.260]   It's way too violent.
[01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:32.260]   So now, have you thrown out your packaging materials, Renee?
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:33.260]   Save them.
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:34.260]   I have carefully re-sliced.
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:38.020]   I keep any box for an Apple product for far longer than I sometimes keep the product
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:39.020]   in case.
[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:40.020]   But look what Mashable did.
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:45.460]   They took the holder for the earbuds and they put them in water.
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:48.100]   Apparently they just biodegrade.
[01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:51.700]   I don't think great for a school project.
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:55.260]   But I mean, this isn't like cardboard gets wet.
[01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:59.740]   This is like, if they turn into sea monkeys, it would be very impressive.
[01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:01.700]   That would be awesome.
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:04.020]   It's pliable and then falls apart after a few minutes.
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:07.740]   The result is pulp.
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:12.380]   But the ear pod case, then what you do, I don't know, somehow it's magic.
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:13.380]   Apple.
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:16.620]   It's interesting because the iPods don't come with the same quality headset that comes
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:20.260]   with the iPhone, the iPhone gets the plastic box and the mic and remote.
[01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:24.540]   And the iPods come in that little paper cardboardy thing with no remote or mic.
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:26.900]   So you only do that with the iPod packaging.
[01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:33.900]   So according to Apple and the environment, Apple's using new tapioca paper cases.
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.900]   It's packaging.
[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:37.260]   I wonder if it tastes like tapioca.
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:39.260]   So you're not eating it.
[01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:40.260]   You know, that would be awesome.
[01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:41.540]   You know, wait, wait, wait.
[01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:46.220]   That would be great to have packaging that you could put into water, dissolve it, and
[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:47.220]   then eat it.
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:48.220]   Now that would be biodegradable.
[01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:50.780]   It'd be biodeable, edible.
[01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:57.740]   Millions of iPhone packages are made from renewable tapioca paper foam material.
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:00.540]   So there, in case you were wondering, do not eat it.
[01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:01.540]   I would like steak flavor myself.
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:05.500]   It could be tapioca base, but I wanted to taste like try to.
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.740]   I think you should sous vide that tapioca.
[01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:08.740]   See what happens.
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:12.860]   Yeah, but how few people would get would, you know, if you figured this all out, just
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:14.060]   think how people would throw stuff away.
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:15.620]   I mean, they'd be like, that's a meal.
[01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:16.620]   It's like a CB meal.
[01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:18.620]   It's a time for Halloween.
[01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:19.620]   It's perfect.
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:24.380]   Here kid, have some tapioca paper.
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:28.900]   This is relevant because Apple apparently now, although there's some dispute over this, is
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:31.780]   now E. Pete again, the E. Pete certification.
[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:33.940]   Remember, I pull withdrew from E. Pete briefly.
[01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:36.820]   There was a hue and a cry and Apple said, no, no, no, we're sorry.
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:37.820]   We take it back.
[01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:40.060]   We are now back in the E. Pete fold.
[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:49.100]   E. Pete is a certification that Apple was part of designing and the idea is their greener
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:50.100]   electronics.
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:53.980]   Apple apparently did pass the P test with their thin laptops.
[01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:55.860]   It sounds like E. Pete blinked.
[01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:57.420]   The standard seems to have gone down.
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:00.340]   I don't know if I'm being facetious or not, but I read somewhere that went down to basically
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:02.140]   if you have a USB port or something.
[01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:03.140]   No.
[01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:04.140]   I'm sort of a fire.
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:08.140]   Well, because E. Pete is not, it's the industry.
[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:09.140]   Yes.
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:14.700]   But, you know, not any third party, independent third party.
[01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:15.700]   It's not Greenpeace.
[01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:17.700]   It's to make you feel better.
[01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:21.060]   Oh, no, we make it out of tapioca.
[01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:22.060]   It's okay.
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:25.300]   But it's important for Apple because a lot of governments and other institutions will
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:27.060]   not buy unless you are E. Pete certified.
[01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:30.300]   So it's important they have the stamp regardless of what that stamp actually means.
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:31.300]   Right.
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:32.300]   Let's see.
[01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:35.500]   E. Pete development team advisory council board of directors.
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.740]   Let's see who's on the E. Pete board.
[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:48.540]   An attorney, somebody with a MBA, Polymers Inc., Walt Disney, Hasbro, call to recycle.
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:49.540]   I don't know who they are.
[01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:50.540]   That's the board of directors.
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:55.820]   Let's see who the advisory council is for E. Pete.
[01:19:55.820 --> 01:20:07.100]   USGSA, Best Buy, German company, scientist and director of the Center for Energy Efficiency
[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:08.340]   of the NRDC.
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:09.820]   That's good.
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:12.980]   Hewlett Packard, Hugo New Corporation.
[01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:13.980]   Yeah.
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:18.940]   There's some people in here that have some interest in sustainability.
[01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:21.220]   Dell, Staples.
[01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:24.700]   Mostly though, it seems like it's an industry council.
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:28.700]   So, "blinked" is maybe not the right word.
[01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:31.260]   Don't worry about it.
[01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:32.500]   You're going to get certified.
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:33.500]   It's not a problem.
[01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:34.500]   Stay in the E.P. please.
[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:41.500]   And you hear the beers clink together and you hear the bass clink together.
[01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:45.580]   Foxconn does admit that it breached Chinese labor laws by hiring 14-year-old interns.
[01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:47.060]   We hire 14-year-old interns.
[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:51.980]   So, I think it's time for me to admit that we are in breach of the Chinese labor laws
[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:53.940]   here at the Twid Brick House.
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:54.940]   Right?
[01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:56.220]   Some of our interns are that young.
[01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:57.660]   I'm only 14 and a half.
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:03.340]   Chads like nothing.
[01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:06.100]   And then what was Singleton?
[01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:09.260]   This is something that happened in Toronto or Montreal.
[01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:15.860]   Yeah, Singleton is a conference that several local developers, Guy English, Scott Morrison,
[01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:18.780]   Luke Vondal and Petra Mueller, put together.
[01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:23.460]   And basically, they just bring a ton of people who do Mac and iOS software.
[01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:26.500]   They have developers, designers, media types.
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.500]   Jason Snell did this year's keynote.
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.300]   Glenn Flechman was there.
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.540]   Marco Arment was there.
[01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:32.540]   Wow.
[01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:34.140]   Great.
[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:36.900]   It was absolutely fantastic.
[01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:38.700]   And the theme this year was on scaling.
[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:43.060]   So it was how you handle scaling, how Apple handles scaling.
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:47.740]   Dan Morin and Lex Friedman did a fantastic presentation about how Apple being huge sucks
[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:49.780]   for us, sucks for developers, sucks for Apple.
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:50.780]   Yeah, of course.
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:51.780]   Of path.
[01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:52.780]   I don't know who the other guy was.
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:55.260]   Dan Morin, Lex, we're both Mac world editors.
[01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:56.820]   Oh, that, Dan Morin.
[01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:57.820]   Yeah, that's Dan Morin.
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:21:58.820]   Not Dave Morin.
[01:21:58.820 --> 01:21:59.820]   Somebody else.
[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:03.700]   But they said it's better than Apple being small because that was no good for anybody.
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:04.700]   Yeah.
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:07.220]   No, I'm glad Apple's doing well.
[01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:10.340]   And you want everybody to do well.
[01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:11.340]   So there's nice competition.
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:17.500]   In fact, Eric Schmidt even says, the defining fight in the technology industry today is
[01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:20.020]   Apple versus Android.
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:22.860]   He said this at all things Deconference.
[01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:28.260]   But I don't think he said that in couch in competition is good.
[01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:30.580]   You've not seen platform fights at these scales.
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:33.980]   He said, the beneficiary is you guys.
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:35.620]   Consumers prices are dropping rapidly.
[01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:36.980]   That's a wonderful value proposition.
[01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:38.980]   Yeah, he is saying that.
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:40.500]   All right.
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:42.500]   He didn't want to talk about patent battles.
[01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:44.940]   He says, first of all, I don't understand the details.
[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:48.140]   Second, this topic makes me too upset.
[01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:51.420]   You want to hear from an executive chairman, right?
[01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:54.100]   It hurts my tummy to talk about patent.
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:57.220]   The patent lures are death, he says.
[01:22:57.220 --> 01:23:00.620]   He's almost like Steve Balmer from me now because every time he opens his mouth, you
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:03.780]   get days and days of headlines and parsing what he said.
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:04.780]   Yeah.
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:05.780]   But I do not disagree with this.
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:08.540]   He says, the impact of the patent wars are not bad for us.
[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:11.940]   Apple, Google and Samsung are big enough we could afford to protect our technologies.
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:13.580]   It's worse for small companies.
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:17.940]   He says, I think, quote, I think this is ultimately bad, bad for innovation.
[01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:19.940]   It eliminates choices.
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:20.940]   Couldn't agree more.
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:22.620]   I think he's absolutely right.
[01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:28.580]   He says, Apple did make a mistake giving up the Google map, obviously.
[01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:31.780]   They should have kept our maps.
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:34.780]   The fact of the matter is they decided a long time ago to do their own maps.
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:35.780]   And we saw this.
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:37.340]   This is finally, we now know this is true.
[01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:38.940]   We saw this coming with their acquisitions.
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:39.940]   We've been saying that.
[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:41.100]   Google, you knew.
[01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:42.940]   I think Apple has learned that maps are hard.
[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:48.420]   We invested hundreds of million dollars in satellite work, airplane work, drive by work.
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:50.940]   We don't call it drive by work, but just don't.
[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:54.900]   And we think that we have the best product in the industry.
[01:23:54.900 --> 01:24:01.540]   They asked Keras Swisher and Walt Mossberg said, well, are you making a new maps for iOS?
[01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:06.300]   I don't want to pre-announce products, but I can tell you that were we to do that, Apple
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:08.500]   would have to approve it.
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:11.020]   We're doing it.
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:12.020]   Yeah.
[01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:13.020]   Apple would approve it.
[01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:15.220]   If we work to do it, Apple will have to approve it.
[01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:17.420]   It's a non-answer.
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:21.300]   Or it's kind of like a little bit of like, well, it's up to Apple.
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:22.940]   But obviously, Apple's going to say yes.
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:24.660]   They can't afford to not to say yes.
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:28.620]   In fact, Apple, the same cook pointed everybody to Google and Bing said use their maps for
[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:31.220]   the time being.
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:36.620]   Schmitt said he still thinks of Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook as the gang of four.
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:39.140]   He's been saying that for a couple of years now.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:42.420]   Facebook is attempting to become the world's communication hub.
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:45.660]   Amazon is attempting to become the world's largest store.
[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:48.820]   I know Microsoft asks Walt Mossberger.
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:54.740]   Schmitt said, well, it's a well-run company, but they don't make state of the art products.
[01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:55.740]   Ouch.
[01:24:55.740 --> 01:25:00.620]   Well, the funny thing is I do think they make state of the art products.
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:03.380]   I just don't know if they mark them.
[01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:05.900]   I think Microsoft does make some state of the art technologies.
[01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:08.620]   I don't know if it ends up as they don't end up proddized.
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:12.260]   They don't end up, you know, there's a lot of technologies floating around there.
[01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:13.260]   They just don't end up.
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:14.260]   That's actually a very good point.
[01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:15.260]   Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:19.140]   They're photosynt, for example, amazing technology.
[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:22.100]   Which is the only place for iOS.
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:24.180]   There was a great talk at Singleton by Michael Lop.
[01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:26.740]   He used to work at Apple and now writes Rans and Repose.
[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:30.900]   He said that at every table, you need the designer, the developer and the dictator.
[01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:34.420]   The problem with Microsoft right now is since Gates left, there's no dictator.
[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:38.340]   There's no one with the clear vision and making the decisive choices to a clear and consistent
[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:39.340]   product line.
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:42.500]   Actually, Eric Schmidt has volunteered just so you know.
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:46.380]   He says, "If I was on the Apple board and I'll always have a soft spot for them."
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:49.420]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:51.820]   I was on the Apple board and I always have a soft spot for them.
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:54.020]   I was very good friends and very close to Steve Jobs.
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:55.460]   We miss him dearly.
[01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:58.860]   When they asked him if he wanted to be the CEO, he says, "Jeff Bezos has made remarkable
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:25:59.860]   moves.
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:03.100]   Facebook has a billion users."
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:06.820]   If you had to be CEO again, they asked, "Would you choose Apple, Amazon or Facebook?"
[01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:10.700]   And he said, "Apple, you know why?
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:12.900]   It has the most cash."
[01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:14.740]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:18.740]   It would take the longest run into the ground.
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:23.580]   I can do very little harm there and I can't wait to spend that money.
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:27.780]   Well, I do think one of the things that has made Apple very successful is how shrewd they
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:28.780]   are with that cash.
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:30.340]   I mean, they aren't one of those things.
[01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:32.700]   I think a lot of companies have made a lot of missteps.
[01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:38.060]   I think that Apple makes the stuff that they buy tends not to be crazy expensive.
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:42.460]   I mean, it's crazy expensive to us but not compared to their cash availability.
[01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:43.460]   Well, like Motorola.
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:47.860]   They're not trying to buy AT&T or something like that.
[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:54.260]   And so I think that that reasonableness I think has also been part of it.
[01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:57.300]   They're obviously making a lot of money but I think they're also not trying to buy their
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:58.300]   way out of a lot of things.
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:00.700]   I think they designed their way out of a lot of things.
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:04.140]   They're not buying Motorola.
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:05.140]   Smart.
[01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:07.620]   They did spend a little money on this though.
[01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:12.700]   They have licensed the use of the Swiss Railway Clock.
[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:18.460]   So if you were worried, you know, Apple and iOS 6 released a new clock application which
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:25.420]   had a striking resemblance to a trademark design for the Swiss Railway, National Railway
[01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:26.420]   SBB.
[01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:28.500]   SBB was very kind about it.
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:33.700]   They said, "Hey, we noticed that and I'm sure Apple make it right."
[01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:39.380]   In related news, iPads have become the new standard at the Swiss Railway for communication
[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:41.660]   and thinking everything.
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:46.700]   You know, that would make me, I would, a piece, we'll give you a thousand iPads.
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:47.700]   What do you say?
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:48.700]   Exactly.
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:52.540]   A thousand iPads, a thousand iPhones and we'll write an app for you that shows how accurate
[01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:53.540]   your subways.
[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:54.940]   The new ones, the mini.
[01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:55.940]   So love them.
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:56.940]   We swear.
[01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:57.940]   Yes.
[01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:00.140]   Brief take on privacy.
[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:02.500]   Then we'll get our picks of the week.
[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:09.020]   Apple has apparently, and we talked about this on Twitch and we found a very arcane way
[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:10.620]   of turning this off.
[01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:15.940]   In the iPhone 5 or an iOS 6, I should say, the company has once again started tracking
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:17.860]   its users.
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:24.300]   You are opted in to a new tracking technology called IFA or IDFA.
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:30.860]   Or the GUI or the, what was it, the GUID that was in the iPhone, Apple deprecated because
[01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:34.860]   it was a source of concern.
[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:41.540]   So they had basically stopped tracking iPhone users using, I'm not the GUID, the OGID.
[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:42.540]   That's the same idea.
[01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:46.980]   Permanent non-deletable serial number that identifies every Apple device for the last
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:50.380]   few months, iPhone users have not been tracked.
[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:55.460]   However, in iOS 6, it's back on, multiple mobile advertising executives familiar with
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:29:02.100]   IFA told Business Insider that, yeah, we can track.
[01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:06.980]   If you're curious, IFA or IDFA stands for Identifier for Advertisers, a random anonymous
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:10.940]   number assigned to each and every one of us in our device.
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:11.940]   It's temporary.
[01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:12.940]   It can be blocked.
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:13.940]   It's basically a cookie.
[01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:14.940]   Yeah.
[01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:19.460]   When you look at an app or browse the web, your presence generates a call for an ad.
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:23.500]   It's a publisher site you're looking at then passes the IFA to the ad server.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:26.900]   The advertiser then says, "Oh, Leo's back."
[01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:30.180]   And can target that if they want.
[01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:31.620]   So when you mustang?
[01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:32.620]   Yeah.
[01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:33.620]   Show him a mustang.
[01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:34.620]   He'll buy one.
[01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:35.940]   The IFA does not identify you personally.
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:37.060]   None of these ever do.
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:40.980]   It's just an aggregate audience data, right, right, right.
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:41.980]   Tracking is on by default.
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:43.980]   It is not where you would think it would be.
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:47.700]   And Larry Magget published this and talked about it on Sunday on Twitch.
[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:50.140]   And his larrysworld.com.
[01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:54.980]   You would think, looking at the iPhone, that it would be in the privacy section.
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:57.380]   But when you go there, no, there's nothing about it.
[01:29:57.380 --> 01:30:01.820]   You have to go to general of all places.
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:03.820]   About.
[01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:05.300]   And then, yeah, about.
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:06.300]   Yeah.
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:08.460]   Well, that's where you would get your phone number, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:09.900]   Well, scroll all the way down.
[01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:10.900]   Oh, look.
[01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:11.900]   Advertising.
[01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:12.900]   About advertising.
[01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:14.420]   Hey, by the way.
[01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:16.260]   And that is, I've turned it on.
[01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:18.460]   But normally, it is, limit add tracking is off.
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:19.460]   Now, they don't say--
[01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:20.460]   All needs to be off, right.
[01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:22.580]   So it's the opposite of what you think it would be.
[01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:23.580]   Limit add tracking.
[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:24.580]   Turn it on.
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:25.580]   Yeah.
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:26.580]   Which turns off add tracking.
[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:27.580]   Yes.
[01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:29.420]   Now, there is a learn more button.
[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:30.420]   Let's see what we can learn.
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:35.940]   iOS 6 introduces the advertising identifier, a non-permanent, non-personal device identifier
[01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:39.900]   that, like the UDID, which was permanent, that apps will use to give you more control
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:42.340]   over advertisers' ability to use tracking methods.
[01:30:42.340 --> 01:30:46.620]   If you choose to limit add tracking, apps are not permitted to use the advertising
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:48.980]   identifier to serve you targeted ads.
[01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:52.260]   In the future, all apps will be required to use the advertising identifier.
[01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:56.900]   However, until then, you might still get targeted ads, like on the Facebook app or whatever.
[01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:57.900]   OK.
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:30:58.900]   So there you go.
[01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:01.580]   It's in general about-- who to thought?
[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:04.220]   General about an advertising.
[01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:08.020]   Who to thunk it?
[01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:10.820]   This stuff doesn't give-- as people know, it doesn't get me up in arms.
[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:14.620]   But I think it's important if there's something you're worried about to know.
[01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:16.620]   I would prefer to get ads that I like.
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:18.780]   I think ad targeting is a good thing.
[01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:34.100]   I mean, I put pro-
[01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:41.100]   as their play.
[01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:42.340]   That's what I've always said.
[01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:45.900]   But people are very sensitive about the idea of tracking, and there's do not track, and
[01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:47.900]   there's all furor over it.
[01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:50.140]   And so it's nice that they have a switch.
[01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:54.580]   It's interesting, because remember Apple made a big deal about Google ending around
[01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:59.740]   the third-party cookie protection that was standard in Safari.
[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:03.460]   And I think a lot of people thought, see, Apple's protecting your privacy.
[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:05.860]   In my position at the time was not-- they're not protecting your privacy.
[01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:08.780]   They're protecting their right to sell your information over somebody else's right to sell
[01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:09.980]   your information.
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:12.580]   And that's essentially what Apple's saying here.
[01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:19.420]   We're going to manage this here through a central process that only we control.
[01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:21.820]   All right.
[01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:22.820]   Anything else?
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:24.740]   Should we move on?
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:25.900]   Let's move on.
[01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:30.180]   And I'm going to give you an ad that I did not have to track you for, because I happen
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:35.380]   to know that every single person who watches this show has an interest in protecting their
[01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:36.780]   data.
[01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:39.860]   If you have data, if you have technology, you have a hard drive.
[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:41.180]   You need to back it up.
[01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:45.540]   And if you're going to back it up, you've got to do it the right way automatically, so
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:47.260]   you don't have to remember it continuously.
[01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:50.100]   So any time you make a change, boom, it's backed up.
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:53.940]   And of course, off-site, you can't have it sitting next to the computer.
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:55.180]   What if there's a fire, a flood?
[01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:56.180]   What if you lose the stuff?
[01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:57.180]   Somebody steals it.
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:32:59.540]   You've got to have it somewhere out there safe.
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:00.980]   That's what Carbonite does for you.
[01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:08.100]   For Macs or PCs, $59 a year, for everything on your computer, they do have other plans,
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:12.700]   flat-rate plans for multiple computers, small businesses and so forth.
[01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:16.340]   But I think the basic plan at $59 a year is such a good deal.
[01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:20.580]   Not only do you get automatic, continuous online backup, it's secure.
[01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:23.220]   Uses SSL, so you can do it at an open hotspot.
[01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:24.220]   Doesn't matter.
[01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:25.220]   Protected.
[01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:26.540]   You can do further encryption if you want.
[01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:30.820]   It has trust no one encryption built in, only you have the key.
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:32.060]   It does allow you.
[01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:35.620]   Now, there are certain things that won't work, by the way, with a trust no one encryption.
[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:37.340]   That's the trade-off you're going to make.
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:41.100]   But among other things, you can get the ability to see your stuff in the cloud.
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:45.940]   I think if you use TNO, that's not going to work obviously because what they see is encrypted.
[01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:47.540]   But you can log into your Carbonite account.
[01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:50.700]   Actually, I guess if you are using a PC or a Mac, you're okay.
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:52.860]   Log into your Carbonite account.
[01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:53.860]   There's your stuff.
[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:55.620]   On any computer, they have a smartphone app.
[01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:56.620]   They have a tablet app.
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:34:02.140]   Those obviously can't use TNO encryption, but they can access your data, which is awesome.
[01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:04.140]   I want you to try it free.
[01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:08.260]   For two weeks, all you don't need a credit card, you just need our offer code Mac break.
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:11.940]   And I want you to use Mac break because then if you decide to buy, no obligation, but if
[01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:16.700]   you decide to buy, you'll get 14 months for the price of 12, two months free.
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:18.260]   You got to back it up to get it back.
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:20.780]   So do it right with Carbonite.
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:29.900]   Make sure you use our offer code Mac break if you decide to save yourself some big bucks.
[01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:34.060]   As always, at the end of the program, we'd like to give you the highlight of the show,
[01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:36.660]   the pick of the week.
[01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:39.580]   Alex Lindsey, what do you got for us today?
[01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:46.700]   So my pick of the week is, there's a new version of Cinema 4D and I always remind people of
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:51.500]   that because it's one of the core pieces of what we do.
[01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:59.260]   There's two basic 3D apps that we use for most of our work in Cinema 4D and Moto.
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:03.300]   And I just think that Cinema 4D just came out with a new version about a month ago, but
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:05.500]   I didn't have a chance to play with it.
[01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:07.740]   And it's just a lot faster, faster rendering.
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:13.500]   And for those of you who don't know what Cinema 4D is, it's a 3D modeling rendering
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:15.300]   animation app.
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:22.460]   And it is for especially doing things like logo animations as well as character work and
[01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:24.700]   a lot of other things.
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:26.900]   I mean, just the gamut.
[01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:27.900]   This is just a great app.
[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:32.540]   And one of the things that I find is it's still one of the easiest apps to learn as far
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:35.860]   as picking up a new 3D package.
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:38.300]   So and it just keeps on getting more powerful.
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:42.300]   We've been using it for a decade.
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:48.500]   And so it's one of the core apps along with Moto as far as a general purpose app that
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:55.860]   we use in our school in Africa that we're building out in Rwanda and also along with
[01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:56.860]   the Pixel Core.
[01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:58.460]   And it's definitely worth downloading.
[01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:03.420]   If you thought you want to play with 3D, we start everyone on this application because
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:04.420]   it's been a lot of--
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:08.020]   Is this better than say light wave or something less expensive?
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:10.540]   Well, there's a lot of different versions of this.
[01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:11.900]   So there's a lot of options.
[01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:14.500]   I'm not sure what all the price points are, but there's not one.
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:17.500]   There-- I mean, obviously the fully blown out version, I think, is pretty expensive.
[01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:20.740]   But you can get into using cinema at a lot of different levels.
[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:21.740]   There's now a student--
[01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:23.220]   There's a demo version of the demo, which is nice.
[01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:24.420]   There's a demo that you can download.
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:25.580]   There's also a student version.
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:26.740]   So if you're a student, you want to get into it.
[01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:30.020]   A lot of companies have gotten into doing student versions.
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:34.980]   And it's a very powerful-- I would use it over something like light wave.
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:40.420]   There's a lot of very, very high end apps like Maya and Softamaj that are great if you
[01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:44.580]   are in a big facility, not so good if you're by yourself.
[01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:50.540]   And so if you're in a smaller facility and you're looking for something that for you
[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:55.460]   to do that, whether it's educational or corporate or broadcast or film work, it's a
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:57.860]   great app to start working on.
[01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:02.060]   And you know that you're going to be able to take it a long way and really produce photo
[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:04.980]   quality work, you know, on-goingly.
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:08.620]   And that's what I love about it is that I can-- you know, I do classes with kids who
[01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:10.700]   oftentimes are like 12 to 17.
[01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:16.220]   That's how I design a lot of our curriculum is working with 12 to 17 year olds in doing
[01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:20.980]   classes because that requires me to really work hard at describing things.
[01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:22.820]   I can't make any assumptions.
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:28.580]   And you know, I'll be-- you know, I'll spend a day teaching them some of cinema and having
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:30.820]   them already doing things that just look gorgeous.
[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:33.380]   And so definitely worth downloading.
[01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:35.340]   You can see a lot of these great renders here.
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:37.180]   They have a lot of great tools.
[01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:40.180]   I spend a lot of time going to broadcast companies.
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:43.500]   You know, so I work with a lot of broadcast organizations for a variety of reasons.
[01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:46.420]   And so I spend a lot of time in their studios and their broadcast.
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:49.620]   And you just see this everywhere, especially for that type of thing.
[01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:55.300]   And so, you know, I was talking about render farms and most of the render farms that I
[01:37:55.300 --> 01:38:00.940]   see at this point are using-- at broadcast facilities are using cinema.
[01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:04.820]   So just-- and a lot of these tools, that looks like a complex, you know, animation.
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:09.540]   And a lot of that is using what we call implicit animation, particle systems, to do a lot of
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:10.540]   these things.
[01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:12.100]   So you're building whole controls.
[01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:14.260]   You're not animating every little piece.
[01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:20.860]   And again, whether it's cinema or a moto or another application, 3D animation is just--
[01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:22.300]   I've been doing it for a long time.
[01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:23.500]   It's so much fun.
[01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:28.380]   So I mean, I think more than anything, I would just suggest downloading these apps,
[01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:30.020]   seeing which one works for you.
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:34.340]   But I think that a lot of people-- there's a lot of opportunity to express yourself just
[01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:40.140]   for fun, but also for, you know, whether you're doing business presentations or-- you're
[01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:42.620]   doing-- you're a teacher and doing educational work.
[01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:46.740]   You know, I think that looking at these-- I know a long time ago, they were very complex
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:48.460]   and very difficult to learn.
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:53.820]   And a lot of applications like cinema have really made it easy to do a lot of this work
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:56.260]   very, very quickly for a variety of different things.
[01:38:56.260 --> 01:38:57.260]   And you shouldn't be afraid of it.
[01:38:57.260 --> 01:38:58.260]   So definitely check it out.
[01:38:58.260 --> 01:39:05.060]   Here's the video they made using 4D of the Red Bull Stratos Pre-Viz before he actually
[01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:06.060]   jumped out of it.
[01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:11.140]   It's on the-- so this would be-- if you were going to pick one, Lightwave or Maya or even
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:14.140]   Blender, which is free, you'd say, this is the one to--
[01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:16.820]   This is definitely the one that I would start with, absolutely.
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:17.820]   Because, you know, it's definitely--
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:19.700]   That's a lot to be able to do this kind of stuff.
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:21.300]   It'd be so cool to be able to do it.
[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:22.820]   Well, I'll teach you.
[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:23.820]   We should do it.
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:25.340]   How much time you got?
[01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:26.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:28.340]   Let's do a show.
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:29.340]   Yeah, I'll do a show.
[01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:30.340]   You want to do a show?
[01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:31.340]   You never hear, Alex.
[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:32.340]   So don't tease me like that.
[01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:33.340]   You've got to do it in pieces.
[01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:34.340]   Just don't do it live.
[01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:37.060]   I would love to do a show where we pick a program like this.
[01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:41.700]   Maybe we could even make a deal with somebody at Maxon to make a special version, a twit
[01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:42.700]   version.
[01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:44.700]   And it'd be really cool.
[01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:45.700]   We should talk about that.
[01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:46.700]   I'd love to do that.
[01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:48.180]   Because I'd like to learn it myself.
[01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:51.100]   And I know there are people out there who would say, hey, it'd be really cool to know
[01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:52.900]   this, but how am I going to learn it?
[01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:53.900]   Yeah.
[01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:56.460]   I think that this is-- I would love to do that with you.
[01:39:56.460 --> 01:39:58.260]   So we should definitely talk about that.
[01:39:58.260 --> 01:39:59.260]   We do it a lot.
[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:00.260]   Next time you're in town.
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:01.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:05.900]   I'll be back soon after I think-- next week, I'm on my way to Rwanda.
[01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:09.020]   But when I get back, I'll-- we'll talk about it.
[01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:10.020]   So I am looking.
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:11.780]   There's a broad range of prices.
[01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:12.780]   I don't know.
[01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:15.180]   40 Prime is $1,000.
[01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:16.180]   Right.
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:17.180]   Yeah.
[01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:20.140]   And so the first thing to do is download the demo, which is going to have a little bit
[01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:21.140]   of everything.
[01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:23.620]   And then you just decide-- a lot of that stuff.
[01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:26.260]   You can start and then just keep on upgrading.
[01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:30.980]   So a lot of this stuff is-- and again, if you're a student, there are student versions
[01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:32.460]   now that are available.
[01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:35.220]   And so there's a lot of ways to get into this.
[01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:42.740]   And it is a-- when we keep on talking about e-learning, for those of you who are working
[01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:47.620]   part time or trying to figure out more time than money, more time than work, when you're
[01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:51.260]   looking at the e-learning market that I think is going to explode over the next couple
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:57.620]   of years, understanding these kind of applications is going to be a very important skill.
[01:40:57.620 --> 01:41:02.060]   So if you've got time-- and even if you don't, if you're busy and still-- I still squeeze
[01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:03.060]   it in.
[01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:05.620]   But if you've got time, this is a great thing to get involved with.
[01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:06.620]   Cool.
[01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:07.620]   It's a great business.
[01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:14.260]   Maxon, M-A-X-O-N makes cinema 4D as in doggy.
[01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:18.700]   And Mr. Eimor, Renee Ritchie, what's your recommendation for the week?
[01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:22.020]   My recommendation for the week is called Glassboard.
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:27.220]   It's by Brent Simmons, who's well known for Net Newswire and originally for Mars Edit.
[01:41:27.220 --> 01:41:30.580]   And it's from CPA, his new company.
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:35.420]   It's a little bit like Campfire, but it's more threaded than that.
[01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:39.300]   So for example, we used it at Singleton to keep track of where everybody is and where
[01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:41.340]   everybody is going.
[01:41:41.340 --> 01:41:43.820]   He used it at his company as a complete replacement.
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:45.340]   They use it instead of email.
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:50.140]   So you create rooms, you can have all sorts of separate, some private, some public rooms.
[01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:54.860]   You can share the invite code with anybody so you can carefully control who gets access
[01:41:54.860 --> 01:41:58.180]   to which room the app supports.
[01:41:58.180 --> 01:41:59.820]   And then you just put messages in there.
[01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:04.300]   There's both a free and a paid version, but the free version is super functional.
[01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:06.780]   You can start threads, you can have replies to threads.
[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:09.060]   It's really well organized.
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:13.340]   And we've tried a lot of things because when we cover CES or we cover Macworld, it's always
[01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:18.180]   hard to keep a team of people well organized and knowing where each other are and who's
[01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:19.500]   doing what task.
[01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:23.500]   And so far, this is the best one I've tried just because of the way it presents the data
[01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:26.860]   and the speed that it works and the notifications that it gives.
[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:29.020]   So I was really impressed with how it worked this week.
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:30.860]   Glassboard.com, this is new.
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:32.900]   I think Brent is amazing.
[01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:34.380]   He has.
[01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:35.500]   And he's done such great stuff.
[01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:39.540]   This is for iPhone, Android, and the web, which is kind of necessary for something that
[01:42:39.540 --> 01:42:41.460]   we're going to use across the enterprise.
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:45.780]   We should look at this chat as a, we played with Pottio for a while and other solutions
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:47.660]   like this Basecamp Glassboard.
[01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:52.860]   He just leaves the web open when you're at your desk or in your company and you're working.
[01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:55.980]   And then when you have to go mobile, you just use the iOS or the Android app.
[01:42:55.980 --> 01:43:00.180]   And so far, it was absolutely flawless for the stuff that I've used it for.
[01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:01.180]   Me.
[01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:03.180]   And he says, it's not just for business.
[01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:05.380]   You could use this with your family, for instance.
[01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:06.380]   Disney World, Leo.
[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:08.660]   I mean, it's the best use case ever.
[01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:09.660]   Disney World.
[01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:10.660]   Yeah.
[01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:11.660]   Wow.
[01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:12.660]   All right.
[01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:15.940]   Hey, now I want to try this.
[01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:17.620]   Glassboard.com.
[01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:21.820]   My pick is something you probably all know about, but Mac Heist 4 is about to begin a
[01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:22.900]   brand new mission.
[01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:26.540]   So if you're familiar with Mac Heist, they've done missions before.
[01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:32.980]   The idea is by downloading the app and solving the problem, you get free stuff.
[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:36.740]   They have Mac OS 10, iPad and iPhone versions.
[01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:38.820]   The app itself is free.
[01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:40.700]   You solve puzzles.
[01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:43.020]   I haven't done a mission in a while.
[01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:48.060]   And they have some very interesting loot that you can get.
[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:54.940]   Essentially, this is a big marketing campaign around a bundle of apps.
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:59.420]   And you can find out more by visiting macheist.com.
[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:01.140]   I just started.
[01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:05.820]   So I don't know what apps they're going to have.
[01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:08.980]   Right now, they're saying music box is the first one.
[01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:12.580]   Download convert import, but we'll find out as time goes by.
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:19.500]   And in the past, 25% of the bundles income goes to charity.
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:25.300]   Usually what happens to developers donate inexpensive versions of their apps to Mac Heist.
[01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:28.300]   And some money goes to developers, some money goes to charity.
[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:32.900]   And you almost always, in fact, you do always get a good deal on the apps.
[01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:37.820]   They say they've raised $2 million for charities in the past three Mac heists.
[01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:39.060]   That's pretty cool.
[01:44:39.060 --> 01:44:40.820]   So a good cause.
[01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:45.060]   And we all win Macheist.com.
[01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:46.620]   The apps will be announced tonight.
[01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:51.060]   So you may want to pay attention.
[01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:54.860]   Thank you so much, Alex Lindsay, for making the time in your very busy schedule to be
[01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:57.020]   here from Washington, DC.
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:58.100]   Always great to see you.
[01:44:58.100 --> 01:44:59.100]   Thank you.
[01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:00.100]   My pleasure.
[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:02.460]   I don't know if there's anything to plug someday soon.
[01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:04.460]   You'll be able to buy stuff at Pixelcore again.
[01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:05.460]   Yes.
[01:45:05.460 --> 01:45:06.460]   I'm in ships.
[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:08.700]   We're working on it.
[01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:11.820]   We've really gone through a lot of design changes.
[01:45:11.820 --> 01:45:15.820]   And we're trying to figure out exactly how we want to add new people and what we want
[01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:16.820]   to provide for them.
[01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:20.140]   So people have to be patient with us as we do that.
[01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:24.300]   What's great about it is that all that stuff that you see constantly coming in is all building
[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:25.700]   towards what we're doing there.
[01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:27.660]   So it's exciting.
[01:45:27.660 --> 01:45:31.260]   We will be hopefully I'm going to get to stream a little bit from Rwanda next week.
[01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:34.740]   So I think I land on Wednesday night.
[01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:40.020]   I'm doing a talk at CMU, the Carnegie Mellon in Kegali on Thursday.
[01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:42.660]   So if you're in Kegali, Rwanda, come visit.
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:48.220]   I'm going to be talking about visual effects and other stuff in media at CMU.
[01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:52.700]   And then hopefully we're going to be doing some launch events on the 26th, 27th.
[01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:54.940]   I think those are the dates that we have set up for it.
[01:45:54.940 --> 01:45:57.260]   And I'm going to try to stream from Rwanda.
[01:45:57.260 --> 01:46:01.700]   So people should just, they should follow me on Twitter, Alex Lindsey.
[01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:03.380]   And I'll tweet it out.
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:06.340]   Or you can also find me Alex Lindsey on G+, and those will be the two places.
[01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:11.940]   And most likely I'll do a hangout from Kegali from our school, which we believe has enough
[01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:14.660]   bandwidth as I get down there and do some testing.
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:15.660]   So stay tuned for that.
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:17.220]   That'll happen at the end of next week.
[01:46:17.220 --> 01:46:18.220]   Good.
[01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:20.980]   Let's hope we can get you on Mac break weekly on a regular basis.
[01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:24.780]   Remember, there's a thing going on October 23rd if you're around.
[01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:26.700]   I'm going to be in New York.
[01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:28.100]   And hopefully I will be available.
[01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:30.660]   So I'm going to, I'm trying to sort out my schedule right now, but I think I'm going
[01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:32.380]   to be actually able to do that.
[01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:33.380]   Good.
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:36.420]   Stan, New York, we could send you to the Windows launch.
[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:40.780]   The Windows launch or the, or the Windows launch is the 26th or 25th of New York.
[01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:41.780]   You want to go to a party?
[01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:43.420]   I'll be, I'll be in Rwanda.
[01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:44.420]   Okay.
[01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:45.420]   But, but I'll be in New York.
[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:46.420]   Oh, rats.
[01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:47.420]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:50.060]   I'd love to be there if I, but the commute will be a little long.
[01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:51.060]   Yeah.
[01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:56.140]   And thanks very much to Renee Richie, who is increasingly irregular on the show.
[01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:57.140]   We like that.
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:47:00.700]   I am ORE.com is his website.
[01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:05.140]   Great place to keep up on the latest Apple and Mac news and you're always the best Renee.
[01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:06.140]   Thank you for being here.
[01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:07.460]   Oh, thank you for having me, Leo.
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:08.780]   The chat room loves you.
[01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:10.860]   Oh, it's what a nice chat room.
[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:11.860]   Of course you're in there.
[01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:13.180]   It's always nice.
[01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:16.780]   And thanks to Chad Johnson, our producer, Chad, I found you a new t-shirt.
[01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:17.780]   Oh, you did.
[01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:19.820]   Lance versus zombies t-shirt.
[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:21.500]   It's a perfect color to go with your red hair.
[01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:22.500]   It's a bright green.
[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:26.100]   I think you'd look like Christmas and, and it says, "Stop zombie mouth."
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:28.020]   Yeah, no one wants zombie mouth.
[01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:32.460]   You know, this is actually a campaign that plants versus zombies in pop cap games is doing
[01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:36.180]   for Halloween to replace Halloween candy with like zombie cards.
[01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:39.380]   And I think they're giving away free cards and stuff.
[01:47:39.380 --> 01:47:40.380]   Stop zombie mouth.
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:41.380]   Do they have gum in them?
[01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:43.380]   No, that's the point, Alex.
[01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:44.380]   Instead of trickery traits.
[01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:46.180]   We've got a pretty crazy way without that.
[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:50.460]   What's good with trading cards when you don't have that horrible, really, really hard
[01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:51.980]   gum that comes with it?
[01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:53.780]   You're sure to get your house egged.
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:56.940]   So I get it, so zombie mouth would be cavity mouth.
[01:47:56.940 --> 01:47:57.940]   Cavities.
[01:47:57.940 --> 01:47:59.580]   They don't like your teeth to fall out.
[01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:02.580]   So instead of giving away candy, that--
[01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:08.380]   I think you have to start slowly, you know, so I think you have to give kids a little candy
[01:48:08.380 --> 01:48:12.940]   with the cards this year and then a little less candy, maybe some carrots next year.
[01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:15.940]   And then we're going to talk about it.
[01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:16.940]   It's crunchy.
[01:48:16.940 --> 01:48:20.900]   They're teaming up with the American Dental Association and they are giving away free
[01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:25.020]   downloads of the full version of Plants vs. Zombies.
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:26.180]   Now I think a kid would be happy to get that.
[01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:28.100]   So you get an app instead of candy.
[01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:29.100]   Yeah.
[01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:32.020]   And then there's new characters in those Plants vs. Zombies trading cards.
[01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:35.980]   My kids would enjoy the plant versus zombie cards a lot longer than the candy.
[01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:36.980]   Yeah, see?
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:37.980]   There's even 3D.
[01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:41.580]   And there's a new version of the game coming next year, so we're all waiting on that.
[01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:42.580]   I can't wait.
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:43.580]   That's my favorite game.
[01:48:43.580 --> 01:48:44.580]   I love that.
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:46.300]   But I've kind of played it out.
[01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:47.780]   I keep waiting for something new.
[01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:49.620]   All right, everybody.
[01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:50.900]   Thank you so much for joining us.

[01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:23.100]   A war.

[01:49:24.820 --> 01:49:25.420]   Break time's over.
