[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.720]   Hello, everybody, and welcome to Mac Break Weekly,
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.160]   episode 409.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.560]   Leo Laport is on the island of Maui, Hawaii,
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.760]   having a wonderful little vacation time off.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.800]   So they asked me to step in and host this episode of Mac Break Weekly,
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.240]   which I haven't done in about a year since I think Leo went on vacation last time.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.320]   So hopefully I didn't screw up so badly that they had nobody else to ask.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.920]   But anyway, we're gonna have a great show.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.880]   Of course, I've got a wonderful panel, all the regulars.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.280]   We've got to my left, Andy and Notko.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.560]   Hello, Andy.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.720]   Hello, Sarah.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.920]   How lovely to see you here.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.280]   Well, how lovely to see you.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.400]   And what do we have behind you?
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.480]   A chorus line and a rodent?
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.040]   Well, squirrels are not rodents.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.440]   They are part of the--
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.440]   I see.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.320]   --those taxanautical class.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.240]   But it was a good spot on a chorus line.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.960]   I made the mistake of realizing that there's a lot of like Broadway on Google Play music.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.800]   And then I wound up having to listen to the entire thing of a chorus line.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.200]   And once you get to the end, that's pretty much your day for the rest of the day.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.320]   You're vacuuming, but you have to do the walk as you're vacuuming.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.360]   So I got to purge this from my system, but then we'll be OK.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.560]   There'll be very little mournful singing about the things I gave up to pursue my passion
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.560]   during this show.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.120]   I suspect by the second commercial break, I'll have that out of my system.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.720]   Excellent.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.600]   Well, I mean, it's lovely to look at.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.200]   We've got a little of everything, including a little maple leaf mug.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.960]   And to my right, we've got Alex Lindsay, who is coming all the way from Rwanda.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.240]   Hey, Alex.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.320]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.560]   It's going well.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.440]   So what's going on out in Rwanda?
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.760]   I know you go there fairly often the African tour of duty.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.440]   But but what?
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.320]   Yeah, we're there is the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the end of the genocides.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.440]   So the independence day, essentially, but 20th anniversary since the end of the genocides.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.320]   So we're going to be doing live streaming tomorrow morning with some youth programs
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.160]   at one of the hotels here.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:31.040]   And then we're streaming from Amherst Stadium, which is if you know anything about the Rwandan
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.680]   genocide, that was one of the safe, the big stadium that was the safe haven.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.200]   So anyways, we're streaming from Rwanda from Amherst Stadium on Friday.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.800]   And so I'm here working with our local Rwandan crew to just kind of back them up.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.800]   But they're mostly have taken over at this point.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.040]   So they're running the whole show.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.040]   Wow, that's excellent.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.240]   Well, thanks for joining us.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.520]   And yeah, it seems like it's good work you're doing.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.360]   And then of course, and this is such good timing because I know it's like a special
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.360]   Canada day.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.120]   We've got Renee Richie, of course, of I'm more and of Mac Rekwekley as well.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.120]   Hey, Renee.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.760]   Hey, Sarah, it's great to have you on the show again.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.360]   Well, it's great to be here.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.560]   And thanks for, you know, not protesting.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.800]   And it is Canada Day, right?
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.160]   That's like a big deal.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.200]   It is absolutely it is a confederate.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.440]   It's got some official name, like Confederation Day when everyone's all 12 provinces, the
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.760]   massive number of provinces signed up to be a country.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.840]   Well, happy Canada Day to you.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.640]   Is there anything that we can do here on our end to celebrate in an appropriate way?
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.760]   No, no, I said at the beginning, Chad's hair being surged red all day, I think, is tribute
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.760]   enough.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.760]   Perfect.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.920]   Chad, thanks for helping us celebrate Canada Day.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.640]   Yeah, I mean, you got to do it for the best country that's above the United States that
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.640]   there is.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.640]   So America's hat.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.640]   That's right.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.040]   And a fine hat, indeed.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.240]   A fine hat.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.160]   So, all right, well, let's talk about some of our, I guess, top Apple news.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.800]   What do we all think about Apple saying, well, we're not going to keep developing aperture
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.560]   in OS 10.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:07.040]   We all heard at WWDC that the new photos app was going to basically be the successor to
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.080]   iPhoto, but it sounds like it's going to be a successor to aperture as well, which I guess
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:19.880]   means that it is more of a pro tool than anything that we've seen before on the OS 10
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.880]   side.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.800]   But I don't know, Andy, were you a big aperture user?
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.280]   Yeah, I mean, it's I spend more time in aperture having fun than gaming or watching movies,
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.280]   probably.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.480]   It's just such a slick app for turning the photo that your camera shot into the photo
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.880]   that is the scene as you remembered it.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.400]   So I like most people who are using aperture kind of disappointed that for the past couple
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.160]   of years, we haven't seen any movement from it.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160]   I'm being being not a pro.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.480]   I wasn't really tempted to move to Lightroom yet.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.680]   So it's not as though it was something that people were not expecting, but you're kind
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.600]   of you're still sad once the shoot drops.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.760]   But I'm not sure if it's necessarily that photos is going to replace aperture.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:05.000]   I think I wrote a column about this a few days ago when the news finally hit that it's
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.800]   possible that Apple has another app that is a replacement for aperture, but they're not
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.280]   ready to announce it yet.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.320]   Or it's possible that they simply think that because photos is so extensible, someone can
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:23.560]   come in and write an extension that can deliver aperture style editing into the photos app.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.000]   Or it's possible they're just saying that you look, we're totally redoing photos for
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Mac OS.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.880]   Photos is not just a replacement for iPhoto, it's not just your photo library.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.840]   It is going to be the resource that's going to deliver photos everywhere that every app
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.520]   and every user wants it on every device, no matter whether you're using mobile or desktop.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.400]   So it's possible that Apple is just saying that we're going to retract our responsibility
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.520]   to just making sure that any app that works with photos can get their hands on whatever
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.680]   photo the user wants to start working with.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.600]   And so we're going to leave that as an opportunity for others.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.000]   I mean, do remember that Apple never got around to creating their own version of Photoshop.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   So just because they're not doing a pro app for photos doesn't mean they don't care about
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   it.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.920]   Yeah, I'm wondering if it's time to finally start taking advantage of that part of my
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.160]   Adobe Creative Studio subscription now.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.160]   Yikes.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.320]   Well, Alex, I know you do a lot with professional photography.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.880]   I mean, was aperture ever enough of a program for you?
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.120]   Yeah, no, I actually have been using aperture almost since day one.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.320]   And so it's definitely actually since day one.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:38.680]   And that's where most of my apps I got hundreds of photos of something in there or media files.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.760]   And there have been some stability issues that have actually had me a little concerned
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.920]   about the aperture in general.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.840]   So I haven't been sure if that's where I was going to stay.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.560]   I'm going to wait to see photos before I decide what I'm going to do.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.560]   I think that there's a lot of, it's hard to see until we see it.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.640]   But I don't know if I'm using aperture even heavy enough that if there's a lot of those
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:04.360]   features get put into photo, and I wouldn't say that I'm pushing aperture very hard for
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.840]   the corrections that I do, I think that they could definitely put most of that into photos
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.600]   and I'm probably pretty happy.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.040]   Anytime I want to do anything serious, I move to Photoshop anyway.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.800]   So it's not been that big of a deal.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.200]   Maybe I should be in Lightroom.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.440]   I don't know.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.600]   Many of my friends are.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.040]   So I'm still trying to figure that out.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.560]   But anyway, I think that I'll be interested to see it before I make a decision.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.480]   I also think that there's still an opportunity for Apple to make it extensible enough that
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:38.920]   people could start adding a lot of plugins and so on and so forth and open up that API
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.960]   to a point where people could actually do something really useful like replace some
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.320]   of the functionality of Photoshop.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.840]   So there's a lot of opportunity there right now.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.000]   I guess I'm probably one of those, well, I know there's a few of me, but I almost do
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.040]   all of my photo taking on my iPhone and then my photo editing on my iPhone.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.200]   I'm never really an iPhone.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.440]   I don't even know if I've ever used aperture.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:05.360]   I've probably looked at it here and there, but I'm not even sure what my options are
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.520]   going forward or what my best option is.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.760]   Renee, obviously, you know, at least what we are to expect from the new Photos app as
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.160]   something that you think is going in the right direction for Apple.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:20.280]   Do they just want to move away from this sort of pro photography universe that they know
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.200]   don't appeal to a lot of people?
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.560]   Yeah, I think that's absolutely right.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.240]   I think for a while now, the writing on the wall was fairly clear that Apple didn't care
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.760]   about pro user features as much as they care.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.800]   They just want to power user features as much as they cared about empowering user features.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.240]   They wanted to make apps starting with iMovie, starting with Final Cut Pro, even Logic Pro
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.720]   tend to some extent that were accessible to a wider range of people, sort of the growing
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.800]   prosumer market, which is this huge middle ground in between brand new people to the
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.760]   platform and pros.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.360]   And I like Alex and Andy.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.840]   I've been using Aputure for a long time, but I've been using Photoshop for decades.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.600]   So my biggest Aputure action is right click, edit in Photoshop.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.520]   I just used Aputure because I liked the way that it organized things and I didn't like
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.680]   the workflow that Lightroom tries to impose on me.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.760]   I didn't need Lightroom specifically.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.360]   So I think this move, one of the biggest complaints I've heard over and over again is that iPhoto
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.360]   just wasn't enough.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.320]   It had okay features, but it wasn't really what everybody wanted.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.920]   It wasn't that sophisticated.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.520]   And now it looks like we're getting the 80% of the stuff that Aputure does really well
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.440]   put into the new Photos app.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.480]   And yeah, the 20% that power users really wanted won't be there, but they do have other
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.480]   options now.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.320]   And I think Apple has always better served when they're sort of democratizing computing
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.320]   technology.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.320]   And that looks like what Photos is going to do again.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.520]   I don't think I was only thinking that Apple is always, I mean, we've talked about this
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.840]   in the past, but Apple's really like, what will 90% of the people need 90% of the time?
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:52.280]   And I think that what we get with Photos is probably the Apple's assumption of that necessity.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.440]   And I think that they're quite happy to lose the other 10% to Lightroom if they need to.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.760]   Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:05.600]   And it's also interesting to think about what kind of future iWork might have given that
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:10.240]   it was really created so that Apple would have a plan B if Microsoft ever decided to
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.920]   sort of ease back on development of Microsoft Office.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.320]   Now that that's not really an issue for them, maybe a year from now, two years from now,
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.120]   three years from now, we'll have exactly the same thing.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.560]   We'll have a year and a half or two years of no serious updates.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.880]   And then after sort of encouraging, instead of kicking people out of the nest, the mama
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.680]   bird just doesn't come back to the nest very often.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.280]   And then after a year, the baby birds decided, okay, I guess mom's not coming back.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.400]   Damn it, we'll have to leave now and then go find our own food from now on.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:42.480]   So this is, I think, maybe Apple's best way of encouraging people to not rely on them
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.480]   for the real hard stuff.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.840]   Well, shall we move on to this?
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:52.240]   Actually, really, did everybody read the story in tech opinions about understanding
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:58.240]   a wearable strategy that might point to how they're doing things at Disney theme parks?
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.000]   Yeah, I read that.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.680]   And that's exactly the sort of, these Disney theme park bands are exactly the way that
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.040]   I imagine Apple wanting to do a wearable.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.200]   Because if you just have a band that is just a sensor that can make magical things happen
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.160]   with the hardware around you, even if one of the limiting things that it does is you
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:22.120]   wear it and suddenly you don't even have to bother to thumbprint unlock a phone anymore.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.320]   Or now you're in a store and now simply your presence there in the store gives you access
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.920]   to your Starbucks account, lets you pay.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.360]   That's worth a certain amount of money.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.040]   And the other big advantage of a system like that is that if you're not building a huge
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.440]   giant touchscreen device, you're building something that people will actually want to
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.120]   wear, which is a good thing if you're trying to sell these things.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.080]   And you're also building something that you can sell cheaply, which is another thing that
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.520]   if you're trying to get people to create a brand new habit of here's a new addition
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.120]   to the things that I do after I jump out of the shower every morning.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:57.400]   Not only do I get my wallet, my watch and my good pen, but now I also strap on this sensor.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.400]   So it's good stuff.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:03.160]   It isn't exactly what Apple would do with such a technology, but it really does point
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.040]   the way to Apple creating something that they can sell as opposed to something that they
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.840]   can demo in June and hope people don't ask about the sales figures for by September.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:17.400]   For anybody who hasn't read this, it's a post by Tim Bajaren, I hope that's how you
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.400]   say it.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.400]   Bajaren.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:24.840]   And he took his family to Disney World and he said, it worked like it went off without
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.840]   a hitch.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.360]   You connect a band to a credit card that you're supposed to use at parks.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.960]   You've got a pin number that you're using for shops and restaurants.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.320]   You can use your wristband once you're wearing it to get into your room.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:41.520]   You can use your phone for staying in a Disney hotel instead of a key card.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.480]   The wristbands came to the house a couple weeks before the vacation, so I guess as long
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.560]   as you book ahead of time.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:52.800]   And then they're using RFID radios to communicate with door locks and restaurant terminals.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.640]   The park entrance gates.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.160]   You sync your bands to a fingerprint reader for double authentication if that's what you
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.600]   want to do.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.680]   You can use them at kiosks and various restaurants on the Disney properties.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.900]   I mean, it does sound like as long as you don't mind wearing a wristband, it is the
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.820]   ultimate inconvenience.
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.440]   And you don't have to think about too much.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.440]   No, of course, that's within a Disney park and that's not where most people live.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.440]   Magical world.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.040]   I think that there's another step that I think that we'll see in places like Disney, which
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.720]   is being able to have those wristbands on your kids and being able to know where your
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.240]   kids are.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:36.480]   And that is, as a father of a four and a six year old, that is a constant concern of where
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.880]   they actually are at a park like that.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.840]   And in Disney, Disneyland, they're probably as safe as they can be, but still it's something
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.560]   that I think they're going to see in shopping malls.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.440]   I think we're going to see in Chuck E. Cheese, being able to put a wristband on your kid
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.960]   and know precisely where they are.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:56.600]   And with Bluetooth, LE, we should be able to pinpoint their position within a foot.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.840]   And believe me, within a foot is very important in some of these locations.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.200]   I'm sorry, I'm going to go ahead.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.720]   That's going to be the thing that I thought I think is really interesting is when Apple
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.040]   is at their best when they try to solve problems, what is the problem with current wearables?
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.880]   What's the problem with mobile that you actually have to go to wearable?
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.400]   And it seems like we're falling into these distinct categories like the projection of
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.880]   notifications, the logging of information, like exercise tracking and things like that.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.240]   Things like authentication with Bluetooth trusted object or RFID and things like that.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.000]   There's several tasks that they can be good at.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.520]   Apple is also usually good at focusing on one or two of those.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.200]   They don't try to be too broad.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:39.080]   And I very much like this idea of things just happen because the biggest advances in computing
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.680]   happen with advances in interface.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.800]   Like multi-touch made all the difference when it came to mobile devices.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.760]   The previous technologies, keyboards, resistive, just wasn't as good.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.440]   And multi-touch let more and more people use them.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.600]   And I think we're going to need a similar advance in wearable, something like proximity
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.880]   where things magically happen when you're within the right place and you have the right
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.200]   sort of permissions.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:03.560]   And that will probably make them much more useful than just another current generation
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.640]   screen on a device.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.640]   Do we think we're going to see an Apple wrist device?
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.840]   I don't even want to call it an eye watch because I don't know if that's what it's
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.840]   going to be called.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.680]   But is that going to happen this September or October or do you think?
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.680]   October.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.960]   I can bet some money on it because I want this.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.960]   I've finally put away my hopes for an Apple television.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.880]   I'm just not even going to think about that anymore.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.960]   So I need to believe in something new.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.520]   Well, I think we're going to see some-- I don't know if we're going to see an Apple
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:37.960]   television as an LED or LCD, but I do think we're going to see a new update to Apple TV,
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:42.520]   whatever that is, where we're going to get a lot more features and so on and so forth.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.800]   But I do think a wearable makes sense.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:48.320]   And I think the more we look at these wearables, the idea that you're constantly connecting
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.080]   the things around you to make your life more convenient I think is probably going to be
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.640]   thrust and I think Apple's going to do that probably pretty well.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.160]   And we're coming right after the first show we've done after-- talk at length after the
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.160]   Google I/O keynote, I think.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.560]   I don't think we've talked much about the wearables that they've done.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:08.240]   And the only thing that really occurred to me that's relevant to Apple is that the Samsung
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:14.120]   and the LG Google Android Wear watches really makes me think about the differences between
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.120]   the way that Google does things and the way that Apple does things where I think that
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:24.480]   Google made a watch that is feature complete that does really far reaching broad things.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.600]   That's first day out the door and then I'm going to take a couple of years to get the
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.600]   hardware right.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.520]   I think Apple's attack would be to do the exact opposite, which is to get the hardware
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.720]   right right off the gate, make it feature incomplete, but in two years start building
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.040]   in the features that you associate with a wearable device.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:45.720]   So anyone here use iTunes U much, the app?
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:50.920]   I love it and yet I find that it sort of sits dormant on my iPad not being used even though
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.200]   I can basically take free college classes.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.800]   The reason I'm asking, of course, is because Apple had announced an iTunes U update.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:02.520]   We talked about it on iPad today yesterday that allows you to create more things from
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:09.200]   the iPad itself rather than just participating in classes and a little bit more sort of back
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.400]   channel discussions.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.360]   But is anybody using iTunes U on a regular basis or do you know anybody who is?
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:21.720]   I got to say that iTunes U on my iPad is like having a copy of a brief history of time
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.560]   on my copy table.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.560]   I have it.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.800]   I'm proud of myself for having it.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.000]   I want other people to think that I use it.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.600]   But no, I haven't cracked that a lot.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.880]   I'm just not that bright.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.840]   And it's something that we were looking at actually implementing it for the school here
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.640]   actually to run most of our education.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.560]   And we just haven't really gotten it working the way we exactly wanted it and the authoring
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.160]   to the level that we wanted it to work at.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:49.920]   But we're going to make another pass at it based on this upgrade for the fall.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.160]   So we're going to take a look at it where we are excited about the idea.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.280]   We just haven't found the solution completely compelling yet.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:02.120]   So Alex, from your end, you would want to be able to conduct classes and have people
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.480]   follow along with a syllabus through iTunes U.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.840]   Yeah, I mean, a lot of our stuff is self-paced.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:15.840]   So what we do is the only time we're in a class class is when we're discussing stuff
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.320]   that they've already done.
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.920]   So there are some ones where we're showing things around if we're actually in the studio.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:29.280]   We use a lot of Google+ Hangouts to connect for Wanda to Petaluma.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.040]   And so we have those classes about once or twice a week.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:37.400]   But then the rest of the time is doing videos and so on and so forth.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:42.320]   And so one of the things we're going to be ramping up to over 200 students this fall
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.960]   and managing that is going to be mostly training videos that are then followed up with challenges
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.360]   and discussions about those processes.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.960]   And so for that, we think that especially with some of the new features here, this could
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.280]   be a good solution for it.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.520]   We are trying to figure out what platform we're going to roll that out on.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:01.240]   And right now, it's probably the inside track is using iTunes U.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:08.040]   I think one of the strangest things about iTunes U is sort of looking at it on my iPad
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.200]   now is it's not laid out very well.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:17.200]   There's a lot there, but it's almost like if the app store was even worse at finding,
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.840]   you know, being able to navigate through and find the apps that you want based on the exact
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:26.080]   name of the app, that's kind of how I feel about iTunes U. And that's I think why I
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.320]   end up, I check it out and I go, wow, cool.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:35.560]   I could be part of this course on the history of rock and roll that, you know, the Ohio
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:42.240]   University, the University of, you know, which one I'm talking about, is just going to give
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.640]   me for free.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.840]   And then I don't really understand how to navigate it very well.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.840]   So I think that's one of the issues and perhaps this update will make it easier for all of
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.840]   us.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.640]   All the ones I want is because somebody linked to it.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.080]   Like I saw a link to the Stanford iOS developers course, for example, and I followed that link
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.280]   and got there, but I never even considered using it as a browsing to discover new things.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.680]   Yeah, which is too bad.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.680]   Go ahead.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.640]   I was going to say that there's so much, there's so many gems inside there that like
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:14.520]   Renee, I'm all I'm so entertained and amazed by when people send me a link to something
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.640]   that, oh my goodness, I can actually learn about this in a self-paced way and it's free.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.920]   I wish that it were more like the app store where it was easy to simply have my attention
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.720]   called to something that the store thinks that I might find interesting.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.960]   Because again, it is like the first time you get that library path that gets you into the
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:37.720]   stacks and you get to see, wow, popular photography from 1972 through 1988 or all these gems that
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.200]   this has been here all the time.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   Why wasn't I informed?
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.080]   That's actually really interesting because the way Apple works internally is that there
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:49.080]   are store managers and then there's editorial people that there's an app store editorial
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.360]   or an iTunes store editorial and there's that for music and movies and there's that for
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.480]   apps and there's that even for podcasts.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:59.320]   I don't know if there's editorial team for iTunes U or if there is maybe one person or
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.480]   two people and maybe ramping up on editorial would be a way to help people discover the
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.480]   best stuff.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:10.480]   Yeah, I would like to see iTunes U set up as like the app store where it's, hey, here
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:18.560]   are the best science classes of this semester or if you're looking to get into coding, these
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.880]   would be the places, great courses to start.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:26.360]   I don't see a lot of that curation going on.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.440]   I would be nice to know who are the people that are curating me because clearly even
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.440]   if you have an issue with the way the iTunes is laid out, I mean, there are people who
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.280]   are putting apps front and center deciding which app is going to be free for the day
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.280]   or the week.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.680]   It's always felt like one of the apps during the iTunes, even interrupted twice.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.280]   I just want you to go ahead.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.000]   I also think that it's very hard.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.840]   It takes a special person to be able to do self-paced training.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:51.520]   So that's always a difficulty that we see across the board because we build a lot of
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.520]   this stuff.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:57.400]   And having something you can do with a lot of people, I think in finding ways to do that
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.480]   is really important.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:04.560]   I think one of the other challenges is in a lot of ways building an online support for
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:09.360]   real-time classrooms is, and this is going to be sacrilegious to say for a lot of people,
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.280]   is kind of building into the past because the way we run classrooms right now is not
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.080]   the way we're going to run them 10 years from now.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:22.160]   As we really start using technology and not just try to use it to brace the old fact and
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.760]   only of GGP people.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:28.440]   So I think it's very, we're trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.600]   Andy, I know you wanted to say something before we were on.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:39.560]   Just that I think Apple's missing a trick because they've always used the App Store
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:44.360]   as though the things that are content in the App Store and in the iTunes store are valuable
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.360]   in and of themselves.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.960]   And they make money when people download music and when they download movies and stuff like
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.120]   that.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:54.680]   But I really think that iTunes U is there to sell iPads by the hundreds to schools and
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.680]   universities.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:01.520]   So I think the way that the, that part of the store operates reflects the fact that
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.800]   it doesn't really pay for Apple to let civilians into this library.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.160]   They're certainly welcome to come in and check it out.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.520]   But why would Apple, I think the thing is why should they spend a lot of time, effort,
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:19.840]   money and personnel into helping people, Apple people who can't do a purchase order for 500
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:23.120]   iPads, get access to this content and find interesting things?
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.480]   Well, should we take a break?
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.600]   I think that makes sense, Chad.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.840]   Do you think this is a good time for that?
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.840]   He says, thumbs up, thumbs up from the TD desk.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.840]   All right.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:38.760]   Well, let's take a moment then to thank Harry's for sponsoring this episode of Mac Break
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.760]   Weekly.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:44.680]   It's always funny because they, they, people say, Oh, Harry's yeah, that's good for guys.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.680]   And I'm like, excuse me, it could be good for girls too.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.280]   Or, you know, whoever would like a little bit less fur on their body, wherever that might
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.120]   be, Harry's is what are you laughing at?
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.720]   You know what I meant?
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.720]   Everybody's got it.
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.360]   You know, there's varying degrees of how furry people want to be.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.760]   Uh, yeah, there's, there's fairly new advertiser here on the Twitter network.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.920]   You might know exactly what they do.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.720]   But if you don't, I will tell you they are making it.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:15.920]   It's much easier and much more affordable to have quality razors.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.600]   They will deliver these razors to you, to your, to your address of choice.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:26.400]   So you don't have to go into the Walgreens or the CVS or wherever you're getting your
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.280]   razors now and then have to like track down somebody who works there because they've locked
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.720]   up the razors because people steal them because razors are way overpriced.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.720]   They're crazy.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   I don't care.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.400]   What kind of raise you have if you're getting them from a drug store, you're paying way
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.200]   too much, the Gillette's and the everybody they, they've, they've, they've, they've, they've
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.320]   jacked up the price so much that it really doesn't make a lot of sense anymore.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:52.000]   And the folks who started Harry's Andy and Jeff knew that there was a better way to give
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.880]   people a great shaving experience at a fraction of the cost.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.520]   It's minimal, but it's nice stuff.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:03.680]   You got in your, in your Harry's box, you got your razor, you've got your, your, your,
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.920]   your replacement razors, a nice shave cream.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.520]   I mean, I even like the packaging.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:13.640]   The whole thing is lovely, plus a little shave guy and a little extra information about,
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.480]   about how Harry's was started.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.160]   This might sound somewhat familiar to you.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.040]   Warby Parker is another sponsor.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.040]   They sponsor Twit.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.800]   And this is actually the same model because Jeff, one of the co-founders also founded Warby
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:26.800]   Parker.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:27.800]   That's the eyewear brand.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:35.080]   The idea is the, the razor model emphasizes good design, craftsmanship, value, and it's
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:40.960]   a lot like that sunglass market, another area where things are way marked up for no reason.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:46.360]   So if you want to go to Harry's dot com and get, you know, let's say an engraved set,
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.720]   yeah, you can say, send me 12 blades.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.160]   Here's how many I need.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.680]   These are, you know, how often I go through razors, three creams every five months.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.680]   There you go.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.200]   They let you know what your price is going to be.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.120]   And then you're just in the system and get shipped to your door.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.960]   The set is, is, is lovely.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.800]   You know, again, it's minimal, but it's, it's very nice.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:10.680]   And the price is just way better than what you would get if you were to go ahead and
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.000]   buy all these items individually.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.400]   And you don't have to go anywhere.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.000]   You never have to go get razors again.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.840]   I just had a friend who's in Europe have a bunch of razors delivered to me here at Twit
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.440]   to put in my suitcase to bring to her because she's desperate.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.440]   She doesn't know where she's got.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.280]   She doesn't know where to buy razors anymore.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.280]   No, she had Harry's.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.280]   She'd be fine.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.800]   She should have done that ahead of time.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.800]   Here's what you do.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:33.800]   Go to harries.com.

[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:42.960]   purchase.

[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:50.720]   Promocode MACBreak and we thank Harry's for their support of MACBreak Weekly.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:55.720]   Is anyone excited about Apple's CarPlay?
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:01.720]   If so, it's coming to nine new automakers that include Alpha Romeo because I know we've
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.160]   all got one of those.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:08.000]   Audi, Dodge, Jeep, Mazda, Ram.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.520]   I know CarPlay is supposed to be integrated into the kind of car that I have.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:17.520]   It isn't yet, so I like the idea and theory, but it's not as if there's been any real world
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.240]   experimentation I can do with CarPlay.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.720]   What does everybody think about the future of this?
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.600]   We're holding off for Lamborghini, Sarah.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   You're what?
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.800]   Holding off for Lamborghini still.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.680]   Oh, yes, of course, right.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.440]   I'm holding off for Ferrari myself.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:40.280]   I think that the issue here is that I know that for me on a day-to-day basis, the quality
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:45.480]   of the connection between my iPhone and my car would make much more of a difference than
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:50.000]   how the performance or many of the other little doodads that they add to the car because that's
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   something I'm doing every day.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.880]   I have an older car that doesn't integrate with my phone and I'm very bitter about it.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:01.120]   I may actually eventually replace it or put some kind of weird wiring in it because I
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:05.800]   can't—it drives me absolutely crazy that I can't connect my phone.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:09.080]   When I rent cars and they have them, I realize how nice that is.
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:14.320]   I think that definitely as I buy a new car, how this integrates with Android or our iPhone
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.560]   is going to be a very big decision factor.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.520]   I think that's what a lot of people are betting on.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.880]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:26.880]   I vastly prefer having a car mount for my phone because I'm kind of picky about where the
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.720]   phone is in relation to my eyes and the steering wheel.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.680]   But I'm certain that I'm not in the majority of it.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.560]   I'm not sure if someone would pick one car over another based on phone integration though
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:43.920]   because I think people actually care more about where the cup holder is than do they
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.920]   have the right phone?
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.360]   How do they connect the phone to the center console?
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.800]   What apps do they have that can exploit that center console?
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:55.640]   It's a nice feature if you discover it one or two years into your ownership of this car,
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.160]   but I'm not sure that that's going to steer a decision.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:03.200]   I am very, very cheered by the information over the past week ever since Google came
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:07.920]   out with their own car dash scenario that there are multiple makers that have announced
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:14.120]   an intention to support both Apple and the Android system because what it's as the former
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:20.880]   owner of a car that had a centered dash stereo that could not be replaced because Ford decided
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:26.000]   that, hey, we've got a great what if we made a sticker that was in the shape of an oval
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.720]   and you couldn't replace it with anything else that you like later on from Pioneer or
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.720]   everybody else.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:34.720]   I know what it's like when you're inside that car and you know that, oh, so this could
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.160]   do something.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.240]   I could be doing something really wonderful with this phone or this technology that all
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.000]   my friends can do, but I can't because somebody made a stupid marketing decision to bet on
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   one solution to lock out all others.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.840]   So we'll see how that shakes out, but I'm happy with what I have right now and I think
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:58.840]   it's going to take a while for features like this to be part of every car as opposed to
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.280]   something that you have to get the right mall in order to make this work.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.280]   We're getting there though.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.960]   It's just a button up or rambling rant.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:12.440]   The other good news after the announcements about these car systems is that it's no longer
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.960]   the Ferrari logo is no longer the Audi logo.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:20.240]   You're actually are seeing this stuff appearing in like the $20,000 Ford cars and GM cars.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:25.080]   So so long as this becomes something that everybody has access to, that's a win for everybody.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:30.040]   Something that's worked well in a car is the idea of voice control, hands free.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:35.440]   I use Siri a fair amount in my car and it seemed to write down little appointments for
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.600]   myself where I know I'm going to forget by the time I park.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:43.920]   But interesting article in Wired that got written up, I guess it was last night that
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:49.920]   something called neural network algorithms will be coming to Siri in a big way, making
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:55.680]   Siri much better, something that Google has started to use with Android's voice recognition,
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.480]   which is, I don't know about all of you, but Google now voice recognition is heads
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.680]   and shoulders above anything that Apple can do.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:09.760]   In fact, I just, I don't know why it has to be so much worse on the iOS side.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:15.240]   But Google invested early on, I mean, they hired the co-founder of Nuance and he was
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.680]   one of the big patent holders and all this technology and they've been investing in
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:22.320]   it heavily and they do things like putting in natural language in context to wear co-processors
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.080]   and Apple's still the licensee of Nuance.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:27.760]   They're doing more and more to distance themselves or to make it their own technology, but they're
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.240]   not as far ahead in this.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.080]   But this is one of my favorite things too.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:36.200]   And I use Siri all the time and iOS 8 you can say, "Hey Siri," and just start talking.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:40.200]   And I use it to dictate things I don't want to forget, including sometimes entire blog
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.040]   posts while I'm driving.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.880]   And that to me is the key because I was watching the Android Auto stuff and I was watching
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:50.080]   the car play stuff and especially the variety of control schemes from knobs to resistive
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.840]   screens to capacitive screens.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.880]   And all of those to me are still very distracting.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.240]   I still remember being terrified as a kid when my friends would drive around with their
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:01.200]   heads buried in the push button radio stations to find their favorite songs.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:06.280]   And the ability to touch things, even if it's big finger friendly controls, is still not
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.760]   a lot of attention to me.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.640]   So again, with that transitioning of interface, I think that getting that to being voice controlled,
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.640]   sure you may have kids screaming in the background, I might not always work, but getting as much
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.680]   as possible there is good.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:22.600]   And I think it's also important to remember that this is all 1.0 stuff because things
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:26.680]   like extensibility and where we're going in the future where audio is being streamed
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:31.000]   and audio is being processed and they're doing neural network connections to it.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.720]   We're basically using the worst version of this stuff right now and it's going to be
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.960]   coming better and faster, I think, more quickly.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.880]   Yeah, I think that central point is a really good one.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:43.840]   I really think that if you're trying to integrate the phone into the car, I hope that these
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:50.240]   interface makers take more of a smartwatch approach rather than a phone approach where
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.960]   every time you see one of these, whether it's a pebble or whether it's an Android Wear
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:58.720]   device, the idea is to say, well, it doesn't make sense to have a full interface on here.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:04.080]   The idea is to put a simple feature, make sure that people can access the most relevant
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:08.120]   and simplest feature of an app and do it in the simplest way possible.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.560]   We're not going to give you that full functionality.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.960]   It would be a very bad thing if the end result of all these phones in the car solutions is
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:19.480]   to don't worry, all of your apps, you can have icons on the dashboard, you can actually
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:24.440]   use them and you can actually, we want to encourage you to respond to all of your text
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:29.040]   and do clear out your get to inbox zero while you're on I-95 at a slightly 72 miles an
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.040]   hour.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.440]   I hope that there is a certain level of restraint that says that we will let you terminate a
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:39.840]   phone call, if we will let you quickly connect a phone call, quickly answer a text, we will
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:44.400]   let you switch between entertainment and navigation options, but we are not here to help you to
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.760]   play Angry Birds inside your car with Vive Voice Command.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:54.600]   We saw Microsoft earlier this year show off neural networking, which I guess is going to
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:35:00.520]   be this new term as voice recognition gets really, really smart Skype translate, which
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:06.920]   I believe only works from English to German or at least that was how it was demonstrated
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.360]   at this point, but I cannot wait for this.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:14.040]   I am so excited, I need to make a bunch of friends in other countries who I can't speak
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.880]   the same language as just so we can have Skype conversations where we don't actually have
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.320]   to learn the other language.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:24.360]   It's very fun, but Apple hired one of, sorry, what's that Renee?
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.360]   Like Star Trek.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.360]   Universal Translator.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:33.600]   Apple hired Alex O'Sero, who had been a senior director, or he is now a senior director in
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:39.360]   Apple's Siri group, but was at Microsoft for almost 20 years researching speech technology.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:44.040]   So that was sort of the catalyst to this article being written and wired that Apple
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:48.680]   is obviously taking this seriously and doesn't want to be left in the dust when it comes
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:54.960]   to speech recognition that works and is helpful and can give you the answers that you need.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:01.280]   Because I agree with you Renee, I use Siri as much as I can, but I do find that the speech
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.080]   recognition often misunderstands me and I'm trying to speak as clearly as possible and
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.640]   it just needs to be better.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.480]   It's interesting to see this.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:17.280]   I think this is the one really clear two-horse race that Apple and Google have together because
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:22.560]   speech recognition and voice control is not something where Apple's industrial design can
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.000]   help them in any way, shape, or form.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.440]   It really comes down to what features can you implement and how well do they work.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:35.400]   And so to see these two companies trading off on different underlying technologies and
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:40.440]   different ways to surface that in a way that's useful to the user, it's a little bit breathtaking
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:45.680]   and it really gets down to the basic core competency of developing technology.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:50.160]   I agree with you that Android is ahead of Apple right now, but I'm excited to see what
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:54.960]   they choose to do with Siri as the next logical step.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:59.040]   The biggest problem for me is that, I used to remember everybody's phone numbers and
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:03.240]   now that I have contacts on my phone, I don't remember anybody's phone numbers anymore.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.760]   I have the same problem with maps and the same problem with Siri now.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:10.000]   All this stuff is so incredibly convenient, but no one is doing it well enough.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.160]   Now no one's doing maps well enough, no one's doing voice recognition well enough, because
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:17.760]   the minute it fails, I am completely lost or I lose my ability to function on the device
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.640]   that I'm trying to use voice control with.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.640]   And that's the sort of the challenge of this stuff is, yeah, we're going to show you that
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.640]   it's incredibly convenient.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.080]   You don't have to worry about getting lost anymore.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:28.240]   You don't have to worry about not having to touch your phone anymore, but it's got to
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.480]   be rock solid and it's got to be all the time.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.560]   And we're still in this transitional turbulent period where most of the time it's okay, but
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.480]   still sometimes it's the wrong exit number on the highway.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:43.280]   Sometimes you ask it to find you a song and it tries to dial somebody's phone number.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:47.000]   And each of those things is much worse now because we've gotten so dependent on them.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.240]   And that's the thing I think that's take very seriously going forward.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.680]   And that's the thing that worries me about the whole Google car without any steering
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:55.680]   wheels.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.280]   I just know that I'm going to end up at a dead end running into a construction zone and
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:02.440]   there's just nothing I can do other than just sit there.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:08.800]   One of the classic differences for me between Android and iOS was that there is a restaurant
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:13.040]   that I really, really like that has a sort of a screwed up kind of name.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:18.320]   And Siri is impossible for me to call and make a reservation at my favorite restaurant
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.080]   by actually speaking the name.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:24.720]   It is a comedy act like who's on first may trying to say, okay, you don't understand
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.720]   Zafdigs.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.720]   How about soft dags?
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:31.720]   What if I would have had an unceded in terms of English words and it just will always do
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:34.400]   a search for what it thinks that I have.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:38.880]   But really what I've the basic voice recognition and attaching it to functions is good.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:43.520]   What I'm really looking forward to is when both of these systems, iOS particularly, has
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.800]   that agility where it can have a conversation with you.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:51.360]   It's annoying to me to try to have to remember if I want to create an appointment, what order
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:56.000]   do I have to put this information in to make sure that the system is going to get it and
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.200]   put it in correctly?
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.560]   I want to be able to simply say, okay, make an appointment.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.560]   Okay, great.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:01.560]   What do you want to remember?
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.400]   I have a meeting with Ted next week.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.400]   Great.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.400]   What day, what time?
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.400]   Oh, this, that and the other.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.400]   Oh, wait.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:11.840]   I forgot to say that this is, I have to get there 30 minutes early and make those corrections
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:12.840]   as I go.
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.640]   That's how I think and that's how I talk to people.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:19.160]   So if you're having an interface where you're essentially talking to someone, you really
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.600]   have to make that someone be able to have a conversation.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.480]   That's going to be pretty interesting when they come up with that sort of stuff.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:28.160]   And I think that there's a big jump that I think Google now does to some degree.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.600]   And I think that a lot of that is contextually really understanding, not just contextually
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.680]   how words fit together, but contextually how they fit together for you.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:40.560]   So if you want to say, I have a doctor's appointment, the first thing that it should
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.960]   be looking at is the six doctors that you work with.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:50.040]   And so now it gets much more accurate because these are the ones that you're most likely
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.800]   going to say next.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:57.640]   And those are the types of things that I think that we're just seeing the front end of as
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.680]   these information gathering systems start to work.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:05.120]   And when we know we always know where you are, we know where you like to go, those types
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:09.360]   of things allow it to zero in because a lot of what makes speech recognition inaccurate
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.720]   is that it has so many variables that it has to solve at one time.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:17.760]   As we reduce those variables when we're talking, it can become much accurate, much more accurate.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:21.720]   If you say one through 20 and it knows that it's only looking for one through 20, you can
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.200]   have all kinds of accents and it will hit it every single time.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.840]   That's the interesting thing.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:30.840]   If you remember Jeff Hawkins, who was a co-founder of Palm and he did graffiti and now he's working
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.240]   at Nementa, his thing was always that we'll never be able to teach computers to understand
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:38.640]   humans, what we can teach humans to do things in a way that's slightly more accessible
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.240]   to computers.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.720]   And right now I'm willing to change the way that I speak a little bit because my fear
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:48.200]   is that if we teach the computers too well and you have Skybox and you have Boston Dynamics
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.280]   then I'm just bringing the Terminator around quicker.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:57.480]   But what would be a great effect on humanity if we sort of train ourselves to speak clearly
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:02.080]   and make our intentions very, very obvious as opposed to what do you want to do?
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.080]   I don't know.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:10.000]   I was like, Bob, would you like to be at a restaurant on Boylson Street at 7.30 p.m.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   on Thursday without all that chit chat with all that mousin around?
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   This could actually be Skynet just sneaking up on us, slowly forcing us to conform so that
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   we can be subjugated.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.280]   That's kind that can't figure out how to do this so the best way is to get figure out
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.280]   how to adapt us.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.280]   Okay, I'll buy that.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:31.120]   As long as I can make restaurant reservations over my phone, that's fine with my name.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:36.720]   Speaking of phones, we're getting to the point of the year where a lot of people would hold
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:41.960]   off on a replacement phone because we are hoping for something more.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:48.800]   But Apple did just release a new commercial, which is all sort of geared at the parents
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.720]   of the world, a way to use third party apps to be a better parent.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:56.760]   Chad, do you want to roll that?
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:57.760]   I do.
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:58.760]   You do, do you?
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:04.840]   I can't tell you how much I want to roll that out.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.840]   She went back.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:12.680]   Well, you know, I'm not a parent, but I know people who are so I can understand how this
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:13.680]   is all.
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.560]   Yeah, I mean, it's cute.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:22.320]   Yeah, it's the ring hold up.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.400]   All I'm saying is that if I ask my parents, even for my combined Christmas and birthday
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:30.600]   present for $200 thing, let alone a $500 iPad.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.480]   Oh boy, they'd still be screaming right now.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:38.000]   Well, the parents all have them in this, I think.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.560]   I do think that this is, you know, it's obviously geared towards people who aren't necessarily,
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.120]   you know, they're not techies.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:48.160]   This is not like, ooh, it's the cool new thing.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.480]   It's a isn't life complicated.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.120]   Wouldn't you like to be a better person here?
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.120]   It's a better life.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.120]   Have an iPhone.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:01.840]   It's been a while since they've shown, since they've really shown off a commercial that
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.200]   showed off the hardware and the hardware features.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.880]   It really is all about here is what it will be like day to day to have this wonderful
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.760]   Apple product in your life.
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:14.000]   And even to the extent we're going to show off a third party people's engineering and
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.040]   products as opposed to our own.
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.000]   Yeah, that's been the whole theme of these.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.720]   This is the more powerful campaign.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:23.160]   I started off with the actual ad called more powerful than I did the one called strength,
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.960]   which was the fitness tracker one and now it's doing the parenting one.
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:26.960]   And they're really interesting.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.200]   I mean, they're very, very human.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:32.880]   They use very current music, a lot of visuals, a lot of apps, even sometimes apps that get
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.280]   bought by Google two days later.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.360]   You know, that's the cost of doing this kind of business.
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.320]   And this one I think is the most effective to me.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.040]   I like this one a lot.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.280]   And if you looked at the new Apple store signage, I started going live today, they're
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:47.760]   using very similar imagery there where they're showing to Andy's point, not a phone in a
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:53.120]   hand, not a piece of hardware, not a separate sort of device, but they're showing it in
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.440]   integrated into people's lives.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.480]   And I think technology alone is not enough.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.240]   We believe that was always my favorite Apple ad of the last many years.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:03.760]   And I think they're getting back to that storytelling, how these devices can be used
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.080]   and how they can make your lives better.
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.080]   Is this.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.080]   I have a start.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.560]   Have they started making commercials in house?
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:13.640]   Is this part of the new wave now that they've sort of started to move away from she at
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:14.640]   day?
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.480]   The last one was, I don't know if this one is.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.320]   Yeah, I'm trying to kind of remember.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:26.200]   And I think that as a father of two small kids, I recognize a lot of the apps and uses there.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:31.360]   So I think that you definitely integrate that and it becomes very convenient because as
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.120]   a parent you are, things are very chaotic.
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:38.960]   You've got two little kids running around and being able to have things much more convenient.
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:44.480]   You want to have a nice phone, but you have the iPhone or whatever phone you're using.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.560]   You don't have a nice camera, I mean.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.200]   And you have the phone and that's what you're going to take.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:55.360]   The one that they showed with the night cam reveals a lot about your kids.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:59.080]   Mostly that you thought your son was making all the trouble and turns out your daughter
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.480]   was snacking alongside the side of the head.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:06.560]   And it really is an important thing for you to understand about your kids.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:11.440]   So I think that anyway, so I think that it is a very compelling one.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:15.240]   I think that I think a lot of these ads that have been coming out lately showing it contextually
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:19.080]   in the rest of our lives have been pretty effective because I definitely recognize stuff that
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.160]   I'm doing that is very related to that.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:26.000]   I don't know if I'm a good sample, but I definitely recognize myself.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   We did the opposite.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.960]   I just put the video in the chat room, but we gave the iPod touch to my two little God
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.320]   children and then shot what they do with it.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:40.080]   And it's everything from learning with Duolingo to making eye movies to doing FaceTime and
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.080]   things like that.
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.680]   And it's almost a reverse of this because they're showing what parents can do to enrich the
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.320]   lives of their kids.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:50.600]   But this technology is so easily accessible now that you can actually have kids do a ton
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:51.600]   of stuff on their own.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:57.040]   You want to fast forward a little bit through that, but it'll.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:01.240]   And they are eight years old and five years old and the amount of stuff that they can
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.240]   actually get done by.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:03.680]   Oh, these are your God kids.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.920]   Oh, well, they're very cute with an iPhone.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:07.920]   It's amazing to me.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:12.720]   I mean, since they've been using them pretty much since they could sit upright and now they,
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:16.600]   whenever they go on a vacation, they collect photos, they make their own videos.
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:21.240]   Every night they do their French and their Italian on their iPad, on their iPod touches.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:25.560]   If they have to, they send each other messages or they do FaceTime if one of their parents
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:26.560]   aren't around.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.880]   And it's an incredibly enabling technology for them.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.080]   My little is Godson.
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:33.080]   He can read and write a little bit now, but before he could, he could still eye message
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.200]   back and forth with me just using Siri.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.200]   He thought it was his best friend.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.320]   He would just talk to it as a little robot.
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:45.640]   You know, speaking of the iPod touch, Apple has launched a 16 gig iPod touch, which has
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:57.000]   a rear camera for $199, which replaces the, I believe it was $249 non-camera iPod touch.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.400]   So not only is it cheaper, but it's way better because it actually has that nice camera.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.400]   And more colorful too.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:11.480]   And has dropped the price on the 32 and 64 gig iPod touch models to $249 and $299 respectively.
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:17.440]   It must be $229 then for this new model or $199, which is replacing the two anyway.
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:18.760]   They're a lot cheaper.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.640]   And I, when I first saw this, I thought, I mean, really?
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:22.640]   I do.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.440]   Who even cares about the iPod touch anymore, but it's kids.
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.440]   It's perfect for kids.
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:29.880]   You don't have to have some sort of a complicated cellular plan.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:34.880]   And as you said, Renee, it's not stopping them from using it to its full potential.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.880]   One kids, we use a lot of developers.
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:38.880]   Sorry.
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.600]   Yeah, we, as a production unit, we use the iPod.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.680]   I have, I don't know, we have a lot of iPod touches because they're the cheapest thing
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:49.120]   that we can use that we can connect and basically put them under cameras to give, you know,
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.160]   to send feedback, put countdown clocks.
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:55.440]   And we don't use more than, you know, we never use more than eight megs on these things.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.800]   They're just, there's a whole slew of them and they have all kinds of little tools that
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:03.040]   we use and you'll see little ones, like just kind of propped up, you know, in a lot of
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:06.000]   different places for us to have real time feedback and they're really cheap and really
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   convenient.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.440]   And I keep a bunch of them in a little bag and put them up when we're doing productions.
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:14.640]   And so as little heads up displays, they are very, very effective.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.480]   And I think a lot of people use them in kind of odd ways like that, in addition to giving
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.480]   kids.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.400]   So having them cheaper is great for us.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:24.920]   Kind of weird how they announced it though, isn't it?
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:29.200]   It's not that it's not that it's such a big update that it mandated its own event.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:33.440]   But I can't help it wonder why they didn't hold off for a couple of months until they
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:39.440]   could until they could just slip it into an iTunes event in September and do it that way.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:43.160]   I think that I think in a lot of ways, Apple has gotten very focused on what they really
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:45.760]   want to push in these events and they want to shorten those events.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.920]   I mean, we can all remember these three hour events that, you know, you'd be sitting in
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:52.520]   the middle of the room trying to figure out when you were going to, you know, get out
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.120]   of the room in the middle of the room.
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:59.480]   You know, and, but the, you know, so I think that, I think that them shortening these events
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:03.480]   and taking these other things are things that are improving things, but they're not revolutionary.
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:06.640]   The only time we want to talk about something is when maybe not revolutionary, but when
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:10.600]   we're really moving our product line forward, we want to keep you focused on that and not
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:14.200]   give you the kitchen sink, which is I think what something that we, not too many years
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:17.400]   ago, we felt like we were getting every single time they did these events.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:21.280]   And there's a pattern too, because they did the 128 gigabyte iPad.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.440]   They did the refresh to the MacBook Air.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:27.240]   They did the iTunes U thing they did the iPod touch.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:31.440]   And I think what's happening is that they're becoming a just in time company as soon as
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.880]   they can put out that iPad at the price point in the margins they want, they put out that
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.280]   press release as soon as the iPod touch is viable.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.280]   They do that.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:42.320]   And I don't know if it portends anything about what we'll see this September, because previously
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:46.040]   the iPod touch has gotten very little attention over the last months and years and it might
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.320]   have just been a press release then.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:51.520]   But if they have something more interesting to announce than at least this gets, it gets
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:55.000]   it far out of the way, so it doesn't even become part of the story this fall.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:02.040]   Yeah, going back to the iPhone, the upcoming iPhone, whatever it may be, called number
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.760]   wise, expected to be larger.
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:10.360]   The latest stories are 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch models, depending on how big you like your
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:11.360]   phone.
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:17.080]   But it's kind of an interesting poll conducted by RBC Capital Markets.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:22.280]   They said they pulled 4,000 consumers asking, "What do you want out of a phone?
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:24.120]   Is it bigger screen?
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.000]   What is your number one thing?"
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.640]   33% said, "No, we want better battery life."
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:37.520]   Bigger screen was in second place with 23% followed by faster processor and then 12%
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.600]   wanted a better camera.
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:44.080]   I can't say I think that the iPhone has the worst battery life in the world, although
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:48.880]   I did just lose my iPhone over the weekend at a party and couldn't find it on my iPhone
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.160]   because the battery is dead.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:54.480]   So when you think about it that way, sure, I'd like twice the battery.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.320]   I'd like it to charge faster.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.000]   I think that would almost be the real killer feature.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.120]   Do you use your iPad charger or use the iPhone charger that comes with it?
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.200]   I use the iPhone charger.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.640]   If you use the iPad charger, it charges twice as fast.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:08.640]   Oh.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.640]   I'm not that's good.
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:14.040]   Also, if you have a really good third party USB battery, you can use it.
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.040]   You can use the iPad charger.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.040]   You can use the iPad charger.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.040]   You can use the iPad charger.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.040]   You can use the iPad charger.
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.040]   I'm not sure that it's a very good battery charger.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.040]   They can also do quick charges.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.040]   That's the kind of one.
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.040]   I have two copies of the exact same one in both of my bags to make sure that it always
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.040]   just topped off real quick.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.080]   See this one here?
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.280]   This is two amps on the top, one amp on the bottom.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:31.120]   So you can, you know, if something happens to not be, and this is made by some Chinese
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:34.540]   company, this one happens to be PowerGin, but there's a whole bunch of names for it,
[00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:40.400]   but you use that top one and it taps off your iPhone in about an hour.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.400]   From zero.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:46.400]   I've got like six of them.
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.400]   Is that cool?
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:48.400]   It's a Delaware.
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.400]   You and Alex have already talked about this.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:53.200]   I think it was a pick of the week and I immediately bought it on Amazon.
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.200]   They called each other this morning, Sarah.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:01.400]   We're actually, if you look real closely, one second, let me see if I can, the usual phone
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:02.400]   call is working.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.400]   We're also wearing the same shirt too.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.400]   It's very close.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.400]   I told you guys.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:11.400]   You guys, what are you wearing?
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.000]   We're working into each other.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.160]   Yeah, we just sign message each other in the morning.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.160]   So all right.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:21.640]   Well, it sounds like I'm the one who has the least amount of good solutions for battery
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:27.900]   life, but I guess it's sort of the idea of the pull is sort of speaking to sure people
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:34.600]   might want a bigger screen, but it's not actually the thing that everyone's wanting.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:38.600]   But they really want is just the more convenience of battery life.
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.200]   Battery battery battery battery and phone.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.200]   I mean, I mean, camera and camera and battery.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.200]   That's all I get about.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:50.080]   I mean, the camera, the cameras obviously can be improved, but it's quite nice.
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.320]   Is I want a half inch chip in there?
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:56.840]   I just want a big half inch chip, you know, with a, you know, like, you know, like three
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:57.840]   times.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:58.840]   Sorry.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:52:59.840]   The Lumia 1020 lens.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:00.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:07.880]   What I want what I want is a real xenon flash and I'm hoping that some of the APIs that come
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:12.720]   out in Iowa say I don't think Apple will ever decide to make a phone thicker in order to
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:17.480]   accommodate hardware for the camera or even or anything cool like that.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:21.720]   But I'm hoping that the technologies that are in Iowa say will let someone make a really
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:26.520]   nice camera sled for it that will have things like an integrated xenon flash that can actually
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:30.920]   integrate with a custom app that has fine grain controls over exposure and stuff like
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:31.920]   that.
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.320]   But it's I did read the article about it.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:41.120]   It's it did leave me wondering how people are wired up to respond to a poll like that
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:44.800]   or a question like that where I think that they're mostly thinking about the phone that
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:48.800]   they have today and what disappoints them about it.
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:56.840]   If you told them that if if you placed instead two different iPhones in front of them and
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:01.120]   gave them an option of a larger screen or a smaller screen with which one would they
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:05.160]   then take I think that's a more relevant sort of way of going about it.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:09.760]   And the and the other thing is that making it bigger does make more room for batteries.
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:14.400]   It does make force a larger and more power hungry display.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:18.880]   But some of the some of all the phones that I've been testing some of the ones that have
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:22.840]   the best battery life are the ones with the bigger screen simply because the the circuitry
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:27.120]   for the actual phone stays the same and there's lots and lots and lots of more room to pack
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:30.480]   that thing full of battery and boy does no key in other companies actually take advantage
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.480]   of that.
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:37.520]   So I'm really I'm just I just want to just say that I'm that's why I'm really looking
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.000]   forward to if Apple does come up with two different sized phones.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:45.560]   I'm really interested to see if Apple's going to release information about who's buying
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:51.400]   what or if it's going to be one of the oh well we're combined we sold over 14 million
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:56.040]   phones this year this quarter without saying that oh well the 5.1 has been outselling every
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:00.240]   every other one every one out there or yeah we're real we think that we did everything
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:05.520]   we intended to do by producing the 5.5 inch iPhone we would need to update it next year.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:10.240]   Well that's what they did with the 5c numbers it just it made for a wonderful quarter but
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:15.000]   the 5c was not necessarily such a great seller it was all combined numbers.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.760]   You got to you got to work out the ASP and then do backwards math magic to try and figure
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:20.240]   out which one sold where.
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.240]   Hi.
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:25.920]   The interesting I'm excited about a bigger phone I you know I understand that the four
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:33.000]   inch iPhone face at this point seems like a little phone I'm so used to it though and
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.960]   I was used to the one that was that that wasn't stretched out.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:42.720]   I will say I mean I have I have bigger phone I big and this is my real were a wanden phone
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:46.760]   that I just use here and then this is and I don't know what this is a max and then this
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:52.280]   is the HTC that I like the camera on I like the short of the field thing that it does
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.560]   but I have to admit when I'm typing when I want to type quickly I still want my iPhone
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:59.920]   to get a hold of it you know so the screen real estate is nice when I'm watching something
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:04.400]   I just don't watch a lot of my phones and so I would that's my iPad's for me and so because
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:08.640]   I'm not watching a lot of stuff I find that the smaller size actually works for me better.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:12.240]   An interesting thing for me is that a lot of times these surveys are not put in any context
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:17.560]   because you know I want a bigger battery well so do you know so do I but what price will
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:21.240]   you pay for that will you take a phone this twice as thick like the razor max line and
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:24.920]   some people happily will do that some people want double the battery life in a phone half
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:28.960]   the size which is not possible in current laws of physics and battery remains one of the
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:32.320]   biggest problems there's just very little advances people are looking at graphing they're looking
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:36.320]   at other options but the battery not only does it take a lot of space but it's it's
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:40.240]   an insulator so you have to ramp down the process or speed faster because it's keeping
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:44.560]   the heat higher in the phone if they could fix that we'd have fantastic devices there's
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:48.960]   very little indication that that's going to be fixed anytime soon though so I think all
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:52.480]   these kinds of things are wonderful I want a better camera I want a bigger screen you
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:56.040]   just have to start picking the ones that are really important to you and then realizing
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:00.400]   what the trade-off start like I want a much bigger lens with optical image stabilization
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:03.880]   well they want that index and now your phone again has to be much thicker and if you're
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:07.200]   willing to have that there are some phones that do that but not everybody wants that
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:11.840]   trade-off I think I think it'd be more interesting to approach people who have switched from the
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:16.080]   iPhone to something else and then ask them okay did you buy one with a bigger screen
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:20.080]   or did you buy one that's pretty much the same size as the iPhone so it's interesting
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:23.880]   to get the sort of data but there really isn't any sort of a smoking gun on what people really
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:27.320]   want I think most people if they're sticking with a certain platform they're generally
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:30.560]   happy with it they just want what they have right now to work a little bit better than
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:32.120]   it does.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.520]   And Volta was interesting from Google I/O they talked about Project Volta which was their
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:41.480]   attempt to make Android to do a lot of magic to make Android batteries go longer and Apple
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:45.000]   doesn't have those kind of code names but they have a lot of people working on getting
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.400]   every bit of battery life out of it and that's probably what we're going to look forward
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:52.560]   to for now is the bigger phone will have to pay a bigger penalty in terms of lighting
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:56.720]   up a bigger screen and using more LED and stuff but the battery technology will once again
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:58.440]   get better at the same time.
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:02.080]   Yeah there are a lot of times I do thought experiments about if I really did have ultimate
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:06.800]   power over Apple and I did have that I also had the tyrannical seat of power at Apple
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:11.200]   not the one that tries to get everybody going along with the people who fear me and will
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:15.440]   duck will take the stairs if they think that I'm going to be entering the elevator.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:21.400]   I would love to tell the tell the resource group to your mandate is your next design
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:27.920]   of phone and it's not going to be any even one millimeter slimmer than a full three quarters
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:33.840]   of a centimeter or whatever whatever the current thickness of the iPhone 5s is add 50% to that.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:38.280]   Now do whatever to exploit that extra thickness however you want and let me see what you come
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:44.600]   up with because I have I just have a feeling that if Apple lost this idea that phone should
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:49.640]   be as skinny as possible so that when you put them in the big fat ugly bumper rubber bumper
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:53.880]   case you know you can think that well inside all this rubber it's a very thin phone.
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:57.320]   I imagine they could do wonderful things with camera they could do wonderful things with
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:01.520]   battery they could even do wonderful things with CPU they could do wonderful things about
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:05.880]   making making their phone weatherproof and a little bit more dust resistant.
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:10.880]   I often wonder exactly how expensive that super slim design is and whether or not that's a
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.200]   price is still worth paying.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:17.800]   If you've got a larger iPhone let's just say that we're starting to get almost into
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.760]   phalbit territory with the new iPhones that come out.
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:23.640]   Does Apple care that it could cannibalize iPad sales?
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:25.240]   I'm thinking no.
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.360]   No.
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:26.840]   No.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:30.040]   They want to cannibalize they they have never been shy about cannibalizing their own thing.
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:33.520]   That's been one of their greatest strengths is they've never tried to soak every penny
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:38.040]   out of everything they could like they never tried to soak the iPod line up they're happy
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:42.960]   for the iPod touch to get cannibalized by the iPad many and by the iPhone 5c and 5s same
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:45.760]   with the Mac and the iPad they just want to make sure it's not another company that's
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:49.720]   cannibalizing them so if they can take existing market share and get people onto new devices
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:53.880]   that's fine they can take it away so right now Apple sells most of their premium phones
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:57.560]   in the world and the other premium phones are larger screen devices the people who can't
[00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:01.920]   get iOS on a device size of their choice by offering an iPad is a bigger size maybe they'll
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:05.880]   lose a couple iPad sales but they have a chance at going after the sales of people who are
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:11.440]   now buying Samsung or or Nokia or HTC devices and I think to them that's a price they'll
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.160]   pay every day.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:18.040]   It could be something to keep an eye on though as part of as we're trying to guess if Apple
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:22.680]   is changing a lot of if a lot of things we always have known and some soon about Apple
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:28.040]   have been changing as it evolves into you know to the 2014 2015 version of the company.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:32.600]   One of the classical observations has always been that Apple wants a very very thin price
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:36.800]   list they don't want to have they don't want people to come in and have any doubts about
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.920]   what it is they came in to get.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:43.640]   Whereas HP and Samsung they'll make a million different tablets and a million different devices
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:48.000]   and without a whole lot of clarity between why they should get the 13 and a half inch notebook
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.920]   versus the 14.2 inch notebook that has the Celeron processor but has the Celeron a processor
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.040]   all this sort of stuff.
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:59.240]   It will be interesting because usually they have absolutely no qualms about cannibalizing
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:05.720]   their own sales but usually it's because they have decided that they've decided that this
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:09.720]   product is going to be dead anyway it's going to be irrelevant in two or three years and
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:14.440]   they'd much rather have you replace this irrelevant device with a new more relevant
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:15.600]   Apple device.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:20.640]   So although we are speaking of a larger and a smaller phone as though they're announced
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.320]   products of course they're not they're just rumors they're very good rumors but they're
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.720]   just rumors at this point.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:29.400]   It would be it'll be interesting to watch this and see that Apple is now saying that we
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:35.200]   will give you a larger phone a much larger phone that's still slightly smaller than a
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:40.040]   tablet and then will also give you a tablet that's larger than the phone and this tablet
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:44.840]   will also be slightly smaller than this other tablet above it and by the way please don't
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.400]   listen to rumors that we're creating another tablet that's slightly larger than the larger
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.760]   tablet.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:55.280]   So it's it's not something I'm used to seeing and if I had resistance a few months ago to
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:59.280]   the idea of Apple coming up with two larger screen phones it is because of that old style
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:04.120]   thinking that Apple would not Apple would not give you a choice between let's say a 5.5
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:08.880]   inch to 4.8 inch phone unless they had a really good explanation for what the difference
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.840]   between those two are going to be.
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.680]   Now I'm not quite so sure.
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.680]   All right.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.680]   Good explanation.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:27.680]   No, I do you does anybody have ideas on which one they would choose if again we have
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:34.080]   let's say let's say we have a 4.7 and a 5.3 inch iPhone and you're probably not going
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.000]   to get both of them.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.520]   I have to get a little more to review on.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.520]   Oh, sorry.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:45.520]   Outside of having to have a review of both of them the one that I would buy would I think
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:50.360]   would have to be the larger one chiefly because I don't spend a whole lot of time like talking
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:56.200]   on this phone and because I'm a big beefy he-man I have these big pockets and I have no problem
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:01.280]   like putting this pop tart size phone into a pocket somewhere and most of the time I
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:08.080]   often find myself sort of stumbling between wanting to have an iPad with me and not caring
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:12.400]   because so many times I'm doing so much reading and so much research and maybe a little bit
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:16.080]   of work but not enough to justify taking a big screen device with me.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:21.720]   So I would be all over 5.5 inch device when I laughed at the larger size Lumia phone
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:26.160]   when it first came in but boy you have that around for a couple of weeks and you start
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:31.200]   to realize what a nice little form factor it is to say nothing of the idea of what Apple
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:37.080]   could do with a larger device with a larger camera in it because the my only my the only
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:42.440]   really major sacrifice in switching to Android for me has been losing that great iPhone camera.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:45.560]   So if they're able to say that oh by the way we put in a larger sensor here and now we
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.880]   have room for a flash in here and but also you have this larger view screen that lets
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:55.560]   you almost see a preview of a 4.4 by 6 inch print as you're taking the picture.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.680]   Oh boy would that be nifty.
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:01.600]   Alex you've already got some a bit of a phone collection with you.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.720]   What do you think about size?
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:07.440]   You know I think that I won't know until I actually play with them.
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:14.000]   I know that for me again you know like for instance between the the the HTC and the iPhone
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.920]   and I still find the smaller version smaller and the problem is I'm not really using the
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:22.720]   screen that often for its size you know I'm using it to get information out and so I
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:26.560]   think that that's the issue for me is that I'm just not I may not be a typical use case.
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.040]   I just don't watch a lot of videos on it.
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.840]   I don't look at a lot of things that I really care how big the screen is.
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.760]   I do like the fact that the phone is smaller.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:38.160]   If I thought that the screen size would give me more battery life I'd be tempted to get
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.160]   a bigger one.
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:44.560]   So so because I think my you know my iPhone if I don't charge it will be dead by noon typically.
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:48.000]   Well it's interesting.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   Go ahead Renee.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.560]   I was just going to say that a lot of my thoughts on this is is are based on the assumption
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:56.120]   that the phones will be identical and it's just going to be a matter of choosing the size
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.040]   like with the iPad mini retina and the iPad air today.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:04.280]   But it's quite possible that because the 5.5 inch iPhone is bigger maybe to Andy's point
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:08.240]   they could add a better camera to it or could have a significantly better battery life or
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:12.480]   could have some other feature that the smaller iPhones missing or or I don't know how they're
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:13.480]   going to stage the feature.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:17.640]   So the features will I'm sure play a factor in my decision and maybe a lot of people's
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:18.640]   decisions.
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:24.400]   Or what if the 5.5 is the smallest iOS device that can run to applications side by side.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:28.400]   Or also I forget I Ben Behren made the point that the big phones right now do not sell
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.600]   very well in North America.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:34.720]   The Galaxy notes sell abysmally in North America but they sell incredibly well in emerging
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:37.440]   markets but those emerging markets want really cheap phones.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:40.880]   So if it's an iPhone 6C that's the bigger phone because that's the market is going to
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:45.680]   sell in I would go for the 7.7 because that would be the premium device.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.440]   So it really depends on how they lay this stuff out.
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:52.160]   It's also it's not so much what you're used to I think.
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.840]   I mean I remember back in the day when I had a blackberry pearl it was like it was awesome
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:01.920]   because it could go into even sort of a tight gene pocket and wouldn't really it wouldn't
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:03.440]   hinder me at all.
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:07.320]   You know the iPhone 5s is perfectly fine for me.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:10.680]   I don't sit there looking at it thinking I wish this was bigger.
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:14.160]   But yeah I think if there was a little bit more screen real estate I might use an app
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:20.200]   like Flipboard a lot more often on my iPhone which I find not really very fun at all on
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.360]   my iPad I think it's delightful.
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:25.560]   So there is a there is a issue of screen real estate.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:30.960]   It's funny because I use Flipboard on 99% of the time on my iPhone and specifically
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:34.240]   because I don't I'm usually standing in some line or I'm you know like you know and so
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.040]   the thing is is having just just one hand on I find that the iPad version is too big.
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:41.600]   So it doesn't you know I can kind of get through the same information quickly so it definitely
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.600]   is going to be an interesting Apple giving people choice is definitely going to be an
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.600]   interesting model.
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.400]   If they are they.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:53.320]   Yeah I think it would be a shame if they if they took that the the standard sized iPhone
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:57.680]   screen off the market entirely because like Sarah said I mean it's it's nice to have
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:01.320]   a phone that is manageable and pocketable for a wide range of pockets.
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:05.640]   I mean I make I make fun of my my tactical cargo pants where I could I can literally
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:12.120]   put a 9.7 inch iPad in my back pocket if I have to and I have but I'm but really there
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:16.080]   are people that really do need something that's a lot more manageable that is easier to easier
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.520]   to one hand than anything else.
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:22.640]   I mean the fact that I'm excited about having a 5.5 inch screen on my on my car dashboard
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:27.400]   and being able to target with my finger a lot more accurately and be able to see data
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:30.600]   with just a glance as opposed to having to go in like this which is what I kind of have
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:34.080]   to do with when I've got the iPhone 5 there doesn't mean that works for everybody.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:37.600]   So it's it's going to be interesting to see what kind of bets Apple chooses to cover
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.600]   with screen size.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.600]   Yeah absolutely.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:46.440]   All right let's take a moment to thank our second sponsor that is Gazelle for this episode
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.360]   of Mac break weekly.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:51.440]   We're talking about new iPhones they're coming.
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:56.320]   We don't know exactly what's going to happen but we can safely say before long we're going
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:01.480]   to have a whole new range of devices and that might mean that your trusty little whatever

[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:09.440]   You can sort of throw it in the junk drawer.
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:13.400]   You can well that's pretty much your only option right because how many phones you really

[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:04.720]   with everyone at iMORTA to just help you'll be our virtual office and just keep us communicating
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:09.160]   during the day but campfire it's just not getting the attention that it that it once
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:12.120]   got you know the the writing on the wall is clear it's not going to continue that much
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:15.880]   longer I don't think anyway so we had the choice of looking at hip chat looking at slack
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:19.400]   and we ended up going with slack because it has a lot of great features it provides
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:25.320]   the same sort of little virtual office rooms as something like campfire or something like
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:30.400]   hip chat you can do direct messages as well you can embed images but it's got a lot of
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:35.240]   really great integration so for example we use Trello for a lot of our planning and you
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:39.520]   can integrate Trello into this so that when cards are moved or updated or otherwise you
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:44.640]   know change their information it pops right into the stream inside of slack you can do
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.960]   that with Twitter feeds you can do that with just tons and tons of things it also is very
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:53.920]   well organized and it's it's kind of cute kind of friendly looking and they have mobile apps
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:58.240]   and the best thing is those mobile apps really work anyone who's ever used Skype on mobile
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:02.440]   knows that it's not a given that a mobile app is good for communication it's gonna work
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:06.960]   anything close to effectively but so far I've been using slack for a week maybe two weeks
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:11.720]   now and it's just been tremendous we've moved over with almost no hassle we got up and running
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:17.160]   I think within a couple hours we had 30 maybe 50 people transitioned and we've just been
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:21.480]   using it since and it's gotten to the point where I haven't opened campfire in you know
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:25.840]   since that day and I have I keep forgetting to open Skype now because I just find no real
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:30.600]   need for it and so if you're looking for this kind of thing if you're running a virtual
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:34.800]   office or you have you know a club or a group or anything that would benefit from virtual
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:40.640]   communications in this style I think slack is a great choice.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:44.040]   Alex your tip of the week?
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:48.520]   So I'm always playing with photos you know and photo editing and one of the ones that
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:51.880]   I've started to play with that I really like a lot and just another one that I'm playing
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.320]   with and there's all these ones but have you played with lightly at all?
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:02.920]   So it's no lightly L I T E L Y and you take your photos and of course it's got a you know
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:07.320]   a couple filters here and you can shop for other presets of course it's you know it's
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:10.320]   all that make their money but even the ones that they have here what I really like about
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.960]   it is is you know you find one there and then you can just simply drag looking at the photo
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:19.760]   you can you can adjust the the effect you can open up you know everything from exposure
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:25.280]   to sharpened to vibrance and you know kind of play with how that effect is going to you
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:30.960]   know to work it's one of many other apps that you can do this with but right now it's the
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:35.960]   one that I'm that I'm really enjoying it's just a it's a fun little app as far as you
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:40.640]   know kind of cutting things and very I don't know from me I feel like I get this kind of
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:46.640]   interesting mix of control and fluidity that that I haven't really seen as much with the
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:51.000]   other apps where it just feels very I feel like I'm doing things very quickly with it
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.280]   that I enjoy so it is I think it's free so it doesn't you know there's not a lot of
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:58.520]   commitment there of course you know the way they make their money is you can you know
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:04.680]   shop for presets other looks that you might want which are also not very expensive and
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:10.080]   they are very cool so so there's a lot of you know other things that you can add to it
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:14.120]   you'll end up spending a whole six dollars I think on a slew of presets that you can
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:18.520]   play with but there's again there's something about the speed and the control mixed together
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:22.000]   and there's a lot of apps that give you one or the other more effectively but I think
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.800]   this is a very nice mix of the two of them and definitely worth trying for nothing and
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:33.720]   that is lightly this is nice I'm I just loaded a picture of me and my friends new baby that
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:39.440]   was taken last night and at first glance it kind of reminds me of Viscocam VSCO cam
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:44.320]   yeah but it's it does seem a little bit more intuitive maybe not quite so fully future
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:50.840]   to do sorry Ted but yeah we've got exposure here we've got yeah sharpening tools, vibrance
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:56.400]   which is all the rage these days and yeah this is this is real nice these are some presets
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:02.360]   here in fact it really reminds me of VSCO cam in a way just yeah less less to buy right
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:06.880]   off the top Andy have you are you familiar with lightly?
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:10.480]   I haven't used lightly been familiar with VSCO cam but if you're telling if you're saying
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:16.520]   that it reminds you of that that's a pretty good compliment yeah I yeah I think the design
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:22.440]   maybe more than anything else but yeah you've got if you go into the area the the shopping
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:26.520]   area we're on the starter here which gives you nine presets but then yeah you can go
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:33.280]   a little nuts origins Venice and this is this seems to be kind of the the trend now is the
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:37.160]   photo apps will say well we'll just give you a few because we know that not everybody
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:43.440]   goes crazy for filters but if you do then this free app then becomes you know a two dollar
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:49.240]   app which is fine maybe you know maybe I want all of those black and white iOS 8 those
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:53.880]   will be available to you in other apps now as well which is great I know I do have to
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:57.880]   remind myself that just because I'm a hobbyist photographer doesn't mean that people share
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:01.880]   the way that I interact with photos that I think people I think most people are just
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:06.280]   like you Sarah where they do all their imaging at image editing on the phone itself and they
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:11.360]   then just shoot it out from the phone directly and so if I'm hoping for aperture like controls
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:16.840]   where I can say she I like that green but I remember the green being a not quite so yellowish
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:20.920]   I think it was a little bit more bluish I want to adjust just that green I think most people
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:25.600]   are just want to look through a menu of preset filters that looks nice great let's let's post
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:35.120]   that one well Andy what is your pick of the week mine's a really cool little iPhone app
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:39.160]   called rookies that lets you as you can as you might have guessed lets you design baseball
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:43.640]   cards there are a lot of apps that are kind of like this and even apps in this sort of
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:49.080]   category where it says oh well you get to make postcards and bumper stickers and you see
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:53.400]   oh great so does it look just like a baseball card no basically we take your picture and
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:57.760]   then we add a rounded border to it and put a quote team name in times new Roman no it
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.040]   doesn't look like a baseball card but they actually have a like about a dozen different
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:07.840]   card designs that will remind you of what baseball cards are supposed to look like I've
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:13.520]   got Tim Cook here I got Craig Frederigi say I got that I got these in the same sorry right
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:19.040]   wrong wrong there you go this Craig Frederigi those are both both of the same style you can
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:24.240]   do front and back so if you want to do statistics you can do that here's another format if you
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:32.360]   want to do horizontal format there's our 214 baseball card and you can add all this stuff
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:37.320]   it really looks like a well designed thing and here's the here's the other cool thing about
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:42.000]   it it's it's a free app there are no in-app purchases you don't like it doesn't cost you
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.320]   two dollars to get the other version of what you like what the way that the way they make
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:50.280]   their money is that you can then order you can see that's the screen right there you
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:55.720]   can order these printed up as real wax package baseball cards where everything but the gum
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:00.000]   they say where I'll be printed on the same sort of like cardboard it'll be wrapped in
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.120]   wax packaging and it will ship to you as these like real looking baseball cards that's I
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:09.520]   think that's why they would so much work into the design of these things so but even as
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:13.760]   a free download and something you can just simply spit these out into new images into
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:17.880]   your camera roll that you can then do whatever you want with and repurpose definitely worth
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:22.120]   the download and I'm pretty sure that at some point in life I will say okay I want to see
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:25.560]   what that looks like as a real baseball card and then maybe I'll do something clever for
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:29.800]   Christmas like have Christmas baseball cards I'll send to people you never know that's
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:37.880]   terrific I was a Max cost I don't actually I don't even know I was so excited about making
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:43.080]   baseball I basically went through every single photo in my photo library on my iPhone it was
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:48.400]   like oh we'll do a squirrel baseball team of baseball cards I don't think it's I don't
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:53.080]   think it's prohibitive though it's not crazy stupid you know and I know that this is this
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:59.720]   is not not very imaginative but I could totally see doing this for a little league team so
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:04.720]   if you're a parent you'd be the star of the show I'm just saying you know and all the parents
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:07.600]   would chip in for this if you made the little pack that was the little league team I know
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:12.240]   when I was a kid on the league that would have been that would have been pretty awesome
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:16.680]   well I mean how exciting is it for a kid to have like a real baseball card I don't I'm
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:24.600]   not sure if kids are hit let me see by this card tap cars to add them to your pack okay
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:29.160]   let's how much are they for card I'm getting trying to figure out that right now hurry
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:36.760]   I'm going to need we're impatient sorry I didn't do I did do my work okay I'm just organizing
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:44.640]   my photography one 20 custom cards is 12 is 1299 with shipping it's 1599 so that'll be
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:49.400]   one pack of 20 so that's if you if you're used to like for a lot of your friends say
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:54.000]   I'll buy them a CD okay that's that's one CD worth and they can put that in the bid in
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:01.440]   the cards of the spokes I'm doing this I'm so good I think it's good idea I like I also
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:05.000]   like the fact that you read the story of this this product on the site they said that they
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.240]   really did want include like really bad stale gum in every pack to but the FBA would not
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:15.880]   let them do that one one one one piece of advice though I kept looking back onto the
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:20.800]   iTunes store to find this if you do a search for rookies and rookies baseball cards you
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:29.280]   will find everything but this app so my tip is to go to rookies app.com our OOK IES APP.com
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:34.200]   and I'll take you right to the product page in the download link I need I need to know
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:40.160]   why if you have the exact name of the app and often you even add the the developer name
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:47.680]   or company name into the search field you still have to go to that company's website
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:55.400]   and then click the app store I know it's hard I know because Apple is not Google well can
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:21:01.800]   they be I have it all I have an alternative theory okay Tim's been CEO for like five or
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:07.840]   six years but he's still not quite done firing people yet I don't I don't want to be mean
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:11.360]   but this is the sort of thing where I'm give you ever have these these problems in the
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:15.520]   computer where you find yourself talking to the computer because you're out of options
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:21.000]   you're saying look I'm giving you the name of the app what what else could I do but like
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.800]   manually look through every single thing and say here is a picture of what I was like
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:28.440]   goodness like it's like I was like I'm like I'm like I'm like lamb choc and chicken no no
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:35.360]   steak with does that mean fish steak you know it turns you into Bill Cosby like give me that
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:43.600]   no not exactly that what I give just give me that son was your head with you all day today
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:50.080]   I feel like I got to an to an iTunes melting point when I was trying to find the yo app
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:53.960]   which I assume we've all talked about on Mac break already as the dumbest app that's
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:22:02.360]   ever been made and I couldn't find it because in the app store it's yo period with a punctuation
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:07.000]   it so it you know it took me a million years and I had to go find it on some article I'm
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.840]   trying to get an app not the battle fish I shouldn't I shouldn't feel a sense of achievement
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:17.640]   once I actually find something on the app store exactly exactly ah well all right so I know
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:24.080]   Alex had lightly which is looks to be a very promising photography app but I don't exactly
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:28.360]   have a specific tip but I thought well since we're on the photography train and since I
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:35.400]   have cute photos at the ready of my friends baby I would just let you guys know what my
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:40.160]   just kind this is just sort of like my default if I want a photo to look better and it's already
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:45.120]   pretty good photo the process that I go through and I mean I've got like 45 photography apps
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:49.720]   I'm all about photography app so I just sort of collect them however I do feel like what
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:55.520]   what has worked well for me is a combination of opening the photo in snap seeds now snap
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:59.800]   seed is a Google product used to be independent let's go ahead and we'll open up this picture
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:04.800]   of my friends little new son Milo we'll go ahead and say okay we'll use it you know it's
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:10.800]   cute picture right now snap seat does a lot of stuff but I find in general that a combination
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:15.760]   of a little automatic which adds a bit of contrast I go ahead and say okay let's go ahead and
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:21.440]   process this then tuning image which then I take to the ambiance now of course in snap
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:26.000]   seeds you the UI can be a little off putting to people at first but once you get the hang
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.240]   of it there's I mean there's features on every level here we've got brightness and ambiance
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:37.200]   in contrast and saturation but ambiance specifically is like adding just a little HDR light so if
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:41.280]   I go ahead and say all right let's go ahead and bring the ambiance up to let's go to about
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:47.200]   40 on this guy and of course I can see my before and after here oh yeah it's good it's
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:51.040]   kind of hard to see on some of these cameras but I guarantee you it makes his skin tone
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:55.800]   look a little bit nicer go ahead and say yes then at this point I saved my photo library
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:01.200]   see this is why I just I spent too much time on my iPhone and I need a better hobby then
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:07.360]   what I do is I open it up in Visco Cam because it's already been saved and updated a pretty
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:12.240]   good amount go ahead and open that here then I go into my presets because I've bought them
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:20.240]   all and then I move down to the I think it's G right these are my portrait section yeah so
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:28.880]   G1 and G2 these are Visco Cam presets that I have I have paid for I go ahead and say all right let's
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:35.200]   go ahead and take some of this so this is if if there was no filter at all just kind of
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:39.360]   clean this up it's kind of just sort of make this a little bit more ethereal and angelic
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:46.080]   pretty happy with that guy how could how could baby be more angelic well well we're the we're
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:50.240]   the filter Andy we're the three and then you go ahead and save the camera roll and then
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:54.800]   usually at that point I send it to instagram and hope I get as many likes as possible so that's
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:25:00.400]   I always say it's gonna save you so much time I hope so because this is extremely time consuming
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:04.800]   I mean that that is literally the the process that I go through with pretty much all pictures
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:09.840]   and then I decide if I want to take it into some other app beyond that point but that's time
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:14.240]   consuming I mean I've gotten pretty good at it at this point but that is uh it's one of those
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:22.080]   like photo layering options that I feel like gives me a better result than any one photo app can
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:26.640]   do on its own then again have a plate around too much with lightly so it would be nice to have a
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:33.440]   little bit more of like a one touch option or an or an if this than that for my for my process
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:39.120]   automated or for photo exactly that would be fun too well is there anything that we have not
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:43.920]   discussed on this episode of Macbreak Weekly uh that that that you guys were hoping I would bring
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:49.680]   up that we need to discuss before we sign off now is the time hosting skills Sarah what's the

[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:08.720]   Alex Lindsey is coming to us live from Rwanda where he and the PICS core team are doing a lot of good
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:16.240]   work uh Alex how long are you gonna be there I am here until uh Saturday night oh I got dark
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:23.520]   all of a sudden hold on one second I said Skype uh really stinks anyway so um uh yeah now here
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:27.840]   until Saturday night although we may I may post a video if it's not too gory we are going to eat a
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:34.400]   goat um not alive but it's we'll start alive and then it will end up on the table um on Saturday
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:40.080]   I told them I'm getting the goat but I said I said I'm getting the goat but I want to film the
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:43.600]   whole process because I was like did the goat start alive and they said all goats start alive and
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:49.680]   I was like well that's true so um so so so so I so I'm gonna you know film the process and decide
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:53.760]   how much of it I let everyone else see because some of it might be a little gory um but it will
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:28:01.520]   start with a goat and then end up with um dinner and then the uh um but uh and then that might be
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:06.080]   30 seconds long you know without a lot to it anyway but um and then I get back next week I've got a
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:11.120]   bunch of events so I'm kind of traveling around um but also I'd love to get people's feedback uh
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:16.720]   we just did our first final cut virtual user group um a couple last week I believe last week
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:21.520]   of the week before and uh it is uh you can find it on my if you follow me on twitter you'll find
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:26.240]   it there um and I may get darker again because um Skype you know stinks we're talking about that
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:36.640]   um so uh FC uh bug so final cut virtual user group -1 um if you go to bitly that's bitly uh FC VUG -1
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:41.760]   uh and it's on YouTube as well on in the pixel core site um but you can see the entire like
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:46.640]   result of our question engine um system that's there as well if you go to the if you go to the actual
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:51.520]   URL and you can find it on my twitter feed Alex Lindsey uh we we kind of are experimenting with
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:56.560]   this idea of this discussion between experts and where people can ask questions in real time and
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:02.160]   these experts like some of the best final cut users in in the uh in my opinion in the world I just
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:06.480]   sat there and just kind of ran the conversation and asked stupid questions um but if you look down
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:09.600]   the side like for instance if you go ahead hit play there for a second you don't have to you can
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:15.440]   turn the audio down but so if you watch that though watch this if you click on uh click on one of
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:21.760]   those questions on the side watch this it'll just take you right to that question so um so anyway
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:24.640]   if you want to see what what discussion was happening there you can kind of go through the
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:29.040]   different questions and all those questions were questions that came in from uh you know from
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:34.240]   people who were viewing it so the idea was to kind of create a new format for user groups and uh you
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:39.040]   know it's not perfect um you know we're in the midst of creating something new and training guys
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:44.400]   and doing it so um but uh we'd love to get your feedback on it so um definitely take a look at it
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:50.880]   and and let us know what you think excellent Renee Richie celebrating Canada Day uh as well as
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:58.560]   prolifically contributing to uh not only the show but everything apple uh for i'm more and beyond
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:02.560]   uh what's what's new over the next week what can we expect from you Renee?
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:07.680]   i'm doing a series called iOS 8 explained where i try to take everything and just you know put it
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:12.240]   into layman's terms and there's a lot of stuff announced so if you go to i'm more.com/ios8
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:18.480]   um iOS - 8 you'll see all of that what i'm really excited about though is we have the final episode
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:24.720]   of our nittin ganatra trilogy on the debug podcast tomorrow he was director of iOS apps at apple um
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:29.200]   last week we covered the purple project all the way to the launch of the original iPhone
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:33.600]   and this last part we talked about all the decisions made from the iPhone to the iPad
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:40.400]   like why there was no mms why there was no cut and paste how they scaled apps to go to the iPad size
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:45.280]   so if like me you consider the advent of the iPhone a one of the biggest cultural events of
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:50.240]   our last decade at least in technology then this is a guy who was at those table making those
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:56.560]   decisions and i find that endlessly fascinating yeah absolutely well good gets um and thanks to
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:02.400]   all of you for for joining us and you not go Alex Lindsey Renee Richie thanks so much for being
