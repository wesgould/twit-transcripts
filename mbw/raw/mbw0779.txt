[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.680]   There's not a lot of news because guess what I think we're gonna have some news from Apple in a couple of months anyway
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.560]   Meanwhile weeks yeah, who knows
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.640]   Meanwhile we should gather together to talk about the non-news Renee Richie is here at least we don't have to talk about c-sam
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.400]   Maybe we do Renee Richie is here. He is from youtube.com/Renee Richie. Hello Renee
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.200]   Well, you know like the rage never ends and we just cycled a rage we talked about that rage last week this week
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.040]   It's all electron app rage. We have fresh new rage
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.360]   I wonder how much of that is is really Twitter based because Twitter ain't nothing without the rage
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.480]   And so you got to keep going it tells you that you
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.640]   It tells you have to broadcast an opinion or nothing about as fast and as loudly as possible
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.960]   Andy and I was also here WGBH in Boston's Andy and I go hello Andy
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.600]   Hello, I'm pretty salty as it is and boy this thing that we're about to talk about its boy
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:47.240]   and
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.920]   From Hollywood it's Alex Lindsey oh nine oh dot media office hours that global
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.840]   Did you do office hours from Hollywood from the Abington studios? I did I didn't do it
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.160]   I'm an Abington studios in the instrument. Oh, cuz I hidden location instrument. Oh, and
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.200]   But I I actually did for my hotel room. I did office hours and I took a picture if you go up a Twitter
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.800]   I took a picture of what I did to my hotel room. I my hotel room was actually this is actually much better
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.920]   So to be honest, I didn't feel like the quality of my hotel room was high enough for Mac break
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.000]   but but I
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.800]   Well, it's just that we have radio mics and I and I have a you know
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.480]   It still is still was very good, but you'll see the lighting
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.720]   I actually replaced the lighting in the hotel room with hue lights. Oh, it's quite beautiful actually
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.520]   I was like yeah, that was my that was my my little setup for
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.120]   For what I actually did so you went around and screwed in the light bulb the hues into it. Yeah, it's great
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.920]   Just naturally carry hue light bulbs in your suitcase. Well, actually I got down there and decided it was it wasn't worth
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.160]   So I had them sent I ordered them and sent them the hotel
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.040]   I was like I was like this is this is intolerable like I can't I can't do office hours day after day after day looking like this
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.440]   How do you control those without access to the Wi-Fi the new ones are Bluetooth. So you just literally yeah, yeah, so you just
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.280]   Just move the the light front and now I've used up my I've now used up my pick for the weekend
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.160]   Oh, no, no, you haven't still more all right. There we go. We want to hear what is it on the day
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.720]   That's what Alex does. He pluses it on the day. Yeah, yeah
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.360]   Mix pre to with noises is that built into the mix?
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.040]   Yeah, yeah, so I've mixed pre to with noises. It's a countryman mic and then these are those are nanlight
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.520]   Pavo tubes which fit really nicely four of them they magnet magnetize
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:41.960]   So they just fit together yeah in like a little box and then and then some little light stands and the most the most technical feature of that is the
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.520]   Ice bucket that I use to raise up my
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:53.960]   Ice bucket, that's good normally I pack all this in a 15 set hand and and I for I for some reason I put it back back
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.920]   I have no idea what got in me
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.800]   So I did that and so when I got down there was like all right
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.640]   This is why I take a 15 tennis because I can put my laptop on top of it again
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.440]   So I was looking around the room. Yeah, I gotta figure this out interesting. How is the laptop?
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.840]   Attached to the ice bucket. It seems to be floating gravity
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.120]   It's really good. It's a really good
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.600]   Alex Alex's gravity the product name of a $2,000 gimbal problem. Exactly. Yeah
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:32.160]   And of course the 1510 is a pelican case. Oh, yeah, yeah, I should probably explain to those of you are not in the know
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.560]   It's assumed that you'd use a pelican case and we know all the well, you know, which
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.680]   Case is the only question. I mean there's 1510 the big argument the the you know
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.320]   If everyone pretty much knows 1510 for the personal use
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.840]   But when you get into larger gear there is a lot of drama between 1640 and the 1650
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.800]   Oh, I bet 16. Oh we got into lots of arguments about it
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:02.360]   I'm I was a 1640 guy for a long time, but I've slowly learned that 1650s as a larger case is better
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.080]   I will admit wrench narr who might be listening
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.160]   Finally persuaded me that 1650 is the right is the right size for most things
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.680]   So do you leave the pick and pull foam in there and create different? I mean now usually I pull it all out
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.240]   You can get separate good foam separators. You get these
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.800]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, those actually work really well
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.200]   And so you just kind of you kind of piece together what you what you need and a lot of times I just have an empty and I just throw a bunch of stuff
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.160]   Pelican
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.520]   But then they have an air version my standard my standard rule we carry on I think is the fifth
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.960]   I think that for for a time they made a fifth version of the 1510 that was designed as like for clothing luggage
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:44.760]   Which means which only means that they let they lined the bare plastic with like just a unjust enough like felt or whatever
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:50.760]   So then it doesn't you know, but that it's that was like the perfect carry on for me because you can sit on it
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.160]   You can you can it's exactly the size of a legal carry on so it's not as though
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.120]   You don't unfortunately put too many socks in the outer compartment
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.120]   You can't get it up there and also but the reason why I bought it specifically was
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.600]   The number of times that I got zorched because oh, that's sorry you're great to have to gate check that bag
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.600]   They're no overheads left and I'm like, okay. I really did count on
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.360]   There's there's like a bottle
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.720]   There's there's there's something in here that I really thought I would have to keep and the thing is having this thing
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.720]   That's at least it's at least it's a pelican case
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.280]   At least that's gonna have give whatever it is a good chance of being able to
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.680]   Actually, you can you know you can carry on the 1510 can you carry on the 1610?
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.720]   No, no the 1510 is the care is the care there's the 1510 for United States
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.040]   It's the right size for Europe. It's a little long
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:42.120]   But it's 22 by 14 by 9 is the size and it's designed that at that size
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:48.120]   Um, so the 1510 works well that way the only problem you get into is is that uh, they look at it and they go
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.040]   I'm gonna have to weigh that yeah, because they
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.920]   No kids got gear, you know, like so looks very heavy
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:58.360]   I admit that we found that hiding things and especially if we're gonna go into a country without without carne
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.960]   We found that two mies were the other we would do me. We would get them
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.400]   Yeah, we would got them because they would look they would look like regular right
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:10.920]   Ones and inside they have a ton of gear. So is this the foam separator system use the with the tech track?
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.240]   Yeah, the tech track is amazing. That's pretty cool. They're really good. Yeah, they you
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.640]   They're awesome. I can talk about I can talk about packing all
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.360]   We're still luggage week
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.480]   It's time for macadamia weekly
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.840]   Today the best and over the shoulder messenger bags are they too trendy that actually we're not trying enough very well effect
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.760]   We probably could sell that show to spotify. I'm guessing but yeah, I'm in
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.680]   Yes, I just have to go to my closet
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:47.000]   I have funny because of you and elisa got me a filson bag for christmas last year because oh good. Yeah, yeah
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.640]   I love my
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:55.080]   I've now that i'm finally able to I bought there there are two or three things that i won't list them
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.600]   but like that like
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.200]   I
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.800]   A month before everything went into lockdown and I couldn't leave my house
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:07.400]   I bought two or three things that that where the mindset was oh, but I spend so much time like going to boston
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.400]   Going traveling, you know, I should buy this thing that will break and the filson bag
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.640]   Which is not a cheap bag was one of those things and of course
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:19.720]   It's been just like this beautiful bag has just been parked like in my bedroom for like an entire year
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.960]   And so now that i'm going out, it's like well, I'm going to be going on for like two hours
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.160]   I'll take the filson bag and i'll take those this light kit and i'll take this other thing
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.160]   Yeah, it's I love it. It's it's it's a very flexible very cool bag. Hope you like it
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.440]   All right
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.840]   I have to admit that I have so many bags from my travel my my years of travel and now
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.240]   Yeah, all week goes by and I barely get to the garage
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.200]   So I can't find my bag and find the bag

[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.440]   Because like well you never take it out of the house where you need to be

[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:16.200]   I I've gotten used to using face face time audio and the audio is so much better that now i call everyone that way
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.760]   And then yes tell it breaks down and then I use the phone

[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:08.680]   I've been thinking about it all year. I've decided what would you have a suit? I'm gonna make the yeah
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:13.000]   No, no, I'm just gonna make the the mess that just the dune the dune face mask would be a perfect face mask
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.160]   But you can only really use it right around the dune launch. So i'm gonna try to make one

[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.280]   So with
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:21.160]   So they got a bunch of uh japanese anime studios to do
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:30.360]   Set well seven not a bunch seven different anime studios to do seven different star wars stories in anime style. Yes
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.040]   That's kind of cool. Yeah
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.880]   This is exactly what i've been hoping for for star wars. I'll turn the audio off
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.280]   Let's get let's make sure that all the fans are happy and they see their their easter eggs
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.760]   They can talk about it. I want people to say here is here's a budget of five million dollars
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:51.320]   You got five minutes to tell any story you want that's set in the star wars. Isn't that cool?
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.640]   That's a good idea. Yeah, the only the only rule is you can't use any characters that have already appeared
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.920]   So don't so it's not like oh, I want to tell the story of the whoever did the coffee service and the death star
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:07.720]   It's like no talk about someone who is they feel as though they're being screwed over by the the rebel alliance and by the empire equally
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.000]   They don't care who wins because they know their life is going to be terrible either way
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.320]   That's going to be that gets interest real quick. I uh, I feel like this is very much like um the animatrix
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:22.120]   You know, yes. Yes, that's right. It's amazing. Yeah. Yeah, animatrix is really really good
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.280]   It's clear disney plus is figured out
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:30.280]   If you really just want to keep people paying the ten dollars a month or whatever star wars can't set out every month
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.920]   It's uh, well
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:39.000]   I feel it this actually this is great because this will actually tie into something apple related. Oh, thank god. I think that
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.200]   I know I know
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.080]   I think I think the lock-in lock-in is an issue not just with apple not just with technology
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:54.280]   I think that part of disney strategy is also lock-in where it's like well rather than people rather than encourage people to go out and see
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.560]   Another science fiction series that and they're because it's animated. What if we create another
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:05.720]   A star wars science fiction series that's animated that will keep their money like coming into disney
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:12.360]   What is way we can't be cantalou- yeah, exactly. Well, we're gonna make make sure that these customers become
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:18.040]   uh, disney theme park customers disney cruise ship customers, uh, disney cinema customers
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:25.560]   Uh disney ice cream customers and that's that's the sort that's the broadly the thing that kind of bugs me a little bit about
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:31.080]   All the way that disney does stuff because even when they show me something that I really really like I feel as though
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:37.960]   Oh, god. You're just trying to make sure I don't do something stupid like go see the go see the dune movie because it's not owned by disney
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:44.760]   It's like, okay, whatever what i've actually been doing is avoiding the topic of the week. So I think at this point
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.760]   We will get to it. Um apple
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:52.120]   Obviously after last week in the furo over apple's child porn tracking system
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.640]   Uh apple's done some backtracking they've done some
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:04.200]   Explanations rene. Can you can you summarize the response? I know that they it's been all hands on deck kind of over the last week
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.200]   Do they approach you i want to yeah?
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:11.720]   Uh, no, but I think like I was I was doing the sort of like because it was so confusing
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.480]   I was doing explainers before explainers were cool. Right. So I was getting a lot of that
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.080]   They needed a lot of explanation frankly. Well, so there was two things
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.600]   Yeah, there's two big one they went on they I think we talked about sordi they went to matthew panzerino
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:28.600]   They had eric the usual privacy engineer usual says yeah, and then they went to join us stern with craig federiki
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.560]   Who's the big guy? The second was recognizable person after tim cook
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.880]   Um, and they're doing what they said is like people are misunderstanding the technology
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:40.520]   The only part that still concerns me is that I don't think like I think apple still misunderstands the pushback
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:47.480]   They think we don't understand the technology. That's why we're upset and they don't understand that regardless of the technology. We're upset
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.760]   Yeah, we don't understand. No, you don't understand
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.640]   That's what they said is he said there's like 30 is the amount of like for the um, yeah
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.640]   They've so they've actually clarified a little bit
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:04.040]   So now the threshold they say is 30 because they want to bend over backwards not to have false positives around there
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:09.480]   Yeah, how many how many how many fingerprints have to be triggered in order for you to be
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:15.160]   Uh, then reviewed by apple before you go to be reported the other big thing neck mac
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.840]   Is the auditing there there's they say like and this is all nebulous because who's doing the auditing and what's doing the auditing is
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.240]   But they saying that because there's a single disc image for ios across the entire world
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.240]   It can be audited and if there's any that the database isn't just from nick mac
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.800]   But it's it's assembled from the convergence of several databases to avoid any spurious results
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:40.680]   That's another thing that is multiple multiple national databases will be used. Yeah, which doesn't frankly reassure me at all
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.240]   That's not how does that make me if you don't want it on your device. You don't want it on your device
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.240]   That's the whole part, right? Yeah
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:53.400]   Uh, I thought that I did listen to joanna sternon view as as typical for joanna sternon view was excellent
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:58.600]   Uh, she is she's the the the ant the ant the ant if this ant if this is of a of abozo
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:06.520]   Uh, I did think that a couple of craigs arguments were kind of facetious because he he was making the point that hey
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:12.600]   There's the reason why our way is better than everyone else's is that like google scans every photo that comes
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:18.600]   Every photo on their server. We only scan the ones that like are you upload to the device and i'm like excuse me
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.680]   But what's the difference they you're still you're still coming into the result where
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:30.520]   Uh, if if google scans the photo after you uploaded to this to to google photos versus apple
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:35.400]   All the scanning every photo but before you sand it up to that's the specious argument
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.920]   Because it's the exact same result. It's not as though i don't seek anybody
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:44.280]   Really, I don't know. I won't speak for all of you or anybody else, but I feel like
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.360]   Look everybody else is scanning cloud storage
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.240]   for child
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:55.880]   Sexual abuse material that's not an unreasonable thing. Do ropbox does it google does it facebook does it
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.160]   I don't think it's unreasonable for apple to say if you're going to store it on our
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.320]   Systems our servers we're gonna scan it first fine
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:08.440]   I think the bigger one frankly is looking for nudity and messages coming in
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.480]   I'm just doing anything anything on the phone
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.280]   But anything like this has been because this is this is the line
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:21.800]   They felt i gathered from craig that they felt like oh, but don't worry. We're scanning on the phone before we upload that i clap
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.960]   It's a true
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.800]   Exactly. I think rene hit it on the head last last week when he suggested that
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.280]   Um, I'm I might be extrapolating a bit from what rene said last week
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:38.360]   But I really think that part of apple dogma is that if you're doing it on device that makes it intrinsically safe
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:43.960]   Or more secure more private and I think this is an this is an occasion where the dogma is
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.320]   Having a meltdown when it's faced with reality
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.520]   The fact that they're doing this thing that no one else is doing
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.400]   and everybody else the entire world seems to be okay with the idea of
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.640]   Stuff being scanned on a server on a service once i've let it
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:06.840]   Psychologically out of my control of by making the willful decision to take it off of my private device this thing that I control that I can
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.640]   Drive a nail through it if I if I want to do that thing and saying I
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.320]   Relinquishing enough control that saying that I want these services that
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.640]   Google photos is going to be giving me I accept that by taking this out of my control
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:24.920]   Google can do lots of things with it including scan it for things evidence that I might have been
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:31.800]   Conducting a crime or allowing law enforcement to have access to it if they get the the right court papers
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:38.280]   It's when the third rail is you're really skiving me out once you say that there's a there's a
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:45.960]   Traffic there's a form of traffic on your phone that we're going to start scanning on this device the thing that I'm supposed to be able to control
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:52.600]   Uh, and you're not gonna you're not gonna have it basically tears down that that that sort of brick barrier
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:58.120]   In our heads between our private device and a cloud service. So I think that it's it's I don't think they're doing anything wrong
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:03.800]   I just think that they don't understand exactly why this cheeses us off and gets us really really concerned
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:09.240]   And they shouldn't talk down to people about it. You you can't you cannot run the privacy
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.960]   Ads that they run
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:18.360]   Then get into the phone like it's not we don't have the expectation on a lot of other hardware or a lot of as apple users
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:25.960]   You know, it it just undermines the entire marketing that they're doing around privacy to do this and I and I feel like there must be some pressure
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.840]   That we're not seeing that required them to make this
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:34.440]   To do this federina just that specifically saying no it wasn't pressure just took us a while to figure out
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.440]   You know he didn't they should have taken a little while longer and figured it out better
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:43.720]   I don't I don't care if if if if a politician goes to a strip club
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.720]   I care if they're saying if they've been lobbying against strip clubs saying oh
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:53.800]   These incredible people these people were cooligans and terrible people who go to strip clubs just be consistent
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.640]   But once you try to play the card that I am more righteous than anybody else
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:05.000]   Okay, great now. We're gonna be checking your credentials a lot more closely than we would be checking someone who claims to be an ordinary human being
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.160]   and on privacy apple claims to be something other than google other than every other
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:17.880]   Entity that transacts business over the internet there. I think they're better, but they are still a multi-trillion dollar company
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.280]   And so I don't think they can play that card
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.200]   And you can be technically right and like morally wrong
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.600]   I mean there's a bunch of people who've looked at this now and said if you have to implement this solution
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.640]   This is probably the most privacy centric way of doing it
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.440]   But the argument isn't about privacy like we get lost in that argument
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.480]   The argument is about sanctity like you're now violating my device
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.920]   Even if you think you're doing it better like for better. Do you think it's more private?
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.080]   I will even concede that maybe technologically this is a brilliant piece of engineering
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.080]   I do not want it on my device
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.600]   And I did a I did a follow-up video now where I was where I was looking at both those systems
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.400]   The other one that they that you were talking about before and this new one
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:58.360]   And just like I think if apple is willing to take a step back and say okay
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.600]   We're gonna scan and we'll let parents block but not alert and or we're good
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.240]   We don't want we don't want seesam on our servers
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.800]   But we recognize that we can't violate your phone
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:12.360]   So what we're gonna do is we're gonna just move the photos to a private relay
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.800]   We'll do the hash matching on a private relay and then we'll do the
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.680]   the envelope verification
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.400]   Um on the the main apple server in that way
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.280]   We don't have full knowledge. You have nothing on your device
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.760]   And this is like the bargain that we're gonna strike
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.960]   But right now it feels like they're unwilling to compromise what they think is better
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:36.840]   Feel like technological privacy and they're forcing us to accept a way worse philosophical privacy and violation
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.760]   Is this in apples be our job to do that?
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.400]   It's the problem is this is in apples dna is we
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.520]   I'm asking. I don't I'm not asserting
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.520]   But it seems like this might be a problem in apples dna
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.240]   We know yeah being a little bit of a nanny
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.440]   We know better than you you're well and you have to yeah, you're welcome
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.560]   You have to trust us that we have figured out a way to do this
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.880]   That's going to be private and secure
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:03.160]   And just trust us we know how to do this and that will give you a little bit of hard for them to listen
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.720]   To what people are saying they just dismiss it
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:10.280]   Uh, yeah, and again, we're not concerned about it. We're
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:18.360]   The content that they're looking for is is very it's it's defendable that you want to get you want to sure go after that content
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.120]   And they've historically a terrible job of it
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:25.480]   But the problem is is that we're we're we're afraid that that list gets longer
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:30.600]   Like that's the that's the thing that I think everybody's afraid of is that that list based on at the be at the you know
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.680]   At the behest of governments
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.920]   That you've now opened up this little thing that i'm going to now go in there and this has been the
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:42.040]   The hard line that apple has had with every government like no, you can't get into the phone
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.200]   You can't have the phone you can and they said they're gonna fight it
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:49.480]   But it was just like why did you go down that path like because now that you've opened it up and people start thinking about it
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.800]   You're just like, okay. Well, they say we'll refuse any requests sure
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:24:03.000]   Unless please please allow us to simply please tie our hands by passing a law because we don't have we don't like having to take
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.680]   A stance on anything, right? But if you but hey if you if you put in a law saying that we have to scan for pictures of like
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.920]   Your president as when you the poo so that you can round these people up please
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:18.920]   We've much rather we'd much rather not have to deal with that they say it's available only in the us but I don't think that
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:25.560]   That makes a difference it they're saying we have the technology and we currently are only offering it in the us
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.760]   Doesn't mean that china can't say well you're now offering it in china as well
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:34.920]   Yeah, I mean their defense against that is that again, it's a single disk image and people like you know gi Rambo or like
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:41.320]   Yeah, we'll find this this kind of stuff and they'll it'll be detrimental to their to their existence or the existential threat
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:46.120]   To their existence but for us it just creates anxiety because it becomes shorting or is cat
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.400]   We can never know like we can even if they don't do it today
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.480]   We don't know what they're gonna do tomorrow and that feeling will persist forever like once it happens
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.400]   Well, okay. Yeah, our worst fear is realized
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:00.840]   But if nothing happens, it's just a case of tomorrow and forever and that's a terrible feeling to have to live with as just a user
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:06.920]   This system and I think leo you're you're right in that's I think that there's there's a conflict between
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.280]   um
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:13.880]   The amount of credit that I that apple thinks it has earned and maybe has just a firefully earned in terms of how much trust
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.480]   It's earned from its users and how much trust
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:22.360]   People are willing to simply give to again a two trillion dollar company like they're there
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:27.720]   I'll speak personally where there are times where someone will say I can't believe it and he's just you know
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:34.280]   How much money did apple give Andy to say that or do how much how much money did he take from google to switch from the iphone
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.920]   And like well, why would they think I would do that like I don't
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:42.120]   About Ford but but but but then but then it's like well the thing is you
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.680]   You know that you're a good person your mom knew you're a good person
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.680]   This person doesn't know you from adam
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:54.280]   So you kind of have to make sure that you consistently demonstrate that this is why my opinions are my own
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:59.320]   I think apple kind of falls into that same trap where they don't it's hard for them to
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.760]   To think that they're that the general public
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.920]   Is going to think of them as again
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:10.200]   I'm a two trillion dollar company that is operating in international markets in a time where it is
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:15.080]   Really really difficult to operate in russia in turkey
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:19.640]   In iran in uh in china in all these other companies of countries
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.760]   It is impossible for us to simply trust that this technology will never be used
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:30.520]   In a way that hurts people, but this is the sort of suspicion that we have to have it's nothing personal apple
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:36.040]   But this is something you have to really make the case to us with your hat in hand and with a humble attitude
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.200]   You can't just simply say you
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:43.000]   It's imagine the imagine the time that someone really really insulted you and they said oh
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.240]   You didn't understand what I said. I'll dumb it down for you
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:53.800]   And I'll I agree that I I was at fault in not messaging it correctly for people who are not going to understand what I say
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.400]   It's like oh, that's not the way to respond to a crisis example
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:02.120]   Um erica point noy at the uh eff
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:08.920]   Said I think very succinctly once you've built in surveillance, you can't call that privacy preserving
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.640]   Yeah, uh and so
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.040]   What should so?
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.880]   To date apple is not backed down in any way
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.840]   They've just given us more information and and attempted to
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.760]   Feels
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.600]   Yeah, but they haven't said oh well k we won't do that. We're not doing it yet. Yeah
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.720]   I mean, I think that the only the only thing they could say is oh we found
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:32.440]   I mean the the the face saving way out of this is we found some technical issues that we're gonna have
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.920]   You know, just it's like the the chargers that never came out
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.080]   This is the thing that we're still working on it
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:42.440]   It'll be out, you know, and then just slowly let it dribble out into the into the spring and then just let it disappear
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:46.760]   To be clear none of their privacy charges shipped on time like every big privacy
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.800]   The shit above the last few years has been delayed at least until january february march of the next year to be clear
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.520]   There is nothing you can't turn off here
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.080]   Right is that right?
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:02.120]   If you turn off iCloud photo sharing. Yeah, no scanning if your photos are big mass
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:08.280]   Yeah, I mean you can't stop them from downloading the fingerprint database. That's going to be built into iOS 15
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:14.200]   So that database is just a bunch of hashes, but that database will be on your phone
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:18.600]   But you can say don't scan my photos because i'm not going to use iCloud photos
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:25.560]   You have to opt in if you want the parental iMessage scanning, right? So that's not going to happen unless you say yes to it
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.280]   I guess you can't turn off
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.280]   Siri and search
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.720]   Is that for everybody the Syrian search warning? Oh, you're about to see nudity
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:39.480]   Or is that just but it's but they do that already like they do that for like a plant parent
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.280]   They do that for a whole like a vast a number of things already
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.720]   Yeah
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:49.080]   And realize that google search does that as well if you you have to turn it off but it will do safe search safe search
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:54.600]   Safe search is well see it's been so long. I'm confused. I think it's off by default or is it on by default
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:59.320]   I know they're always trying to they're always trying to protect you from yourself and it makes me ducking and
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.400]   Great. I hate ducking that ducking stuff. Yeah
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:12.200]   Really is an anti i'm gonna my pick later is gonna be a new photo app which I love and in the terms of service they say follow you right now
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.360]   We can't
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.720]   Allow you to upload
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.920]   Nudes
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.680]   Because of apple
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:23.400]   And if we have to we have to build some things into the app that allow you to say
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.960]   I don't I don't want to see that before apple would approve it
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.840]   So we're just gonna not allow nudes and that to me is I mean it's a photo app
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.880]   So there's porno, but there's also legitimate
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:41.080]   Photographic nudity that to me is a nanny's kind of ish point of view on apple's part that really strikes me as out of
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.560]   Date at least in the u.s
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:47.000]   It's a horrible idea
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.920]   I'm just saying it's a bit
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.960]   You're getting something a lot of trouble to what yeah, I mean allow nudes you mean
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.240]   Yeah, I mean you know, no, I'm saying it's it's
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:03.480]   They can allow it or not a lot. I'm just saying that that functionally as a person. It's a dangerous thing to do that's all
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:09.160]   Oh notes of yourself you're saying i'm anybody like you're like yourself your your friends whatever
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.400]   Born naked. I don't think it is
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.320]   Act like as these huge rock conversations
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.960]   Facebook has these huge rock conversations about
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:22.920]   Uh, you know death camps and things like that, but if you show a nipple, uh, they will kill they were killing an account
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:28.840]   Like it is like that's that's that's overtones of these. Yes. It's pure tannock. It's old. It's pretty old
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:35.080]   Um, I mean for christ sake in in france. There's a there's a topless woman on their money
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:41.400]   It's just it doesn't seem like nudity is such a big deal. I understand. Yeah, you know, wild pornography
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.600]   But yeah, we violence. There's no stricture against that
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.920]   I mean, I do apple less you have watched the suicide squad on their devices
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:54.440]   Yeah, yeah, I can store is fine, but not the app store. It's so sorry. It's so weird. Yeah. Yeah
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:31:00.360]   No, I was just gonna quickly say I mean this is this is something that's been on my mind for a while that how
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:04.760]   Um, I understand the reasoning saying that well, we don't we want this
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.720]   We want parents to be able to buy iPhones for their kids
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:13.960]   Uh without worrying that they're going to be exposed to content that the parent does not think that it's time for that kid to be exposed to
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:18.760]   On the other hand, I'm gonna I remember the first time that I walked through time square and they had
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:24.360]   women a topless with a body paint for as part of that retinue of people who will
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:31.880]   Take tips for forgetting pictures taken and my first my first very Boston winger my my my monocle papa
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:40.200]   Oh my that's not proper. This is a family place and then like five minutes later. I'm like, well, that's just your attitude. Why like
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.240]   if kids
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.760]   if kids were
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:52.040]   allowed to accept that look men can walk along along the beach without a shirt on women can walk along the beach without a shirt on either
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:59.720]   Uh because they're cooler and they're more comfortable and because they want to why it's what kind of a sense a sense of shaming are we creating?
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:06.120]   In female nudity that we're saying that no no it's okay for men. It's not okay for women because that's shameful
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:11.080]   And how how long with this attitude lasts in the United States if children were
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:18.600]   Not could walk through time square and not have their their their their their eyes shielded from it because there's nothing shameful about it
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:24.040]   It just just like there's just like this a naked cowboy and his where he's there with michael when he was 16 and he
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.400]   He definitely shaded his eyes from dust. Yeah, exactly
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:32.920]   But he was much more offended by the olafs that kept coming over to try to hug him that really
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.400]   We're so bad at this that we will like we will have protests over a mass
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.000]   But nobody protests having to wear like a pants or forcing women to wear shirts
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.640]   That's not draconian, but there's masking that's terrible
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.600]   Not like just how why are we justify the puretanic wisdom in our heads?
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:52.840]   No, and I have to say we uh, we don't have a lot of swear words on her podcast because we don't want an explicit tag
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:56.840]   It's not because of apple. It's because early on was told by a number of parents
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:01.960]   I want to a I listen to show loud in the house. I don't want to I don't want to have stray
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.280]   Explatives and be I I want my kid to be able to listen to it
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.040]   And I want kids to be able to listen to it because I think we
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.880]   On on the shows less so with the news shows, but the help and how to shows
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.400]   I think kids should be exposed to technology and if they're interested
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.760]   You parents shouldn't say oh, I can't like you listen to that
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.520]   And I don't feel like it adds anything to have expletives on the other hand
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.520]   I got I have no problem with expletives
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:29.080]   In fact now that I know that call her daddy is worth $20 million a year
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.200]   $1,000 in episode rewriting the code of conduct right now
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:37.800]   It's ex-plative it is she swears every third word and it's like oh, I get it. Okay. It's allowed
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:43.960]   So it's not it's not something that scares scare people away. It's cool. It's great. It's great because it's your choice
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:50.600]   Uh, it would be bad if you're you're not able to put out a podcast exactly my and that's that's right
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:54.440]   I I again. I do see apples decision here
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:59.000]   Uh, the problem is at scale when this is the only place where you can get apps from so
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.280]   And where apps are considered to be creative content
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.720]   Not just simply a functional thing that helps you to to hail a cab
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:09.560]   I think that becomes a potential problem on society
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.000]   When again the one place you can go to to get apps for
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:20.120]   One of the most popular and influential phones in the world will say that there is at least imply that there is something about nudity
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:28.440]   That is other. Yeah, and we don't and please kids continue to think of nudity as something other than as well in politics too
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:32.760]   I mean, uh, they they have all the it's in the app store has a lot of
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:41.240]   Interesting and I think somewhat antiquated points of view and they and the thing about apple is they have no problem with saying
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:45.320]   This is our point of view and this is this is how we're going to do it
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:52.280]   And and I do think that one of the reasons that the house and senate have just introduced bills jointly
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.240]   Uh saying you're going to have to open your app store
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:02.520]   Um is because of this a little bit this this sense that apple is a little draconian and it's controls over this
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:07.480]   What do you think of that of that bill the senate was dick bloomin thall marsha blackburn?
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.880]   Amy clomatore
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:15.720]   But what's interesting is after the senate introduced that bill the house on friday introduced a similar bill
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:19.080]   Um, I don't know what the chances are obviously
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:25.400]   Appling obviously apple and google are not filling the coffers of the kind campaigns enough paying the right people are they
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:30.520]   Not paying the rent because because the thing is if they if they were paying the rent we they would be treated like the cable industry
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.920]   That is allowed to to basically have
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.720]   Monopolies everywhere that actually affect
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:42.600]   Communities actually affect individuals the reason people now figure out where they're going to go now that we're all moving out of the cities
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.840]   They're all looking for where is their fiber?
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.800]   Where is their connection and the reason that we don't have good connections?
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:54.920]   Everywhere is because congress protects the telecommunications. Yeah, you know and and the thing is that's really true. Yeah
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:02.520]   We're fiddling around with this little problem compared to the fact that it is it affected our our students all last year
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:09.000]   It affected employees all last year. You know, we were brutalized by the fact that that cable companies are allowed to
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.400]   Basically not provide pole access. This fix is not expensive
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:19.160]   It is literally passing laws and congress won't do it because the cable companies give them so much money
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:24.520]   You know and so let's be clear. I know that 67 million dollars in telecom lobbying
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:30.120]   In 2019 from just Comcast a dizzy and Verizon this is corruption
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:36.120]   Yeah, like it is. I'm you know, we got to stop talking about little little countries and people getting paid and everything else
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.200]   This is bold face corruption
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:45.880]   People should stop taking money from the telecom companies because it is it is impacting every one of us day after day after day
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:50.360]   Because we would have one gig up and down we'd have fiber to every house if there was competition
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:55.400]   You know and the thing is so we as you know, but instead we're going to pay attention to something that is
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:37:00.120]   You know without a law and completely the reason that they're going down the legal and let's be clear
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.840]   These laws are being written by lobbyists
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:07.000]   This is not a fight of the little guy because the little guys aren't paying that percentage
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.160]   This is a fight of of big companies and their lobbyists writing laws with these lawmakers
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:16.120]   This is these are rich companies that want to pay less
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.400]   You know, this is that's what this fight is that's that's who's driving this fight
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:24.600]   You know, this is this is all being driven by a bunch of other rich companies that want to get richer
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.640]   And they want to force it and the in the people that are going to pay for this law
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.880]   Are going to be the individuals because as soon as they do the sideloading all these companies are going to say
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.160]   Well, the only way you can have our app is the sideload like it's not going to be this
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:39.080]   You know, we have to understand as users. This is going to affect us. Yes, sure
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:43.400]   The developers will have more freedom. The users will have less freedom
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:48.040]   We're going to be forced to sideload if we want to have some kind of content
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.320]   We're going to be forced to give up our email. We're going to be forced to do so
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.320]   I don't get that
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.240]   That's because I don't get what you're saying there
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:55.800]   How quickly
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.720]   Look for now right now
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:04.120]   If I want because apple has opened it up and allowed netflix to have people not buy through apple
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.560]   You know, so now I have to go in and I have to give him my email and I have to log in
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:11.800]   I have to go to the web page and do all those things that's inconvenient for me as a user
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.520]   You know and and and what will happen is is that
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.240]   There'll be companies like I don't know if it'll be netflix
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:20.760]   But there'll be companies that say well, I'm only going to provide this service on you know
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.440]   It's a it'll be a really cool service
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:26.040]   But you'll have to sideload to have it, you know because I'm not going to put it in the app store
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:32.200]   You know and so now as a user, I'm not going to have that so the thing is is that we are going to have it now
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.840]   No, no, there there'll be apps that don't know
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:40.440]   It'll be clear people are going to pull apps out of the like huge numbers of apps will come out of the app store to be to be
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.080]   To be sideloaded so you know because
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.440]   I don't think that's going to happen
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:48.600]   Netflix is going to have an apple official app that you'll have to go out of it to
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:52.520]   To buy it and they'll have maybe they'll offer a sideload app
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.120]   No, no, it's we're not talking about netflix. We're talking about lots of developers a little guys
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.760]   Well and medium sized guys
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.560]   Alex that these companies
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.360]   But we as users have rights to we have rights
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:10.120]   We have rights to not have to do that to unsecure our app because we but now the thing is is that we as users
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.800]   Should be allowed to you know have the the experience that we paid for
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:18.440]   You know, this is you know, this is a you know, we as users should have it be easy and secure
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:22.600]   I don't know there's only one example on android that I know of of that
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:29.080]   Which is epic with fortnite and it went so poorly that they that they abandoned that but they blame google for that
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.120]   Well, yeah, right
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:34.040]   But so google which does have a switch and I suspect this is going to be what apple will end up doing
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:38.040]   If they if these bills are made law is they'll have a switch
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:43.800]   Just like google does in the settings. It says allow third party app stores apple will have just as google does
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:48.760]   Expensive warnings like gatekeeper saying oh my god. You're crazy
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:53.240]   You shouldn't be doing this it's going to be hazardous. You sure you want to do this and you say yes
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.600]   I'm sure
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:40:00.280]   Uh and just like google most apps will still be in the main store because most people won't ever turn that on
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:03.720]   And now i solve the problem and i don't see it i don't see that
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:06.920]   The most installed
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.320]   Yeah, it won't it won't solve the problem, but it will at least address the problem by saying okay fine
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:18.200]   We give you will give you the option we're done and apple doesn't apple doesn't even necessarily have to give it equal parity with the app store
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.640]   They can do it they can do a thing where i've always loved the way that
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:27.320]   Android lets you turn on developer features. Yeah, there's no there's no there's no if you haven't seen this
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:31.320]   It's not that there is like you go into settings and developer features switch it on
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:37.480]   It's like go you go to the about page and you tap the like the legalese like seven times and five times
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:42.600]   It says okay two more times and you'll turn on developer features because they figure that if you know this trick
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:47.480]   Then you know what the repercussions are and it's easy to find it's right kind of
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:51.720]   Yeah, right, but it's not like apple would do something like that
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:56.040]   But they would bury it deep enough so that it's findable if you want it if you don't want it
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:56.840]   It won't but
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:00.760]   But what's contention is that companies are going to say oh good
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:04.840]   I can sideload let me pull my main app out of the app store and just
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.720]   Disney but that didn't happen on
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.120]   Android that did not but if they if they force
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:14.360]   I this one this isn't going to be like oh you can do it the way google does it what they're talking about
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:18.920]   Is really forcing you to have parity you know like to that you have to have access because I think that
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.920]   If you're not part of the app store you shouldn't get to use xcode
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:28.440]   Like literally, you know like that's a that's something that's available for that is a that is a that is a code
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.280]   That is a code. Well, you don't have to use xcode
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.160]   You can use dart and flutter and you can make a cross platform app
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:37.080]   Make a make a command lineup. That's gonna be just as good. Yep. That's great
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.320]   You know, so the thing is is that apple
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:44.440]   But no libraries no no xcode that's gonna be the biggest issue is api access
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.920]   And I don't know if lawmakers will talk about that
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.880]   That's being
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.920]   But the lobbyists will push for it because that's because otherwise it's worthless
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.280]   You know and so and so if they do that, you know, it's fine. I think also
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.240]   We as users need to seriously think about
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:02.200]   Basically building a a community that is the you know that'll defend ourselves
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:07.000]   So so the thing is is that you know what made the nra powerful was not
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.640]   Money it was people, you know and if we start to i think we need to start organizing
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:16.680]   And making sure that companies know that when they start affecting us and and our representatives know
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.560]   When they start affecting us we can act in unison
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:23.160]   I think i have a hard time getting a majority to say oh, this is a terrible bill
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:25.560]   You're not I don't need to get a major you don't need to get a
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:29.080]   You don't need to get you don't need to turn 10
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:33.400]   Like the biggest is that 10 people, you know, with the way that congress works. They're not gonna
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.800]   This is not gonna be a unanimous
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:39.080]   The unanimous thing you just need to just make it painful. You just pick and you don't you know
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.000]   All you do I mean let's look we don't want to get it
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:41.880]   But
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:45.240]   All you need to do is you pick the weakest ones and you make sure they don't get elected next
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:49.800]   You know you you pick off the weakest ones in the flock and you get and you pound them into the ground
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.880]   I don't think you're gonna be able to get a
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.800]   Strong enough lobby to do the show
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.080]   No, no
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:59.960]   Note for show title pick up the weakest ones and pound them into the ground and credit alix with that quote
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.400]   Please
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:06.840]   Well, already he's already got the title so far with uh, i'm uh ducking mad so I think we uh
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.720]   We we might have a double alix title
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:15.320]   It's alix. So thank you. Oh, he's talking about audio like I agree that I think it's two is the idea of having off ducking
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:20.280]   Above above audio like you know the thing is is that is that is that again email?
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:23.880]   I mean people calling you know the reasons so I agree it works
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:30.360]   But I don't know if you're gonna get a consensus around that because I think there's an equal number of people who say yeah epics right
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.480]   Apple should open the app store. I think spot
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.560]   You know remember the you've got some heavy-duty
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.680]   Hitters on the other side of this including spotify
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:43.000]   Uh and epic and they're gonna pump money into congress as well by the way
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:50.760]   Uh, this is gonna be one that complains and sues apple for not providing a device that they never use then and stop using right
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.760]   They're pathetic, but they might I'm dropping my I'm getting rid of my spotify. They might have
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:58.840]   Yeah, so you can see how that's consumer boycott's gonna really change spotify
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:07.000]   I think it's gonna be hard you're gonna be hard to build an NRA style lobbying organization around this
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.160]   They give all their money to call our daddy. They can't fit them anymore. They have good. They got no money left
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.480]   uh
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.760]   You know
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:21.480]   It'll be interesting to see I agree that it's it's a it's a burden on apple because you really have to think about how how would we do this
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:29.240]   Um, I don't know if there's any chance this will pass. We've actually gone back and forth on this now that it's both in the house and senate
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.400]   I don't know
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:35.800]   Yeah, and my my own personal dogma speaking of dogma is that
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:39.000]   If you're gonna have an imperfect solution either way
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:44.680]   Be prejudiced towards a solution that gives people more options and more freedom and then deal with it after that's developers getting
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:51.960]   I don't see why you think people get free options as well and and also and by the way developers are people too
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:56.680]   Yeah, okay, the number of times I talked to developers who are like I can't believe the latest piece of bs
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:02.280]   That I have to go through with apple to just get my stupid app actually running and that's the thing think about how much
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.040]   I can't believe that
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.840]   I can't believe that I can't believe that I dossed that was okay
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:11.960]   Once but then was not okay, but then was okay again, but now was not okay again
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:17.960]   I'm saying that i'm yeah, I mean apple has to add I believe that the the one
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:24.440]   100 good of this is that apple has to defend these policies
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:31.320]   They can't just say we're just making the best choice for our our users and our developers you're welcome
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:37.560]   Next next topic. Yes, but what about next topics. They're welcome. There's actually a right now a problem
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:42.760]   There's a keyboard iFON keyboard design for blind users called flick type that is abandoned
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:47.720]   iOS to the detriment of blind users because they said apple
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:51.080]   Is is not responding to our
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:59.480]   Issues they blocked it from the store apple rejected the apple according to the developer arguing the keyboard quote doesn't work without full access
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.840]   um
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:08.920]   He's he'd appealed at once before three years ago. He's appealed again now the developer says well. It's just I can't
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:15.800]   Yeah, I can't no literally that that's that's what I keep hearing from so many developers not just blah blah blah
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:17.640]   It's I just can't anymore
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:22.360]   It's it's like the end it's like the end of a relationship that you try to keep going for years
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:27.800]   Because you like this entity and you want to continue, but it's like at this point. I'm I'm done
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:31.080]   Here's the here's the here's the tweet it is with a heavy heart today
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:40.040]   That we're announcing the discontinuation of our award-winning iFON keyboard for blind users apple has thrown us obstacle after obstacle for years
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:45.320]   While we try to provide an app that improves people's lives and we can no longer endure the abuse
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:50.840]   Hmm now now maybe if you tell me maybe there's something else going on okay
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:57.780]   but um, you know, maybe there's a reason apple is just a tweet and like if it's a tweet how does there nobody at apple who's
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:01.940]   Responding to this instantaneously and saying look we're gonna get like we have Phil on the phone
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:08.020]   We're gonna fix this right now. Can't believe that doesn't look good. It's an accessibility. It's a cno app. Yeah
[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:10.500]   Um
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:16.340]   They last week we submitted an update that fixes various iOS 15 related issues and improves the app for voiceover users
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:20.180]   No new features just improvements no changes to our app store page either
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:24.820]   We're very excited to get this out the door to the hands of our users, but apple rejected it
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.820]   They incorrectly argue again
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:33.220]   That our keyboard extension doesn't work without full access something they rejected us for three years ago back then we successfully
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:37.700]   Appealed and overturned the decision and this hasn't been a problem since until now
[00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:43.220]   Maybe this you know, I suspect what will happen is there will be a response from apple in a day or so saying oh that was a mistake
[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:44.580]   We'll fix that
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:51.060]   Yeah, this developer just doesn't under we'll explain it again because he's dumb developers don't understand why these features are we understand
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:55.940]   We're a apple. We know everything you guys are just idiots. Well, we'll dumb it down for you again
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.060]   You're welcome
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:01.940]   The keyboard API has not been developed very like it's barely used and not been developed like apple does this
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:05.700]   We remember they're like one engineer on the remote app right and yet something else to do for three years
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:10.260]   And this seems like one of those things where they the analysis is part of all the features the extended
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:15.620]   Instability features of iOS 8 and this has gotten like almost no attention since then and it's barely used anymore
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:20.580]   But this app depends on it and you have it live in the field and I get so frustrated our rejection history
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:25.700]   He writes already spans more than 40 pages filled with repeated unwarranted and unreasonable rejections
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:31.140]   That served to frustrate and delay rather than benefit end users and dealing with app review isn't just time consuming
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.380]   It's also very emotionally draining
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:39.620]   And this is entirely separate from the technical side where apple's third party keyboard apis are quite frankly terrible
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:44.020]   Since 2014 keyboard api has been buggy and consistent and ever changing and broken
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:47.460]   Particularly when it comes to accessibility features like direct touch
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:51.140]   So a third party app store might be a good solution for somebody like this
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:58.740]   Sure unclear because it's unclear how many resources they'd have would work ability they'd have to support to maintain it
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:01.700]   But
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:05.860]   This is another problem and i've talked to people at apple and at google and at youtube about this
[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:08.900]   And like I wish all of them just say it's a big data problem
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:14.820]   There's so much user generated content coming in all the time that we are going to have some apps that are scams that are approved
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:18.180]   Or some videos that are scams that are approved and some that are legitimate
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:22.740]   Accounts that are flagged false flag then removed and we just try to maintain that balance
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:28.020]   But there's really human beings on both sides of those extremes where and that just can't be the answer
[00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:30.580]   I don't know what the answer is because you're dealing with
[00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:32.580]   thousands if not millions if not billions of
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:38.420]   Things to go through all the time, but it's not working for these part part of the problem is that I
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:42.900]   Don't think it's necessarily one of arrogance or one of stupidity or lack of thinking
[00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:48.260]   I think that a lot of companies twitter included are in the position where look when we started this
[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:55.140]   All we wanted to do was allow people allow developers to create games and nace utilities to extend the functionality of the iphone
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:57.620]   We did not anticipate that in 2021
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:00.980]   We would be the gatekeepers to one of the most important
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:10.260]   Cultural access devices on the planet and we didn't design this ecosystem to allow us to be the cultural gatekeepers
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:15.780]   We don't want to be the cultural gatekeepers and so please don't make us make changes that we
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:19.620]   Are going to make things of that moment. I understand scaling is a challenge
[00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:24.020]   But then if you can't scale something like the app store review process
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:28.260]   And you need to rethink it also your two trillion dollar company you have resources
[00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:32.020]   You're building cars that you don't do you have no announcement of selling you can do this
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:37.140]   Don't tell us that you can't it's a question of do you want to well and and I think everyone as soon as the
[00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:40.020]   Finding the right people is an unlimited resource and it's not
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:43.220]   You know like finding the right people to look through it that are technically capable
[00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:47.140]   My point is not you can have a lot of money, but it doesn't necessarily scale got it
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:51.780]   So maybe we need a new model because you have to scale because you're that big now
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:56.660]   You don't you don't have to skip like you don't have to you know like you you can just say we're gonna go as fast as we're gonna go
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:59.780]   You know, I guess that's what happens chosen. It's like well. This doesn't scale
[00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:03.620]   So too bad. We're just gonna make mistakes. What can you do?
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.420]   And if you don't like it there's a whole nother platform that is equally
[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:12.900]   Much larger than the apple platform that worldwide it is a much is a majority if you don't like the way apple's doing it
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:16.420]   Go somewhere else, you know like it doesn't apple doesn't have to do this
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:21.540]   Like you know, they don't they shouldn't have to do it is it is something that these companies all these little companies
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:23.540]   They wouldn't exist without them, you know
[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:31.220]   It is it is arrogant a lot of these companies a lot of these companies existed without the app store before the
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:36.660]   But the vast majority of the like facebook would not be nearly what it is today without without a phone
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:40.180]   You know like it, you know, it was it was a little it's it's not nearly
[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:45.460]   You know, and so the thing is is that they wouldn't be the same size that they are now if many of them wouldn't exist
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:48.420]   You know like there's many there's many
[00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:53.140]   Arments complaint though is that apple acts as if we add no value. Yes
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:58.420]   Apple acts as if these apps you you know, we're the we're the you know, we're the
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:01.300]   Load star for everything and
[00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:06.420]   We just allow you to use our platform for your apps, but you don't add any value really
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:10.340]   Well, I don't think wwc would exist if they didn't they didn't any bad add any value
[00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:16.740]   You know like it like the apple spends apple has a massive team that is there to support developers, you know
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:22.740]   To to make sure that they're they're successful. I mean i've interacted with that. Is it multiple times? Is it possible that apple
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:32.660]   With its shift to looking at services as a revenue generator has become too dependent on app store revenue and is as a result
[00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:34.820]   very unwilling to change things because
[00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:37.540]   Now this is a big part of their bottom line
[00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:40.740]   It's definitely got to be a factor and absolutely
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:46.020]   Yeah, I mean, but uh, there's a better there's a better model for apple
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:48.980]   It's not necessarily better for the developers, which is to go
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:54.740]   Down the art the apple arcade route, which is we're just gonna pay developers and people pay a subscription
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:53:00.580]   I mean like so developers should should be careful about how hard they make how hard they make this for apple because that's an interesting idea
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:02.900]   Just apple basically owns everything
[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:09.060]   Apple to start, you know like if you look at like kingdom rush has that they have kingdom rush, which is what my favorite game and
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:14.500]   Uh, then they have a kingdom rush now that they built for apple that was paid for by apple
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:18.260]   And and put into the apple arcade, you know, and so
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:25.220]   So, you know, and I think that you know so apple is experimenting with with a with a model that could work in many places
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:29.060]   You know and so you know you could end up with apple just saying well
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:34.020]   You could just pay a subscription and these are the apps that we start developing and they don't have to get rid of the app store
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:39.140]   But you could start, you know, if if this becomes really complicated apple could just have something that you're just
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:43.220]   Putting stuff into the subscription apple boutique and then the flea market off to the side
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.180]   Yep
[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:45.620]   Oh, that's a really interesting idea
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:50.820]   That's a great idea and most people would just go with arcade with an arcade style app store
[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:55.060]   Oh, yeah, most people never stayed at least there be an opportunity
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:56.980]   Uh
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:58.980]   a sideload opportunity
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:03.540]   I don't know. I don't I don't is that a bad keep that's the math right? It's like gatekeeper on the
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.380]   Gatekeeper and you say it'd be well
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:09.620]   I mean it'd be it'd be horrible for independent developers because it'd just be hard to get you know
[00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:15.060]   It's hard to get critical mass again, you know, if you're you know, the thing is is that if you're a certain size company
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:19.060]   You know, I can you can talk about sideloading and everything else as an independent developer
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:24.420]   The fact that you can download a free app get help put it together on your own
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:31.140]   Publish it without any without having to figure anything out that they're gonna handle the the um protection of it
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:37.460]   They're gonna handle the order. They're gonna handle, you know, all of that stuff being handled for you and infrastructure essentially a webpage
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.940]   Like all of that. You know, that's what we're not talking about
[00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:42.500]   Also
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:47.060]   Also, we're not talking about is that apple has driven the price down for apps to the point where
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:50.420]   If you have an app that deserves to be a hundred dollars or two hundred dollars
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:52.500]   You're just not gonna put it. You're not gonna do it on
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.020]   on a
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:55.060]   mobile, right?
[00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:56.020]   Oh, yeah, but
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.700]   You have to you have to do affinity photo. You can't charge more than 30 bucks for it
[00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:03.300]   Even if I know developers that are making good money at 50 dollar apps on ios
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.460]   Yeah, but there's a that's kind of the limit
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:09.300]   Sure, but but you're also when I when I sold software
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:15.940]   I knowingly had software that was I knew that was being pirated a hundred one. So sure. I'm I am
[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:22.180]   I am selling it at 200. You don't have to worry because I don't but there's no piracy on the app store
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:24.740]   Yeah, so I could I could have sold it for 20 bucks
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:27.380]   Yeah, you know or half or whatever I could have sent a 20
[00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:33.620]   I could have sold db mat for 20, you know, 20 bucks a copy if I knew that it wasn't being pirated
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:38.980]   You know and and all of that stuff I would have handed that management off in a second for 15 for
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:42.260]   For 15 percent, which is what I weigh. I never made a million dollars a year on it
[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:44.260]   so so the so the
[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:49.300]   So that you know the thing is is that apple would have been a godsend for that. We need to put that together, you know, right?
[00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:55.460]   I think as a model as a developer, that's the lens I look through is that it would have been a lot better if
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:56:01.380]   It's a model that it is definitely good for some large number of developers obviously, right most
[00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:06.340]   Well, not most because there a lot of apps also appear on Android, which is not as
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:10.100]   I'm saying most developers on the iOS. I mean
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:16.900]   Remember we see 30 percent are at step so 70 percent are happy with what they have so most most developers are happy with what they
[00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:23.460]   Boy, you cannot hold you you cannot hold on to a dictatorship if you're only making 70 percent of the people happy
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:27.140]   Unless unless you have a lot of control over the remaining 30 percent
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:31.940]   And you don't apple is not a company that wants to say that oh well, we have our users because
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:36.820]   They're they they like our quality. They like our point of view. They like our our design
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:41.620]   Not because we have 30 percent of our users because they have absolutely no choice on what the hell they're going to do about it
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:45.780]   There's also I mean just the real politic of the of the matter is
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:49.860]   At some point apple is going to is going to be under a lot of pressure
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:57.060]   Yeah in some way to to exceed to the demands of congress the ftc and the uh, eu
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:04.820]   I feel as though this isn't this is inevitable in some fashion that apple has has got to already have a plan for how they would
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:10.100]   If for lots of different ways that this could play out and all the different ways that they would incorporate
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:18.580]   Support for third party apps if they had to because I do think that this is where the this is where the rock slide is going for good or for ill
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:24.500]   And I think that apple part of apple strategy going forward is to argue it so long
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:30.420]   It's it's it's if you can they can keep this thing tied up as long as they possibly can they can negotiate the best terms
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:33.300]   They can possibly get at least in the united states time anyway
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:36.660]   Yeah, yeah, and they would they would much rather not have to localize
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:41.220]   They're they're they're fighting a battle on so many fronts. I feel so a little bit sorry for them that
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:50.420]   They're facing a potential world in which they're going to have to provide a localized version of iOS for every single market that they operate in
[00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:56.980]   Because governments are they sense blood. Yeah, they sense the ability to success though. Google's got the same problem
[00:57:56.980 --> 00:58:00.420]   All these big tech companies are facing this. This is the price of success
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:03.300]   They were going to unify the world lilyo and now we're fragmented across
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:08.740]   Yeah, all right. Let's take a little break come back. We got more to talk about making news lilyo. Yes
[00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:12.500]   There is some breaking news so two things we can talk about it after the break absolutely
[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:17.620]   But one apple has pushed out a new beta and there's two really interesting things one is they've redone the safari
[00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:22.100]   um address bar again and also giving you a toggle to put it back where it used to be
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:24.580]   And i've also announced a share
[00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:29.620]   They've also announced a share play won't be shipping with iOS 15, but we'll be in a in a future update later in the faller
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:35.860]   Oh, this is good. Well, we'll talk about it when we come back rene richy youtube.com slash rene richy andy and not go
[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:38.180]   wgbh
[00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:39.140]   from
[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:41.140]   office hours dot global
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:42.260]   On the road
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:46.020]   Alex lindsey, you know, it'd probably be cheaper. Alex instead of getting a
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:49.620]   big a pelican case if you got maybe a pelican rv
[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:53.940]   And you just you just drove down everywhere and i
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:59:00.660]   I'm just waiting for someone to give me the the electric vehicle that is just a box that is the rights that
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:02.820]   That's the map
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:06.100]   Pick a plug in the no no no no just a big no no i want a big box
[00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:10.820]   I want a big box with a monitor on the end with a with an exercise bike that folds out with a bed that folds out
[00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:13.140]   And a desk that folds out and so there are any ideas
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:17.540]   And I just I just it opens the door. I don't my wife was like and where would you put the windows?
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:18.820]   I'm like nowhere
[00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:21.060]   We got screens
[00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:26.180]   I just put put screens up. I have it and I can work and if I want to take a nap and take a nap
[00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:30.740]   If I want to exercise like an exercise and then I get to la and how fast it goes. It takes an extra hour
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:36.100]   It's fine. Just just I think you're wish we'll come true in the next yeah, we're going over gears for sure
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:38.500]   I think in the next day maybe the next time
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:42.980]   You know, it's funny. I just heard our call says waymo's got 99% of self-driving down
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:44.980]   It's that last 1%
[00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:48.740]   The thing is is that if you if you if you just say it'll work
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:52.660]   The problem that waymo has and the problem that some people want that you go to 100%
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:56.100]   Is if you just said it won't it'll only work on highways. They all
[00:59:56.100 --> 01:00:00.020]   They all kind of work. Yeah, that's what I get so if you just do it right
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:04.420]   I'm like gm does that now the blue cruising right yeah, that's that's the idea. Yeah
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:07.620]   Um just highways
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:12.180]   I'm actually I think I think I think soon on my car. I'm very interested to see compare it to
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:13.380]   I think that within
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:16.740]   In our lifetime probably by 2035 or 2040
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:21.540]   We'll probably see roads that you're not allowed to drive on like a human's not allowed to touch the car
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.540]   Like you have to let you know
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:28.500]   The literally you have to be disconnected because it can it can be much more efficient safer and faster
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:32.420]   If you just stop stop touching according to the new business week
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:35.220]   The the problem is traffic cones
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:40.500]   The 1% is traffic cones
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.060]   Anyway, let's let's take
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:46.980]   Let's take a little a little break our show today brought to you by

[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:44.500]   All right breaking breaking news. We need a breaking news sound
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:49.860]   Bum bum rene richy
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:53.460]   Yes
[01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:58.980]   Wow, that's awesome. Well, that's good. Um, sounds like a didgeridoo breaking didgeridoo
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:06.740]   Go ahead. Yeah, so the the latest update for the beta for iOS 15 has come out and it's got two changes
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.580]   one is apples continuing to
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:12.340]   Improve the UI for the on the bottom address bar in safari
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:15.780]   And they're now making it less because one of the problems was it would interfere
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:21.140]   I'm gonna back up for a second people were so pissed off about what apple did was so angry
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:27.220]   But they were actually usability problems because a lot of developers had learned to put things at the bottom of the screen because apple's chrome
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:32.980]   Took up the top of the screen and apple moved to the bottom and the address bar would cover like important parts of the website
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:39.220]   You needed to use and so now apple previously they integrated it with the keyboard and now they're they're interviewing it even more
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:45.540]   But they're giving you a switch that you can flip to take you back to ye old days of top-mounted address bars if you so choose
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:49.540]   Here's frittorico vaticci's tweet. We did it everyone
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:56.100]   Hey, you know with apple you got to take your victories where you can so it what is this awesome andia?
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:04.660]   We did it so so you can now put the is it a switch or is the developer yeah to toggle in settings in settings not the website
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:06.900]   Just the user so you can put that
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:12.100]   Apple because they're supposed to have strong opinions loosely held, you know, they're supposed to make these decisions so unburden us
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:15.460]   Of the need of options and now they're giving you again one of these
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:21.140]   Like when ios 7 came out and nobody could read it they put a bunch of options and accessibility to make things bolder and you know
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:24.340]   Easier to read instead of just making the whole interface easier to read
[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:29.460]   Now you're getting an option to revert safari instead of just reverting safari, but you know small victories
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:34.580]   I wasn't really I mean I saw all the upset but I didn't not not being an ios 15 user
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:38.500]   I didn't really experience the thing and I have to say looking at frittorico's screen capture
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:41.780]   having that address bar at the bottom really is kind of
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:46.260]   Not so it was also worse because there were so many controls there and so many collisions
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:51.860]   Like you have to tap so precisely to edit the address bar or you'd reload it and everything was two or three taps away
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:55.620]   That used to be just exposed and there was this I think there was this mistake again
[01:03:55.620 --> 01:04:00.020]   We're going to go back to the same discussion previously where apple thinks less is simplicity
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:05.220]   Even if it requires more and and being bereft of things being spartan is not
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:13.060]   Simplicity usability is simplicity and act sometimes means exposing the most obvious and important controls even if it looks like it's more cluttered
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:18.180]   It's more usable and that's the more important parts. Yeah. Yeah, you're right that that was that was the fault
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:24.020]   That was for me was the failure of the first re redo of the user interface for for ios
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:27.620]   That it was so stripped down that you would look at the screen
[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:34.340]   I would look at the screen for like seconds thinking that okay. What do I tell you to do the thing that I want to do no problem
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:38.740]   Where's sometimes where yeah, we're what what I liked about the material
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:40.500]   material
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:47.380]   Interface design on google was that they've actually flipped that on his head saying that there will be a big round colorful button at the bottom
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:55.380]   Right of the screen that is the thing that you are probably going to want to put to touch to post a tweet to reply to email to do something like that
[01:04:55.380 --> 01:05:01.540]   So yeah, it's I would this is why I really wish that apple would had it would allow their
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:03.300]   Allow their developer excuse me
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:10.500]   They're internal developers to and designers to occasionally blog because I would love to hear like what the this what the real decision-making
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:15.060]   Process was about that I know I I joke about apple being arrogant and to degree
[01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:18.900]   They certainly are but I know that they don't just do it on a do something like that on a whim
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:25.780]   But it's such a big deal saying okay every single other web browser puts the address bar at the top
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:33.940]   Even mobile browsers put it at the top. We're going to put it at the bottom because why everybody else is doing it wrong
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:37.140]   Or because sometimes sometimes it's brilliant
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:43.460]   But sometimes you realize that the reason why an airplane has two wings instead of like a third wing at the back
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:47.620]   Is because the ones with the third wings they crash they try them they don't work
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:50.020]   They do that's why that's why they all look to find uh
[01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:55.860]   You can find wwd sessions like I remember when ios 7 came out mike stern who's the uh graphics
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:06:00.340]   developer evangelist did a brilliant one hour long talk deep diving into the
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:04.660]   Incredible logic they had in thoughtfulness behind everything it didn't make it more usable
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:08.900]   But I understood and I have not found one yet for the safari
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:13.060]   Paul had a looking Paul had a tweets sanity
[01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:18.660]   There's apparently a setting now to take the tab bar from the bottom and put that up at the top as well
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:26.500]   There is you know, Steven sanovsky who was responsible for office and later windows at microsoft has left since
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.020]   um
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:34.900]   Did sometimes you find out decades later? He did just post a blog post on how clippy happened
[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:38.420]   Right. Yeah, which is really interesting
[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:44.340]   To read especially the part where he talks about bill gates reaction
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.220]   uh to clippy
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:53.060]   Uh, he said let me let me see if I can uh, I can find the oh, yeah, I don't know
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:58.580]   I don't know if I should say it out loud he coogates called clippy an effing clown
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:01.940]   and and and
[01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:04.100]   I really want to
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:11.460]   Hey boss. I'm reviewing the CEO go parrot. We're gonna have an old hands. Apparently this was a common thing with bill gates
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:14.420]   where he would um
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:19.780]   He would be very combative sometimes with product managers and you you had to stand up for yourself
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:23.460]   But apparently there's a there's a whole dialogue
[01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:29.540]   It doesn't appear that people ignored go gates a lot more than apparently they got away with it because clippy happened
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:32.660]   I think there's a lot of complaining about clippy. Can I help you?
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:37.060]   Well, it just it looks like there's stories that come out that bill gates was like I hated that
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:41.060]   You know, like, you know, I hated jobs would win every job to fire you
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:42.100]   Yeah
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:45.620]   Like don't lose iTunes for windows, but the things you lost were good things
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:51.140]   Yeah, I think I think but I think it's jobs propensity to fire people that disagreed with them too much
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:52.660]   like I think
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:55.940]   Arguing is fine, but I think there was definitely like a level of yeah, you gotta go
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:08:00.580]   Okay boss. How the feature review go and why are you carrying everything from your desk in a cardboard box
[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:04.660]   It's a it's uh, it's on his um
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:10.980]   I think it's on his learning by shipping a blog at uh medium if I can find it
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:18.420]   But essentially there's a there's a back and forth between gates and the product manager in which he says and then the effing clown
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:26.180]   Comes out and tells you what do you want to do and the and fairly there were a whole series of microsoft programs for kids
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:33.060]   Designed this way where instead of using a UI you would be you would have an interrogation with a character
[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:36.740]   Who would yeah? It'd be the same thing as if you picked those menu items
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:43.380]   Um, but I guess they thought it was an easier way back in the day people didn't really understand
[01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:50.820]   I'm afraid how things worked. So they didn't appreciate the genius look at they have that you know, it's you know
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:52.820]   You don't change it is a little bit better
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:57.460]   You don't change the design of a steering wheel even if you do have a better design because this is what people absolutely
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:01.780]   Understand it works model s side is sitting right there andy yeah, exactly
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:04.740]   Oh, oh here yoke here it is
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.820]   so uh
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:11.540]   In early discussions we attempted to explain how we had learned from the abysmal failure of microsoft bob
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:16.660]   And we had a plan at one point the conversation turned from stepping through a complex task in excel
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:19.460]   To bill gates bringing us to tears
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:23.700]   And playing back we'd heard it went something like this demo
[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:27.220]   The assistant will then appear and offer each step and sequence
[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:33.940]   To create a chart as the user interface does today, but it will be more friendly and approachable and have easy access to help content bill
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:40.820]   So when I want to create a chart the clown will pop up and say i'm here to help and it's not a clown bill
[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:45.060]   It's an assistant the clown pops up and then i'm like clicking on the clown
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:49.380]   Saying clown next next clown next or something just to create a chart
[01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:56.340]   bill the assistant is just a more approachable and helpful version of the same number of clicks and steps you always had next next next
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:59.860]   And pretty soon. I just want the effing clown to get out of the way
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:11.860]   Apparently his story of my entire teenage years. Thank god someone has articulated it so well the pattern complete with the escalating high pitched
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:14.900]   Frustrated bill g voice would make an appearance
[01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:21.540]   I lost track of how many times he ridiculed the feature this way still he doesn't get the right to stay I told you so
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:23.700]   Here's a
[01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:27.700]   Example of microsoft fine artists, which was for kids where you have a character called mixz
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:34.660]   Saying hi stevie would you like to start a painting make a comic strip button or sticker or put together a picture show?
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:38.900]   Maybe you'd like to learn some drawing tips or copy the leader clean up paintings
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:44.660]   I'm glad we're away from these nanny apps. Yeah, but in the early days. I think the thought was we know people don't know how to use computers
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:46.020]   We got to help
[01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:46.980]   true
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:54.660]   It was they did have a point there this was still the point where there are a lot of people were a lot of people using computers were being forced to use computers because
[01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:59.620]   People who knew about the technology were incorporating it into workspaces
[01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:05.060]   So now things are being more tightly automated more tightly computerized and there were people that you know
[01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:10.580]   The joke about hey, it says press any key but I can't find a key marked any that's not a joke
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:14.500]   There would be people who would say I don't see a key that's marked that way. So
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:18.020]   A little bit it wasn't dumb. It was a dumb idea
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:26.020]   But it wasn't as though the intentions weren't merited. Yeah, and of course bill did marry the product manager of microsoft Bob. So
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:33.140]   That's that's your pun. That's your punishment. This is such a bad screw. Yeah, you know what I'm gonna marry you
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:37.460]   I'm sorry. You world would be so too different place
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:43.220]   So sometimes you do but get the story behind some of these things
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:47.380]   But unfortunately it's usually long after the person who knows left the company
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:52.340]   He's a treasure though. He's a must follow you get to hear so many really wasn't a treasure when he was at Microsoft
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:56.740]   I must say no, no, it's it's good now. He's since you left Microsoft got an iPhone
[01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:00.500]   He's been and been tweeting with it. He's much more interesting so much more insightful
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.460]   uh, so I pad OS
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:10.260]   Beta six for the public usually will next day or day or two later usually usually like two or three days
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:12.580]   Pretty close
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:16.820]   Big problem. That's the big problems on developers and if it's fine everybody else gets right
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:23.220]   So here is uh apple's post on the beta six release notes
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:29.220]   Um, I don't make it's right doesn't make any sense if you're not a developer. It's all about, you know
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:31.620]   stuff
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:37.700]   But good so fix at least to uh safari which I he just shows micros. Sorry apple does listen
[01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:40.820]   Um, if you complain loud enough
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:45.860]   The bottom bad. I mean a lot of things they test out and some of this stuff is great
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:48.900]   Like my classic example is the mat the 12 inch macbook
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:53.620]   They made a they made a non mechanical touchpad and they made a butterfly keyboard
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:57.300]   One of those things is amazing and we still use it today and one of those things had to die by fire
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:01.460]   But you know you got it. You got to excursion. It's got to fail faster fix it. Yeah, put it out there
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:03.860]   See what people say. I think that's fair. Yeah
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:08.340]   That's this is the beta after all. That's the whole point exactly. Yeah
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:12.980]   No, I'm glad I'm glad that they're doing live fire exercises of some of these ideas too
[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:16.900]   That it would be bad if they just simply did something they had a test group
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:20.420]   The test group didn't like it so they they canned it as opposed to no
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:21.460]   We'll we'll take the heat
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:26.420]   We'll we'll spend the time of the dunk tank if we have to this is interesting enough that we want to see how people like it
[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:30.340]   And for all we for all we know the consensus inside apple was that this is a bad idea
[01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:35.220]   But people are making a good enough case for it internally. Let's see at least yeah
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:40.580]   the people who volunteered to say close your eyes close your eyes and taste this
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:43.220]   Yeah
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:47.540]   So apparently there was something people did like I don't know what it is called shareplay
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:52.660]   They're not gonna. Yeah, they're not gonna put that out. They take it out. They're gonna be a six
[01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:54.660]   So what is shareplay rene?
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:58.660]   That's the feature where if you are on a FaceTime call with somebody on your iPhone or iPad
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:03.060]   You can choose to share like a tv plus or other companies can choose to embed this too
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.540]   So like Netflix so you can watch or listen to something
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:09.460]   Together and also like you can put it on your apple tv and watch or listen to it together
[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:12.660]   It was a very 2020 2021 friendly feature
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:14.740]   It just sounds like it's not fully baked yet
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:20.580]   And so it's gonna come like a month from now or three months from now share play apple says we'll be disabled for use in the initial
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:23.460]   Releases of iOS and mac OS and tvos
[01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:30.420]   But it will be enabled for use again in future developer beta releases and we'll launch to the public and software updates later this fall
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:34.180]   I've been I saw that and I was like wow that looks like it's really hard to do and
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:37.140]   Turns out it might change out of this. Yeah, you were right
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:41.220]   You were right what's so hard what's so hard about it?
[01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:43.780]   It's just a lot of your
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:47.220]   It's a lot of communication between the devices. Just keep everybody synced
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:50.740]   Sinking lots of devices together is never trivial
[01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:55.540]   You know, they're all on their own little clocks and then you have the latency of Wi-Fi and you have the latency of all these other things
[01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:58.820]   And keeping them all doing the same thing that they're supposed to be doing at the same time
[01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:02.980]   Is a big deal like it's not there's nothing trivial about that problem
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:08.580]   And uh, and so when you start going hey, we're just gonna make it work and it's gonna be easy and you're gonna be able to do this thing
[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:12.740]   It it's it's just it's incredible engineering to get that to work
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:14.980]   There's the experience like it until now. Yeah
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:20.820]   Like what happens because all this stuff is is DRM content and every provider had their own options
[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:25.700]   Like you could send you the thing and say oh you have to subscribe in order to do this share play or it could send it into you
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:29.940]   Say, oh you get this one free, but you got to pay for the next one or you get two weeks free if you watch this
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:33.860]   But then you've got to pay off and designing all those experiences and making them understandable to people
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:36.260]   I think is a big challenge too. There's a lot of parts
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:38.980]   A lot of moving parts
[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:42.980]   Apple uh, iOS 14.7.1
[01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:50.580]   Which came out a few weeks ago it uh, if solved the apple watch unlock bug and uh, fixed a
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:53.300]   zero day
[01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:59.540]   Some sir some users are saying uh is causing a no service message from their carriers
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:03.940]   I don't know how widespread this is widespread enough that it's made the news anyway
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:09.700]   Users are saying restarting the phone removing the sim even resetting network settings did not fix
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:12.500]   this
[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:17.380]   So I don't know I haven't experienced it. Um, but I guess some people are
[01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:25.300]   So the user base is so big now and the amount of variables that everybody has on their device is so big now that it seems like every time
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:30.740]   There's an update some people get better Wi-Fi some get worse some get better Bluetooth some get worse some get and that's not an excuse
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:35.620]   It's just like it's it's butterfly effect. It's uncertainty principle is just so complicated now. Yeah
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:42.100]   Apple has uh lost a wireless patent suit
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:48.580]   We reported last week they they'd want a big big decision now. They've been told to pay
[01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:52.100]   uh a marshal texas same old place
[01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:57.860]   Pan optis patent management and it's optis cellular and unwired planet units
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:01.940]   a uh award of 300 million dollars
[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:04.740]   in royalties
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:07.860]   This was a retrial a second trial. They were originally ordered to pay
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:11.860]   506 million so I guess you could consider that an improvement
[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:14.260]   um
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:17.140]   Rodney gill strap added again us district court judge
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:22.660]   Uh said the jury should have been allowed to consider whether the royalty demand was consistent with frand
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:25.620]   So they they thought it over again
[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:28.900]   Uh optis was trying to get seven billion
[01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:31.780]   Yeah
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:33.060]   So
[01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:36.260]   I remember this is the beginning because it still has to be appeal which
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:40.260]   Yeah, I wish the appeals courts would just go hey came out of east texas. We're just gonna throw it in
[01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:45.540]   No, like we're just like if they just started doing that or they just started throwing them out like like not even like we don't want to listen
[01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:50.100]   Anyone we'll listen to you talk for a little while then we're gonna throw it out because it came from that location
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.260]   We would probably find more sanity
[01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:58.740]   Optuses as they say a non practicing entity, but they got the patents from panasonic sam sanghan lg
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:01.860]   uh originally
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:03.860]   Um, that's who had the original patents
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:07.060]   so
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:09.620]   There you go
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:12.580]   Optis says apple has had refused all fair offers
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:16.660]   And has accused the company of being an unwilling licensee
[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:20.100]   I don't even
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:23.780]   We didn't license it. We didn't want to license it. We we don't need the license
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:25.780]   So
[01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:28.980]   Why are you interfering with our sole purpose and like we're here to sue really
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:34.100]   There was this really great and he knows this there's really great comic strip by grant morris and all star superman where
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:36.660]   There's this living bomb and superman tries to save the world
[01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:41.700]   He's like you're interfering with my right to exist as a bomb to be to unlive my potential to be all that I can be
[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:46.420]   How dare you stop me in this way? That's what it sounds like he's be pretty a bomb just be a bomb on mars
[01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:52.180]   How about that? Yes, exactly. I think that was actual solution. Oh, yeah, there you go. Yes, it's fine. No problem
[01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:57.380]   Uh, let's uh, let's see what else we're gonna take a little break come back and talk about apple
[01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:01.860]   TV if you're a ted lasso fan get ready
[01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:05.220]   I don't want to steal anybody's pick or anything
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:07.060]   Nope
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:09.060]   apple tv talk
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:14.340]   apples released at ted lasso sticco sticker pack for iMessage and clips
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:17.380]   You got believe
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:20.500]   The sign you got a soccer ball. You got a footballs life scarf
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:24.980]   couple of pictures of ted and some of the other cast members too
[01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:27.380]   Which is nice
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:33.060]   I hear that uh, this guy i can remember his name, uh, is is be a big part of season two
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:34.580]   Yeah
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:38.500]   I just I just want an animated thing of ted lasso's cabbage patch dance
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:40.820]   [laughs]
[01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:47.140]   If you go to the apple store, you might be able to get a sticker pack an actual physical
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:49.860]   sticker pack which would be very awesome
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:55.620]   Like the animated gift gifs and the stickers everything just has ted lasso on it and it takes me out of it out of the moment
[01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:59.940]   You know, it's just his head you have to put the name on it. We know we can recognize that what it is. No, it is
[01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:06.820]   Yeah, that's a good an excellent point. It's like if every baby yoda sticker had star wars on it. They don't like just relax
[01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:12.340]   uh, when hbo max launched it was in every respect a mess
[01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:18.660]   A mess nobody could figure out what it was. Do I get it for free? Who do I get it from?
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:25.060]   But not to mention the fact that the app was really not very good apparently hbo max is working
[01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:32.740]   Uh to update its app on the apple tv and everywhere else. So if you are suffering through the hbo max app
[01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:40.340]   Some some sort of there are some the contents great, but you couldn't fast forward very well or rewind and
[01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:44.660]   There are a bunch of big media companies that like not at the developer the developer level
[01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:48.100]   They're all angry about this, but there's some product managers who decide that
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:52.740]   Making it easy to cross port is the number one priority not making it the best experience
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:58.020]   They'll use their open gl app. They'll use their tv o at like whatever they've compiled for tv
[01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:01.940]   And like the amazon app is horrible the youtube app varies between states of
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:08.260]   Peopleness but you can easily tell what's a native app and what was like the worst tv like smart tv app that they could possibly put on the platform
[01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:10.980]   Yeah, because I always feel like the the youtube tv app
[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:14.740]   I think that they they make it hard to scroll just so you don't you can't go through the ads
[01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:20.660]   Because it's just so painful like it just you're like it's just easier to watch the ads than it is to like try to find the other
[01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:25.540]   And it couldn't move tabs on the original apple tv controller you like it would skip eight tabs anytime you twitched on it
[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:33.860]   But but isn't it isn't it funny that now like apple and the apple community knows what's like to be like blackberry
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:38.100]   I think a few years after the the iPhone took over because like you realize that you're like
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:43.940]   The this platform is all roku and it's all amazon as far as streaming devices go
[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:50.340]   You realize you're making us do wanting to do a whole lot of work for a tiny tiny sliver of the market you'd be happy
[01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:52.420]   You even have an app to deliver
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:58.500]   And you were an tolerant sliver you were used to you're used to getting our way except for getting our way when we talked to apple
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:00.500]   But otherwise we're used to getting our way
[01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:07.620]   Uh, so anyway, I guess it'll get better. What's the content you like uh, Alex on hbmx. What are you watching?
[01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:12.260]   Oh, but you know you always if I don't have it in front of you. I can't remember what it is
[01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:17.540]   We watch the white lotus and don't watch it. This is it. It's terrible. It's uh, very disappointing
[01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:21.700]   I think I just want to surprise that how often i'm at hbm xwajis so good
[01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:24.180]   Do you do patrol?
[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:25.940]   Yeah, this is is that like rapskroll?
[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:31.140]   No, no, it's it's a dc comics. It's uh, it is a superhero
[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:36.500]   Technically, it was a par let's say parahuman series, but it is so niche
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:40.180]   It's not about like let's introduce this thing that's going to become a movie
[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:44.820]   It really is about personal stories about five people who were turned into freaks by
[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:49.700]   Circumstance and by science and whatever and are just trying to figure out how to live their lives
[01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:56.180]   Uh, and it's they're just episodes that are like, oh man. I'd i'm very happy. They're not being attacked by
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:59.700]   Whoever on whatever dimension and whatever reality
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:05.220]   It's just it's okay to just have them be an episode where they're in the mansion and they're just superhero
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:07.780]   They don't want to leave superhero
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:14.100]   It's about it's about people right it's about it's about people fighting their own internal battles and that's that's always
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:19.540]   Easy being a superhero you guys you don't appreciate how hard we work. Yeah
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:23.060]   Also based on grant Morrison like all star superman. He's a really good writer
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:28.340]   All right. I'll have to okay good recommendation. I didn't even I mean that's part of the problem with the app
[01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:30.020]   You can't find anything
[01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:31.460]   so uh
[01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:35.300]   Even the thing you're watching it's like you have to I know i'm watching this show
[01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:42.020]   Why don't you show me the next episode, please? Also also starring Brendan Fraser. Oh, I like him. Yeah. Yeah
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:47.780]   He's he's aging a little which is nice. He plays robot man. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:53.220]   He you know, he's he really is like a like a jean hackman sort of actor where he's gonna be good in this 20
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:57.780]   He's gonna be good in his 30s 40s 50s. He used to be a hunk, right? And now he's like
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:02.100]   bombs leo just for warning. They just dropped that bomb with wanton abandoned. Oh, I don't mind that
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:04.900]   I've heard right Morrison. I've heard it before
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:08.580]   um bloomberg
[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:15.540]   apple tv's mark german even apple tv's box is now mostly pointless
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:22.020]   This is from his power on newsletter, which is getting a lot of play. It's uh clearly a big hit
[01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:27.140]   Um, he says it's lost his purpose his content moves to more devices
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:29.860]   Uh
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:34.100]   It's a little expensive. Yes, it's about twice as much as what everybody else
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:37.140]   offers
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:39.140]   um it it
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:44.340]   You know the phone wasn't gonna work the the you know apple was you know, they're they're a little you know,
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:47.060]   as a
[01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:50.900]   Incurrently sure it's not that competitive when most of the content is pretty
[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:57.220]   Low grade from a technical you don't even need it anymore to watch apple tv. So well, yeah, I mean
[01:24:57.220 --> 01:24:59.460]   So so here's the thing
[01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:06.420]   Someone who develops content for all these devices who streams to these all all these devices the apple tv is 10 times better than everybody else
[01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:11.940]   So how about the um, how about the uh, Nvidia shield? Do you ever do you get any feedback from that?
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:14.740]   Because that's also we want users. Yeah, so i'm powerful
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:15.860]   I mean, we don't i don't see it
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:21.860]   So we the the main thing is is that is like when we wanted to develop really high quality content
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:24.820]   I'm not talking about the flock that you get on Netflix or
[01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:31.700]   HBO or whatever like from i'm not talking about the content i'm talking about the video the video quality
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:35.620]   When we go, hey, we want to put something up really nice and we just wanted to work
[01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:38.740]   You just want it on the apple platform like like the rest of them are just worthless
[01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:42.900]   And so the so the thing is that they're so hard to deal with they they can't read the manifests
[01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:47.220]   They can't do all this other stuff. They can't you know and so the apple just works and
[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:52.740]   You're gonna you want to keep watching how often apple says high frame rate hfr high frame
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:56.340]   Right, they're giving it a name. They're not talking 120 frame per second
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:26:01.140]   But you want to notice that the pixel high end pixels are 120 samsung's going to 120
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:03.140]   That's interesting every tv we make is 120
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:08.500]   And when you if when you turn up the dial and right now with 5g
[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:13.220]   You'll be able to turn the dial up, you know, you can't end with fiber and people getting faster connection
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:15.220]   You'll be able to turn that dial up
[01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:19.700]   I I will say as someone who spends a lot of time looking at 120 frames a second
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:21.700]   uh that
[01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:24.500]   It changes the way you look at everything else, you know
[01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:27.380]   And so the thing is is that there i believe that there is going to be some point
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:31.540]   Where apple starts developing content and so having apple tv apple tv plus
[01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:36.420]   And having uh 120 frame having some content coming out
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:41.140]   And most likely the the the the areas that we think are the most interesting are concerts
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:42.580]   um
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:49.300]   Sports and horror films of all things because it really scares you so it's because it's basically in hdr
[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:53.940]   At 120 frame per second you have a window in your house into something else
[01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:59.860]   Like it your brain looks at it differently than it does at 60 or 30 or 24
[01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:05.940]   Now I wouldn't create features this way because it actually uh I find that features at 120 making really uncomfortable
[01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:09.860]   And so so they um they so there's great documentaries
[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:13.060]   Great for sport you can see the makeup like you can see it makeup
[01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:15.620]   And that's why i'm not in resolution
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:17.460]   When on late did uh, no
[01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:22.260]   Did uh billy lens long time half long half time mark he didn't have the artists wear makeup
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:24.340]   Which was even more disturbing
[01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:27.460]   Because you don't see these people with their real things
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:33.300]   Right like in the hobbit at high frame when you watch it at 30 like it seems like like a fantasy when you watch it at 60
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:36.580]   Yes, everything is so instant like you can see like that's not a nose
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:44.180]   Yeah, there's actually there's actual science. There's actual science behind this that at a lower frame rate particularly at a film film
[01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:50.260]   frame rate it actually turns the the brain switches into a different cognitive mode that makes you
[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:57.300]   More more accessible possibly because we've been trained to that right so I don't I don't think that it's good for everything
[01:27:57.300 --> 01:28:00.740]   But again, I think that horror films are gonna be at 120 are gonna be really scary
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:05.300]   And because they're very real. Yeah, I guess it's gonna be a realism
[01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:10.260]   Documentaries sports concerts great for documentaries and concerts and sports
[01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:14.340]   I mean the I gotta tell you when you watch there's so much fast moving things going on
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:17.620]   I watch some baseball at 8k 120
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:19.220]   And
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:22.820]   It's just like you're there like you are there and and there's some point
[01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:28.900]   We found that between 90 and 120 frames per second that something in your brain like goes quick
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:30.580]   You know and it's a different
[01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:32.260]   It just now looks like a window
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:36.820]   You know and people can talk about and you know, there's been patents that have already been done for 240 480
[01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:42.180]   You know these these higher frame rates are gonna keep going because it's gonna create that I but I think from a practical perspective
[01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:43.540]   Is there a limit though?
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:48.260]   Does it get much better after 240? I think I think that the I think the the I think
[01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:49.620]   um
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:50.820]   You get much
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:53.380]   It's so much effort over 120. I think 120
[01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:56.180]   120 so I don't think it's
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:59.540]   480 is the barrier for human perception. They did a bunch of green
[01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:02.660]   480 humans can't tell anymore
[01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:05.700]   But this is completely consistent with what Andy just said
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:11.540]   Which is if we if we want to be in a suspended state of suspended disbelief a dream state
[01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:15.060]   Make it dreamy, but if you want to think you're actually at the ball game
[01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:17.460]   But if you look at like small world that it does
[01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:24.180]   Small world at 120 frames per second would be amazing because you think you were in a plant, right?
[01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:26.900]   But what you would forget
[01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:30.740]   We're getting off the point. I think that that's great
[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:34.820]   But apple can't sell a one the most expensive streaming boxes
[01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:39.140]   On the market today on the basis that someday in the future
[01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:41.700]   Undetermined there will be high frame rate video
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:48.020]   But that may be you will enjoy and it and apple knows that this is a market in which you can you can walk into Walmart
[01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:51.300]   With $25 and get a very competent streaming device
[01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:55.220]   You can walk into any other store with $50 and get a very good streaming device
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:58.020]   And the amount of money that you would spend on an apple tv
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:05.620]   You can get a computer that can act as a server for all of your media and can stream games and can do all these other great things
[01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:08.020]   Sure, but apple needs to make apple needs to make
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:12.660]   Something that's that's competent for people who are walking to a store with $50
[01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:16.340]   In a way they are by putting apple tv on samsung
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:18.900]   Yeah, they do so the that's the answer to that
[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:22.580]   What what will happen is isn't in the manifest in the manifest?
[01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:29.380]   We'll just tell tell you if you're going to not to an apple tv give you 30, you know, like like here's 30 frames a second, you know, enjoy
[01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:34.580]   And more on but again, no, it's fine and again and again
[01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:40.820]   The point is is that the problem is that you can't you have to control
[01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:47.060]   The the reason that everything works on on apple products and this is not because we're talking about 120
[01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:52.660]   We're not talking about the apple tv. We're talking about the ipad the matt all the max all of the phones
[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:58.260]   Everything being at 120 it's a big market that can that can theoretically watch this in the in the main thing
[01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:02.660]   Is is that the apple tv is one of those and it needs to be part of that ecosystem because we're going to go
[01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:05.540]   Hey, we really want to watch this great video on our tv
[01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:09.540]   You know and so the thing is is that so apple by controlling that controls that
[01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:12.740]   They're able to develop it and they're not and they're able to not be
[01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:16.100]   Basically kneecapped by the cheap
[01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:22.740]   Television acres who are trying to shave pennies off of it and so they won't get they won't put the extra chipsets in
[01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:26.180]   They won't do all the other is in a mistake for apple to offer at something
[01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:31.540]   I can tell you what is a cheap sets. It's a mistake. I can tell you what I hate it. Yeah
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:32.980]   Yeah
[01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:35.300]   Like I think I think both are important like I
[01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:41.300]   I think both are actually important like for a long time. I want to low-end apple tv like an i like not an apple tv shuffle
[01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:45.300]   That'd be horrible, but an apple tv nano where you just plug it into the back like a google chrome cast
[01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:48.580]   That's actually because it felt like there was a huge a fifty dollar forecast
[01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:51.780]   I mean like you've been calling on that we've been calling on that for five years
[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:53.940]   I mean that's that's the lowest hanging food at this point
[01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:57.860]   But I think apple addressed that with doing the samsung tv app and doing the smart tv apps
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:02.180]   And what they've what they have right now is something that really serves their core prime audience
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:08.580]   Which is also people who like I was surprised when I turned it on last year and all those ad tracking things popped up to see
[01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:10.900]   All these tv apps always is that amazing?
[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:14.260]   That's my day every app. Yes every website. I went I just went nope
[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:17.620]   Nope, nope, and apple tv is the only thing I can do that on
[01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:19.780]   And that may not matter to some people at all
[01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:24.900]   But I like the option and it's also not just about the tv like some of the a lot of the apple tv apps
[01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:26.900]   Like the netflix team takes huge pride in it
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:30.420]   They're the best quality some of them have the best quality apps you can get apple
[01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:35.220]   Arcade is only because it still uses all the native apple frameworks. It's only available in apple tv
[01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:38.980]   You can use a sony controller and xbox controller. They're getting better and better games
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:41.860]   You know now that they're putting a lot more effort and money behind it
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:46.980]   So to me the total package is still incredibly valuable and it's it's a niche for sure
[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:52.340]   But it's a niche. I don't think apple wants to abandon especially as they build out towards vr like I said before
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:57.620]   Ar is going to build off the apple watch. It's a very similar experience with air pods and apple watch and all that
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:03.300]   But vr is going to build off the apple tv everything we do now in the apple tv will be available in ultra premium
[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:08.660]   One per customer form on the vr box and we need we apple still needs to ramp up to that
[01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:10.740]   So I think it's absolutely worthy
[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:13.860]   It's worthy of their attention and worthy of their continual development
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:19.300]   I I think that if you look at it as just a video as just a video platform then then you're probably right
[01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:21.940]   But I just don't think apple should spend build another skew
[01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:25.540]   You know like I just think that they you know they should they should do what they do well
[01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:28.820]   They don't do cheap well, you know, they don't they just don't do that
[01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:33.780]   Do cheap little things well and they're going to go into a competition where there's keep on fiddling around with little chips
[01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:36.900]   Then it won't really work and you know, it'll it'll be problematic
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:41.620]   You know, I think they should just let people have that market and continue to build the best in class
[01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:44.420]   Um because it is the best in class by far
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:48.340]   Like it's you know the the the chip set the power and what it can do
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:55.460]   And the games are just starting like the apple arcade games are just and other games are just starting to
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:34:00.420]   Go, you know, just starting to touch on what the apple tv is capable of, you know, and so
[01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:04.260]   And it's a lot more than these stupid little um thumb drives
[01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:10.100]   I respect what both of you are saying, but what I keep hearing you say over and over again is that
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:14.500]   They're it's good to spend an extra hundred dollars for things that don't exist
[01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:17.460]   But you hope will exist someday well the games exist now will be relevant someday
[01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:20.180]   The we're talking about there again
[01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:24.660]   You're gonna you're gonna talk kids into saying we see all these games that you're enjoying on your phone right now
[01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:27.860]   Well now you can enjoy it through this through the big screen
[01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:33.940]   Maybe they don't want to join it through the big screen again, but i'm not i'm not saying that i'm not saying that apple should cancel the
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:38.580]   the expensive one and and switch to something else i'm not saying that everybody else is stupid
[01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:43.300]   I'm saying that it see apple has to i think i think that it's
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:44.580]   very
[01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:50.500]   Short-sided and misguided for apple to say that we're only going we're going to sell this hundred fifty dollar box that today
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:54.740]   Side by side by side by side the way that people are using these devices
[01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:58.180]   Put if it costs a hundred dollars more is delivering
[01:34:58.180 --> 01:35:02.500]   $18 maybe more worth of value to to actual users
[01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:06.180]   I'm not i'm not talking about dopes who just are taking up to an 80 dollar tv
[01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:08.900]   Uh that they they they wanted bingo i'm talking about
[01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:14.340]   Typical users are connecting these things i've got i've my own videos connected up to a very very nice mid-range tv
[01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:18.820]   I can't tell the difference between really on this on this thousand dollar tv
[01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:27.460]   Uh 4k hdr. I can't really tell the difference between an apple tv my and vidya and uh and a 50 dollar google dongle
[01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:33.380]   That's the problem apple and i've got all three hooked up to the same the same tv because i'm using them as a test bed
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:36.180]   That's why i'm disappointed by the price of this again
[01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:38.660]   I appreciate that when i look at the engineering behind it
[01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:41.860]   I see that this is built for a built definitely built for the future and I
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:48.180]   Absolutely accept your expertise and from the developer point of view what is what is the greatest streaming target?
[01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:53.140]   I'm saying when I pick up the remote control in my in my living room sit on the sofa
[01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:55.700]   I do not see the extra hundred dollars
[01:35:55.700 --> 01:36:00.420]   Between the thing of the dog. I don't see the parody between this and the nvidia shield
[01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:05.700]   Which operates which is the hdmi one device because it does it's a hundred and fifty dollar device
[01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:12.340]   But it does great things and that money the main the main thing is is you start you you build the spec for what you what you where you're trying to go
[01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:17.700]   You're allowed you're able to now test it in mass because people buy their apple tv's and and so on so forth
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:22.260]   You're able to test the product about a hundred dollars to help apple test products that they need to show me in the future
[01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:24.500]   No, no, just get a yes i do
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:32.660]   Care apple is not apple is not apple is not putting that i'll stamp on the box saying the reason why we're charging a hundred and fifty dollars
[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:37.700]   For this is that no i'm saying that that is that is i feel is that that's such a such a weird
[01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:42.100]   Thing to say that you have if you're selling something to a user for a hundred and fifty dollars
[01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:47.540]   You have to your goal your dream your ideal is to deliver a hundred and fifty dollars worth of value
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:55.460]   That means that if someone else is has a competing product for a hundred dollars less you have to explain why you're true what they're getting for that extra
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:59.940]   Dollars i think that all matters does not make that argument this one saying well i mean
[01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:05.060]   The gap but make sure it shirts for four dollars and sells them to the were sixty
[01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:09.860]   We've decided that we're willing to pay that i as an as an apple tv user i'm willing to
[01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:15.780]   As an apple tv user i'm i'm willing to continue to invest in that process
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:18.900]   It is i don't trust any of the other ones i won't let them touch the internet i won't
[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:26.420]   Like i you know to me i i want there's only one thing that touches the internet that brings me content and that's my apple tv
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:29.780]   And so for this tiny little market that is me
[01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:36.420]   You know and the people that buy apple tv's evidently is this tiny tiny little market that probably sells only a couple million of of these
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:43.060]   Out out there so i wish me more than numbers. I think that would be the answer to the question. Well i can
[01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:50.660]   You kind of know you know a percentage you know the number is the numbers are pretty big
[01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:52.660]   Yeah
[01:37:52.660 --> 01:37:56.820]   Pretty big so so anyway so that the numbers are you know are much bigger than you would expect
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:01.300]   So so i think that that it is uh, you know because we see it across when we stream things
[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:04.260]   We see what percent of the people are watching on different things
[01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:09.780]   And so if we extrapolate against that the numbers in our little verticals of what we're doing
[01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:13.940]   Numbers apple tv apple tv is much bigger than a hobby so
[01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:17.620]   Bigger than roku probably not though. No, no, it's probably not bigger than roku
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:19.620]   but but it is uh
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:23.700]   But because the streams what we do are not the roku can't play what i stream
[01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:27.220]   So so it literally that's part of the reason then all right
[01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:29.940]   You're eliminating the number one device
[01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:31.300]   But also i mean like the magus
[01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:36.740]   But i don't but i see in the mac pro is very very small and that those are still markets that apple wants to
[01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:41.220]   Take care of yeah, yeah, yeah, i'm sure it makes sense for apple even though it's a hobby
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:45.380]   Right, it's i think it i don't think it i don't think they're losing money with it
[01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:50.020]   You know i got sure there was money selling it so so i think no one's one living room yet either
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:55.380]   Yeah, and but and the thing is is that is that there will if apple actually makes the
[01:38:55.380 --> 01:39:01.300]   The thing that apple has done with us in the past is gone. Hey, here's a new feature. Oh, by the way, you can that feature works
[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:08.020]   Two versions back or one version back or whatever they put it all in there so that we would have it when they needed it
[01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:13.860]   And now sometimes we don't get those features as fast as apple would like because it takes longer to develop them
[01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:18.580]   You know like it's like oh that didn't work that because one thing i will say is apple does not put out things that
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:23.460]   You know you just you just know that there i mean it's not that everything works, but it is far more
[01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:30.900]   Stable than most things that go out and so the thing is is that um and if apple i will say that if apple starts to
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:35.540]   Put out high frame rate htr, you know at for even just at 4k
[01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:39.540]   it really
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:41.140]   Causes a
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:46.660]   An issue for not everyone but there's this apple doesn't need to cater to everyone and i don't think apple should
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:53.460]   Like i think apple should do what it does well, which is produce a high-end tool, you know bmw's don't make cheap
[01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:59.460]   Don't make cheap cars, you know and so the thing is is that apple builds the car builds the thing to handle
[01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:03.700]   The best you know the best possible quality that we can put out
[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:08.260]   You know and and it makes a huge difference for us that you know for people who love to
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:14.820]   Like i've been an audio file since you know for 30 years and so and and i've loved video for a long time and what i want is
[01:40:15.220 --> 01:40:20.660]   Somebody to pay attention to that, you know and not lowest common denominator every single thing out there
[01:40:20.660 --> 01:40:22.740]   You know and just say we're gonna make something great
[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:26.660]   You know and there's so there's a handful of us that would love apple but keep moving down the path
[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:31.540]   And eventually give us the ability to have something in our house for two or three hundred dollars
[01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:36.740]   That is going to give us an incredible experience, you know a video
[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:41.380]   And i'm not and i think that there are plenty of other products for people who think that they're all the same
[01:40:41.380 --> 01:40:44.260]   You know and there's some people who keep buying them there's some numbers
[01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:51.300]   I mean take them with a grain of salt apple doesn't give out numbers but strategy analytics put out numbers for last year
[01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:59.300]   One point this is global one point one four billion streaming devices in use almost you know almost half of them are televisions
[01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:05.780]   But uh among the non tv devices amazon is tops with five percent of the market
[01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:11.620]   Uh followed by roku with three percent of the market followed by apple with two percent of the market
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:13.780]   so
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:19.140]   Yeah, so two percent of one point one four billion is still a significant number big number. Yeah, it's a big number
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:25.940]   You know, but you can see why because of this you can see why apple decided to put apple tv's in smart tv's
[01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:28.580]   By far
[01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:35.780]   Dominates the market the itunes on windows discussion again. Yeah. Yeah, you may not want to and certainly those processors are underpowered
[01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:38.180]   It is nowhere near the apple tv experience
[01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:43.540]   You'd probably like some of them are so snoopy. Yeah, and they yeah, they're snooping the hell out of you
[01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:48.820]   Samsung is 14 percent of the market sony 12 percent lg 8 percent for
[01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:52.260]   20 million units though
[01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:57.620]   Yeah, it's not a mistake. No, you know like it's not bad. Yeah, I'm not saying it's a not successful
[01:41:57.620 --> 01:42:06.020]   LG is a soft spot in my heart. Yeah. Yeah, I do I do like webOS now a lot of apple users have soft spots in their hearts
[01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:09.060]   for one password
[01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:14.340]   But one password apparently doesn't have the same soft spot in their hearts
[01:42:14.340 --> 01:42:19.700]   For apple users they used to have in fact they were originally a native mac
[01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:25.140]   Password manager. That's where they started and of course for a long time. They've had a native app
[01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:30.980]   Uh, Jason stell writing at six colors not important enough one password abandons
[01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:36.740]   It's native mac app. It's going to electron, which means cross platform basically
[01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:41.460]   I have to say that's in the beta version of one password eight for mac. I have to say
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:47.140]   My guess is very few people. You I don't know use the app and most people use the browser extension
[01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:51.860]   So they had they they've gone above and like I really liked the company. I love Dave tier and I love uh, rous
[01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:56.740]   I'm gonna say their names wrong, but they're they're fantastic people and there's been a lot of concern and controversy because
[01:42:56.740 --> 01:43:02.020]   They expanded into enterprise. It took a lot of VC money and a lot of times we've seen our favorite apps
[01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:04.740]   uh, like corrupt and corrode under that sort of
[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:09.700]   Direction I just not become what we want to use anymore. And so there's been a lot of concern over one
[01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:14.980]   Password they put up a blog post recently where they discussed that they moved they basically bifurcated the app
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:20.020]   They took all the logic and put it server side in a rust implementation because they thought that would be the best
[01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:22.340]   Yeah across platform
[01:43:22.340 --> 01:43:28.180]   Yeah, but then they had to make uis for all of the front ends and they were doing swift ui because that's the latest and greatest thing
[01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:31.700]   And it just they just could not make it work on the mac and a lot of other developers gone
[01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:35.300]   Yeah, it's it's not ready for prime time on the mac not unless you're like apple
[01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:39.460]   And you can basically you have the the engineers, you know writing the app for you
[01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:45.060]   So and they for a right of reasons they couldn't go back and do catalyst and they're still working on swift ui
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:47.860]   They couldn't they didn't have time to go back and redo it in app kit
[01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:51.220]   So they decided to use the electron app, which is what they've made for
[01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:56.500]   Massive cross platform support and older max because swift ui doesn't work on older max either
[01:43:56.500 --> 01:44:00.180]   They planned on that as being sort of their legacy support and they're being
[01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:04.420]   I've been forced as a hardware. They ultimately own the choices that they make and to be fair
[01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:08.340]   They're doing that on windows as well as on mac os. It's not just
[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:10.900]   Windows is capitulated to
[01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:18.500]   Yeah, well electron and and progressive web apps all of that like microsoft no longer really has a native development
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:20.820]   Then not the way they use to with win 32
[01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:25.300]   But apple we're still fighting for it so people hate it and they're like we're gonna we're still working on this
[01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:26.980]   You will get yours with ui app
[01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:30.500]   We have an abandon it is just like this is the best that we could do for now and some people are
[01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:32.180]   Ella angry. Yeah
[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:34.020]   Given our history of shipping great apps
[01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:40.420]   Built using the native ui toolkit apple provides the ability those toolkits gives us to meet the goal of an app that feels at home
[01:44:40.420 --> 01:44:43.140]   On the system we wanted to continue that trend
[01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:46.260]   But we can but but we couldn't
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:49.460]   So we decided for a two prong approach
[01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:56.580]   We would build two mac apps one written in swift ui that targeted the latest operating systems another using web ui aka electron
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:59.060]   That allow us to cover older os is
[01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:03.300]   I think the problem for me is electron apps are just such pigs
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:10.100]   When it comes to when it comes to cpu usage that because they're basically chromium. It's uh an entire
[01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:11.940]   chromium
[01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:13.940]   built in so
[01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:15.940]   Yeah, but on the other hand
[01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:22.500]   We're all used to web ui's so it's kind of an easy simple way to make a cross-platform app
[01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:26.820]   Yeah, i'm sympathetic. Uh, I didn't realize swift ui was that hard
[01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:30.980]   Or that bad it's I what we're finding with sure
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:34.740]   I know that a lot of us are talking about it recently is is is not that it's hard
[01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:38.900]   It's hard to find people that are available to work on it because so new as soon as you get
[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:42.500]   Well, it's not that it's you know, it's it's new and also as soon as you show any
[01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:45.860]   Capability the number of people that want to hire you is so high
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:50.260]   That they're just people is just really hard to find anybody that's in the wild
[01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:53.220]   You know and we're finding that with a couple people that I know that are developers
[01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:58.180]   They're like I have to compete with you know apple and google and facebook and and amazon
[01:45:58.180 --> 01:45:59.700]   And all these other folks that are writing stuff
[01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:05.140]   I have to compete with all of them because they're just snapping people up and paying way more than smaller developers can afford
[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:07.460]   Yeah
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:09.460]   Okay, so maybe a tempest in a teapot
[01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:17.380]   At the same time apple to really really increase the the purview of the iCloud keychain system
[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:22.580]   It does a lot more now yesterday. They released iCloud keychain basically in the latest iCloud update for windows
[01:46:22.580 --> 01:46:26.420]   You can now you can't do everything that you can do in the mac yet, but you can fill passwords
[01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:31.380]   You can auto fill out these interesting cards yet, but it's uh, and doesn't do android doesn't do linux
[01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:35.780]   But like for a lot of people windows was the pain point. Yeah, um, so it's that's the only reason
[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:41.300]   I mean, I think it's a very good implementation. I know it's extremely secure, but it's oh, you know, I thought it was only mac
[01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:45.460]   I'm I'm interested here. There's that's that's that's a very that's a very telling choice
[01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:50.180]   Uh, because they're very very aware that they've got a lot of users who are windows laptop users
[01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:53.300]   But the personal phone is an iphone right they certainly don't want to help
[01:46:53.300 --> 01:46:57.700]   People who are maybe iphone users switch to android thing. Oh, no worry. No worries
[01:46:57.700 --> 01:47:03.620]   All my all my passwords will just simply migrate over because i guess it's got to download this uh android apple password app. Yeah
[01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:07.460]   Uh yikkiak is back
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:13.380]   Uh on the app store. This was the app that remember gotten a lot of trouble
[01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:18.980]   But it's actually a very good idea for a social app. You can only chat with people within five miles
[01:47:18.980 --> 01:47:23.620]   Um, the verges graphic was a million dollars
[01:47:23.620 --> 01:47:28.740]   Small number has a other folder of apps for some of us for some of us that'd be a really small number
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:32.020]   It's it's all you live in a country. It's great for riots
[01:47:32.020 --> 01:47:34.820]   You know to say, you know, if you wanted to
[01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:38.340]   What happened of course it was used in high schools
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:44.340]   It what would happen it was used in high schools and colleges and it was because it's anonymous
[01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:48.900]   It was used to bully and and harass and that's why it got pulled
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:52.660]   Apparently it's going to continue it got pulled in 2017
[01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:59.620]   And I think there are a lot of kids in the that demographic, you know who were in college in 2013 to 2017
[01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:01.540]   Who still are traumatized?
[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:04.100]   But by the existence of yikkiak yikkiak
[01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:08.900]   It was valued at 400 million dollars when it shut down
[01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:14.740]   Um square picked up a lot of the engineers. It's not clear who is doing it
[01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:18.420]   Now but it's it's back and it's still anonymous
[01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:22.580]   It was such a weird time like to remember a secret came out around the same time
[01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:27.220]   And then there's this facebook sling where you had to respond to a message before you could read the message
[01:48:27.220 --> 01:48:31.380]   Didn't last more than a few days, but that was their big insight into into communication apps
[01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:35.540]   Yeah, it's so weird. It's it's kind of hard to
[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:40.020]   You kind of can see this coming. They're going to just go right back to the same problem
[01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:42.500]   And yet at the same time, I think it's a great idea for an app
[01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:46.020]   It's a neighborhood, you know twitter kind of
[01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:48.900]   Yeah, it's it's heart violates wheatens law
[01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:52.580]   Don't be a jadeo don't be a jerk
[01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:56.500]   Yeah, but it's it's but it is it is the sort of app where
[01:48:56.500 --> 01:49:02.980]   I I want to see it out there to see what communities have what positive communities have needed
[01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:07.220]   Something like this and oh my god. This is this is exactly the the the resource we need
[01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:11.620]   it might be it might be relaunch not specifically as a
[01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:19.140]   Your phone is geofence within a five-mile radius of your phone. It could be rebranded as a
[01:49:19.140 --> 01:49:23.860]   It's locked to a certain campus or it's locked to a certain company
[01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:28.020]   Company property or it's locked to a certain Wi-Fi base station
[01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:33.460]   And it would be interesting to have a social social media app that only works with people that are
[01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:36.020]   at my own office or
[01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:39.860]   Again in my own neighborhood as long as it doesn't turn into a hey
[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:42.980]   There's a guy who looks kind of shifty and because it's anonymous
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:46.260]   But you know it's probably that neighbor who thinks that anybody who is
[01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:51.380]   A shade of brown looks a little shifty. That's the problem that we get into when we get into these apps
[01:49:51.380 --> 01:49:53.780]   But I like to see the these put out there
[01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:56.260]   At least initially to see what?
[01:49:56.900 --> 01:50:01.220]   Community is not being served by social media apps and by infrastructure
[01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:09.460]   And what communities can be held by the sort of stuff. Why make it anonymous? I wonder that seems like that's the recipe for disaster
[01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:16.100]   I built I built a lot of I built a lot of communities online
[01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:22.100]   It's always a bad idea. It's a bad idea. Yeah, it's it's it never worked
[01:50:22.100 --> 01:50:26.660]   It always starts like this would be great and never it's okay. It never ends up that way
[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:28.820]   It's it's it should be
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:33.860]   It's okay to be I think that the people can protect their anonymity
[01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:38.820]   On a service like this. I think that so long as the service knows who you are
[01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:44.900]   And but if you decide that look I don't want people knowing that I'm a woman in this particular neighborhood or this particular
[01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:49.300]   In this at this particular event or be or maybe my
[01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:53.300]   The the name that's on my driver's license does not reflect my true identity
[01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:58.660]   And so I'd much rather be out in the world with my with my true identity or even if there's this is
[01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:00.820]   This is who I decide to put a fire
[01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:05.460]   This is the person that I created to create a firewall between my social media life and my real life
[01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:11.140]   I think that those things are very very valuable in some cases. They protect people's uh, people's health and their safety
[01:51:11.140 --> 01:51:14.420]   But I think but I think that's it's you're right that so long as people can
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:18.660]   Drift through a community without anybody knowing who they are
[01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:24.420]   I think 100 privacy and a situation like this never creates a service that works well for anybody
[01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:26.260]   Except I think that all
[01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:29.220]   No people don't like office consequences to be correct. I think yeah
[01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:31.860]   I think that all all of your arguments are completely valid
[01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:35.780]   It just it's just very hard to do like it just it's just hard to have a have a
[01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:37.220]   a um
[01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:41.780]   You know and I think I guess for me the idea of being only connected to the people that are within five miles of me
[01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:45.460]   Seems you just don't like your neighbors. Well, you're on a farm
[01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:48.500]   You know, I
[01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:51.860]   Know I'm with you. I don't like my neighbors either. I don't want to
[01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:55.940]   I have a couple I have a couple great neighbors, but but I wouldn't want to be though
[01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:59.300]   I wouldn't want to be limited. That's that's why it lends itself
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:01.060]   I think I have one set
[01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:04.660]   I have one set of neighbors. It's right down the right down the thing that I love
[01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:07.540]   And then I just don't know anybody else like I had another set that I that I
[01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:12.340]   That's not for you that left that were they were here and I they were great and then they moved to Connecticut
[01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:14.340]   You could see so you could see
[01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:18.260]   In schools and on campuses that makes sense
[01:52:18.260 --> 01:52:20.580]   Because you are
[01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:25.700]   Everybody at your college is within five miles, you know, that's also what made secrets so bad
[01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:29.380]   Is that you like you do like people would put all their worst stuff on there and you didn't know who they were
[01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:32.020]   But you knew you were connected to them on Facebook. Yeah, that's kind of creepy
[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:35.700]   Same thing like they put their worst stuff out there and you don't know who they are, but you know, they're gonna buy
[01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:39.300]   I have a knife
[01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:44.580]   There's another example that happened unfortunately in Boston just I think last week
[01:52:44.980 --> 01:52:48.740]   Where there was open gunfire on I think went to Newbury street
[01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:54.660]   Which is the last place in Boston you would expect like someone be running into a store saying shooter shooter shooter
[01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:57.060]   Stay inside stay inside stay inside
[01:52:57.060 --> 01:53:01.300]   And so if I could see like if I were in the middle of the city
[01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:06.420]   Sometimes I kind of want to know that gee why what what's that siren that I just heard or hey
[01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:10.340]   Why does there seem to be a whole bunch of people that are walking towards cobbly square right now?
[01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:13.940]   And if I find out, oh, there's a Ben and Jerry's is there that giving up free ice cream
[01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:17.860]   I want to know about that and if there's a shooter on Newbury street, I want to know okay guess what that's
[01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:22.980]   That's next door for the next that's the next door. Yeah, which is not anonymous by the way and in fact
[01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:27.060]   It's very much not anonymous and I that's that hasn't actually made it any better
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:32.820]   complaining about like someone someone's letting their dog poop in my yard. Yeah, you know like like that's
[01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:37.860]   And you find out it's on purpose. You don't know which neighbor it is
[01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:43.540]   I was finally free from the adobe creative cloud, but they keep pulling me back in
[01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:46.580]   Photoshop on ipad has released
[01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:52.580]   A major update to sky replacement healing brush and magic wand. It's getting more and more
[01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:56.660]   They had to the competition is so hot. It is. It's good
[01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:58.020]   I actually
[01:53:58.020 --> 01:54:03.220]   Reupt for light room on the ipad because of the workflow. It just seems like the easiest way to do it
[01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:06.980]   But I didn't pay for Photoshop now. I'm thinking oh crud
[01:54:06.980 --> 01:54:13.460]   I guess pixel-meter photo still is pretty good choice does a lot of these pixel-meter infinity are pretty good
[01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:18.740]   Pretty so unless you really need I have a copy of Photoshop. I still use it for some things that I have to do
[01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:19.620]   but
[01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:24.740]   I use affinity photo and pixel-meter and mostly affinity photo on on both platforms
[01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:30.100]   Mostly and there you know there's muscle memory for me like I just like I have pixel-meter
[01:54:30.100 --> 01:54:32.660]   I use it, but there's sometimes when I just know how to do it in Photoshop
[01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:36.020]   And I don't want to take the five minutes to figure out how to do it in something else alpha channels
[01:54:36.020 --> 01:54:40.660]   That's the thing that is like they they for some reason they don't always all the other apps don't use alpha
[01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:44.660]   They don't have alpha channels. Yeah, they don't let me explicitly have alpha channels and I and this isn't
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:48.100]   30 year old, you know 30 year user of Photoshop
[01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:51.700]   I'm just very used to manipulating my alpha channels and doing a bunch of things with them
[01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:55.460]   And I can't get to them and so every time I need to get to them I go back to Photoshop
[01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:56.740]   Yeah
[01:54:56.740 --> 01:55:02.660]   I gotta say though that I when I need to when I've slurped in a photo whether it's for my phone or from my real camera
[01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:04.980]   On my ipad or on my phone
[01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:07.940]   I do go straight to light room because in terms of
[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:13.220]   When I when I'm on my computer here, yes, then I want layers and I want all kinds of really complicated
[01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:16.100]   calculation filters and smart objects
[01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:18.260]   But when I just want to say gee what would it be?
[01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:21.620]   I kind of like want the color the color grading to be kind of like this
[01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:27.860]   I wish there were sort more of a greenish cast of the shadows or I want to make sure that this face pops or these eyes pop or whatever
[01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:30.180]   I don't see I haven't found it
[01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:31.460]   I do have affinity photo
[01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:33.860]   I do have like the the Photoshop type apps on my ipad
[01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:41.140]   But none of them get to get from good photo to the photos that I really really want to post or share or save as fast as light room
[01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:46.500]   Darkroom just got updated too. That's another good choice on iOS and Mac. I've been using that
[01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:48.660]   I have all of those just all of them
[01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:53.780]   Just in case I haven't yet settled on anyone one tool in each one of them. That's invaluable exactly
[01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:59.220]   All right, we're gonna get you a
[01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:04.100]   Sorry the the ML super resolution on pixel meter is so much better than photoshopped that I just go there and use it
[01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:06.100]   Yeah, I'll back sometimes. Yeah
[01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:12.900]   But yeah, that's exactly right. It's a lot easier. Just say I'm gonna lightroom guy and just I'll do whatever lightroom will do anything else
[01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:15.860]   But there's something else you know so my
[01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:20.100]   Knowledge yeah, I I do the exact same thing where the light
[01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:26.340]   I'll I'll spend like 20 minutes getting things quote perfect and quote in lightroom and then I'll just say you know what?
[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:33.780]   I think I'll just put it right through this other app justice that like the dumb as a you know what the the the stupid add fat and salt
[01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:41.060]   Carbohydrates to this algorithm like that actually works at five percent not at 100 percent, but five percent that does something
[01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:44.580]   I think that I think one of the problems that adobe has created
[01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:46.820]   I'm sure that they've done really well with the subscription model
[01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:50.180]   But there's so many of us that are so graded by it that
[01:56:50.820 --> 01:56:55.540]   The the way that they've done it is a I don't make it. It's definitely not in the whole company
[01:56:55.540 --> 01:57:01.460]   You know because of that number two is that you know so because I haven't needed I haven't really needed a new Photoshop
[01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:07.220]   Feature since like 2010 right like that on my day-to-day basis that I would need there's a lot of cool things
[01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:10.100]   But I don't use them very often um and you know illustrator six
[01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:13.140]   was the last one I really needed um and
[01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:15.060]   the
[01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:18.820]   The trouble is is that all of us are now we bought a bunch of other apps
[01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:21.140]   They're not as good as photoshop and illustrator
[01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:24.900]   But we keep trying and we keep on sending the developers feedback
[01:57:24.900 --> 01:57:28.180]   And we keep on wanting them to be successful and we still go back and we buy you know
[01:57:28.180 --> 01:57:30.660]   We use photoshop we use illustrator when we have to and then we go back
[01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:35.540]   But we keep we keep on trying out this and trying to push these guys forward because
[01:57:35.540 --> 01:57:40.260]   Because you're just so frustrated and eventually that catches up with the boby I think you know like it maybe not
[01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:45.940]   But it but eventually you know you're you're you're building a lot of high-end users that are
[01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:50.900]   Coaching your competition because they want out that's never a sustainable model
[01:57:50.900 --> 01:57:53.460]   And it's just that they charge so much per month for
[01:57:53.460 --> 01:57:57.460]   You know, they don't they don't let you just get what you need and have it be a
[01:57:57.460 --> 01:57:59.060]   A nominal number
[01:57:59.060 --> 01:58:01.380]   They they charge a lot and so a lot of us are just trying to help people
[01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:04.020]   You know, I don't I don't begrudge adobe's right to do that
[01:58:04.020 --> 01:58:07.700]   I just think that they open up a gate that a lot of us are trying to push other people through
[01:58:07.700 --> 01:58:13.140]   And i'm not gonna get to go any streaming for adobe after that
[01:58:14.980 --> 01:58:21.460]   No, i'm with you though and I and I want to use adobe's stuff, but you're right they've right they have created that
[01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:28.340]   Avoceral relationship with their users. Yeah, I really think that they're they're they're most useful users
[01:58:28.340 --> 01:58:30.900]   There's definitely people who love photoshop and they speak at their confidence
[01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:34.260]   If I knew it as well as you they really know that you do I don't know if I would ever change
[01:58:34.260 --> 01:58:37.300]   I mean, uh, it's you know, it's one of those things again
[01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:40.180]   I still go back to photoshop. I still go back to after effects
[01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:44.820]   You know because there's things that after effects can do that or it's more stable or it does something like really
[01:58:44.900 --> 01:58:47.220]   You know, there's certain things that I I need after effects for
[01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:50.580]   But I do most of my motion graphics all in motion, right?
[01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:52.820]   You know, like it's 50 bucks and it's it works great
[01:58:52.820 --> 01:58:56.580]   I didn't I don't I don't have I paid once and I get keep on getting upgrades and it keeps getting better and
[01:58:56.580 --> 01:59:01.620]   You know, it's it's better solution for me. Yep, and it's fast and I can put 3d models into it
[01:59:01.620 --> 01:59:02.580]   So
[01:59:02.580 --> 01:59:03.620]   I'm saying about that
[01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:07.380]   Let's take a little tiny teamy time and why any tiny time out and then when we come back
[01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:11.780]   We're gonna go to the picks of the week. I do want to do a little
[01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:14.420]   put out the the
[01:59:14.420 --> 01:59:19.540]   The little paper cup and say if you'd like to support our shows you might have noticed
[01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:23.620]   Uh, it's been a little tough these days what with covid and
[01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:30.900]   You know the changing landscape and podcasting we've really thought that what we would like to do is be kind of listener supported
[01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:33.940]   And so here's your chance. It's not expensive club twit

[02:00:12.900 --> 02:00:18.500]   Uh, yes, and if I had a sad eye dog in a sarah mclaughlin song, I would pay it play it right now
[02:00:18.500 --> 02:00:24.020]   But instead just effect. I won't if you just send me seven dollars right now
[02:00:24.020 --> 02:00:30.820]   Twit.tv/club twit Alex lensy pick of the week my friend
[02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:35.300]   Gonna warn everybody. Uh, oh
[02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:38.500]   Giving you a pick. It's not doesn't look expensive when you start
[02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:40.900]   Uh
[02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:48.180]   First taste is free coming. No, it's not free. They cost money. It's a piece of hardware. Yeah, um, it's a pretty piece of hardware
[02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:55.300]   It's a sickness. Uh, oh, it's so um, so my my pick of the week is the neutron from baringer now what what baringer has
[02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:58.260]   Seemingly done is uh
[02:00:58.260 --> 02:01:03.060]   They've gone back and looked at a lot of things that aren't made available anymore or they or they look at patents that you know
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:08.100]   They're not these are old products that that people uh, and I think this one's actually a new product
[02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:11.220]   But but they've they've really built an incredible
[02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:17.140]   We I've I thought of them as just mixers right like marynger mixers and some of my I hate it in the past and now ones
[02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:21.540]   I love and you know and we use a lot of x32's and and uh and other things like that and so
[02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:27.700]   Anyway, so a couple folks in office hours are really good at modular synth
[02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:30.500]   And I was like
[02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:34.820]   I wonder what that's like it's a couple hundred bucks. I got all I'll get well. That's not bad
[02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:39.220]   Yeah, yeah, it's a couple hundred bucks and then and then you go. Oh, I think I I really need the crave
[02:01:39.220 --> 02:01:43.700]   Which is another couple hundred bucks. Oh, I really need the wasp and then that one another couple hundred bucks
[02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:48.740]   Then I was like, I'd be really good to have the poly D and uh, so so before I know it
[02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:51.620]   I think i'm on my way. So the neutron is the it's the gateway drug
[02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:56.980]   It's like so are those software modules you add to the neutron or the hardware modules? No, no, no
[02:01:56.980 --> 02:01:59.540]   I bought new i got different synthesizers
[02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:04.900]   I got and what happens is you you you what I love about it is the patching so I love it
[02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:10.340]   That has patch k a patch. Oh my gosh. It is so much fun. That's a very intuitive way to do this
[02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:13.700]   Well, this is it's been around. It's been in twitter for the last 30 years
[02:02:13.700 --> 02:02:17.540]   You know, like it's it's you know 30 40 years 40 oh, I'm sorry 50 50 years
[02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:22.340]   Um, so this is where you know a lot of electronic music, you know, um is definitely in the you know
[02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:25.220]   Where it really began is late 60s early 70s with the moog
[02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:30.260]   And you know, you're making music with it, you know, um, but what you're doing is you're really shaping noise
[02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:32.660]   You know you create something that's going to create a sine wave
[02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:35.620]   You're going to create some kind of noise and then you're going to keep working with it
[02:02:35.620 --> 02:02:38.740]   You know and and you're going to turn it into something and so a lot of the stuff that you hear
[02:02:38.740 --> 02:02:44.420]   In electronic music, um, but also like sound effects like the 2600 is what I believe
[02:02:44.420 --> 02:02:49.540]   Penbert used to make r2d2, you know, you know, and so so and you run it through all these effects
[02:02:49.540 --> 02:02:52.580]   But and you can do some of this digitally, but there is something about it
[02:02:53.140 --> 02:02:55.140]   I didn't know until I bought it
[02:02:55.140 --> 02:02:58.580]   There's just something about it being organic and you're just sitting there playing with it
[02:02:58.580 --> 02:03:00.660]   And I I got the neutron
[02:03:00.660 --> 02:03:02.660]   And I sat there for about a week
[02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:05.380]   And then I sat down on a saturday afternoon
[02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:07.380]   I and I was like, I don't want to figure this out
[02:03:07.380 --> 02:03:10.980]   And I didn't you I for the first 15 minutes. I couldn't get a sound out of it
[02:03:10.980 --> 02:03:12.900]   Like I was just like I don't understand this
[02:03:12.900 --> 02:03:15.460]   You're like like I was just like I don't like I didn't ask for any help
[02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:18.100]   I didn't look at any videos. I just turned it on and just started fiddling with it
[02:03:18.100 --> 02:03:20.580]   And then three hours
[02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:24.420]   Disappeared like I was just you know, just just like I would just suddenly the sound started coming out
[02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:28.420]   And I'm playing with it and I'm hearing the thing is is that you're not you're playing with electricity
[02:03:28.420 --> 02:03:30.900]   You're not it's not a digital thing that's making up an effect
[02:03:30.900 --> 02:03:33.380]   It's things that are interacting with each other
[02:03:33.380 --> 02:03:38.500]   And so as you the thing about modular synth is that as you start to connect things just
[02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:44.420]   New things come out of it like it's not like I'm gonna do that effect or whatever new sounds appear
[02:03:44.420 --> 02:03:49.460]   You know and they're ephemeral because you have to remember where all the dials were to make that sound like it's not
[02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:55.380]   It's like it's truly an instrument like I I got I had an incredible sound at the end of that that I can't remember how
[02:03:55.380 --> 02:04:01.140]   So so how many patch cables would you recommend? I mean you can't buy this without getting patch cables all of them
[02:04:01.140 --> 02:04:06.420]   Yeah, yeah, like all of them. Yeah, I have a feeling that I will end up with a lot and I'll feel and what there's a
[02:04:06.420 --> 02:04:09.540]   So I think it comes with eight of them and that was enough for me to get started
[02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:12.020]   Um, I am looking at getting
[02:04:12.020 --> 02:04:19.220]   A lot more a little rack for them and a and make them and multi colored because what happens is you get a whole bunch of patches
[02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:24.260]   And you can't figure out which one is which yeah, this way you take a picture with your phone and then you kind of be able to reproduce
[02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:29.060]   Well, the main thing is just having lots of different colored patches would would help and then the key is that you can
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:31.300]   This is an output because it's a patch
[02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:35.300]   It's an output it can go out to another device and that's where things start to get interesting
[02:04:35.300 --> 02:04:39.700]   So you can tie these to other so you can use the patches not just a patch within itself
[02:04:39.700 --> 02:04:41.700]   But you can patch it to other devices
[02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:47.700]   Um, you can patch it to other modules and other bits and pieces and and and and start and has midi and you know
[02:04:47.700 --> 02:04:52.260]   There's a lot of other things that you can you can start to tie into it. Um, and and so it
[02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:54.180]   as a
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:55.540]   For a
[02:04:55.540 --> 02:04:59.940]   You know, it's good geeky fun. That's all I'm saying but like it's it's always and it I don't have any good
[02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:02.500]   Go ahead. I'm saying the
[02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:07.220]   I've been looking at videos of it since you've been talking and there are buttons and knobs and lights
[02:05:07.220 --> 02:05:12.740]   Passcade very analog. It's very physical. Yeah, and it's and I think I had an
[02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:19.380]   It's built on a standard like rec standard and I've seen like now videos of someone who has like three or four of these like in a little like
[02:05:19.380 --> 02:05:26.660]   Curving tower above the keyboard enough now. I just want a few of these just as a just just to color up the office
[02:05:26.660 --> 02:05:32.980]   Because we need more buttons and this would be good to give a smart musically inclined 16 year old for instance
[02:05:32.980 --> 02:05:36.020]   So really get them kind of on their journey. I think
[02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:39.780]   I you know and the thing is is that you know, you can you can just start playing with it
[02:05:39.860 --> 02:05:43.860]   You know and things started. Yeah, I want to wreck one. Rach Mount one of my bathroom
[02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:49.620]   Never where's Leo? Oh, I hear him. He's in the bathroom again
[02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:55.700]   He was
[02:05:55.700 --> 02:06:01.220]   We're gonna start check instruments to play that
[02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:04.020]   We've been doing what happened was is that we had
[02:06:04.020 --> 02:06:06.260]   uh
[02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:08.260]   We have folks that are
[02:06:08.740 --> 02:06:12.260]   That are they're really good at this and they're playing stuff in after hours
[02:06:12.260 --> 02:06:13.620]   You know not during the main office hours
[02:06:13.620 --> 02:06:19.140]   But the after hours that we don't record and they'll play stuff for us that are mixtures of this with analog and mixtures with
[02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:22.820]   With this on its own and showing us how to do it all and I started getting like okay
[02:06:22.820 --> 02:06:23.940]   I want to play
[02:06:23.940 --> 02:06:26.740]   And and so we're gonna start doing a lot more of it's not an instrument
[02:06:26.740 --> 02:06:31.140]   It's just making a sound and then you have to put put put it into as a mini
[02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:38.180]   You can make you can make music out of it without any external input because you now it'll be kind of rhythmic
[02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:40.180]   I mean, it'll sound like our 2d 2 yeah
[02:06:40.180 --> 02:06:43.860]   No, no, no if you listen to some of that stuff people will get it into something that sounds like electronic music
[02:06:43.860 --> 02:06:47.620]   But it's not gonna sound like r2d 2 you can build it into something that's playing but
[02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:50.500]   yeah, so
[02:06:50.500 --> 02:06:53.780]   So this is like a good one
[02:06:53.780 --> 02:06:59.460]   You know in the day in the day this would be like you could do this now with all and but so much fun
[02:06:59.460 --> 02:07:01.540]   again, it's it's
[02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:06.740]   It's just really fun, you know and and uh and I've had uh, you know, I when I was um
[02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:10.900]   I used to spin a long time ago for raves and
[02:07:10.900 --> 02:07:14.260]   I was like the warm-up person so all I had was MK 1200
[02:07:14.260 --> 02:07:16.180]   the
[02:07:16.180 --> 02:07:20.500]   The guys that came in after me would have all this stuff and I used to look at it going someday. I'll do that
[02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:24.020]   30 years later now. You finally got it. You know like like it
[02:07:24.020 --> 02:07:30.340]   So I'm like 350 bucks. So it's not you know start yeah start. I'm probably a couple grand into it now
[02:07:30.340 --> 02:07:31.780]   Like it's
[02:07:31.780 --> 02:07:33.780]   Did you get a rack and more
[02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:37.940]   So I got I got that I got the crave I got the rasp I got the polyd
[02:07:37.940 --> 02:07:41.140]   And I just bought the 200 what do you use to control it?
[02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:43.700]   The the polyd is a keyboard that I'll tie into it
[02:07:43.700 --> 02:07:49.780]   Yeah, and but I can create you can create um arpeggios as well as uh, you know, I'm looking
[02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:52.100]   I'm waiting to get the rd8 but I'm waiting for the new one
[02:07:52.100 --> 02:07:55.380]   Um, the the rd8 is a drum machine. It used to be the 808
[02:07:55.380 --> 02:08:00.980]   Um, you know, so it's a rebuild or the rate 808, but the new rd8 has anyway, so so the um
[02:08:01.860 --> 02:08:07.700]   So after that, I'm trying to I'm going to try to slow down but but like like Todd Todd Reynolds in our group
[02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:08.900]   Uh
[02:08:08.900 --> 02:08:12.580]   He has this he has this amazing one that is not not barringer
[02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:18.500]   It's like but it's like four or five thousand dollars and it's just this gorgeous piece and i'm like i'm not buying that
[02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:23.940]   Oh, that's next yet. Yeah, no, no. I like I yeah, and he creates just amazing
[02:08:23.940 --> 02:08:25.860]   amazing music
[02:08:25.860 --> 02:08:30.980]   um, you know with it so it's it's uh, uh, and and so it's it I think it's going to be um
[02:08:31.540 --> 02:08:34.420]   You know and and we have this member named carl esmucin
[02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:39.220]   And uh, and he's the one that just know he gets me up to speed really fast
[02:08:39.220 --> 02:08:43.300]   So so at five o'clock in the morning, he'll have these things out and he'll start to show me how to
[02:08:43.300 --> 02:08:46.500]   You know how to like how it all works and we haven't done it together yet
[02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:48.900]   I've just been learning from him, but now we're gonna once I get set up
[02:08:48.900 --> 02:08:51.620]   I've been in LA for a week, but once I get back i'm gonna
[02:08:51.620 --> 02:08:55.620]   I'm gonna do that. So anyway, so it's it's i'm just warning everybody that
[02:08:55.620 --> 02:08:58.260]   Look at it and if it looks cool
[02:08:58.260 --> 02:09:00.420]   Think about it for a little while don't buy it immediately
[02:09:01.140 --> 02:09:04.420]   Understand the that when you take that first dose
[02:09:04.420 --> 02:09:07.060]   It can be an expensive habit
[02:09:07.060 --> 02:09:09.940]   So good a good question from dugam in the chat room
[02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:13.540]   Could you do all this in software with a with logic pro or something?
[02:09:13.540 --> 02:09:19.620]   I mean you can you could probably do a lot of it in software and you could also um, there are software
[02:09:19.620 --> 02:09:24.740]   Things that will replicate what yeah, i've seen rax. Yeah, literally you can do it
[02:09:24.740 --> 02:09:28.260]   Here's the thing is that I just look especially in the replication one
[02:09:28.260 --> 02:09:31.380]   It's great to learn it before you buy it because of like a four or five thousand dollar rack
[02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:33.860]   That's something you want to think about for a while
[02:09:33.860 --> 02:09:35.860]   So learning how to do it
[02:09:35.860 --> 02:09:41.700]   And I when people when I talked about modular sent and I was like oh, I can just do this in software. They're like, yeah, but not
[02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:46.580]   That's really yeah, because well here's the thing is that is that you're playing especially as you start patching these
[02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:48.580]   You're really playing with true electricity
[02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:54.180]   And and it is doing things that is creative that that is not in the calculation that a software will do
[02:09:54.580 --> 02:10:00.260]   And in addition to that there's something about the organic nature of it that makes it like you're playing with it
[02:10:00.260 --> 02:10:04.580]   And there's something about the freedom of software that that likes it, but I think I love the um
[02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:07.380]   Uh, I love the organics of it
[02:10:07.380 --> 02:10:11.060]   Yeah of just that i'm pulling things around because a lot of times i'm just patch
[02:10:11.060 --> 02:10:13.780]   I started moving the patch around like what does it do here? What does it do here? What does it do?
[02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:17.780]   Oh, I like that now what does it do here here here, you know, and and you can do that with software as well
[02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:23.940]   Um, but but it is there was something about the organic nature of it that I really that i'm really enjoying
[02:10:24.420 --> 02:10:28.260]   Um, probably more than I should it not because I it's not like I don't have other things to do
[02:10:28.260 --> 02:10:32.900]   So, uh, you know, I have to kind of I am keeping it in a small pocket of like when I give myself
[02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:36.260]   Because I can I could do that all night get one of those euro racks in your bathroom
[02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:43.780]   And uh, it's great. You just said well the the other euro rack stuff when you start getting into the little modules that every module is individual
[02:10:43.780 --> 02:10:48.420]   Like I know I'll graduate there, but i'm trying to stay away from i'm standing in the baron your world right now
[02:10:48.420 --> 02:10:52.660]   I like like don't because is that i start building a quick wakeman in the bathroom right now?
[02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:54.660]   No, just a little
[02:10:54.660 --> 02:10:56.660]   You're a wreck. That would be a good time. It's got a year, right?
[02:10:56.660 --> 02:11:03.140]   It would be really really fun to have just a couple modibles in the back
[02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:07.780]   Like a little like a little like a little like a brushy
[02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:15.060]   I would I would always be doing the basey deep things because I like that. Yeah
[02:11:18.580 --> 02:11:24.100]   Well, if I actually make something that I think is remotely worth listening to I'll bring it. I'll bring it to Mac
[02:11:24.100 --> 02:11:28.500]   Please do. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's going to be mostly noise for a couple years
[02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:33.300]   Well, that's you know, I've tried all these things in software and that's all I can do because i'm not a musician
[02:11:33.300 --> 02:11:36.100]   So I end up just um
[02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:41.940]   Well, and I think the only reason that i'm adventurous about it is because we have these folks in office hours that know it really well
[02:11:41.940 --> 02:11:46.500]   So I know that I don't have to like go up to online forums. I'm gonna do we're gonna do labs
[02:11:46.660 --> 02:11:49.620]   So like we have a video by the way of Alex's
[02:11:49.620 --> 02:11:53.060]   Rack right now. I'm just I'm just saying
[02:11:53.060 --> 02:11:55.700]   What happened
[02:11:55.700 --> 02:12:00.660]   Honey what happened to the washing machine the prior
[02:12:00.660 --> 02:12:03.460]   Yeah, sorry
[02:12:03.460 --> 02:12:07.220]   How cool it looks though. I mean it really would be pretty cool
[02:12:07.220 --> 02:12:13.220]   Like if you look at if you look at a friend of mine has a website on and uh youtube called learning modular
[02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:16.420]   Chris Meyer. Yeah, and Chris taught me after effects of all things
[02:12:16.420 --> 02:12:23.060]   Yeah, Chris Meyer and um, but uh learning modular is the is the is the website and and he yeah, see
[02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:28.020]   That was so much fun. He's he's patching and patching man. This is all so cool
[02:12:28.020 --> 02:12:31.220]   It is it is work. Yeah, it is except
[02:12:31.220 --> 02:12:37.300]   Except is five nine four all our patch cables when I was working in radio were phono plugs with
[02:12:37.300 --> 02:12:41.940]   Fabric cable fabric covered cables. You know, these ones don't have fabric
[02:12:41.940 --> 02:12:44.580]   I was fun. I fabric. Yeah, I want I want fabric
[02:12:44.580 --> 02:12:47.060]   And I bet you if I made them myself
[02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:51.060]   Shoot if I made them I have a boat
[02:12:51.060 --> 02:12:54.100]   Oh boy
[02:12:54.100 --> 02:12:59.540]   Now we got a factor fabric and a sotter and i'm there, you know, yeah handmade. Yeah
[02:12:59.540 --> 02:13:03.460]   Uh, any an echo what's your pick of the week?
[02:13:03.460 --> 02:13:09.780]   Uh, this is a fun one like you know that all the times when you're watching a movie like pewee's big adventure
[02:13:09.860 --> 02:13:15.060]   at the end of it like they make a movie based on pewee's big adventure and ends with them watching the movie or
[02:13:15.060 --> 02:13:16.660]   uh like uh
[02:13:16.660 --> 02:13:21.940]   That episode of the of the office where uh, they show where michael scott was making like this movie
[02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:24.820]   He was calling threat level midnight where he stars just by
[02:13:24.820 --> 02:13:32.340]   Okay, so this brilliant web designer and illustrator by the name of lin fissure decided to create a parody of Netflix
[02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:39.620]   That only contains like those movies as if those were real movies and real tv shows and it and it's
[02:13:39.700 --> 02:13:46.580]   Done 100 percent straight. It looks like a streaming video service and then you go to under spy movies
[02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:50.500]   Okay. Oh wow threat level midnight. It'll list the cast it'll list the running time
[02:13:50.500 --> 02:13:56.500]   It'll be like a beautiful presentation of like what it would what this would be like as a page on Netflix
[02:13:56.500 --> 02:13:59.860]   You'll see as they they have they have stills from the movie
[02:13:59.860 --> 02:14:03.780]   The only thing they don't have is like actual video clips because they would get sued into oblivion
[02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:06.500]   Oh, they can't actually we have the clips. I'm sure
[02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:13.380]   But but that's but and a part of the reason why it's so brilliant is that there's also a high level of standards
[02:14:13.380 --> 02:14:18.500]   It's like a lot of people were asking I posted this on twitter. It's been retweeted like a thousand times
[02:14:18.500 --> 02:14:20.020]   uh, the
[02:14:20.020 --> 02:14:24.180]   A lot of people say why how come there's why come there's no roshel roshel from seinfeld
[02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:27.940]   And the reason is like given in the about page for this like there there are rules
[02:14:27.940 --> 02:14:33.860]   One of them is that it's not enough for someone to mention a character to mention this show or for there to be like a poster
[02:14:34.100 --> 02:14:40.980]   They they're actually has to be footage of this fake tv show or this fake thing. So every time so every time on
[02:14:40.980 --> 02:14:45.060]   uh, they have a clip from like mik bane on on
[02:14:45.060 --> 02:14:47.140]   on
[02:14:47.140 --> 02:14:51.860]   On the simpsons they will have they will have like clips from that they've got titanic to they've got
[02:14:51.860 --> 02:14:54.260]   Amistad to they've got
[02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:59.940]   And it's and it's such a tribute to all of these like fake
[02:15:00.740 --> 02:15:04.420]   Yeah, again you you think you think this is going to end
[02:15:04.420 --> 02:15:09.380]   the you know that angels with angels with filthy souls from uh
[02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:12.740]   Uh from home alone. They've got that one as a movie
[02:15:12.740 --> 02:15:15.060]   Oh
[02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:18.820]   But now it makes me want to see these exactly exactly
[02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:24.260]   So it's like is there a way you can I mean this isn't actually refer to the place that they started
[02:15:24.260 --> 02:15:24.900]   Yeah
[02:15:24.900 --> 02:15:30.020]   Well, it will no in the in the last line will show you will tell you what what movie it's from. Oh, you can go
[02:15:30.020 --> 02:15:32.340]   Or tv show. Okay. So you can't
[02:15:32.340 --> 02:15:34.660]   You won't necessarily go there, but it's so i love it
[02:15:34.660 --> 02:15:38.420]   There is uh, there is like an entry for the crewman show like I guess yes
[02:15:38.420 --> 02:15:39.700]   It was the title of the movie
[02:15:39.700 --> 02:15:46.340]   But was also the title of like the tv show that documented the character's life for 30 years and says running time 30 years
[02:15:46.340 --> 02:15:52.020]   This is pretty amazing
[02:15:52.580 --> 02:15:58.900]   Again, and it's a lin lin fisher. I'm so I got so excited about it once I once I once I got my once I
[02:15:58.900 --> 02:16:01.460]   Countering on seven matter work
[02:16:01.460 --> 02:16:08.260]   Holy she spent months she spent months on this and the original loadout of like three or four hundred stuff was all written by her
[02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:10.660]   She is accepting the user generated content
[02:16:10.660 --> 02:16:16.020]   That's but she's she's had to like temporarily pause because she's got so many like people offering things
[02:16:16.020 --> 02:16:18.820]   I would love to see this turn into like the the imdb
[02:16:19.460 --> 02:16:24.340]   Where again, it's like the one it's so there's so many of these fake movies and fake tv shows
[02:16:24.340 --> 02:16:29.300]   It's not just like it's easy to do like a poster roshell roshell and come up with like a tagline forward
[02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:33.060]   Right, but when they say you know what we are going to actually build a set for this
[02:16:33.060 --> 02:16:36.500]   On 30 rock we're gonna build a set for
[02:16:36.500 --> 02:16:45.140]   For for for the thomas jefferson movie. We're gonna have costumes. We're gonna write dialogue for a five second clip
[02:16:45.140 --> 02:16:47.620]   We're gonna be putting into one episode as a joke
[02:16:48.100 --> 02:16:51.940]   Uh, and there's a she does have a buy me a coffee
[02:16:51.940 --> 02:16:54.980]   Uh donation and I believe me I bought her many
[02:16:54.980 --> 02:17:03.060]   Many copies. Yeah what this is obviously a labor of love for her, but uh now I want to see all of these right now
[02:17:03.060 --> 02:17:05.460]   Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I hope it's gonna
[02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:12.500]   I hope this is like still going on for like years after this and it encourages people to like if if a producer or writer is getting like
[02:17:12.500 --> 02:17:16.020]   Pushback on saying no no if we're gonna do titanic for in space
[02:17:16.260 --> 02:17:19.700]   We have to do it like we have to actually have green screen we have to do modeling
[02:17:19.700 --> 02:17:23.380]   Like why because if we get onto nest flicks dot fun
[02:17:23.380 --> 02:17:27.140]   That's that's gonna be like the place where everyone's gonna find this and everyone's gonna love it
[02:17:27.140 --> 02:17:30.900]   It's again
[02:17:30.900 --> 02:17:35.380]   All the laughter you've been hearing like for the past five that is me for like the first like 10 minutes
[02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:36.820]   I but they don't have oh my god
[02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:42.500]   They have it and then and they of course they have to make a title page when there is no like title screen for it
[02:17:42.500 --> 02:17:44.820]   They have to write a description for it when there was no description
[02:17:45.780 --> 02:17:51.540]   Again, I cannot phrase this. This soap again. It's not just that anybody can have a good idea
[02:17:51.540 --> 02:17:54.820]   I could have had this I how many times have like you've been in the gua you know what
[02:17:54.820 --> 02:18:00.340]   There should be like a version of netflix just for these fake things and then you get distracted or you move on
[02:18:00.340 --> 02:18:03.700]   Or at best you'll do this lame version of it that gets a
[02:18:03.700 --> 02:18:09.940]   And then move on the execution of this from the design to the writing of the content is
[02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:13.940]   Spotless and that's why this thing could go on for years and years and years
[02:18:14.820 --> 02:18:16.820]   I
[02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:21.860]   Nest flicks any st f l i x dot dot fun
[02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:31.380]   And I have to I'll extend my warning that I put on twitter all of you studios out there disney Netflix if you do anything to screw this up
[02:18:31.380 --> 02:18:37.380]   So help me i'm going I have never been someone who goes who like goes on to use net to download
[02:18:37.380 --> 02:18:40.580]   Movies illegally, but I will download movies that I hate
[02:18:41.060 --> 02:18:46.740]   Just to stick it to you if you do anything to say excuse me that you're using a screen capture from our
[02:18:46.740 --> 02:18:53.300]   Copyrighted materials without a license. Yeah, no go to hell christmas with the california prunes
[02:18:53.300 --> 02:19:02.180]   Again the Simpsons that you know what we don't know how to do claymation, but we will hire us
[02:19:02.180 --> 02:19:09.140]   We're a high hire people to do claymation just for this one scene because it's a good joke burns for all seasons
[02:19:10.740 --> 02:19:12.740]   Mr. Renee richy your pick of the week
[02:19:12.740 --> 02:19:21.380]   So there's no way to follow that i'm starting out this pretty awesome. No way to follow that's why you're going. Yeah total total domination
[02:19:21.380 --> 02:19:23.860]   To andy and Alex this week
[02:19:23.860 --> 02:19:26.580]   So there's a youtube channel called Gerald undone
[02:19:26.580 --> 02:19:33.300]   So if you were to imagine what a john syrucusa macos review would be like if it was for photography gear
[02:19:33.300 --> 02:19:39.460]   That is what this is. It's just the most the sounds expensive for me. Um, well, so this yeah
[02:19:39.460 --> 02:19:44.020]   So he will do everything he will get like a mass spectrometer to see what the actual components of the cameras
[02:19:44.020 --> 02:19:46.180]   he does all his own color like um
[02:19:46.180 --> 02:19:51.220]   Uh, uh, sorry a depth of field. It does everything he measures everything he is exacting
[02:19:51.220 --> 02:19:54.740]   But he's also just put out. These are just for fun. He's put out a set of
[02:19:54.740 --> 02:20:00.180]   Uh hdmi cables that are purple hdmi cable because his whole channel is based on purple
[02:20:00.180 --> 02:20:01.940]   But that was not enough for him
[02:20:01.940 --> 02:20:07.540]   He had to get ifondo who i love ifondo for rook who does the most amazing mac reviews
[02:20:07.540 --> 02:20:14.100]   Like like the mac pro spins around and the camera ducks inside the mac pro and comes out and there's colored lights everywhere
[02:20:14.100 --> 02:20:19.380]   And he and he'll say in his inimitable accent, you know, it's apples new mac pro, but is it any good?
[02:20:19.380 --> 02:20:21.940]   You know, and then he'll proceed to keep dive
[02:20:21.940 --> 02:20:24.100]   Into the interview. Um
[02:20:24.100 --> 02:20:28.020]   And so he reviewed as part of the announcement for these purple hdmi cables
[02:20:28.020 --> 02:20:30.900]   Which are just really good hdmi cables that happened to be in purple
[02:20:30.900 --> 02:20:36.340]   He got for rook got ifondo to do the review and it is it is so brilliant because he tries to tie
[02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:38.820]   He tries to put the hdmi cable in the shoelaces
[02:20:38.820 --> 02:20:43.860]   He tries to see like anything that everything that you could at least like how his his videos look
[02:20:43.860 --> 02:20:46.980]   But he's doing this whole thing far so far so fully far so quickly
[02:20:46.980 --> 02:20:50.500]   And i had to buy an extra set of cables just to support
[02:20:50.500 --> 02:20:54.420]   madness the sheer madness and lunacy of
[02:20:54.420 --> 02:20:57.860]   This kind of quality of of a fake review
[02:20:57.860 --> 02:21:03.860]   For a just fun fun sort of product to tie in because it's it's it's mad
[02:21:04.100 --> 02:21:09.380]   I actually thought a bunch of these cable it'd be nice if you get him to start making patch cables for your synthesizer
[02:21:09.380 --> 02:21:12.740]   You know, these are nice. It was so this is all from amazing
[02:21:12.740 --> 02:21:18.980]   Yeah, and they're usually blue cables, but he got like a bus perk set done in purple just for his just for the show channel
[02:21:18.980 --> 02:21:24.900]   But nice if you go a little bit later on you'll see like all the shoelaces are being tied and all the like it's just it is a perfect
[02:21:24.900 --> 02:21:32.100]   Destruction of how it in a youtube review like it's just so dumb, but this is how all youtube reviews really are so it's
[02:21:32.900 --> 02:21:38.820]   You know, it's it's it's everything it wants to all people's goly. I love this all it's good. Yeah
[02:21:38.820 --> 02:21:44.660]   I love I just I just I could not I could not find it more adorable jerel done done and the new
[02:21:44.660 --> 02:21:46.740]   Yeah
[02:21:46.740 --> 02:21:48.740]   HDMI cable episode
[02:21:48.740 --> 02:21:53.700]   Uh, I want to mention real quickly. I sent and I see that you joined
[02:21:53.700 --> 02:21:54.900]   uh
[02:21:54.900 --> 02:21:58.180]   Renee i'll send you one alex and uh an invite
[02:21:59.060 --> 02:22:06.100]   Yeah, and uh, yeah, Lisa say well, he said so Lisa got in. This is by invite only it's called glass
[02:22:06.100 --> 02:22:10.500]   I found out about it from ome mallek who wrote about it and interviewed the founders
[02:22:10.500 --> 02:22:17.780]   Through the looking glass and it's in response kind of to adam maseri at instagram saying we're no longer a photo sharing app
[02:22:17.780 --> 02:22:21.140]   Which is pretty clear. I mean it's become something completely different
[02:22:21.140 --> 02:22:23.940]   So the founders of glass
[02:22:23.940 --> 02:22:26.660]   uh tom watson and staphan borge said
[02:22:27.220 --> 02:22:32.420]   Maybe we could make a kind of a replacement for instagram that's really focused on photographs
[02:22:32.420 --> 02:22:39.060]   Um, no ads because it's not free. It's $30 a month if you sign up, uh in the air pre-release
[02:22:39.060 --> 02:22:45.140]   I uh, yeah, yeah, did I say a month? I'm sorry. Yeah, $30. Yeah, that was like wow. That's a lot
[02:22:45.140 --> 02:22:48.980]   I don't i don't need i don't need it
[02:22:48.980 --> 02:22:51.940]   It's kind of like 500 px a little bit in the sense that
[02:22:51.940 --> 02:22:55.460]   Uh, people aren't using it for social media. They're using it to share
[02:22:55.940 --> 02:22:58.500]   Uh, what they consider to be their their best photos
[02:22:58.500 --> 02:23:04.740]   I this i've been looking for this because I the ads on instagram are overwhelming and it's all about influencers now and all that
[02:23:04.740 --> 02:23:10.740]   So but it's not a social site. It's not a place where you say hey, we just went to uh, you know, have lunch and here's my sandwich
[02:23:10.740 --> 02:23:15.380]   It's really i don't ask for your contacts when you upload when you yeah, there's some beautiful images
[02:23:15.380 --> 02:23:19.780]   One thing they did which was smart is they put the um x if information from the photo
[02:23:19.780 --> 02:23:24.020]   In the post so you can really see what the photographers up to
[02:23:25.060 --> 02:23:31.060]   I'm really liking it a lot. Uh, I I needed a better photo sharing site. So this is I think a very good
[02:23:31.060 --> 02:23:37.540]   Choice worth looking at this is a total lake of flex for you. We know yeah, I like it. Uh, boy is beautiful
[02:23:37.540 --> 02:23:45.140]   Yeah, but also if they if they just treat photos with respect instead of saying but we recompressed this and the color is kind of screwed up now
[02:23:45.140 --> 02:23:49.380]   Uh, and you can't really see the details because we're not going to let you really scroll scroll in
[02:23:49.380 --> 02:23:53.220]   That that was one of the things that kept flicker to be such a good photo
[02:23:53.300 --> 02:23:58.260]   Right photo site because it did such a good job it respects that people are looking here to
[02:23:58.260 --> 02:24:02.420]   Enjoy and celebrate photography not just see oh well
[02:24:02.420 --> 02:24:08.740]   It looks it looks like Andy has a new makeup palette for sale on his store. Okay. It's invite only right now
[02:24:08.740 --> 02:24:12.420]   Um, but I love the exit information. I think that's great
[02:24:12.420 --> 02:24:18.180]   But uh, I you know, I think it's going to go public eventually ios only right now, but
[02:24:18.180 --> 02:24:23.220]   Uh, I gathered that they might consider doing an android version. Yeah, just a
[02:24:23.220 --> 02:24:24.180]   easier
[02:24:24.180 --> 02:24:30.660]   Um, it's really beautiful and as I mentioned no nudity because it's too complicated to to make to put nudity and something like this
[02:24:30.660 --> 02:24:35.940]   Uh, so if you're a nude's photographer, you want there's a lot of astrophotography some beautiful stuff
[02:24:35.940 --> 02:24:41.540]   This is Reese Jones picture from New Zealand. Oh and you can leave comments too and because it's you know
[02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:44.900]   It's photographers and people have paid the money to be here
[02:24:44.900 --> 02:24:51.060]   Um, it the comments are very valuable as much it is kind of like the early flicker frankly in the early days
[02:24:51.060 --> 02:24:56.500]   Getting hit on for every photo. Yeah. Yeah, I'm really I'm really enjoying it. Oh, there's somebody I know what
[02:24:56.500 --> 02:24:59.220]   What?
[02:24:59.220 --> 02:25:02.180]   That's mine. Yeah, it's called you talking to me
[02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:06.100]   I'm the only one here
[02:25:06.100 --> 02:25:11.540]   So I just uh, I wanted to give it a plug. It is invite only, um right now so
[02:25:11.540 --> 02:25:17.940]   Uh, you've just got to download it for your ios device and uh, there's no ipad version
[02:25:17.940 --> 02:25:22.660]   But you could put it on an ipad and uh ask for an invite but I noticed it moves fairly quickly
[02:25:22.660 --> 02:25:25.380]   Lisa got hers just a few days later glass
[02:25:25.380 --> 02:25:31.460]   Is the name of it the website if you want to at least kind of delve into it as glass dot
[02:25:31.460 --> 02:25:37.940]   Photo and I'm I'm kind of wishing him the best. It's not I know not for everybody
[02:25:37.940 --> 02:25:41.940]   I paid for the year immediately me too 30 by you by the way, that's an early
[02:25:41.940 --> 02:25:44.580]   uh, adopter price 30 bucks
[02:25:44.580 --> 02:25:47.380]   Um looks like they're gonna have a web
[02:25:48.340 --> 02:25:51.700]   I'm not sure is there a web version because that looks like a web version doesn't it?
[02:25:51.700 --> 02:25:55.220]   So, um, maybe that will come too
[02:25:55.220 --> 02:26:00.420]   At some point I would like I would like that because these photos deserve to be seen on a big screen
[02:26:00.420 --> 02:26:01.620]   There's some beautiful
[02:26:01.620 --> 02:26:04.980]   Look at the photographers you like on instagram and then go find them like I like
[02:26:04.980 --> 02:26:09.140]   Sebastian do it from halide is like you just as long as you know their name you can find them on there
[02:26:09.140 --> 02:26:11.220]   Oh, that's smart. Yeah, because right now
[02:26:11.220 --> 02:26:14.500]   You just scroll through a whole bunch of people which I did
[02:26:15.060 --> 02:26:19.220]   Finding people uh you get you can get notifications if somebody follows you or comments
[02:26:19.220 --> 02:26:20.900]   So it's like but no ads
[02:26:20.900 --> 02:26:26.820]   It's like there are some spectacular photographers on instagram like apples photo team their camera team is on instagram
[02:26:26.820 --> 02:26:28.580]   john macormic who runs it
[02:26:28.580 --> 02:26:32.740]   Unbelievable, but you can't find them because all the algorithm wants to show you is the latest booty dance
[02:26:32.740 --> 02:26:38.260]   And it's just like where you have to make like search list and it's and this is just the photos. Yeah, it's so yeah
[02:26:38.260 --> 02:26:44.900]   I really I'm enjoying it. Anyway, just a plug. I want them to do well. I think it's a really uh great idea
[02:26:45.060 --> 02:26:47.060]   Tom Watson stephen borsha
[02:26:47.060 --> 02:26:49.140]   glass dot photo
[02:26:49.140 --> 02:26:51.540]   All right, my my spot in line is

[02:26:57.060 --> 02:27:03.220]   That's okay. I I actually if you saw me earlier on in the show, that's when I noticed glass
[02:27:03.220 --> 02:27:10.180]   And I first mentioned it then like oh well, I'll take my ipad and try to get in line for this. Oh, yeah, you could do it an ipad sure
[02:27:10.180 --> 02:27:14.180]   Yeah, yeah, um, I will I will send both Alex and andy
[02:27:14.180 --> 02:27:19.140]   Invites I have a couple left don't ask me hi come on don't ask me folks. I'm done. That's it
[02:27:19.140 --> 02:27:21.300]   They all went to Alex and andy
[02:27:21.300 --> 02:27:29.140]   Yeah, well, that's the thing lisa and I worked out who we were gonna invite so that we because we had six total I used one
[02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:34.340]   um lisa actually asked aunt and aunt says I don't have an ios device so
[02:27:34.340 --> 02:27:37.220]   Uh, yeah, I would love to see ants photos on here, but
[02:27:37.220 --> 02:27:40.180]   Anyway, so I will invite

[02:30:22.820 --> 02:30:25.380]   You did it
[02:30:25.380 --> 02:30:27.380]   uh also alex lindsay
[02:30:27.380 --> 02:30:29.380]   uh, of course we
[02:30:29.380 --> 02:30:33.380]   Profuncturally mention oh nine oh dot media his day job
[02:30:33.380 --> 02:30:39.220]   But he also is fun. It's a great place a lot of cool things if you need to do a lot of things through this go to these guys
[02:30:39.220 --> 02:30:43.460]   And then every other hour of the day office hours dot global
[02:30:43.460 --> 02:30:46.980]   Where you can catch up on amazing stuff
[02:30:46.980 --> 02:30:53.060]   24/7 pretty much we had we had a great uh, we had a company come in elk dot live they do remote
[02:30:53.060 --> 02:30:58.820]   You might be interested in this leo they have remote boxes for low latency audio between two points. Oh, so we're talking
[02:30:59.700 --> 02:31:02.500]   like extremely low latency how than a thousand miles
[02:31:02.500 --> 02:31:05.140]   Uh, they're gonna be like 350 for the box
[02:31:05.140 --> 02:31:10.580]   And then and then the service is like 20 bucks a month if you if you want to have like this for musicians mostly
[02:31:10.580 --> 02:31:12.580]   But I was thinking for podcasts it'd be great
[02:31:12.580 --> 02:31:15.060]   Uh, and that's a reasonable price
[02:31:15.060 --> 02:31:19.220]   So not using it's not using the it's point-to-point or is it using the
[02:31:19.220 --> 02:31:24.980]   It's it can use a server so it can do up to I think they set up to five at a time without a computer
[02:31:24.980 --> 02:31:27.380]   But it can also act as a a usb
[02:31:27.940 --> 02:31:33.940]   You know a device to your computer on on your end you can choose you can see all like if you have one of these connected and you're talking to five people
[02:31:33.940 --> 02:31:37.380]   You can see five uh stems. Oh
[02:31:37.380 --> 02:31:41.060]   Yeah, what's the name of that?
[02:31:41.060 --> 02:31:46.100]   Called elk dot live, um is the company they were they were just on uh, it hasn't been released yet
[02:31:46.100 --> 02:31:52.260]   But they can't you have to watch they came on office hours and the big thing is is i'm like now when I hear about any new product
[02:31:52.260 --> 02:31:54.420]   I'm like, hey, let me schedule you for office hours because
[02:31:54.900 --> 02:31:58.340]   All of us are way smarter than one of us. I can't think of like the questions that came up
[02:31:58.340 --> 02:32:00.500]   I couldn't think of so our second hour is now
