[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This week on Mac Break Weekly, Andy Renee and Lori are here to talk about the Apple Epic.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   It goes on and on.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.240]   The first ruling from the judge late last night will have the Deets.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.680]   Tim Cook, as he begins his 10th year at CEO of Apple.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.920]   And a Lightroom Bug that deletes your photos.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.160]   How bad can that be?
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.160]   It's worse.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.960]   All coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.320]   Mac Break Weekly comes to you from Twitt's LastPass Studios.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.800]   Now, you're focused on security, but are your employees?
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.800]   LastPass.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.320]   And ensure they are by making access and authentication seamless.

[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.080]   This is Twitt.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:00.320]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 728.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.200]   Recorded Tuesday, August 25, 2020.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.440]   Shaken Bacon, Rice Oroni.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.120]   This episode of Mac Break Weekly is brought to you by Molecule.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.680]   Molecule is reimagining the future of clean air, starting with the air purifier.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.720]   It's not just an innovation on existing technology, but it's a scientific breakthrough in air purification.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.680]   For 10% off your first air purifier order, visit Molecule.com and enter the code MacBreak10.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.480]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest Apple News socially distanced
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.720]   in our little boxes.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.880]   I have our hosts.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.240]   I like the new shot Renee Ritchie.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.240]   Is this new camera?
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.240]   Thank you.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.600]   A new look for you.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.680]   I finally did an Alex Lindsay and hooked up my Canon C500 Mark II to an 8 of Mini and
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.680]   then routed that into my MacBook so that I could try to do a little bit of the heavy
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.880]   Lindsay lifting while he was gone.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.640]   It's so funny as time goes by, because we've been doing Skype interviews, Skype posts on
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.920]   our shows for 15 years, but it's funny as time goes by, more and more people are stuck.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.800]   How this is improving over time.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.040]   Yours now looks like a motion picture.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.920]   It looks like a 6K sensor being down sampled to 4K being down sampled to 1080p being
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.040]   down sampled to 720p by the time it gets out to the viewers.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.040]   But it looks good.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.040]   I love the color mix.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.000]   I always have liked blue and gold to cool in the hot together.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I've always liked that.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.240]   It's a really pretty good look.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.240]   What are those?
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.880]   This is a Canon C-Log II.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.440]   Oh, man, it looks good.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.480]   Do you run it through a LUT before you feed it to us?
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.200]   The default Canon C-Log II LUT I really liked.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.760]   I used to use a custom LUT made by Crimson Engine and Mondo Bytes, but that was based
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.840]   on an ARRI LUT.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.920]   I just love the texture of it, but the new Canon C-Log II LUT is so good.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.640]   I've just been using the built-in.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.880]   I don't know if it's frame rate or latency.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.240]   It's probably because you're passing it through filters, but there is a little bit of latency
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.680]   on it.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.640]   We should explain for people who don't watch Alex Lindsay on a regular basis that these
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.560]   really good cameras can shoot in a form called S-Log where there's a lot more information,
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.440]   but the raw output looks very washed out, desaturated.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.800]   You have to pass it through a color look-up table or LUT to make it look normal.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.320]   You're taking the S-Log output, passing it through a LUT, then sending it to us so it
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.080]   looks normal.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.200]   As a result, you get a much better look because you have so much more information in the image.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.200]   It's just an beautiful...
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   It's a 10-bit from the camera.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   I'm sure it gets...
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.560]   It's sure it's 8-bit by the time it goes over Skype, but it starts out 10-bit in the
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.360]   camera, so it's getting a lot more data.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.960]   The bokeh is great.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.760]   What are the two little round things behind you?
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.760]   Are those...
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.960]   I'm going to guess those are fans from a cooler, for a PC cooler.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.960]   Those are actually old-school Hollywood spotlights turned back.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.960]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.720]   Because I like the way they look from the back, they look great.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:08.600]   And then there's Yoda and Baby Yoda and Baby Grou-ton, sorry, that side, and R2D2 and BB8 on that
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   side.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.880]   And then the thing that's the best that people are saying, "Wait a minute, he's so dark,"
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.040]   is because I have very flat, intentionally so, TV studio lighting on me.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.440]   But you are doing really nice movie style lighting, which has a lot of dynamic range,
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.640]   and it really looks fab.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:31.240]   I have a D120 with a soft box and a crate there, and then I have Quasar Science tubes
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.480]   there and back there.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.440]   And then there's Annie Inako with his Wayfair paper screen, and...
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.400]   No, no, your picture is good too.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.160]   No, see, I'm glad we're talking about tech because I don't know if you noticed, but I
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.360]   switched my camera from a Logitech Brio to a Magnavox VHS handicam for that warmer
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.120]   analog sort of feel.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.320]   It looks good.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.320]   It's very realistic.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.880]   Yeah, and I don't want to make any promises, but again, possibly because of the really great
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.040]   backgrounds that everyone else is using.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.360]   We might see a suspension of the...
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.680]   I'm finally at the point of redoing the entire house where it's like, "Now, there's nothing
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.880]   left but to confront the office."
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.880]   You want to...
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.880]   It might be time...
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:28.400]   Well, yeah, because behind me, the office is not every visitor to my house in the before
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.720]   times would get to see the office because that's a good room to choose to close the
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.480]   door and I've got stuff in progress.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.000]   I don't want people to see how I work, but now it's like, "You know what?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.720]   If I'm installing shelves and I'm installing new power outlets and doing painting, I may
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.000]   as well make it look finally like my own workspace do okay."
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.080]   But yeah, no, this is the time where all the money that I'm not spending on commuter
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.080]   rail tickets to Boston, all the money I'm not spending on dining out, it's like money
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.680]   that I could be saving.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.880]   But it's like, "You know what?
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.400]   What if we were to finally replace that 10-year-old sectional sofa with something nice?"
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.840]   And so I think that we're all just sort of getting ready for that time when, "Come
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:20.400]   out, come out, we can have guests over and they're going to be able to see this new piece
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.000]   of artwork that I finally put on button on."
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.240]   So with us from the burning regions of Northern California, Lori Gill, how are you staying
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.080]   okay there in the smoke field Sacramento?
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.160]   Yeah, it's bad, isn't it?
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.080]   We're really smoked out here.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.760]   It's a lot.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.280]   The sky is just red all the time.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.280]   It's crazy.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.960]   Are there fires near you?
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.040]   The closest, I think, is sort of on the Reno, Nevada border line.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.040]   Oh no, that's not true.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.960]   Actually, Vacaville is the closest fire.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.960]   And that's...
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.960]   That's pretty distant.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.680]   35 miles from us.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.320]   Yeah, that was the first really bad one.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.160]   And all of these were caused by light, unseasonable, unseasonable.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.680]   Not even unseasonable.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.640]   We never have lightning any season, but lightning storms a couple of weeks ago and now there's
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.720]   in the forecast they were worried that we might have more lightning and there were over
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.760]   10,000 lightning strikes in the area which caused many of them caused wildfires.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.800]   In California, we're in an arid climate and it doesn't rain except in the winter.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:34.000]   It rains generally November through maybe April and then there's no rain at all for
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.480]   months.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.280]   Everything gets very dry and tinder-like.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.080]   And as the president has pointed out, we are so lazy, we just don't rake our forests
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.080]   enough.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.800]   And as a result, boy, lightning strikes are the worst thing that could happen.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.800]   Stay safe, everybody.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.560]   We got hurricanes in Texas, Florida.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.040]   It's just...
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.560]   Mother Nature seems a little miffed.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.360]   A little pew.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.360]   She's done with us.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.280]   She seems to be done with us.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.520]   It's worse than that.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.840]   It's recognizing that Mother Nature is barely aware of our existence.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.840]   That's really the truth.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.840]   Yes.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.840]   Yes.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.840]   By the...
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.520]   This is why all the hippie 1970s, oh, the planet needs us to save it.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:23.080]   And the '80s kid thing is like, no, the planet doesn't care whether we're here or not.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.480]   Mother Nature says, "Hold my beer."
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:34.400]   If that asteroid that missed us by several thousand miles where to strike us, the planet
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.760]   would be pretty okay.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.640]   It would be us who would be wiped out.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.640]   It's funny.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:46.120]   My dad is a longtime paleontologist and expert in marine, paleo marine ecosystems, undersea
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.120]   ecosystems.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.160]   And my whole life grew up with all of this stuff around us.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.640]   And a couple of years ago, I said, I was reading some books of the sixth extinction,
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.640]   the uninhabitable Earth, on climate change.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.800]   I said, "Dad, what do you think of all this?"
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.480]   He said, "Oh, Earth will be just fine."
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.840]   It's not going to have a problem with this.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.480]   You remember in Blue County, they had that old comic strip with Opus the Penguin and his
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.280]   cockroach goes up to him and says, "I'm indestructible.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.120]   You can nuke me.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.120]   You can poison me.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.120]   You can destroy everything.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.120]   I'll still be here."
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.360]   And then Opus just looks at him and steps on him and walks on.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:25.680]   That is something that's cockroaches as a global community, as opposed to any individual
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.680]   cockroach.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.320]   Actually, I think humans will survive.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.120]   It's just what the conditions will be like for those who...
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.120]   Unfortunately, we don't get to choose which humans will survive.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:40.320]   It will probably be the bastards who have got an underground bunker.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.720]   Yes, I have a strategic here panel.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.640]   Rocket launching, Silo.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.400]   And then our society will consist of entire people who don't know how to boil an egg.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:59.880]   Meanwhile, back down here on Earth, the court has issued a preliminary ruling on the epic
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.880]   battle.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.520]   I'm just going to call it the epic battle.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.640]   Previously on Epic vs. Appel.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.680]   Do we need to recap?
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.040]   I don't think I need...
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.040]   You boi.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.120]   I don't know if I really need to recap it.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:20.560]   I guess the general gist of it is the overall battle between many companies and Apple over
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.560]   App Store.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.560]   The TRO.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.400]   It's worth telling people there was this whole TRO thing.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.240]   What's that?
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:33.520]   So originally, Apple and Google just pulled Epic's Fortnite game, but then Epic came out
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.520]   and said that Apple was threatening the entire Unreal Engine and filed a temporary restraining
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.600]   order to try and prevent the Unreal Engine from being shut down.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.840]   We talked about that last week because Epic isn't just a game company.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:51.920]   They make a gaming engine and a lot of people from Microsoft to ILM to a bunch of other
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.920]   places use the Unreal Engine to make all of their games and virtual set.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.920]   You jumped way ahead.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.560]   I was going to start at the beginning.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.200]   Can I start at the beginning and then we'll get to the TRO?
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.960]   From the beginning, the issue and others have complained about this.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.320]   Start at remember, hay.com back at WWDC.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.360]   Apple wants 30% of in-app purchases.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:17.120]   If you mention in-app purchases or if you have in-app purchases, Apple has several requirements.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.200]   One, you've got to offer them in the app.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.920]   Two, you can't offer a better deal out of the app.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.000]   You can't say, "Hey, get your Kindle books here.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   They're 30% less because we don't have to give Apple any of it."
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.520]   These rules are fairly strict.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.360]   I think universally enforced.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.920]   There are a few exceptions.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:41.480]   For instance, Netflix is just because Apple says, "Well, you're streaming video, so you
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.160]   don't have to give us 30% of subscriptions."
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.520]   There are a few exceptions like that.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.960]   But generally, that's why for a long time the Kindle app didn't offer in-app purchases
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.080]   on iOS.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.160]   It did on Android.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.160]   It didn't.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.160]   Things like that.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:58.600]   Along comes Epic Games, Fortnite, the most popular game over the last couple of years.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:04.040]   It has made Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Fortnite, $7 billion last year.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.760]   It's made at a $12 or $13 billion company.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.360]   It's been a very successful game.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.480]   It's a free game.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.800]   It has in-app purchases for downloadable content like outfits and dance moves.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:20.120]   They decided to play a little game with the way in-app purchases worked on iOS and Android.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:26.600]   In effect, giving a discount, if you didn't buy it through the store, eliminating Apple's
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.920]   30% Apple immediately yanked Fortnite.
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:35.920]   But then the next step, and that's the TRO we're talking about, Apple, then also said,
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.800]   and by the way, and it's in the provisions we talked about it last week, we're going
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.720]   to yank your developer certificate.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:48.640]   The problem with that, it affects more than just Epic because it's the Unreal Engine.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.080]   A lot of people use the Unreal Engine.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:57.360]   Dozens of games, including Infinity Blade, which is one of the best known iPad games,
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.320]   but many, many games, use the Unreal Engine.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.880]   Not just on iOS, it's everywhere.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.680]   If you're a game developer, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.360]   Use the Unreal Engine.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.360]   Makes your life easier.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.280]   You don't have to write a gaming engine.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.960]   You can take advantage of hardware features on multiple platforms.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.080]   You can offer a game on multiple platforms.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:18.080]   All you really have to do is design the game, put the underlying logic in, and you've got
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.920]   something gorgeous.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:28.480]   By yanking the developer certificate from Epic, Apple made it impossible for Epic to update
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.920]   the Unreal Engine so that games reliant on Unreal Engine themselves would not be able
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.160]   to get updated, and that is a severe problem.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.960]   Epic went to the judge, well, first of all, I book sued in the Ninth Circuit Court of Northern
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.360]   California.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.960]   Epic went to the judge at that time and said, "Judge, we need injunctive relief.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:54.400]   We want you to stop Apple now so that we can adjudicate this so the trial can go on without
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.600]   harm to us."
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.600]   The judge ruled yesterday.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.480]   US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers split the baby.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.200]   For people who are concerned, the court wouldn't really understand the issues.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.320]   This showed a very nuanced understanding of what's going on.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.320]   She was skinny.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:27.080]   Gonzalez effectively said that Epic is acting strategically in this lawsuit.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.360]   She recognized that Epic planned this and set it up, pulled the trigger, knowing that
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.520]   Apple would react this way.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:40.440]   She said, "For that reason, she was going to not give injunctive relief on Fortnite.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.000]   Fortnite is not in the App Store, and she would not order it so."
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.400]   However, she says, "By unlimited Unreal Engine," Apple has, quote, "Apple has chosen to act
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.760]   severely hurting third party developers who use that platform."
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.920]   She wrote, "Epp in her judgment, Epic Games and Apple are at liberty to litigate against
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.880]   each other, but their dispute should not create havoc to bystanders."
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:11.240]   She did tell Apple, "No, you cannot block the developer certificate.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:16.760]   You cannot block them from updating Unreal Engine because that doesn't just hurt Epic Games."
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.560]   So it was a 50/50 judgment.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.560]   Have to Apple.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.560]   Have to Epic.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.520]   Sorry, I just wanted to just- >> You should just call that a-
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.520]   >> Go ahead.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:30.600]   >> She explicitly called the pulling of the Epic's developer license and overreach.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.360]   So that shows you where the tone is going.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.760]   That's where we stand right now.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:44.040]   I would guess I would say, you could argue both sides of this in both cases, but it did
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.560]   show at least a somewhat of an understanding of what the issues were on the part of Judge
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.560]   Rogers.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.560]   >> There was an interesting thing.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.560]   >> No, there were two.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.560]   >> Go ahead.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.440]   >> What I'd like to do today, by the way, is everybody should talk before you start talking
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.440]   again.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.280]   So once you've said something, now it's Renee's turn and then I'll give Lori a chance.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.280]   >> Okay.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.840]   >> Yeah, I thought it was interesting in two ways.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:13.360]   One is that she was good at honing in on several points of technical aspects of the case.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.520]   For example, she really wanted to know if Epic had put this in for review and Apple had
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.680]   approved it.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.320]   Or if Apple, as Apple said, they snuck it in and Epic said, "No, we did not snuck it
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.320]   in.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.040]   They absolutely reviewed it."
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.760]   And then a few developers like Miguel Casara, a really well-known Xamarin developer, went
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.240]   through the notes and said, "No, no, you lied to the judge.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.800]   You did sneak that in."
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.440]   And on Apple's side, they were trying to conflate Epic's international company that owns the
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:42.560]   Epic Unreal Engine license and Epic calling it a shell company, a facade.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.600]   And the judge is like, "Well, you have improvement in that.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.920]   You're just saying that it's a facade.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.920]   It's a shell company.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.040]   So maybe the two of those should be separate."
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.400]   And I thought that was more than just her willingness to enforce one side of it and not
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.880]   enforce the other, was her willingness to get deep into those sorts of weeds and sort
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:02.760]   of figure out beyond what the companies were arguing what was really happening here.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.360]   Laurie, what do you think?
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.200]   Victory for Apple, Victory for Epic?
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:14.960]   Well, I think it's definitely a non-victory for both sides because this is going to be
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.160]   a while in the making.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:22.400]   I think this was the right decision, though, which is Epic.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.160]   They went against the contract that they had with Apple and the punishment for their
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:32.440]   crime is that the game that committed that crime, Fortnite, is pulled from the App Store
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.120]   until they make that change.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:39.640]   But at the same time, because Epic Games is such a large organization in terms of the
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.560]   things that they do for other developers, this is a great way for third-party developers
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.920]   to be able to continue to get the support that they need.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:54.320]   I do think that it was overreaching on Apple's part to go that far.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:59.920]   So having a judge come in, it's like two kids on a playground that are kind of pushing and
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.080]   shoving.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.760]   When the teacher comes in and says, "You're both acting like jerks.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.400]   You both need to go sit in the corner.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.400]   You have a timeout."
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:12.920]   Hopefully, hopefully, it sounds like the judge is doing a lot of really detailed research
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:17.920]   and not just taking things at the surface because there is a lot going on, especially
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.720]   when it comes to things like what's in the code and what's not in the code, asking those
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.240]   kinds of questions, "What do you mean?
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.400]   What are you talking about?"
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.400]   She seemed to really understand it.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.840]   By the way, this is just a preliminary order.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.000]   This is going to go on for some time.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.400]   She said at the hearing that the case is not a slam dunk for either side, "Cautian, her
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.680]   temporary restraining order will not dictate the final outcome of the litigation."
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.360]   This is just while litigation goes on.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:54.560]   She said a September 28 hearing on Epic's request for a preliminary injunction.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:00.400]   There's going to something that's going to happen in a month.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.880]   Then, when she asked Apple and Epic, "How long you need to prepare this?"
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.040]   Epic said four to six months.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.760]   Apple said 10 months.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.320]   We're not going to see a trial for a year, I would guess.
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:16.800]   She did say Epic breached its agreements with Apple, breached its agreements with Apple
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:24.200]   by trying to make money on Fortnite purchases while accessing Apple's platform for free.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:30.160]   It did not breach any contracts related to Unreal Engine.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.080]   She said it was punitive on Apple's part in effect.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.880]   A little spanking for both sides.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.240]   This is going to go on for an awfully long time.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:45.960]   I think that's the reason for the injunction is she realizes this is going to be painful
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.240]   for Epic fine.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.560]   Epic, you brought this on, but she doesn't see any reason for it to be painful for third
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.560]   party.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.560]   You agree, Andy?
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:01.960]   There are a lot of people on both sides that are trying to read into what she was saying.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.880]   For instance, saying that, "Oh, well, that wasn't good news for Apple because she acknowledged
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:12.800]   that just because Fortnite, just because Epic broke a..."
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:19.160]   Just because Apple has enforced a rule that it said was in the developer guidelines forever,
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.120]   does it mean that necessarily that's enforceable?
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.600]   That's not what she said.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.840]   Exactly as you covered very, very well.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:31.200]   She basically said, "For the purpose of this, we don't want the winner of this battle to
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.400]   become the king or queen of a scorched battlefield."
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:40.800]   There's no need to punish the entire Mac and iOS software market just because these two
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.960]   companies were having difficulty.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.680]   It really wasn't a win for anybody.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.840]   It would affect the Mac, too, right?
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.080]   It's not just...
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:54.320]   That's really a side effect that goes well beyond this battle over iOS.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.320]   That was a bullet dodged.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:01.560]   I was really, really concerned that I was surprised that Apple would have gone to that
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:06.160]   level of brinkmanship because I'm sure they realized that here is all of the technology.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:12.840]   Here's all the software that people use that require use of this engine.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.560]   It seemed like a way to try to get Epic to.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.600]   All they back down once a couple years ago, maybe if we hit them with a big hammer, they'll
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.600]   back down again.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:26.680]   If you're bored with this story, I'm sorry because it's going on for...
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.680]   I'll try not to make every show about it, but it is...
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.680]   Fight, fight, fight, fight.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.320]   It's going to go on for a little while and it raises...
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.080]   It's kind of like a soap opera.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:41.200]   But also, I think these are important issues and it's not just Epic raising these questions.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:48.440]   Renee, this is something that the US government's looking into, the EU's looking into.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:54.320]   The anti-competitive nature of the app store is something I think that somewhat...
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.520]   It is a monopoly, at least for people who use iPhones.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.080]   Something needs to be addressed.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.080]   Maybe policies need to be adjusted.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.600]   Do you think Apple's even considering that, Renee?
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.360]   So I just, for the sake of it, I'll point out that the Apple versus Samsung lawsuit was
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.360]   finished today.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.360]   And we all know how long ago that's gone.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.360]   Really?
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.840]   The final paperwork was filed today.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.040]   Yeah, I forget like 3000 filings.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.760]   So these things, and it was settled a while ago.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.600]   So these things do drag on.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.120]   I think there's a couple ways to look at it.
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.920]   Technically Apple is fine under existing law.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:34.600]   People may not want the iOS devices to be a console, but Ben Thompson pulled out Steve
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.840]   Jobs's original statement on it from 2007 before the app store where he makes it super
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.120]   clear that what they're building is a console.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.720]   And that doesn't mean it should be a console.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:47.240]   You should argue against it being a console, but just from design, it was built that way.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.280]   And all the consoles charge 30%.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.800]   All of them have monopolies over their own devices.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.880]   We license software.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.120]   We don't own our software anymore.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.120]   We license hardware.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.120]   We don't own our hardware.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.120]   I mean, BMW is charging subscriptions for seat heaters.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.840]   We live in a truly bizarre age.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.160]   And I think it's really important to fight against that.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.520]   But Apple is doing what a console owner does.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:12.840]   I think it's harder to accept when the console owner is that big and that important in our
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.040]   lives.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.680]   And we have to litigate.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:20.680]   I think we need to litigate it away from being a console into being more of a general
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.040]   purpose device.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.840]   And I think there are consequences to that.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.480]   Like some people want alternate payment systems and they want alternate stores because they
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.880]   want the freedom to choose.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:36.640]   And other people are like, no, I deliberately went iPhone instead of Android because I like
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.120]   the lack of confusion.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.680]   I like the fact that I can trust what I download.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.160]   I specifically chose it because it was a managed environment.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.040]   And you're trying to take that away from me.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.880]   And part of the value, part of the reason people are willing to spend more money on iOS
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:57.160]   devices is because of the relationship that Apple has developed that has value.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:01.680]   And I think we will have to sacrifice some of that trust, some of that value to get a
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.320]   broader app store economy.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.720]   But I think we should never just be very, what's the right word?
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.680]   It's not a good versus evil battle.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.320]   And it's not a clear cut battle.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:17.240]   We're going to have to very carefully charge out what we want, carve out what we want,
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.920]   and what we're willing to give up to get it and make sort of like a new app store deal
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.920]   for 2020.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:26.800]   >> There's also a larger issue with the app store, which is it's become unmanageable.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.680]   There's not enough people Apple could hire to do a good job with the app store.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.680]   >> They make mistakes.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.680]   And they don't deliver on the promise of the app store.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.520]   And that's a separate, but I would argue much worse, much bigger issue.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.920]   >> Yeah, malware sneaking in.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.760]   Recently, Zach Wood, who's a developer for something called Addix, got kicked out of
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.760]   the app, a store in the developer program.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.840]   Not for anything he did, but because his app had been copied many, many times by other
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.200]   people, third parties.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.400]   And so Apple accused him of manipulative or misleading behavior.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.640]   They couldn't figure out that he was the one injured.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.440]   It wasn't him doing it.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.880]   Fortunately, his appeal succeeded.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:09.560]   But I think that this is demonstrative of the issue when you have thousands and thousands.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.400]   How many, do we know how many apps a day are submitted to Apple?
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.680]   It's got to be a huge number.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.480]   Laurie, is there any number, any figure for that?
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.440]   >> No, no, I've never heard any talk about how many apps are submitted each day.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.600]   Yeah, it's got to be in the thousands, tens of thousands.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:31.760]   >> And do we know how many people Apple employees to review these?
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.480]   And what kind of training they get and who they are, where they come from?
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.600]   >> Yeah, we don't have to be in this region.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:44.160]   >> Yeah, and we don't have any of that detail, but that's clearly where the choking point
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.160]   is.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.360]   You know, when you hear developers talk about things that are wrong, it has to do with communication
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.520]   at that level.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:56.800]   So what you're having issue with is reviewers, Apple's reviewers of apps, either getting
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:03.040]   it wrong or just not communicating quickly enough with the developers, they're overburdened.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.080]   They're doing a lot.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:09.400]   And so when a mistake happens from Apple's perspective, they just, oops, we made a mistake,
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.680]   we're fixing it, you're back to normal.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.360]   But from the developer's perspective, that could be hundreds or thousands of dollars
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:20.120]   in revenue that they lost during that time period where things went wrong.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:26.680]   And depending on how bad the error message is coming back to it, it could be detrimental
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.280]   to their reputation too.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.440]   I think, I can't remember who it was, but a few weeks ago, it was an app developer whose
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.920]   app was pulled.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.320]   And when you tried to download the app, Andy, I think you were the one that pointed it out
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.000]   to us, you got a notification that said this app might be malicious.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.080]   >> So that ruins the reputation of the developer.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.160]   And Apple doesn't do anything to compensate for that.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.040]   They just say oops and then turn it all back on.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:55.160]   So there's definitely a huge issue with there not being enough people.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.720]   I don't think it's that they're not being trained well.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:02.320]   I think it's just that there's not enough people to cover thousands and thousands of
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.040]   brand new apps and middles and app updates that come through the app store every day.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:14.720]   >> According to just a teaser, per month, it's about 39,500 mobile apps every month
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.720]   released.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.720]   That's released, doesn't mention how many are blocked.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.640]   >> So it's 150 to 100 a day, which is a lot.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.640]   >> Yeah, it's a lot.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.120]   So per person, each person is expected to do 50 to 100 a day.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.600]   >> That's, wow, you can't reasonably be expected to.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:34.000]   Look, you're reviewing them for malware, you're reviewing them for failure to adhere to Apple's
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.120]   rules with the app store.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.640]   This is a lot to look at.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.920]   And they don't get source code, right?
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:40.920]   They just get the binary.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.320]   They've got to figure all of this out.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:47.160]   I'm sure they have tools to do it, but this is definitely problematic.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:53.480]   And then you get things like the WordPress thing, which Apple eventually apologized for.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.480]   >> Andy.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.120]   >> Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:03.560]   They had a problem where the WordPress is, it's kind of a weird app because it is an open
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.320]   source free platform for blogging.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:12.480]   The app that they distribute is an open source free app for posting to your WordPress blog.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:18.560]   And there was a big, either A, misunderstanding or B, a demonstration of the problems of the
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:23.880]   bureaucracy of the app store, where suddenly they were the automatic, the company that makes
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:29.240]   that app was told that, hey, we are not going to allow you to post any updates or bug fixes
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:36.640]   to this app unless you allow in-app purchases of your domain and web hosting product.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.920]   And they said, what are you talking about?
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.280]   We don't have, this is nothing to do with this side business.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:45.800]   There's a side business, there's also WordPress.org, which is the free stuff, there's WordPress.com
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:50.720]   where if you don't have a web host, they will help you, they will provide you with web hosting.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.640]   And they said, well, look, it doesn't make any sense for us.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:58.520]   It doesn't make any sense for the users of this app to be given in-app purchases.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.840]   And Apple essentially went back and said, well, tough, you're going to have to add this as
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:07.520]   an in-app purchase that you don't think you need so that we can collect 30% of it.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:13.480]   And it went back and forth until what Apple, this is the frustrating problem, I think,
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:17.560]   when Apple is dealing with app store regulations.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:22.960]   They said that because somewhere inside the app, there was mention of, oh, by the way,
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.000]   if you need a domain, you can go to our website and go get it.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.880]   So, oh, see, that violated the policy.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:33.280]   And as soon as WordPress made its app comply with our web, our policies, we were more
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.000]   than happy to restore them to the app store.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.240]   And this is, to me, this is the big problem that we're talking about.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.560]   There are two problems here.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:47.160]   One of them is that it's such a huge bureaucracy at that point, largely because of scale, but
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:54.160]   they can't simply say that that isn't a problem that Apple is capable of solving.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:59.840]   But the problem is that they often come across like when the power company sends you a bill
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.560]   for $0.00 and 0.00 cents.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.920]   And so you don't pay it.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.960]   And then they turn off your electricity and they say, hey, why is my electricity?
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.760]   We turned off, I don't know any money.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.720]   And then instead of saying, oh, you're right, we screwed up.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.720]   We shouldn't have done that.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.760]   Here's your power back and here's a credit for the time.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.400]   They will say, well, I'm sorry, but we've opened a proper investigation into this.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.240]   We sent you a bill for $0.00 and 0.00.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.440]   You fail to pay that bill for $0.00 and 0.00.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.680]   Therefore, we were absolutely correct in turning off your electricity.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.600]   We are now closing your customer service case.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:35.840]   And this is an example of that sort of thing happening.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:41.120]   I'm not sure why Apple apologized, although Sean Hollister's article in the Ferg maybe
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.720]   is the best explanation.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.080]   He says, let me find the last paragraph.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:52.560]   He says, interestingly, no, no, that's not it.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:56.080]   Oh, gosh, where is it?
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.920]   He says, basically, this is a hill Apple decided not to die on.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:03.320]   In other words, they just decided not worth fighting over this one.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.920]   We got enough problems here as it is.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:07.920]   It's a bad look.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:13.720]   Protecting right now, it's a very, very bad look to be beating up on an open source project.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.720]   Okay.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:20.680]   Apple kind of made a mistake, not a mistake, but I know it's a making a mistake.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.680]   They did imply they made a mistake.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:27.920]   Well, no, I mean, just in general right now, Tim Cook made this very strong statement that
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.200]   they treat all developers the same.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:37.360]   Now we're seeing them trying to actually make good on that claim, but I don't think it has
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.400]   been quite as cut and dry in the past.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.240]   And now we're seeing Apple saying things.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:47.240]   I think WordPress is a perfect example of like, well, they needed to tell WordPress,
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.360]   we treat all Apple developers the same.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.360]   So you owe us 30%, but it was a totally different situation.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:59.200]   This wasn't even an issue of giving a different, playing favorites or giving them a different
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.200]   deal.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.000]   They didn't even fit into that deal.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.520]   So it almost seems like there's somebody behind a sitting in an office going, okay,
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.680]   who doesn't pay us 30%?
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:15.840]   Let's go find out why they're not paying us so that we can claim to everybody that we're
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:19.560]   forcing these developers to, we treat them all the same.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.200]   We make them all pay 30%.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:28.120]   So it almost seems like they're trying to dig up the reality of that issue.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.280]   It's such a complicated story.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:36.680]   And neither Epic nor Apple is helping by adding all this kind of ad hominem attacks and all
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.520]   of this stuff.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:43.920]   I wish we could just kind of, I agree with you, Renee Ben Thompson's article, rethinking
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.400]   the app store is a very kind of measured look at.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:54.360]   He quotes Francisco Tomoski, who was on the original iPhone team.
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:59.120]   He tweeted a couple of days ago, Tomoski did.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:04.520]   Remember Apple's iOS rules would not have allowed for the invention of the web browser.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.520]   Let that sink in.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:10.720]   They would have rejected one of the most important technical innovations in the history of computing
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:15.920]   Microsoft's bully tactic of making IE free seems quite in comparison.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.920]   But here's the kicker.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:21.000]   Think of all the other amazing ideas we don't know about because they haven't got a chance
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.280]   to be invented because they aren't allowed on mobile devices.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:32.680]   Yeah, I only agree with that because so again, like if you go back and he has yes Steve Jobs
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.760]   is quoted in there as well and it's an apt one.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:38.600]   But you still can't develop on any of these devices.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:43.720]   You're still developing on Windows for Android, you're still developing on Mac for iOS.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:49.320]   And we've seen incredibly innovative, deeply like world changing apps be created the entire
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:55.720]   gig economy, the entire logistical revolution come to life on mobile devices.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.960]   And it doesn't use on the desktop or going to filter.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:01.240]   Yeah, it doesn't make sense to conflate the iPhone with the desktop.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.640]   That's what Jobs was basically saying.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.000]   He said, you don't want your phone to be like a PC.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.960]   The last thing you want is to have loaded three apps in your phone.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.440]   Then you go to make a call and it doesn't work anymore.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.400]   These are more like iPods than they are like.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.240]   That was my trio, by the way.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.680]   By the way, they're not really phones anymore.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.160]   They're the primary computing device.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.160]   No, it's changed.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.600]   Yeah, for the vast majority of people.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:30.640]   Well, this is why this is the second reason why I think this is an important lawsuit.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.720]   I think that I don't necessarily think that Epic is right.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:41.040]   I don't necessarily think that Epic that it would be the best for Apple or the iOS community.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:46.360]   If any time that a developer wanted to create its own store, it was able to do so.
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.840]   What I do think is necessary at this time is for Apple to go to court to defend all
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:57.600]   of these policies, to really be made to held in public to say, you need to defend all of
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.600]   these actions.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.080]   You need to prove not just to the court, but also to the court of public opinions that
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:07.880]   you haven't just simply been allowing things to slide because, hey, look, every WWDC, we
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.320]   get to say how many billions of dollars the app store is generating for developers, it
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:16.800]   doesn't matter if a lot of smaller developers who don't have the ability to hire a dream
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:21.000]   team legal team, they'll simply have to deal with the fact that, oh, by the way, we pulled
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.800]   your entire app and we made a lot of your customers think that your app is malware without really
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:26.800]   any explanation.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:31.280]   Well, you're going to have to address that Apple has never had been forced to explain
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.280]   itself.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:37.240]   And during the process of discovery, just like during the we're going to learn a lot
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:41.040]   about apples internal policies, and Apple is not going to be able to defend a lot of
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.160]   the reasons why it's been doing what it's doing.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:48.600]   Same reason why the Samsung lawsuit was, again, I think that the findings were correct in
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:54.880]   the very end, but at least as a bench warmer as a member of the audience and as a journalist,
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.600]   it was really, really cool to have Apple forced to produce documents explaining, here's how
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.600]   we develop things.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.520]   And here's how here's the arguments that we have.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:06.440]   Sometimes it's not exactly the same thing, but during the process of discovery, we're
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:10.760]   going to have Apple is going to have to not just simply go for PR, not just go for the
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:15.440]   bureaucratic responses of, well, we case closed, where you violated the rules and we have
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.920]   to apply the rules to everybody.
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.280]   I think this is ultimately going to be very, very good for Apple and for everybody.
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:26.440]   Yes, there's Thompson in particular points out that based on existing law and Supreme
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:31.160]   Court rulings, it's very unlikely Apple will lose in this epic battle.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:35.640]   This company has a right to determine how they do the business with third parties.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.640]   To be hyper competitive.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.320]   Yeah, you can be hyper competitive.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.480]   It's not any competitive.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.880]   But he does, and it's complicated.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:46.120]   So I don't know if I want to go through what he proposes as new app store rules.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.320]   Can I suggest something?
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.040]   So I sort of am not on the same side.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.280]   I think his remedy is an interesting one.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:57.320]   People worry if there's alternate payment systems or alternate stores.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.880]   Like for example, Fortnite will no longer be on the app store.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.760]   Everyone will have to figure out which store, which app is on, have to make accounts for
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.760]   every service and it destroys this.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.320]   It's kind of like the TV situation right now.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.920]   It's a streaming TV situation, right?
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.520]   Yeah, but I think there's a simpler answer.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.760]   I think that Apple should be grudgingly allow gatekeeper on iOS.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:21.160]   And I think that will solve myriad of problems because Epic will hate it because they want
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:25.920]   the shelf, the storefront of the app store, but then they should pay for it.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.200]   But if you give them sideloading.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:33.760]   So Apple opens up sideloading, but has the security features of Mac OS to protect you.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.760]   Yes.
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.520]   That actually seems like a good solution.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:40.120]   You know, the way Android does it is not a good solution because basically it's just
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:43.720]   a setting you turn it on and then anything goes.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.880]   There is no security around it.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:51.000]   So you're talking about a halfway measure that seems actually quite sensible and it works
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   on the Mac.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.120]   And it would create one other huge benefit.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:00.720]   And that is if China says no more VPN apps or Trump says no more TikTok, that's fine.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:04.000]   It gives Apple the same kind of deniability they get when they say, we don't have the
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   data.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.600]   We took it off the store and they're like, well, people are sideloading it.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.600]   We can't stop that.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.720]   We took it off the store.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:11.720]   That's you know what?
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.320]   I like your proposal, Renee.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.480]   That's a very simple.
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.480]   Laurie, you agree?
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.040]   It's a simple never find it.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.880]   It's a clean way to do it.
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.880]   Absolutely.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.440]   Might be hard for Apple to implement.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:28.600]   This has been sort of the solution for quite a long time of just allow people to use, you
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:33.280]   know, not just sideload, but gatekeeper, which makes it makes everybody happy.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.520]   Everyone gets what they want out of it.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:40.280]   Or at least when they start making accusations that Apple doesn't do this or that for them,
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.440]   Apple can say, and the antitrust is a perfect thing.
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:48.720]   Apple can say anybody can do anything they want on their phone with any app.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.640]   It's just that if they do it in the app store, here's the rules that they have to follow.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:58.480]   So would you do it maybe a little bit more stringently than you do on Mac OS?
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.120]   Because on Mac OS, there's really three choices.
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.760]   You say, I'm going to set it only app store apps.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:08.440]   I'm going to set it only signed apps, but they can be sideloaded.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.760]   And then I'm going to have a third setting that says anything goes.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.240]   Would you eliminate on iOS?
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.240]   I don't need to be a third setting.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:19.080]   Eliminate that third setting so that you have basically have two choices on iOS.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:22.120]   App store or signed apps?
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:27.240]   I don't see why there's any reason not to allow me as the consumer to do whatever I
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.040]   want with the phone that I paid a thousand dollars for.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.000]   So let me hit that switch that says anything goes.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.480]   And if I break my phone, that's my fault.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.560]   That's what Apple doesn't want you to do.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:38.960]   Well, it's not the breaking.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.960]   It's like the event.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:44.520]   You increase the surface area for attack because once you do that, it gives an amount
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.480]   of access that makes it more difficult for everyone else to stay secure.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:53.720]   I should point out that while we assume that the iPhone is more secure than Android, there
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:59.840]   is increasing evidence that that is not the case, that Android is not really old
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.840]   and Android for sure.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:05.880]   But if you're using an up-to-date version of Android, you're probably as secure and
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:09.880]   in some argue even more secure than you would be on iOS.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:14.640]   So you wouldn't necessarily be giving up the security of iOS to add this gatekeeper.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:19.360]   No, it would be the same certification, same protection and they've proven that it works
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.360]   on Mac OS.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.720]   But Laura, you think I should have the ability to say it's my phone if I want to install
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:30.120]   it from a third-party app store, I should be able to do that.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.120]   I do think that.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.560]   And then it's turn on jail breaking.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:40.240]   Yeah, it's a consumer-right kind of idea that if I, again, if I paid $1,000 for my
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.840]   phone, I should be able to put whatever I want on it.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:51.960]   And I frankly think that the argument that it opens up more issues of attack, well, so
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:56.200]   does my Mac, but Apple didn't put those restrictions on Mac.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:01.040]   So if they're willing to do it on Mac, why aren't they willing to do it on iOS?
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:07.000]   I think that there isn't a really good reason in my opinion that Apple wouldn't allow something
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.280]   like gatekeeper to exist on iOS.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:13.560]   And by the way, as long as you're doing this, let's put first-class support in for progressive
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:17.760]   web apps so that there's a third way I can install stuff.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.760]   I can install stuff from it.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.760]   Can we agree?
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.760]   No, Electron.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.880]   If we give you that, will you say, will you agree to know Electron?
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:27.800]   I think if somebody wants Electron on their iPhone, they should be allowed.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.920]   Renee likes Electron about as much as I like cooked broccoli.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.800]   It's like I can't even put it in my mouth.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.800]   I hate it so much.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.800]   Why don't you like it?
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.800]   It's just heavy, right?
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.000]   So it's heavy weight.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   It's too much.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.160]   So do you remember that error we had with all our Skype a while ago?
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.760]   That was Skype render helper.
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.240]   And the other day I had three of those.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.800]   I had Slack render helper, Skype render helper.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.040]   And I think Discord, I think render helper.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.040]   And it destroyed my mind.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.360]   This is a 16-inch MacBook Pro.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:57.920]   I can render 8K raw video with no problem.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.640]   And these three stupid Chrome render helpers is brought into its knees.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.040]   And also there's a good argument.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.840]   Go ahead, Danny.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.840]   Go ahead, finish.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:08.840]   Thank you.
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:14.640]   There's also a good argument that they're not efficient and they discourage companies
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.720]   from saying, well, we're going to make a Windows app that absolutely takes advantage of everything
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.720]   that's unique to Windows.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:23.960]   We're going to make a Mac app that takes advantage of everything that's unique to Mac.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:28.560]   It helps all these companies be able to create a feature complete release across all platforms
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.080]   on the same day release.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:34.280]   But yeah, I mean, if it were a choice between having the electron app and not having it
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:36.320]   at all, I would much rather have the app.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.680]   But yeah, I would much rather have a native Mac app for everything they use.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.920]   Go ahead, Laurie.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:51.240]   These are ways that we can then force developers to be accountable for what they don't do well.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:57.800]   When we start just saying, so if I have all these Chrome helpers that are just bogging
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:02.520]   down my Mac and destroying my Mac, I'm going to start shouting from a mountaintop how much
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.560]   I hate Chrome and how it needs to be fixed.
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:11.960]   But by not allowing it on iPhone, let's say, not allowing these kinds of apps, we then get
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:16.840]   mad at Apple for not even letting us have it instead of really forcing the developers
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:23.080]   to take responsibility for their shitty apps or excuse me for their bad apps and for fixing
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.080]   them.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:32.240]   I kind of like the idea of acknowledging the iPhone as a computing platform.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:35.520]   It's not an appliance.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.760]   I just really don't think it even has to go as far as that.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:43.200]   I'm totally with Laurie that if you spend $1,000 for a phone, it's your phone.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:47.200]   And if you decide that the way to get the most value out of your phone is to make it
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.480]   slightly less secure, that's totally up to you.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.920]   So also doesn't do it in such a way that you can make a botnet that brings down the entire
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:55.920]   internet.
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.960]   That's really acknowledging that the times have changed.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:02.600]   And Steve Jobs said that the iPhone is more an iPod than it is a general computing device.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:07.320]   Nowadays, it's a general it's it is probably the primarily computing device.
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.520]   One of the reasons I was excited about Xbox.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.020]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:15.880]   One of the reasons I was excited about the Microsoft Duo that that book shaped to screen
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:21.280]   phone is it acknowledges that this really and they even say it's not a phone, but no
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.960]   phone anymore is really primarily a phone.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:24.960]   It's a camera.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.360]   It's a productivity device.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:29.280]   It's a communicator for sure.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.280]   And acknowledging that.
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.360]   I don't want to get upset.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.960]   Yeah, I don't want to get upset.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.000]   It's really true actually.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.520]   I hit the hang up button fast.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.200]   Yeah, bothering me.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.600]   It's something that I'm trying to farm here.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:45.560]   I got farming to do.
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:46.560]   Let's take a little break.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.560]   Bigger discussion.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:50.360]   Like, okay, it's like everything we get now is licensed.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.360]   Windows is licensed.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.360]   They've DVDs.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:53.360]   We buy our license.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.840]   The stuff we stream is licensed.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.480]   The switch we own is licensed.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.760]   The stuff like our entire we've allowed a lot of technology companies to turn our world
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.680]   into a licensed and not owned world.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.840]   And I think it's good that we start clawing that back.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.200]   Let's take a little bit.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:16.080]   This is actually the better, much more interesting conversation than Epic versus Apple.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:22.880]   It really is about the deeper philosophical underpinnings of what this device is and what
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.000]   would be the best way to go forward with it.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.040]   And I hope Apple will start looking at that.
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:32.400]   The mistake Apple would make is, and I understand why they would make that mistake is just to
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:36.800]   say, well, it's 53% of our revenue.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.800]   We're fine.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.800]   Thank you.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   We're just going to keep doing what we're doing.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.200]   We're fond of the status quo.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.640]   Yeah, we kind of like it the way it is.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.640]   And in that case, it's only going to be government intervention that's going to change it.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.520]   And that's the last thing you or I or anybody should want.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.520]   Yes.
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:58.120]   That's just, that's going to inevitably be an ill-fitting suit.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:02.040]   Despite the fact that the court seemed to do the right thing at least so far with this
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:08.040]   Epic versus Apple battle, but I wish it would always be preferable if companies would say,
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.280]   look, we understand the platform.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.720]   We understand our audience.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:15.200]   And we're going to maybe not do what's in the best business interest immediately for
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:19.640]   us, but do what's in the best interest of our customers and our users believing that
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.840]   in the long run, that's the best thing for us to do.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:24.880]   Apple's always paid lip service to that.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.000]   But let's see them do it.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.600]   And Apple, we figured it out.
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:30.600]   We figured it out.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.600]   We got it.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.600]   The answer.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.600]   Watch the show.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.600]   Watch the show.
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.200]   By the way, Tim Cook today starts his 10th year as CEO.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.200]   Can you believe that?
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.200]   I know.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:39.200]   Amazing.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:42.640]   Did he get his like acrylic plaque like the other guests?
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:43.640]   I hope so.
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.040]   Is that nine by himself?
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:51.560]   Nine years ago Monday, Steve Jobs, August 24th, 2011, Steve Jobs stepped down as Apple
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:52.960]   CEO for the last time.
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:58.200]   Where he became so ill that he let Tim Cook take over briefly, then came back.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:04.200]   And then as he was sadly on death's door six weeks before his passing, he said, all
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.600]   right, Tim, you're in charge.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:13.000]   Hard to believe that Steve passed away 10 years ago, a little more than 10 years ago.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.680]   It's just very, very sad.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:16.680]   And you know what?
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.680]   Good job, Steve.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.360]   I'm picking your successor.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:26.760]   And I remember 12 years ago when Steve was sick, we said, oh, you know, the CEO succession
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.160]   process is not ongoing at Apple.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.120]   Steve just doesn't want to let go of the reins.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.560]   He really needs to do a better job.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:36.640]   Little did we know he was well on this.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:41.520]   This was this was like everybody everybody knows that the fourth empty plinth interfollower
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:46.200]   square is reserved for a beautiful bronze memorial of Queen Elizabeth.
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:50.840]   There is always going to be denial because it is not good taste to speak of a 90-something
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:53.480]   year old woman's a minute death.
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.960]   And so this is what was going on.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:48:00.800]   It's just a sign of how well Apple runs its company internally that it's just such a
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:07.280]   tight team that you never really it's a really is about growing your own talent inside as
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:11.200]   opposed to, oh, here is this person that did a great job of this other company.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.240]   Let's hire them for their expertise.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:16.840]   It seems as though when they do that, it's a two year or three or higher before they move
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:18.160]   on to other things.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.320]   I never knew about the fourth empty plinth.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:27.200]   Yeah, it's really great because occasionally they it's apparently was 400 years ago or
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.200]   something.
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.960]   It was for a statue that never got completed.
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:32.560]   And then it was just like no one bothered to do anything with it.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:36.360]   Occasionally they do things like a few years ago they did a thing where they'd have, well,
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:39.160]   let's do regular like art installations there.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:42.480]   There was a period in which they just said, well, everybody gets if you apply, we'll do
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:46.160]   like an entire summer where anybody who wants to can get five minutes to do whatever they
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:49.880]   want up there, whether it's an art piece or a speech.
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:52.880]   And now it's pretty it's pretty much understood that it's a sense for it.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:56.280]   There was the yeah, yeah, and thank and absolutely correct.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:02.800]   It's like, yeah, it's she's the longest reigning monarch in British history.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:08.720]   I know I have Canadian generation generations of people who have never ever heard God save
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:09.720]   the king.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.920]   Just think about that.
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:18.120]   And honestly, I while this is an interesting way to use the fourth empty plinth.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.320]   Can you show this?
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:22.680]   I don't think it's exactly the long term intent.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:25.840]   It was going to be that was that was this was one of those temporary ones.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:33.120]   I know it was intended for an equestrian statue of William the fourth, but they ran out of
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.120]   funds.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:39.720]   So it's now empty and this is another interesting idea.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:46.440]   One of the other temporary ideas, you know, it's just really reinforced how real engine
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.000]   yeah, I could put us on there.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.400]   Yeah, we can be on here.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:50.600]   This is really interesting.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:56.760]   The fourth, these are the various fourth plinth projects.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:01.200]   One of the figures I saw today was that apples market valuation went up as much in the last
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:04.600]   month as it did in all the time before Tim Cook became CEO.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.920]   Yeah, two trillion, two point one trillion now.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.120]   If you had Apple stock, congratulations.
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:14.840]   It's funny money though, but it's like it's like a YouTube subscription count.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:15.840]   It's a little bit funny.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.840]   It's funny if you can.
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:18.840]   Exactly.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:25.000]   Well, well, because you think you think about all of the industries that are absolutely
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.920]   getting it right in the neck.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:31.800]   Like again, like live entertainment theaters, there are a lot of one of the long term effects
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:37.460]   of 2020 is going to be that all the independent venues that to this date have evaded being
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:41.920]   bought out by these national conglomerates that took that turn it into an exclusive venue
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:47.360]   for Ticketmaster or an exclusive venue for our roster of events and our roster of talent.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:49.040]   They're going to be in financial distress.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.440]   They're going to be bought up.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:54.560]   And meanwhile, unfortunately, in a year in which we are actively asking questions about
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:59.200]   how much power huge tech companies have, this is an environment in which the services
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.040]   that technology provides.
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.240]   It's a bloom year.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.360]   So they're essentially becoming more and more wealthy and more and more powerful in
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.480]   a time when other industries are getting less powerful and less wealthy.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.160]   So it's a bummer.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.160]   It's a problem.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:17.680]   It's actually interesting because if you look at the tech sector, that's why the stock market
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.680]   is hot right now.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:21.360]   If you take it out, it's not such a stock market.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:28.600]   Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google, those five are pretty much all of the gains
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:32.040]   in the S&P 500 over the last six months.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.040]   John Lee Gessay.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.040]   These are minutes.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.520]   Gene Long's the week Gessay had a very funny piece in his Monday note.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:44.640]   "Apple's best times are behind it for real this time, but in fact, he's pointing out
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:48.800]   that many, including myself, I remember and my dad will never let me forget the Thanksgiving
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:52.400]   10 years ago when I said Steve's gone.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:55.200]   It's time to sell your Apple stock."
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.920]   Sorry, dad.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:02.520]   That was when it was down here at the bottom of that big growth curve you see here.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:08.240]   The good news is my father has never listened to me for financial advice.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:11.400]   He kept that stock and he reminds me everything's giving.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:15.920]   What I've been doing, and I know it's a drop in the bucket, but every time I watch a movie
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:22.320]   on digital now, I've been donating the ticket price to the relief efforts for theater and
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.000]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.600]   It's because I watch Hamilton and whatever the Hamilton tickets would have cost, I donate
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:29.600]   it.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.160]   It's a small thing, but it's just...
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:34.240]   To Broadway, to movies.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.240]   To whatever it is.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.240]   To Broadway.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.240]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:39.240]   And not to Hollywood stars.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:40.240]   Like their organizations were out.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.240]   They're doing fine.
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.240]   That are completely devastated by this.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:43.240]   Exactly.
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:47.640]   As with all of this, the top 1%, they're doing just fine.
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:49.640]   It's the normal people.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:50.640]   And the assistants.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:54.960]   Like the assistants to all the people who aren't working right now and all that kind of stuff.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:55.960]   But that's really good.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:57.960]   We're doing a little bit as well.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.280]   I encourage that too.
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:05.840]   I've been watching the Met Opera has still been streaming another daily opera every single
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:06.840]   day.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:07.840]   This is very weak, by the way.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:11.920]   So all the operas you've heard of and all the Arias that are like the opera's greatest
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.760]   hits are going to be streaming this week.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:18.440]   And so I have been like there's some that have been so good that I've been capturing
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:20.480]   it so I can watch it later.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:25.120]   But I've made like a big bulk donation to a fund for Met Opera artists.
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:30.280]   And we're talking about the chorus, the super numeraries, like the people who hold the spears,
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:34.600]   the people in the costume department, because they really are having a hard time.
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:38.440]   They've had no income for, they are on unemployment.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:39.440]   They've had no income.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:43.080]   And they're not going to have any until at least January if the schedule holds.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:48.680]   So yeah, for whatever life theater you personally have an emotional investment in.
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:52.640]   And in addition on the list of organizations that could use your financial support, think
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:55.080]   about adding that to your financial investment.
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:57.200]   Shoot, I missed Diana Damar on Rigolletto.
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.080]   No, no, it's still today today.
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:01.080]   You got until 630.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.080]   630 today.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.080]   I'm going home early.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:04.080]   I'm going home early.
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:07.280]   That's a I already owned that one on Blu ray super production.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.280]   I love Rigolletto.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:10.840]   Oh, that much Raviata.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:14.440]   Two of my favorites both this week.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:15.440]   And where do you see that?
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.880]   How do you get that?
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:23.120]   You go to medopera.org and right from the front page is a link to the daily stream.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:25.400]   You can also take a look at what's going to be coming up for the next couple of weeks.
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:30.480]   They also provide background information, like information about the production, information
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.960]   about the opera.
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.920]   And they're committed to doing this forever.
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:39.080]   They've been streaming, they've been doing live in HD theater streams forever.
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:44.920]   And also like P on PBS, they used to do live streaming since like the 70s.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:50.280]   So on some nights you can say, okay, here, here, here is Luciano Parroti and Beverly
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:53.080]   Sills like in 1978.
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:56.880]   Like, okay, I think I know what I'm it's like saying, do you want to see what's what's on
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.880]   the baseball play of the night tonight?
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:03.760]   Mickey Mantle and Don and and Joe DiMaggio playing against the Red Sox of 1950.
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:07.040]   So, okay, that sounds like something that would never have had a chance to see.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.840]   So is this Rigolletto in 1960s Las Vegas?
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:10.840]   This is a stairwell.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:11.840]   Yes, yes.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:14.440]   They read this is this is why people don't.
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:20.500]   I grew up, I mean, I grew up with it's always like people dressed in like 19 16th century
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:24.720]   is 17th century court dress and like florid like ballrooms.
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:28.560]   And they will always they keep doing things like figuring out, well, free set this.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:30.320]   Let's give this an exciting new setting.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:31.720]   They don't change a word of it.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:35.360]   They don't change any of the songs or anything, but they put into a new context and it becomes
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.360]   twice exciting.
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:37.360]   So, so hysterical.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:39.560]   I can't wait to see this.
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:41.560]   And I love the music.
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:42.560]   It's beautiful music.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:43.560]   Oh my God.
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:47.840]   And of course, as with all operas, there's a woman sobbing on the ground.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:51.520]   As some guy sings sweet revenge.
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:57.360]   Again, the marriage of Figaro is funny.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:58.840]   It's a it's a good one.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:55:59.840]   That's actually good.
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:03.040]   Well, for somebody who's not an opera fan as their as your first opera.
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:04.560]   So, yeah, yeah.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.240]   I know we complain about sequelitis, but that's a good.
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:11.640]   I'll put that up with Empire Strikes Back as one of the few sequels that actually improves
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.160]   in the original.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:15.520]   Thank you for joining us for this Andy and I co-opera minutes.
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.520]   We're going to take a little break.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:20.960]   And I've just monetized every opera purchase I made in 2020.
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:24.600]   Actually you can donate and they do say that, you know, pay for your tickets if you want.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:26.880]   It's a free stream, but I think that's really good.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:27.880]   I like that.
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:29.440]   Yeah, I'm going to do that.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:33.080]   I never did watch the Mandalorian on Disney Plus got that money for nothing.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:34.440]   So I can mix time.
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.240]   We all watch it.
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.240]   I started it.
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:40.440]   It's like, man, Lisa said, this is a kids movie.
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:42.320]   And I said, yeah.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:43.920]   All Star Wars is a kids movie.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:44.920]   I know.
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:45.920]   It just gets good.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:50.560]   My problem was, I was, Lisa was, but I was not a kid when it came out.
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:54.680]   And so I don't have that same appreciation of Star Wars that people who grew up.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:59.320]   But it's very much a Japanese samurai Western in outer space.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:02.320]   It's a little wolf and cub.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:04.320]   It truly is.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.800]   I mean, it's like, it's practically that story.
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:08.760]   So give it another try.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:11.240]   It's, you know, it's going to be PG.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:17.960]   But, you know, it's got a lot of great operatic Japanese operatic story telling style to it.
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:18.960]   So yeah.
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:19.960]   All right.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:23.400]   And for Alex's sake, just watch it for the cinematography because that's really impressive.
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.360]   Well, the technology now that I know how they shot it is fascinating.
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:27.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:30.360]   We won't, we won't judge you for not having seen it.
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:33.960]   We don't want to be, we don't want to be that person who says, you've never seen apocalypse
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:34.960]   now.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:35.960]   Okay.
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:36.960]   Well, forget our plans for tonight.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:40.000]   You're staying here and we're I'm going to make you see apocalypse now.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.040]   I confess I might be that guy in some cases.
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:49.280]   I think it, but after after my twenties, I stopped doing it because, oh, is that why no one comes
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:50.840]   to my house anymore?
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:55.640]   Gosh, it could be my personality, but I'm sure this doesn't help either.
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:59.600]   I was sure today brought to you by the fresh air in this studio.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:04.480]   You know, it's funny when I came in the studio, I said, it smells a little smoky in here.
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.480]   Not anymore.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:07.040]   It smells great.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:12.280]   Like goodness, we have our molecule in here and at home, we have two molecules.
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:15.760]   A lot of us work in offices like this one where the windows are sealed.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:19.000]   You can't open the windows.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.760]   Probably okay nowadays with all that smoke in the air, but, but inside the office indoor
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:27.480]   air can be five times worse than outdoor air.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:28.480]   And that's not just me.
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.480]   That's the EPA that says that.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:33.200]   That's why you want to have a molecule.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:37.240]   It is reimagining the future of clean air.
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.040]   It's not just an innovation on existing technology.
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:44.400]   It's a scientific breakthrough in air purification called Pico.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:50.600]   That's molecules core technology, P-E-C-O photoelectrochemical oxidation.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.360]   And what it does is very interesting.
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:59:00.240]   It has a, it's like a catalytic converter in my molecule and it traps harmful pollutants
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.240]   in the air.
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:06.400]   It's very small pollutants that most filters can't capture viruses, bacteria, mold, volatile
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:09.400]   organic compounds like formaldehyde.
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:15.240]   And instead of just collecting them, it traps them and then destroys them.
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:19.720]   Molecule air purifiers are designed to help protect homes, businesses and medical spaces.
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:24.280]   So you know they're destroying pollutants and providing clean air.
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:26.680]   There are a variety of molecule air purifiers.
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.440]   We have the tall one.
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:32.160]   It's suitable for a room as big as ours up to 600 square feet.
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:36.760]   For a smaller room, 250 square feet, kind of your bedroom or your living room, the molecule
[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:38.600]   air mini is a great choice.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:43.320]   There's also the mini plus which has a particle sensor and auto protect mode.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:47.920]   That's really good because you may not smell the pollutants.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:51.720]   You may not know that they're there, but the molecule does and it will ramp up to take
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:54.600]   care of them even if you don't know they're there.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:59.320]   They even have an FDA cleared as a 501(k) class two medical device.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:06.240]   Molecule air pro RX, that's for medical offices, dental offices, specifically to destroy bacteria
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.960]   and viruses in the air.
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.680]   That's that Pico technology.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.080]   It's really amazing.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:16.400]   Healthcare settings and independent testing, the Molecule air purifier was shown to reduce
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:22.000]   MS2 which is a COVID-2 proxy virus.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.680]   They obviously don't want to test it on the real virus so they use this MS2 and it was
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:31.680]   able to reduce concentrations by over 99.9% in an hour.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:37.360]   That's important for your health these days and you can see the study right there on the
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.960]   Molecule website and I highly recommend checking that out.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.800]   It's an extra layer of protection for your space.
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:48.960]   You still want to obviously wash your hands and social distance wear masks, but having
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:54.160]   that makes me feel a lot better.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.600]   Molecules technology and filtration systems have been tested and verified by independent
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:01.280]   third party labs for the whole home and beyond.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:06.600]   Molecule now offers breakthrough Pico technology across a broad range of products depending
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:07.600]   on your environment.
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.520]   Pick the unit that's best for your space.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:15.840]   You can also create a discounted bundle at Molecule.com to protect your entire home office,
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:19.960]   medical or dental practice or business against pollutants.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:23.280]   I'll tell you what, Lisa won't sleep without the Molecule on.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.160]   We know that and I kind of agree with her especially nowadays.

[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:06.440]   Apple has released the sixth version of the iOS 14 public beta.
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.160]   Every time one comes out, I think we're almost there.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.800]   We're almost there.
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.120]   There are some changes.
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:15.800]   Let's see.
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.800]   Encrypted AP.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.800]   I don't even know you had AP.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.040]   Do you have APFS on the iOS?
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.040]   APFS.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.520]   Oh, it was an iOS first.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.520]   Oh.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.920]   They did that thing where they rolled it out and they rolled it back quickly to see if
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:27.920]   it caused any damage.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.920]   Oh.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.560]   Then they waited and they tested it and they rolled it out to everybody.
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.560]   That's right.
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:33.560]   I remember now.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.240]   That just shows how well done.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.760]   It's because it's transparent.
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.760]   That's the new file system.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.560]   We've managed computing environment.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:40.560]   This is different though.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:44.840]   I believe when you attach files, when you use the files app and you attach external volumes,
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:47.080]   you can now read encrypted APFS volumes.
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:53.080]   You could have on iPad Pro, for instance, a USB encrypted, which you would want to on
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.280]   a portable device, encrypted APFS volume.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.360]   Plug that in and it will be able to read it in the files app.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:03.200]   Sometimes, if it was important data that you would not ever want anyone else to steal,
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:06.640]   you want to encrypt it, if it's important data that you never want to lose, like your
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.080]   wedding pictures or kids pictures, don't encrypt it.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.080]   Yes.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:13.280]   That's a different kind of protection.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.280]   Yeah.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.280]   Encryption is so that the-
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:18.040]   It's my channelling, David Nainian there for a second.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.960]   You don't want the NSA to get it or like that.
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.800]   Let me see if I have it.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.960]   No, I don't see it on my phone, but I presume it's coming.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.440]   I just downloaded and installed it.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:28.440]   Okay.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.440]   So they-
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.440]   Oh, use the public beta though.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.440]   I think this is developer beta.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:37.040]   No, apparently this is, yeah, iOS 14 public beta 6.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.040]   So this is-
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.040]   Okay.
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.400]   Yeah, the private version came out last week.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.400]   This is the-
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.400]   So I'm on the public.
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.400]   Okay.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.400]   You're on the private or the developer.
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.400]   The developer.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.400]   Yeah.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.400]   I don't yet see it.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.480]   The control center airplane mode indicator now reflects the current airplane mode status
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.480]   and settings.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.280]   I don't know why it didn't.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:00.080]   Control center now indicates phone is using the microphone for calls placed over the cellular
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.400]   network and over Wi-Fi networks.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.400]   These are little things.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.160]   The new time picker gets rid of-
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.160]   Oh.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.280]   Oh, look at this.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.560]   No more scrolling wheel.
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.120]   It's a-
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.120]   How does that work?
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.880]   Well, so they took away the scrolling wheel.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:21.200]   And I think because they're going to be running iPad and iOS and iPhone apps on the Mac and
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.280]   it would look weird and act weird.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.880]   But that was one of the most delightful interactions on iOS devices.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:30.520]   And now they've sort of made it look like the scrolling wheel, but it's still not.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.120]   And we know it's still not.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:35.360]   So this is like a half measure.
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:40.360]   But I didn't like it was the clock where the hands are going like this.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:43.160]   I couldn't ever get that to work for everyone.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.160]   Was that- Is that on iOS?
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.840]   I feel like that was on iOS.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.160]   Give me back the real to real from the original podcast.
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.160]   I like that.
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.160]   Yup.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.480]   Skeumorphism.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:55.840]   So if you are doing the public beta, and by the way, I've been doing it on both iOS and
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:00.280]   iPadOS without any problems since I think beta two.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.280]   So that's pretty-
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.280]   Does one hurt me?
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:03.280]   Did it?
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:07.160]   It messes up Instagram, which like for some people is not a problem at all.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.160]   Yes, it would have been.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.960]   Instagram is always wonky on the betas because they use a lot of their own.
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:13.760]   I used to think it was React Native, but I don't know what it is now.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:19.240]   But I can't- It's very hard to post stories from iOS 14 for me right now.
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.280]   I have to use an old phone.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:23.280]   Yup.
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.280]   iOS.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.280]   It's beta.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.920]   It's 14 privacy features.
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:33.080]   Getting better and better.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:37.840]   This is a piece from MacRumors talking about in aggregate all the new features you can
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:38.840]   expect.
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:41.080]   I expected iOS 14.
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:45.440]   We've mentioned before the recording light, the little green dot, letting you know that
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:50.640]   the camera, the microphone is on, is recording.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:57.880]   There is now password monitoring in Safari, including a password, compromised password
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.880]   alerts.
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:03.040]   So if there's been a breach of a site, you will know.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.720]   That's something that desktop browsers often do.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.640]   It's nice to have that in Safari.
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:10.520]   A privacy report from Safari.
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:15.320]   App Store also will have privacy reports.
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:18.800]   That's not yet, I think, on the App Store, but it's coming.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:23.640]   Each App page will provide a summary of the privacy practices of an app before you download
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:24.640]   it.
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.560]   Love that feature.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:29.600]   That's the one they called like a nutritional label for apps.
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.600]   Yes.
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:31.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.600]   App tracking controls.
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:36.120]   That's one of what Apple's doing, honestly, about privacy.
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:40.280]   It's one of the things I feel like if I'm going to use TikTok, for instance, I'm going
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:45.560]   to use it on an iPhone, not an Android phone, because I think that we really know a lot more
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.680]   about what's going on.
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.240]   Did you see yesterday it turned out that Zuckerberg was whispering about how dangerous
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.240]   the talk was?
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:54.240]   What a surprise.
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:59.240]   He was whispering it to the president.
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:02.720]   And you know how the president tends to be influenced by the people he talks to?
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:06.260]   And I think that's pretty much any competitive behavior.
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:07.260]   They can't buy it.
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:08.260]   They can't beat it.
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:10.480]   Well, there's one way, one way to beat it.
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:12.120]   Talk to the president.
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:13.120]   Wow.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.320]   Did you see the new Singapore Apple store?
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:20.000]   Now we were going to be in Singapore in January.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.720]   I'm so bummed that that trip is off because I would love to see this.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:24.720]   It's floating.
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:27.640]   It's a giant floating sphere.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.640]   Really?
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.720]   Or you would hit it like a baseball.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.160]   She would just walk up to it and hit it.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.480]   She has to touch everything.
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.960]   She can't look at something without touching.
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:34.960]   We know that.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.960]   It's true.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:36.960]   It's Apple Marina Bay Sands.
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:42.080]   It's the only Apple retail shop floating on water.
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.080]   It's actually the third one.
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.720]   The reason of doom.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.720]   That's wild.
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:48.920]   I think that I hear a little hot spot inspired.
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:50.720]   It looks like Epcot, doesn't it?
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.160]   Look at that with the skyline behind.
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.160]   That's beautiful.
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.120]   Or in my dumb little town.
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:57.360]   I want something fancy and cool.
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.840]   The new Sacramento Apple store is--
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:00.840]   Port of Montreal.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:01.840]   You know what?
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:02.840]   Port here.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:06.520]   It should be a custom railroad car.
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:07.520]   Yes.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:12.000]   That would be so cute.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   This is beautiful.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.720]   Look at it when the skyline is lit up.
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.360]   Oh, that is pretty.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.360]   Look at that.
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.520]   It just makes me sad because I was going to be there in January.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.520]   I'm so sad.
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.520]   I really--
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.520]   Oh, God.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:25.480]   We spend four or five days in Singapore next year.
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:28.000]   I'm so pleased that Apple has stuck to--
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.360]   remember when they first started opening Apple stores and they were mentioning about how
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.800]   certain ones are going to be architecturally significant.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:35.800]   And that seemed like--
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:39.000]   Well, it seemed as though they were going to be pleased enough to see if their stores
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.600]   are going to be still open five years from now.
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:45.240]   But they still just deliver it, like year after year after year, where yes, the mall
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:48.520]   stores, they're nice, but what can you do with the mall store?
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:52.080]   But every now and then, when they open the Chicago store, they don't just say, we're
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:56.680]   going to take our Cupertino design aesthetic and make-- and transplant to Chicago.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:02.200]   No, they decide what makes sense to the Chicago skyline or the Chicago neighborhood, what
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:05.560]   makes sense for Singapore, what makes sense for all these different cities.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:09.600]   It's always a treat whenever they see-- whenever we see like a brand new piece of architecture
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.160]   coming out of Apple.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.360]   Final Cut Pro 10 has now been updated.
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:17.000]   In fact, a lot of updates from Apple.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.040]   The iWork suite has also been updated.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.400]   Let's start with Final Cut Pro.
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:27.040]   They say significant-- this is the Apple press release-- significant workflow improvements,
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:28.600]   particularly for social media.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:35.040]   Oh, that sounds kind of sad that people would be using Final Cut for social media, but of
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.680]   course they are.
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:39.640]   I guess YouTube is social media, Renee, right?
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:40.640]   That's the same, right?
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.640]   Well, it was for Quirby.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.640]   They don't want to say it, but it's for Quirby.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:49.200]   Quirby, cats have reinforced them to add support, and they're just saying it's social media.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.480]   Automated tools for social media cropping.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:57.400]   So you could have a vertical video, for instance.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.240]   Oh, God, I don't know.
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.240]   It's really--
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:05.480]   It has a great video about it already because there's a lot of smart cropping.
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:13.400]   Yeah, so if you have seven different scenes, it'll actually find the subject matter and
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.400]   crop to it.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.400]   It is for Quirby.
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:20.680]   If the subject is to the left or if the subject is to the right, it'll crop according to that
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.680]   subject.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:22.680]   It is Quirby.
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:23.680]   It's kind of a neat little--
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:24.680]   Geez.
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:31.080]   Significant performance improvements with the metal-based plugins for Red Raw.
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.200]   Canvas, you'll be happy about this, Renee.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.000]   Canon Cinema Raw Lite.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:42.840]   8K Red Raw video to ProRes 422 is up to two times faster on a Mac Pro, up to three times
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:45.360]   faster on a MacBook Pro.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:50.640]   And for the first time, Final Cut Pro editors can play in it at 8K.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.280]   Canon Cinema Raw Lite.
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.480]   Are you going to be shooting everything in 8K an hour, Renee?
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:58.920]   No, I haven't bought an R5 yet, and I'm very hesitant to.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:02.640]   So unless-- unless and until the overheating issues get resolved.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.640]   Oh, that's a good problem.
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.640]   I'm admiring it from the distance.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.960]   Are you looking at the Sony A7S?
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:09.640]   Yes, but I don't have any Sony Glass.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:14.400]   Now, I wasn't going to bring it up, but Marquez and Dave May's both posted their first looks
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:19.440]   at the new Red affordable quote unquote.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:20.520]   It's like the Pro display.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:21.680]   It's 6K for 6K.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:24.360]   It's very simple and easy to remember.
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:28.920]   I'm blanking on the name of what it's called, but the new Red Consumer Camera, which looks
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:32.680]   fantastic too, and it has an RF mount and uses Canon batteries.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.800]   The Epic Dragon?
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:35.800]   Is that it?
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:36.960]   No, it's not the Epic Dragon.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.880]   It's the brand new one, and I'm blanking totally blank.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:43.120]   Marquez's latest video, but it looks like a box.
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:46.920]   It looks like either a Stormtrooper box, depending on the color, but it's a little square box
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:50.920]   that you plug everything into, and it's all consumer tech, nothing proprietary in the
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:54.080]   build out at all.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.280]   It looks like a really-- it's got red color.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:59.200]   It looks phenomenal, but you do have some trade-offs.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:02.800]   It's only SRI out, SDI out, sorry.
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:06.040]   It's no HDMI out, and a bunch of other things.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.520]   Is it a HRSA?
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:11.280]   This year has been the year for cameras.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.280]   It has.
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:17.920]   It's been an amazing year, but we knew this was coming because they've been slowly improving,
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:22.040]   improving, improving, and the price has been dropping, and dropping, and dropping.
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:29.240]   I think it's really somewhat driven by YouTube and social media by the new use of high quality.
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:33.840]   Credit to Marquez Brownlee, who really set a very high bar, and others have followed
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:37.680]   and realized that he's done very well by saying, "We're going to make the best."
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:38.680]   How much bigger market?
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:40.160]   Yeah, it's a bigger market than anybody knew.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.160]   People really care about the-- yeah.
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:43.320]   The fact that's only--
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:44.320]   It's the Komodo.
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:46.320]   It's the what?
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.480]   It's the Komodo.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.480]   The camera's called the-- the "Komodo."
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:50.480]   The Komodo.
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.480]   Yeah.
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:55.120]   It said, "Dragon successor, the Komodo."
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:59.920]   Mm, I'm not buying it.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:02.600]   Don't worry.
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:05.920]   We're still 720p and mighty proud of it.
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:06.920]   Yeah.
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:12.920]   I've been so tempted, particularly after seeing and reading, but Renee's been talking about
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:18.880]   building up his own studio that, "Wow, I should upgrade my cameras to something more
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:20.680]   like red quality."
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:25.200]   And Renee and other people on YouTube have inspired me to say, "Maybe I should start
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.200]   making videos."
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:29.640]   And unfortunately, the first step you think is, "Oh, I should get this camera.
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.320]   I should get this control deck," and really comes down to, "Perhaps you should start off
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:34.600]   by shooting with an iPhone."
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:38.000]   And once you have 20 videos, then you consider--
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.320]   It's the content--
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:42.480]   --the investment justifies the purchase of a six-dollar camera.
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.000]   But yeah, but it's very meaningful.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.840]   The fact that Sony has come up with a blogging variant of their RS100 camera and Canon is
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:55.560]   also just making-- not just cameras that have convenience features for bloggers, but
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:00.960]   things that they're willing to say, "Here are--" but we know how you-- how you vlog, we know
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:03.880]   how you do things inside your house, we know how you do things when you walk and talk and
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:08.680]   you're at a resort or whatever, and we're making stuff exactly for you.
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:15.680]   Again, not used to-- a lot of us grew up with-- and with this flip camera, you'll be able
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:20.680]   to take pictures of your friends and your family and not miss those moments growing up.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:27.160]   And now it really is, here is to support your business as a Twitch, YouTube, and other video
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.160]   streamer.
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.160]   Fascinating.
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:33.960]   Here's a day at the beach with the red Komodo test footage.
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:36.440]   I don't know why--
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.760]   God, salt water sand, salt water sand.
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:39.760]   It's a--
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.760]   Oh, no!
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:41.760]   --pance of camera.
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:42.760]   Oh, God.
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:47.080]   It's just-- if you want the red look used to cost you $60,000 and now it costs you $6,000
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.080]   is a big deal here.
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.080]   Yeah.
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.080]   Yeah.
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.480]   The surf museum at Santa Cruz, that's--
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.480]   Is it Santa Cruz?
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:55.080]   Yeah, it does look stunning.
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:56.080]   It looked familiar.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.080]   Yeah.
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:01.160]   It's Grommet Island Beach Park and Playground.
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.120]   And there is a puppy.
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.120]   Oh.
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.120]   Ah.
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.840]   So this is a particular look.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:07.840]   I've seen this a lot.
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:11.200]   It's kind of almost a soft look, isn't it?
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.200]   It's a little softer.
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.200]   Is that--
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.960]   Is that part of the feel?
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:19.200]   You'd expect with 6K to be hard-edged.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:20.200]   Crisp.
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.200]   What?
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:25.000]   I mean, like, Indie Mogul has some good footage up as well.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:31.400]   And it does give you-- so I think it's 6K down sample to 4K, but it depends what mode
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.920]   you're shooting in and what you set it to.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:34.920]   Yeah, probably what.
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:36.440]   I mean, I'm watching the 1080p.
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.800]   I should probably turn up the volume.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.840]   Oh, that doesn't matter.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.080]   I know, but you can see it anyway.
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.080]   We're at 720p.
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:48.000]   And mighty proud of it.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.840]   Actually, some of our equipment's starting to fail, and we're thinking about what we want
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.080]   to do going forward.
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:56.480]   Mostly what I want to do is not spend any money I don't have.
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.480]   Right.
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:58.480]   We made--
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:00.600]   Blackmagic Pocket 4K, Pocket 6K also excellent.
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:04.120]   We may be downgrading, not upgrading.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.120]   Good.
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:11.920]   That's the one that made my index finger twitch on the mouse saying, but we have that
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:12.920]   money.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:13.920]   We could spend that money.
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.640]   And we just pulled a play with it.
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:16.640]   My precious.
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:17.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:18.640]   Yes.
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.520]   And you make it before to Andy about wanting to make sure you put like 20 or 30 videos
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:23.800]   on the board before you.
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:28.440]   But having this kit inspire you to do more work.
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:29.920]   And Lizard Brant just threw it.
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:33.040]   It's reviewing that new Sony vlogger camera.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.040]   I don't know if that's up yet.
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:35.040]   Nice.
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.040]   On V20.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.040]   I forget what it's called.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:39.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:42.560]   He's got it in his hands, and he's been doing some amazing things with it.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:47.120]   That's the one that kind of tempts me because that's not expensive relatively.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:48.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.120]   But I know--
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.120]   And it's a practical camera.
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:56.560]   My problem is I lack the content to make it worth doing.
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:00.840]   Have they largely solved the problem of-- it seems like most of the ones that are pocketable
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:06.400]   and affordable, the element heats up way too much in 4K if you try to shoot more than
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:07.400]   five or 10 minutes.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.400]   Right.
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.400]   Is that still a problem or are they--
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.400]   I don't know.
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.400]   I think it's thinking of fan on them.
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:14.960]   But the reason it isn't-- it was a mandated thing for a while because they wanted to avoid
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:17.360]   taxes if you were a video camera.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.360]   You had to pay more taxes.
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.560]   So they artificially limited it.
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.760]   And then some of the sensors were getting too hot.
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:28.440]   Now it's a huge debate over Canon because is the R5 really overheating or is Canon artificially
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.440]   limiting it?
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:34.040]   Or they were too lazy to do the math and actually check the temperature and just wanted to
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:36.000]   be safe and put a limit on it.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.840]   But the Sony doesn't overheat and it's doing 4K easily.
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:45.280]   And the Canon doesn't overheat and regular 4K over heats and down sampled 4K and an 8K.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:49.280]   Yes, and it's review of the Sony ZV1 came out yesterday.
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.280]   Yeah.
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:51.280]   Twit.tv/HOT.
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:54.160]   He's doing such great stuff.
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.120]   I'm very-- this is very intriguing.
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:00.720]   This camera for vloggers and so forth we talked about.
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:04.760]   And it has a bokeh mode and bokeh often bokeh on and it has a product demo mode where it
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:08.360]   will change focus really fast so you can hold up your product shot.
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.360]   Yeah.
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:13.600]   Does it have a feature where it automatically mutes if you say hey guys?
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.600]   No.
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:15.600]   If only.
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:16.600]   If only.
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.840]   If only.
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:25.960]   So Apple has updated iMovie as well with some new filters to give videos.
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:26.960]   Hand-drawn looks.
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:30.960]   This is for the iPhone and the iPad not for Mac OS.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:33.440]   You can-- they've got a comic.
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:37.240]   Comic Mono which I presume is a comic look with the black and white.
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:38.240]   And Ink.
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.240]   Sounds neat.
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.480]   There's also 25 new soundtracks.
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:44.680]   You always need to update those regularly because we get tired of the same things over
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:45.680]   and over.
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:50.040]   Action, chill and sentimental soundtracks they automatically adjust to match the length
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:53.280]   of your movie.
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:56.720]   It addresses an issue that could prevent the viewer from updating after duplicating a photo
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.280]   on the timeline.
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:01.600]   It improves reliability of redo when editing a trailer and performance and stability
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:02.520]   improvements.
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:06.320]   On the Mac iMovie is added five new filters.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:12.280]   The comic comic Mono but also an ink but also comic vintage and comic sepia.
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:17.000]   And you can import movies from iOS projects.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.920]   So that's kind of cool.
[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:23.600]   Do people-- I feel like people should-- more people should be using iMovie.
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:27.880]   Like we-- because it's free and it comes with iOS and Mac OS we just kind of overlook it.
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:32.040]   And it's a darn fine product.
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:38.000]   It also hides away distractions from storytelling which I think is really important if you're
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.960]   just getting started in this thing.
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:44.640]   If you really need to start learning nonlinear editing and how to tell a story through video
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:48.840]   and audio and still pictures, you don't want to get distracted by, okay, well, how's my
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:53.440]   color rating and how's my after effects and how am I going to incorporate my titles.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:58.560]   I really think that people who start off trying to create something as impressive as what
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:04.120]   they're seeing in these big YouTube channels, they're doing themselves into service.
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:10.920]   It's 80% is just the simple, when to cut on action, pre-plan your shots, make sure that
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:13.920]   you've got the-- you're close enough to the action and all that sort of stuff.
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:16.120]   Yeah, yeah, I completely agree.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:20.560]   Oh, and also if your mouth is dry and you've got a good microphone, don't like get some
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:24.360]   water or go-- or don't go, well, I've got the new Sony--
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:26.560]   Oh, I hate that.
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:27.560]   Oh.
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:31.800]   I'm sorry, but I know you've worked really hard, but I had to turn you-- I was just
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.360]   doing this this morning where I was like, oh, this is such a great video, but I can't
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.960]   listen to this anymore.
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:37.960]   It's horrible.
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:41.040]   The L and J cuts where they start one sentence before completing the other sentence just
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:44.320]   because they're afraid of any dinner at all.
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:47.520]   Anyways, we get quibble all day.
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:50.880]   And whatever you're doing, kids, don't do like Uncle Leo does and eat lunch during
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:51.880]   the show.
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:57.520]   I have no word, but I have a lot of-- speaking of someone who's--
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:01.800]   last post was up in a YouTube five or six years ago, I have a lot of wisdom and advice
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:02.800]   and judgment.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:03.800]   Yeah, it's exactly.
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:04.800]   Share with people who--
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:05.800]   Exactly.
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:10.560]   --have learned in my many years of not posting to YouTube, I have really learned some important
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:13.280]   points I'd like to share with you.
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:16.400]   Yeah, I'm just going to watch you guys, you kids, you Renee Richie.
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:17.400]   You go ahead.
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:18.400]   You have fun.
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.200]   You're going to have fun.
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.640]   I'm going to stay here in old media, the podcast.
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:26.880]   Well, it was fun because I had a couple of people say, you know, you should really do
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:29.480]   much like more sedate, much calmer thumbnails.
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:32.880]   There's no reason to try and get any attention with your thumbnails.
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:37.160]   My response was, I could put my-- I could take down the coffee shop sign, I could move
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:41.720]   off from Main Street, I could put a new one behind the factory on the outskirts of town.
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:45.840]   I'm not going to sell any coffee that way.
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.800]   Your response was bam, bam, wow.
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:48.800]   Wow.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.840]   You know what we haven't talked about?
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.840]   Next, let's talk about the Mac.
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:54.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:55.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:03.960]   Renee, it looks like the second public beta of Big Sur is out.
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:06.200]   Should I have still not done it?
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:10.440]   I've had bad experiences installing betas of Mac OS.
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:14.040]   I've had bad experiences installing release versions of Mac OS.
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:15.040]   Well, that too.
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:18.160]   How about it running?
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.160]   You're using it, Lorrie?
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:24.080]   I've got it running on my MacBook Pro, and I have not had a single issue with it.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.080]   So, can't you do it?
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:31.040]   I always say, it doesn't matter that this version of it is running great, the next version
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:32.760]   might destroy your computer.
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:38.360]   So, if it's not your second computer, or if you're not partitioning or putting a separate
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:40.440]   volume and don't do it.
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:42.800]   But now, since the public didn't make any count--
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:46.880]   Well, and aren't they saying do not do the separate volume thing?
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:48.840]   That's like a bad idea now.
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:54.080]   That was in the developer beta one and two, but they fixed it and developed it in three.
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:55.080]   Oh, good.
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:58.520]   Yeah, and it was never a thing in the public beta.
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.880]   They had fixed it by the time that had happened.
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:06.080]   So, it is now officially something you can do, is separate a volume for.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:08.960]   So, it's been absolutely wonderful.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.960]   I haven't seen any issues whatsoever.
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:14.440]   I've had no slowdowns or any issues with apps not working or anything like that.
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:17.000]   So, it's pretty reliable and pretty solid right now.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.680]   I always figure by the second public beta, you probably, anything really, any showstoppers
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:23.680]   are gone.
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.680]   So, this is the second public beta.
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:26.680]   Sometimes.
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:27.680]   Sometimes.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:30.480]   No, there's always time for September surprise.
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:38.040]   I'm not committing myself, but I'm saying that I'm enthusiastic enough about the quality
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:43.160]   of Apple System software that I'm considering may be upgrading from Mojave on this main
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:44.160]   work machine that I use.
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:45.160]   Mojave.
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:46.160]   Holy cow.
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:47.160]   You're an old-time guy.
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:48.160]   Yeah, I know.
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:50.080]   First of all, Andy, just--
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:54.880]   Yeah, at first it was prudent and then I forgot that this was running an old version of the
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:55.880]   OS.
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:58.600]   And this today was actually the first time I tried to install something that said, "Oh,
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.600]   you're still running Mojave?
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:03.920]   Well, if you want, we can download for you the older version of this app."
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:10.360]   And now it feels-- I do feel confident that in terms of production, Macs, I really don't
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:15.480]   want anything to do with a new Mac OS release until a couple months have passed and we find
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:19.600]   out what's broken from it, mostly because of Gatekeeper.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:24.240]   The previous version of Catalina was extremely painful, like extremely-- PDK, which is the
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:28.760]   plug-in manager, kept taking over 100% of my CPU and then it was something else.
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:34.560]   This latest version has been fine, fingers crossed, but Catalina I think has been a far
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:40.560]   rougher road than I expected over the last year.
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:44.120]   So Big Sur, is it more than just a cosmetic update?
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:46.040]   It's definitely a big cosmetic update, are there--
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:51.280]   And it's more features that I'm going to go, "I really wish I had that."
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:52.280]   Probably not.
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:55.960]   I mean, it's less features, but it's more the foundation for the future.
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:59.400]   It's where they're going to be building the Apple Silicon Macs off of and it's going to
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:01.600]   have all of the stuff in there that you're--
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:03.600]   But I don't have a silicon.
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:04.600]   It's going to be less important if you don't run an Apple-- yeah.
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.600]   Yeah.
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:07.600]   I don't have Apple Silicon yet.
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:12.240]   I, for sure, when I get my new Apple Silicon 13-inch MacBook Pro, we'll be running Big Sur
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.240]   on it.
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:16.240]   But me emoji, Leo, you're going to finally have me emoji in messages.
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.240]   No, I don't care about that.
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:18.240]   I don't care about that.
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:19.240]   I love that.
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:20.240]   Oh, Leo.
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:21.240]   Oh, Leo.
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:23.480]   That is the 13-inch MacBook Pro, because that's the one I want it to be in too.
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:24.480]   Me too.
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.040]   So I'm on the same path.
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.960]   We are holding hands down Apple Silicon Road right now.
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:31.440]   And we should point out we have no idea that there are--
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:35.240]   There are thumb on-- and Louise, clipping your hands and gunning the gas pedal.
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:37.280]   Jumping off the cliff, together at last.
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:38.280]   Yes.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:39.280]   Good.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.280]   I'm glad you want that one too.
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:44.680]   I think that that's the one I would buy today if it were available, for sure.
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:47.080]   I don't know if I want to know I'm Mac.
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:53.080]   I think my Mac Pro is pretty good, but we had a nice powerful MacBook Pro.
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:57.080]   That would be nice, especially 13.
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.560]   You want a MacBook Air, don't you, Andy?
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:59.560]   I could tell.
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.920]   I could see it in your eyes.
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:04.120]   This could be an hour-long topic for me.
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:11.040]   I have been working out, not just not for a blog post, not for an article, like the landscape
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:14.560]   of all the hard birds that I feel is all I need for the office and how I want to distribute
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:15.720]   my money.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:20.120]   And it comes down to I want a desktop that's really, really, really powerful, so I will
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:24.520]   not have a problem recording or streaming 4K or doing Photoshop editing.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:28.360]   I want something that is going to help me be super, super portable.
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:32.440]   And that because Apple has pulled back a bit from the abyss and they seem to be interested
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:38.520]   in making MacBooks that I can use, that plus Apple Silicon is now making me edge towards
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:42.240]   definitely getting a MacBook Pro as opposed to last year thinking, "Eh, let's think
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:43.240]   about it."
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:48.960]   You're still the question of, "Do I necessarily want to get something that's a conventional
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:49.960]   notebook?
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:56.120]   Would I rather have a $1,000, like a really nice iPad Pro to do that?"
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:27:00.640]   Or, "Who knows next year what happens with the Surface Duo?
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:04.920]   It's absolutely not something that I'm willing to buy for $1,400 this year.
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:09.200]   But if the technology matures, I have to say that the idea of a dual screen-
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:10.200]   It's attractive, isn't it?
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:11.200]   Product everything.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:16.600]   Again, if I can remember back to the time when I was actually commuting to places and
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:23.280]   flying and taking trains to places, that would be an almost ideal setup for your basic,
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:25.960]   "I'm going to spend one night in New York and we're going to be coming back the next
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:26.960]   day.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.760]   I have to do a meeting or cover an event.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:34.000]   I would like to board the train with just a tiny bag with a change of socks and underwear
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.880]   and one computing device that can handle everything for 24 hours."
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:42.200]   Basically, the Duo is almost an ideal device for that.
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:44.120]   There's a lot to navigate.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:48.440]   I'm excited about how two years ago it would have been, "Oh, well, I'll have to buy one
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:49.840]   of these depending on the model.
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.960]   I'll have to buy one of these depending on the model."
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:58.120]   And now it really is more like here is a bucket full of money and a scoop, which how
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:01.640]   many scoops do you want to put into each of the things that you need to get?
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:02.640]   That's pretty exciting.
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:08.360]   Yeah.
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:13.680]   Good news, if you want to use virtualization on your new Silicon Mac, VMware Fusion 12
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:15.160]   has come out.
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:19.320]   I presume when they say we support Big Sur, that means we will support Apple Silicon,
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:21.440]   I hope, I don't know.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:28.600]   It also supports eGPUs, which I think is really interesting.
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:32.240]   We have the original Mac Blackmagic eGPU.
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.120]   My son's using it because he's doing a lot of final cut editing.
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:37.120]   It works pretty well.
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:44.640]   He's got a 15-inch MacBook Pro with eGPU, and that works pretty well for final cut.
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:49.560]   I presume it would be smart to wait until Apple Silicon comes out before looking into
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:52.520]   the GPU.
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:54.480]   What will an eGPU be with Apple Silicon?
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.200]   Will it be Apple GPU?
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:58.920]   It's not going to be in Zidia.
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:00.880]   It's not going to be in the radar card.
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:02.480]   Yeah, it's going to be something Apple.
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:04.400]   It could be like the Afterburner card.
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:10.360]   Either they'll do a partnership with AMD where they make something like the special
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:17.120]   fabric connector that just creates this monstrous GPU that you can plug into and metal and
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:22.280]   the performance controller just arbitrarily, not arbitrarily dispatch appropriate tasks
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:25.360]   to that thing.
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:28.240]   I would love it, and I don't want to get anyone's hopes up, but you have a modular
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:31.440]   Mac Pro that they built for very specific reasons, and it'd be great if they figured
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:35.040]   out a way to have an analog for that on mobile.
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:39.960]   You could have a MacBook Pro 16-inch that had a reprogrammable ASIC on it, but if you
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:42.720]   do a lot of final cut Pro, that could be your Afterburner Excel.
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:47.240]   You could have an Afterburner MacBook Pro or whatever the logic of the equivalent is.
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:48.240]   Ooh.
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:51.920]   Well, hardware because it would have the ASIC card, but then the ASIC card can be reprogrammed.
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:52.920]   But it's programmable.
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:55.520]   Yeah, so it's reprogrammed.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:59.160]   I like the GPU because it was a dock.
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:04.640]   It was actually a nice thing for a laptop because it was a dock as well as an GPU, so
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:08.600]   you could carry your laptop around, but when you sat down at your desk and plugged it in,
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:12.560]   now you had all those benefits plus a pretty...
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:13.840]   I mean, it wasn't small.
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:17.200]   You wouldn't want to travel with it.
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:22.520]   Carrying a fire starter with you or something, but it did...
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:26.920]   Yeah, they also wasn't the greatest GPU.
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:27.920]   That's why I'd be very interested in Apple.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.560]   Game views come so far.
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:30.560]   Yeah.
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:33.160]   Their next generation stuff is going to be...
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:35.560]   The big Navi is going to be, I think, really, really competitive.
[01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:38.920]   It's going to have Ray Tracing and all that stuff.
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:43.080]   They don't have the budget that NVIDIA has, so they had to invest the money that they
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:45.760]   did have into being competitive with CPUs.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:49.480]   We saw that with Threadripper and Ryzen and all of that, and now they're putting that
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:55.160]   budget into GPUs, and Navi was really good, but Navi 2 is supposed to be really, really
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:56.160]   good.
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:59.560]   So I'm really intrigued the idea that the VMware Fusion will work with Apple Silicon
[01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:01.360]   and EGPU.
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:05.440]   Might it be a way to play PC games on a Mac?
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:07.960]   Might it actually be fast enough to do that?
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:08.960]   Typically...
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:09.960]   They're going to do it in Silicon.
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:12.040]   Like, they're going to put Silicon accelerators.
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:16.360]   I believe they announced that they're going to specifically build a Silicon to make hypervisor
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:19.440]   run faster than it has any right to run, which will be interesting.
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.440]   Which means you could...
[01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:21.440]   It'll be...
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:25.200]   That's why you wouldn't need boot camp, because the main reason you do boot camp is so you
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:26.280]   have native performance.
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:32.560]   You'd have near native or native performance in virtualization who needs boot camp.
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:37.720]   In fact, now presume VMware Fusion still works like this with coherence mode, you could
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:42.760]   have your PC game running as just like it's a standalone app without leaving back OS
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:43.760]   at all.
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:46.160]   They demoed that at WWDC.
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:47.160]   They had the apps just superimple.
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:48.160]   They had Linux.
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:49.160]   That's right.
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:50.160]   That's right.
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:51.160]   Who has the desktop?
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:52.160]   Oh man.
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:56.760]   Could be Gamer Nirvana coming our way.
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:01.120]   Graphics performance is one of the top few things that I'm looking forward to for Apple
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:02.120]   Silicon.
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:09.000]   The ability to put it all on the same pile of sand is pretty exciting about how well
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.280]   Apple could tune this.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:13.920]   Not for people who are necessarily interested in external GPUs, but I'm just talking about
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:19.080]   the basic core graphics acceleration you get for free with every single Mac.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:22.080]   A couple of acquisitions Apple has made.
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:25.040]   One last year that we just learned about and one recently.
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:32.440]   This space is, I think we feel like we had them, the original spaces on the new screensavers
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:34.720]   or something like it.
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:40.320]   Originally, the idea was it was a social network.
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:45.400]   Then they were funded by DreamWorks.
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:50.720]   They also did location based VR spaces.
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:57.000]   The spaces in Southern California where you could play Terminator Salvation.
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.240]   That was in Orange County.
[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:06.080]   Apparently, thanks to the pandemic, nobody wants to go in a blank box room with other
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:08.480]   people and run around like crazy.
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:12.360]   They pivoted to what's the hot thing right now?
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:14.560]   Zoom style spaces.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:20.520]   I don't know how good that pivot was, but it did get Apple to buy them.
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:25.440]   We don't know what Apple plans to do because they don't tell anybody, but they seem to
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:28.360]   have acquired it.
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:32.240]   I doubt they're going to use the VR rooms, but I don't know.
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:38.440]   This is all part of Apple's continuing acquisitions to boost their AR, I think.
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:43.140]   We found out that last year they acquired an Israeli company called CameraAI or Camera
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:48.480]   Eye, Camera AI.
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:52.320]   They developed cross-platform AR graphics.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:57.360]   A cross-platform AR graphics application is really company.
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:02.120]   They bought it last year, but nobody knew it was a secret.
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:07.360]   They're clearly working on something having to do with AR.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:11.240]   I need to say, they're just trying to really improve their Memoji game.
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:13.520]   That's what this whole thing is about.
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.000]   Oh my god, but you're right.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000]   It probably is.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.840]   It probably is all about Memoji.
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:19.840]   We want to get Leo to use the new messages on Mac.
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.400]   They're going to have to opt out there.
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:22.400]   Clearly.
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:24.120]   Clearly.
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:27.440]   We announced the Apple New Apple radio stations last week.
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:28.400]   Yeah, I think we talked about that.
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.400]   We talked about that.
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:30.400]   All right.
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:32.400]   We don't have to say anything about that that's already happened.
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:33.400]   It's in country.
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:34.400]   Apple.
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:39.520]   I will say I've been listening to Apple radio or Apple music a lot more now just because
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:43.200]   they have three stations and gave me some opportunities.
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:45.840]   Do you like it?
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:50.160]   It's still not Nisha enough for me, but I did discover there's Uncle Snoop's radio, which
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:55.600]   is Snoop Dogg doing some throwback stuff from 80s and 90s.
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:57.960]   That's kind of fun.
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:34:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:02.840]   Boy.
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:10.720]   Apple TV plus ink steel for adaptation with Keira Knightley called the Essex serpent.
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:12.360]   It's a Sarah Perry novel.
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:13.640]   I'm not familiar with.
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:15.640]   She will also care about nightly.
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:20.000]   We'll also executive produce set in 1893.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.360]   The Essex serpent will follow the newly widowed Cora.
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:28.680]   Play back here and nightly recently released from an abusive marriage.
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:34.000]   She relocates from Victorian London to a small village in Aldewinter intrigued by the superstition
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:40.560]   of a mythical creature known as the Essex serpent book of the year.
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:45.840]   According to the British book awards in 2016.
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:48.360]   I'm not familiar with it, but more Apple TV original content.
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:50.680]   I don't even know if are they shooting it?
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:51.960]   Is it shot?
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:52.960]   Will they shoot?
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:54.440]   I don't know.
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:56.800]   Shot first.
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:58.800]   We don't know.
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:01.800]   That's a good way to get us into our four.
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:02.800]   Yeah.
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.800]   Don't you dare stop.
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:12.960]   They just announced that famed writer and Mac app developer John August and Ryan Reynolds
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:13.960]   are doing a new show.
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:14.960]   I believe for Netflix.
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:15.960]   Oh, cool.
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:19.040]   He makes Highland for the Mac a really well known script writing program.
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:20.040]   Oh, neat.
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:22.680]   That Ryan Reynolds, he's got a lot of energy.
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:25.040]   He is not letting the pandemic slow him down.
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:26.040]   No, Canadian.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:29.680]   Come on, there you go.
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:36.400]   I actually am not sure, but I think I got bit by the Lightroom iOS app update.
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:41.160]   I'm pretty sure I had pictures stored in my Lightroom on my iPad.
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:43.440]   I don't think I had any presets, but I'm pretty sure I had pictures.
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.360]   There's no pictures there now.
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:52.520]   So fortunately, they were not the only copies, but I hope that you had backups because Adobe
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:59.440]   offered an update to version 5.4, which wiped out all images and presets that were not
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:00.840]   synced to the cloud.
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:04.760]   And Adobe has said there is no way to get them back.
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:09.040]   So just a reminder that you should never store anything anywhere that you don't have
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:12.720]   backups of somewhere else, obviously.
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:17.160]   But it is the iPad is such a tempting device for users.
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:21.920]   What I've been doing with most of my cameras will do this by doing with my Leica is there's
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:24.240]   a Leica photos app on the iPad.
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:26.480]   You turn on the phone, it connects via Wi-Fi.
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:31.400]   You don't have to do any hard wiring, copies of the raw image over.
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:35.120]   It doesn't unfortunately copy your right to Lightroom, copies of it to photos, but then
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:36.600]   you can import it in the Lightroom.
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:37.800]   But that's the good news.
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:38.800]   It's still in photos.
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:39.800]   Edit in Lightroom.
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:42.880]   It's a very easy workflow, very nice workflow.
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:47.760]   I think Lightroom, I think Lightroom might now take direct copies, which would be part
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:49.760]   of the problem.
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:52.880]   Anyway, I don't update if you haven't.
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:59.000]   The next version, 5.4.1, prevents this from infecting additional customers, but does not
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.120]   fix the problem for those who got hit.
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:03.120]   Yeah.
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:08.840]   It bears remembering that backup is not about, "Hey, I've got a second copy of this somewhere."
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:11.800]   Or worse, it doesn't mean that, "Oh, I've got it in the cloud.
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:12.800]   It must be safe."
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:16.640]   It means that you have multiple copies and multiple locations on multiple media.
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:22.520]   So having your photos up on iCloud is fine, so long as you also have a copy that's safe
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:28.280]   locally and a copy on a piece of digital media that you've actually stored offsite.
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:32.520]   So yeah, that's heartbreaking when you start to think that, again, I've sometimes gotten
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:37.280]   to the trap of just saving things to my Dropbox, forgetting that, "Well, again, Dropbox can
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:42.200]   screw up as not as easily or as profoundly as I can, but when they do screw up, that would
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:44.200]   be very bad."
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:47.440]   Carson wants us all, maybe if I can log in, could I play this?
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:49.280]   Carson, maybe I'll just play it from the tweet.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:50.440]   That would be safer.
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:55.440]   Carson wants us all to know that if you search for on your Disney, if you're Disney Plus
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:00.640]   subscriber, if you search for it, of course you are because of the Mandalorian, which
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:03.600]   I have not watched as I confess.
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:06.920]   Search for the Mascotiers at Walt Disney World.
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:11.000]   It's apparently digitized from an OV&Jest recording.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:19.400]   It's a 1977 special and they didn't even remove the advertising.
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:25.600]   So analog glitches and weird 70 commercials, 70s commercials, including for Shakenbake.
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:27.120]   Oh, Shakenbake.
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:33.440]   I will now reveal we had Shakenbake chicken just yesterday and it's just as good as it
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:34.440]   was in 1977.
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:37.800]   Did you have Rice or Roney with it?
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:41.440]   As a matter of fact, we did.
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.080]   Because the services go treat.
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:45.760]   Those two ads are like back to back in my mind.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:49.080]   We're living in the 70s.
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:54.480]   A total disclosure here, Lisa and her son had that.
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:57.400]   I refused to touch it.
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:59.800]   I made my own coconut curry chicken.
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:04.640]   Thank you very much on brown rice, neither of which they would eat.
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:06.360]   So we worked it out.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:07.360]   We worked it out.
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:11.760]   Shakenbake, I curried coconut.
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:12.760]   Tim Cook is donated five.
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:16.480]   If you could smell, it was asking if they could put the Star Wars Christmas special up
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:18.480]   on Disney+ in the exact same way.
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:20.240]   Oh, that would be so fun.
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:21.600]   Cut your feet off of VHS.
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.040]   Oh, I would subscribe to Disney+ for that.
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:25.840]   I'm already a superstar.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:27.720]   But I would, seriously.
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:30.080]   You can't watch the Star Wars Christmas special, right?
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:32.320]   George Lucas Prohibited that.
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:33.320]   As far as I know.
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:34.320]   It's not available.
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:37.320]   It's not available streaming anywhere, but I have my own copy of it.
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:38.320]   You have a copy?
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:39.320]   I have a copy of every Christmas.
[01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:40.320]   You have every Christmas.
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:44.280]   Oh, it's out there, man.
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:47.480]   You can't stop Star Wars fandom.
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:54.280]   I have a, when you're talking about the despecialized editions of the original trilogy, it's like,
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:41:01.080]   I was just watching a note about how upscaling, 4K upscaling of the original trilogy is going
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:06.920]   on and how well it's happening just from fan productions where you can see it much better
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:08.720]   than the original production.
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:12.760]   I think I might have watched that same, it was like a documentary about somebody who is
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:14.280]   working on it, right?
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:15.280]   Right, right.
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:20.400]   Where they're doing it by saying we've got like multiple 35 millimeter prints and by
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:26.800]   essentially doing the same techniques you would use when you're stacking images in Photoshop,
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:32.200]   essentially by stacking like five copies of these prints on top of each other, any scratches,
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:35.640]   that's anything that's missing from one frame and one print, it's kind of that detail is
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:39.680]   going to be there and another print and you're also removing all the grain and it's like,
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:41.320]   oh my freaking God.
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:45.520]   So like when I would Disney, I would give you a hundred dollars for each of these movies,
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:50.160]   but I'm sorry that I'm being forced to download it illegally, but oh well.
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:55.360]   Unfortunately, it looks like the version on YouTube does not have the ads in it because
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:58.920]   that would make it so much fun.
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:01.360]   Tell me what to have for dinner tomorrow.
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:02.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:03.360]   So what was the story?
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:04.360]   Yeah, what right?
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:09.160]   I think it's going to be, it's going to be those hot dogs wrapped in bacon.
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:10.960]   What do they call those pigs in a blanket?
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:13.520]   So what was the story of this?
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:18.920]   This was live action shot with some of Christmas-y kind of feel to it.
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:22.920]   It was, it was, it was, are you going to fight over who's going to tell the story?
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:25.200]   I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll start.
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:26.200]   You, you pick it up.
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:30.320]   I'll, I'll, I'll say the funniest part of it is that they, it wasn't obviously wasn't
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:35.160]   a Lucasfilm like sort of thing, they subcontracted, Sid and Marty Croft.
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:39.840]   The ones who make those really terrible like Saturday morning, like, you know, lidsville
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:41.640]   cartoons to do it.
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:45.680]   So the production quality is like absolutely low to the basement.
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:46.680]   Yeah.
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:47.680]   Yeah.
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:52.840]   And, and, and now I turn the, I turn the, the podium over to my friend and colleague for,
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:55.840]   for the actual storyline, which is even more improbable.
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:58.760]   So it's, it's the story of Chewbacca's family.
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:01.560]   Is that our carney of TVs, the honeymooners?
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:02.560]   Yes.
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:03.560]   Oh, geez.
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:08.080]   And that's, that's grandpa right there who is about to go into a virtual reality machine.
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:14.200]   And Frankly, it's a little bit of a stay when you think about what he's doing and what
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:15.200]   he's watching.
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:17.240]   And that's really not quite a wookie.
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:19.320]   It's more like a Sid and Marty Croft wookie.
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:20.320]   Right.
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:24.640]   And so it's, yeah, it's the story of Chewbacca's family waiting him to, for him to come home
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:35.200]   for life day and they get some, some imperial soldiers coming in to harass them and Chewie
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:40.960]   and, and Han are kind of on their own adventure trying to get him to his family in time.
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:43.720]   And it's just a bunch of like little things that appear.
[01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:46.080]   There's a lot of some B. Arthur's is in it.
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.080]   And it's really incredible.
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:48.080]   And he's an incredible.
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:49.080]   And he's an incredible.
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:50.080]   And he's an incredible.
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:51.080]   Oh my God.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:53.080]   Yeah.
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:55.360]   I love watching it.
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:56.360]   It's for you.
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.280]   It represents Christmas, right?
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:00.080]   Well, also, okay.
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:04.640]   For, can I, can I just say that for me, it represents like this, the depression of Christmas
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:08.840]   because I remember specifically, I was a little, little kid at the time, but I still
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:09.840]   remember clearly.
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:14.480]   Now remember that this is like at a time where you don't have, you don't have Star Wars
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:16.720]   on video, you don't have access to it.
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:20.760]   It's so this is like the first time I'm going to see anything new Star Wars in years.
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:23.080]   And I'm looking forward to it.
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:28.200]   And it was, and I remember specifically that my family had to go out to go to some sort
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:30.640]   of a family Christmas party or something.
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:32.720]   And I missed the entire damn thing.
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:36.680]   And I was so upset until I was in my twenties and I bought a copy at a comic con.
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:38.560]   I realized that, oh, I really wasn't missing anything.
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:39.560]   You missed anything.
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:44.000]   In fact, it might have ruined your, your, your, but it is, it's a, it's a wonderful artifact
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.440]   because they act, they got the original costumes.
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:50.280]   So you see the original costume, like original stormtrooper costumes, original like Imperial
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:54.840]   officer costumes, but it's in the middle of this really tacky like video production.
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:45:00.720]   You see Han Solo and Choo and Chewy like in their original costumes, but now they're in
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:04.960]   like a very cheap made for TV version of the Millennium Falcon cockpit.
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:10.520]   It's like made out of like plywood and like it really is something.
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:11.520]   Oh man.
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:15.480]   This is also the first appearance of Boba Fett because this came out before.
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:20.480]   A part of the Jedi.
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:22.680]   So Lucas had something to do with it, right?
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:25.800]   He had something to do with it, but he wasn't.
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:28.680]   It was more like he just gave them the go ahead to do it.
[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:29.680]   He didn't.
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:30.680]   There's mod.
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:31.680]   It mod is in it.
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:32.680]   Yeah.
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:33.680]   At the bartender at the cantina.
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:34.680]   Yeah.
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:35.680]   Yeah.
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:36.680]   Yeah.
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:37.680]   She does this great song at the end.
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:38.680]   Oh my God.
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:39.680]   Well, it's all on YouTube.
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:44.520]   So, and this is Harvey Korman in drag and a really, really huge padded like dress with
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:49.520]   enormous like bosoms and doing this Jewish sort of and now here's how you do it.
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:55.200]   It says like, oh goodness, they just, this was not a high quality production.
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:59.040]   I don't think it was a high quality production at all.
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:01.800]   I suspect.
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:06.520]   It is as cheesy as only 70s television could be.
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:07.520]   Yeah.
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:08.520]   All right.
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:09.520]   I don't know why we got under that.
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:15.640]   You're originally talking about Disney plus and I can't stop watching.
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:16.640]   I cannot stop.
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:18.440]   Again, you can't look away.
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:20.440]   You can't look away.
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:22.280]   It's just, it's just too good.
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:23.280]   All right.
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:28.080]   So, watch the 1977 Mascotir special for the ads.
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:31.560]   You'll have to go somewhere else to watch the rest of it.
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:33.680]   When we come back, let's take a little break.
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:37.360]   When we come back, folks, I want to get your picks of the week.
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:38.920]   So prepare them.
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:42.680]   Dip them up.
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:48.040]   In fact, I shall kick off the picks of the week because I forgot to mention this earlier.
[01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:53.600]   But I am a big fan of the screen savers on the Apple TV.
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.280]   It just, they're so great.
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:57.720]   The slow motion drone shots.
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:59.400]   Now they've got underwater shots.
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:02.840]   And for years, I've been using Ariel on the Macintosh.
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:08.240]   It actually is available on Windows as well to, and Apple seems to have never turned off,
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:09.920]   never stopped this guy from doing this.
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:14.880]   It's a third-party developer, Rodin App, that would put those screen savers on your Mac.
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:16.280]   He just updated it.
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:17.680]   It's a 2.0.
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:19.480]   And it's, this is wonderful.
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:23.000]   John Coates created this.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:27.880]   And then Guillaume Luel has done a version 2.0 for Mac users.
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:34.080]   So if you don't yet have the Ariel screen saver, there's a lot more control, a lot more information.
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:38.440]   And the beauty part of it is it actually pulls the video from Apple's servers.
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:41.720]   So that's why I'm always amazed Apple doesn't, doesn't block this.
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:47.680]   The update brings 20 new screen savers donated by a professional artist.
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:50.720]   So they're not even from Apple.
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:52.720]   And so there's two ways to get it.
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:54.480]   You could check it out on GitHub.
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:57.760]   Just search for A-E-R-I-A-L.
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:47:59.560]   Works with Mavericks and later.
[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:03.960]   Although some features require Sierra or later and it's free.
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:09.080]   You can use it as a dedicated, as an individual screen saver or you can download a dedicated
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:11.040]   app which will install.
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:14.520]   And I'd be sure to install that at the minute I get home because it's my favorite screen
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.520]   saver on the Mac.
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:19.320]   Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:23.040]   So I'm picking Final Cut Pro above and beyond this update because I want to just give it
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:24.520]   a little bit more attention.
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:26.960]   I don't think we've talked about it for a while.
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:31.040]   But I was an old school, like I learned to edit on a video toaster, I think.
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:34.680]   And I was doing very traditional, even though it was computer editing.
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:36.120]   It was very traditional.
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:41.680]   And I remember we were doing a big show in New York City in 2013.
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:48.040]   And our editor had left and we shot a three camera podcast with Luria Petrucci and myself
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:49.640]   and the other editors.
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:50.960]   And there was no one to edit it.
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:53.360]   And my boss at the time, Kevin, said, "Well, you know how to edit.
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:54.760]   You can do it."
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:57.200]   And I got on the phone with the editor.
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:59.120]   He goes, "Oh, you're Final Cut Pro.
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:00.120]   That's easy.
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:05.760]   Put the clips in there, right click and make multi-cam edit and then just go through and
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:09.120]   press a one, two and three keys and it'll do all the cuts for you."
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:10.840]   And it took them like five minutes of explanation.
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:14.880]   It took me about 30 minutes of editing and we had the video posted.
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:18.680]   And like Scotty from Star Trek, they thought it was a miracle worker.
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:24.040]   And it was just really that when Randy Ublos rethought what a near-line editor should be
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:25.240]   for the modern times.
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:29.120]   I know it upsets so many people who were used to the traditional Final Cut, who were used
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:32.440]   to Adobe Premiere, who were used to Avid.
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:33.920]   All of that stuff had upset them.
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:40.280]   But everything from magnetic timeline to things like multi-cut, they saved so much time rendering
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:43.880]   while you're editing, background rendering, all of these things.
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:49.280]   And just like Adobe is adding GPU enhancements this year and Final Cut has been doing it
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:52.280]   for years and they have advantage in Apple's ecosystem.
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:54.120]   They can access all this stuff.
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:50:00.120]   And if you have Mac hardware, it is so fast and I'm not talking about benchmark scores,
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:04.520]   I'm talking about time to completed work, which I think is the only real metric that
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:05.520]   matters.
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:10.240]   I can ingest footage and I can export a final video so fast.
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:13.920]   And this latest version, it does things like it has crossfading, which you don't have to
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:16.840]   do tediously, clip by clip anymore.
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:20.480]   And it's using, like Laurie said earlier, it's using machine learning to help pick where
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:22.080]   it centers footage.
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:25.240]   And it'll also let you mask things if you want to edit for like, I do everything in
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:29.040]   two by one aspect ratio, not 16 by nine.
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:30.800]   And it was just a bit of a chore.
[01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:33.760]   And now it just handles that kind of stuff.
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:35.960]   So it is expensive in the modern era.
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:40.320]   The previous version of Final Cut Pro was like 1200 bucks.
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:43.160]   Adobe is mostly still a subscription.
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:46.520]   Divisionally resolve, which is brilliant, is either free or pretty expensive depending
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:48.200]   on which one you take.
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:52.720]   But for a few hundred bucks, Apple has been updating this for free every year going on
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:54.280]   10 years.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:51:00.960]   And again, if you edit on a Mac, it is just such good, fast, clean, smart software with
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:06.480]   a really great array of features that let you produce really good videos really fast.
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:11.600]   I recommend it as a next step up once you've exhausted iMovie because just so much carries
[01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:15.800]   over, which is a really nice thing about it.
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:21.560]   And let me follow up for Renee's sake that if you took the 90 day free trial last time
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:25.480]   Final Cut Pro was updated, you can get a new 90 day free trial.
[01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:28.000]   So you can get another 90 days of it.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:33.520]   So you can try it again for another three months if you want to give it a try.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:38.440]   So has it overcome the hit it took when they went back to the drawing board?
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:42.640]   Is it back now to everything it was before that?
[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:43.800]   It's different.
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:47.600]   So there are people who just want some, like some people just really hate the magnetic
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:48.600]   timeline.
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:53.040]   And I would argue that if you put a role or voice over the magnetic timeline, it'll save
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:57.360]   you a ton of work and then just edit the role traditionally on top of the main timeline.
[01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:02.120]   But it's little things like that that I think still grieve some people or just they're used
[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:06.400]   to the or like after effects is just something they need and they figure if they have after
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:09.400]   effects, they might as well use premiere.
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:11.240]   And some people just love the way DaVinci does.
[01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:16.520]   But I would be hard pressed to find somebody who wasn't just I'm used to the old version.
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:17.960]   I don't like the change.
[01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:21.760]   I think feature for feature it's well beyond where it used to be now.
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:22.760]   Good.
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:28.200]   Yeah, we that was the end of the line for us because it had a key feature taken out that
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:31.120]   we couldn't work without.
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:36.280]   And so we went to Windows and Adobe Premiere and we are our editors are still using Windows
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:38.680]   7 on Adobe Premiere I think.
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:44.200]   I feel bad for him, but we had to make that change and unless Adobe Premiere suddenly
[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:48.520]   takes out a feature we have to have, I don't see any reason to move again.
[01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:49.520]   They're all good.
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:51.400]   They have content to wear fill for video now on Adobe.
[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:53.080]   I mean, they're all just killing it these days.
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:54.800]   We don't truthfully.
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:56.280]   They don't.
[01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:58.560]   The editing on this show is not real editing.
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:01.200]   You know, they take the show.
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:06.440]   They cut out anything that like swear words, they put something at the beginning and slap
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:08.480]   something at the end and push it out.
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:11.400]   It's not like we have anything fancy going on.
[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:15.260]   So almost anything would do it was the one feature we needed was the ability to use a
[01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:18.920]   storage area network of sand drive and that was at the time we don't do it anymore.
[01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:20.080]   But that was how we did it.
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:21.080]   They added a bunch of that.
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:23.760]   The funny thing is Daniel Pasco, I mean, because a lot of people were complaining that
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:27.280]   our five footage because it uses an H.265 codec.
[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:32.880]   It was just wrecking their Macs and wrecking their PCs and Daniel Pasco posted it on the
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:38.080]   iPad using Luma Fusion just flying through it, which again is making me just just cannot
[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:42.160]   wait for Apple Silicon to be able to do things like that.
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:49.000]   I love seeing up and comers say, hey, well, guess what?
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.000]   Hold my beer.
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.000]   Watch this.
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000]   Yeah.
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000]   Good.
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.000]   I love that.
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000]   That's competition is the best.
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.520]   Andy, your pick of the week is in French.
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:00.400]   That's why I thought it was originally going to be Renee's.
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:01.400]   I have been pronouncing.
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:04.520]   I have been practicing this word because I know that I'm going to be pronouncing a French
[01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:05.880]   word in front of Renee.
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:06.880]   It's called finet.
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:07.880]   Very good.
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:10.880]   I thought that was how close the French word for windows.
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:11.880]   My good.
[01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:14.080]   So there's a real natural lead to that.
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:15.080]   That's good.
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:16.160]   Yeah, that's close enough.
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:17.160]   Yeah.
[01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:19.680]   It has the E has a little hat on it.
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:22.160]   So I had to have a certain.
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:23.160]   Circumstance.
[01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:24.160]   Yes.
[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:29.560]   It's a really cool simple little utility menu bar utility where if you drag a URL into
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:34.800]   it, it will open that webpage in a proper Mac OS floating window.
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:40.480]   So if you are, it's not something I need every single day, but there are a lot of times where
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:45.400]   I'm trying to, I'm trying to follow like a procedure for here's how to, here's the command
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:48.840]   line mojo in order to configure this on your Mac.
[01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:52.520]   And the thing is I've got lots of tool windows open and the instructions need to be on the
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:54.040]   top at all times.
[01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:59.000]   There are times where I'm taking notes on like a long, long document that I'm reading
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.880]   online and there's sometimes where there's a streaming site that doesn't offer picture
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:07.000]   and picture and this will solve that problem very, very nicely.
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:14.360]   Now the only things I wish that it could do is that it's, it doesn't Google Docs doesn't
[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:16.080]   work nicely with it.
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:20.120]   When you try to drag like a Google Docs window onto it, Google says, Oh, this might not be
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:21.120]   a secure browser.
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:25.040]   I don't think I should let you run it inside this browser, which is a bummer because one
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:29.040]   of the things I was really hoping for is that's why I could, if I'm working on a Google Doc
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:33.680]   or like a spreadsheet or something like that, I could have that on top, at the top window
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:36.520]   on my entire workspace while I'm doing other things.
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:41.120]   Bummer there, but it's still useful enough just as a way to keep a, keep a website window
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:43.960]   open on top of everything else that's worthwhile.
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:48.600]   Now the documentation also says that it can do documents as well.
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:52.760]   I've never gotten that to work properly, which would be another bummer because it would be,
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:53.760]   I do like it.
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:57.760]   There's a free version that I, I liked it enough that I bought the $8 pro version with
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:00.160]   a few extra like enhancements to it.
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:03.440]   But I would have been twice as eager to buy the pro version.
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:07.240]   If it will allow me to simply say here is a BB edit window or here is a Microsoft Word
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:10.320]   window or whatever, I want this is, this is what I'm working on.
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:15.440]   I want this to never be covered up by any other window at any time where if, if it's,
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:19.560]   if I'm accidentally covering up something I need, I want the problem to be I need to
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:23.800]   move that, or the window, not I need to move the window that I'm typing in all the time.
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:29.400]   But as is, it's one of those simple utilities does one thing, does it reasonably well and
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:32.640]   there are a couple of other solutions that are kind of like it, but none of them work
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:33.640]   quite as well.
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:34.640]   So I dig up.
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:38.600]   So is this, I didn't think that this was a problem.
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:43.760]   So I mean, you can't just resize a window and leave it.
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:45.560]   Well see that's the, that's the problem.
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:51.480]   As I'm, as I'm tapping between like a, again, imagine that I'm, that I'm in the terminal.
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:55.520]   I'm also, I'm trying to solve a problem with my, with my hard drive and I've got a terminal
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:56.520]   window open.
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:58.600]   I've got, I've got disc utilities open.
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:00.040]   I've got some other things open.
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:03.600]   As I keep tapping from one place to another, the instructions keep getting covered up.
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:04.600]   Yeah.
[01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:08.760]   But now, and I, and yes, yes, you're very, it's very correct that I could be arranging my
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:14.240]   windows so that nothing overlaps the other, but Mac OS doesn't make that very, very easy.
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:18.280]   And it's much easier for me to be able to simply have this thing in my menu bar at all
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:22.800]   times so that in the odd occasions in which that's a very, very useful thing for me to
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:27.360]   have, I can simply drag that URL into the menu bar and now suddenly it will never be
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:28.360]   covered up.
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:32.800]   I mean, as, as the reason why I found this as a matter of fact was that I've been looking
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:41.120]   at a basic tiling window interfaces for Mac OS because I think that if you have an enormous
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:47.480]   screen or if you have like multiple screens as I have now, having a tiled interface, or
[01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:50.600]   at least on one of those windows is not a silly thing.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:55.440]   I know that that was between windows 1.0, like their first reaction to Mac OS was that
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:57.560]   you can overlap any windows.
[01:57:57.560 --> 01:58:00.960]   But the idea of being able to create a new window saying I want to be able to use this
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:04.960]   other app, but I don't want to obscure the toolbars, what I'm doing in, you know, in
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:08.960]   other places, I would like to not have to work so much on window management as I often
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:13.200]   have to do when I just simply create new windows and they keep overlapping each other.
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:20.760]   So I haven't found there's on Linux, I have a window manager called IWM, which works
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:21.760]   very, very well.
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:26.680]   It is a learning curve involved, but once you get spun up on it, that's why I was looking
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:32.520]   for a solution like this on the Mac because I was finding that when I'm using my full-screen
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:37.280]   Linux install, there are things that I was enjoying in my workflow that I would like to
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:40.720]   be able to get in other operating systems.
[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:45.960]   So it's possible to get that windowing manager working in Mac, but I don't think it's really
[01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:46.960]   satisfactory.
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:48.120]   It's not something that I would recommend.
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:52.120]   So I was looking for give me alternative ways of putting up a window that will never be
[01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:53.120]   covered up.
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:59.360]   Yeah, that's all the rage in the Linux world is I3 and IWM and these tiling managers because
[01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:00.360]   they don't overlap.
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:05.280]   They're windows that tile rather than overlap and so you have different things going on.
[01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:09.720]   There's no, you can use magnet or something like that to simulate that, I guess, on a
[01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:10.720]   screen.
[01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:15.400]   I have and I've used a couple of those things where that duplicates to one extent or another
[01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:18.360]   Linux and Windows where you drag a window to the edge of the screen and automatically
[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:21.200]   snaps to the edge and takes up half the screen.
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:26.200]   What I need is something that will automatically that could automatically say, actually, I
[01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:30.520]   don't want this to cover up the other thing I've snapped to half of the screen.
[01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:35.240]   The fact that I've already snapped something to the left half means that if I snap something
[01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:37.080]   else, something else that's there to it.
[01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:42.240]   Yeah, now I want it to be the top half, bottom half, not only that, but if I decide that
[01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:45.920]   I really want the top window to be three quarters of the screen, I don't want to have to, I
[01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:49.920]   want to be able to adjust both of those windows at the same time by dragging the bar that's
[01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:50.920]   between the two.
[01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:52.760]   And there's nothing like that on the back?
[01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:54.760]   Nothing that, well, I should say nothing that I found.
[01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:56.640]   Not naturally or not built in.
[01:59:56.640 --> 01:59:57.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:59:57.640 --> 02:00:03.480]   There will be because it's so, it's so hot right now in the Linux world that I can't imagine
[02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:05.080]   somebody won't figure out how to do.
[02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:08.720]   Although I always, in Linux, I always think of it as for command lines.
[02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:12.240]   I don't really think of it as for gooies, although I guess that doesn't, you could.
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:17.440]   No, I think, I mean, the number of times where I have to have an edit document open some
[02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:19.240]   place, but I also have to have a PD.
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:23.640]   I'm also what I'm writing requires a PDF and a webpage that I'm opening at the same time.
[02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:29.720]   The number of times where I'm in Linux and I can just, again, there's a learning curve.
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:31.640]   It really is all like keystrokes too.
[02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:32.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:36.600]   So, yeah, it is frustrating as hell for the, it is counterintuitive for the first few
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:39.840]   days, but if you stick with it, or excuse me, if you have a need for this and you stick
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:43.280]   with it, the number of times where I've been able to create like an environment where,
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:49.400]   again, I'm doing radio in the morning and I need to be able to assimilate lots of things
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:50.800]   at once.
[02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:54.360]   That's why Linux has been like one of my go-to desktops for that sort of thing.
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:58.760]   So, Phinestra, that's the point of Phinestra is that you can have a window open, but it
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:01.360]   doesn't obscure the windows beneath it.
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:07.280]   No, no, it is a Mac OS floating window meaning that nothing will ever cover it.
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:11.360]   You can have, if you buy the 799 version, you can have multiple windows like that.
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:13.520]   I think that would be chaos.
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:16.920]   And it's only for video right now, right?
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:18.840]   You can't do anything.
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:22.080]   It only works really well for URLs where you drive.
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:23.080]   Oh, I see.
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:25.240]   So, it could be any web page.
[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:29.200]   Any webpage against Google Docs doesn't work with it.
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:33.240]   Again, the documentation says that it works with documents as well, but I can't like drag
[02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:35.040]   a BBA to document it to it.
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:40.200]   It will try its best to open that document within a floating window, but apparently,
[02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:44.840]   it's not such a generic operation that BBA is not aware that wait something's wrong.
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:47.040]   I can't draw into this window.
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:49.400]   But again, for free app, it's very, very good.
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:50.400]   And I liked it.
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:54.760]   I was using it enough that I wanted to at least give the person some $8 to reward their
[02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:55.760]   efforts.
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:56.760]   I am going to give it a try.
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:01:59.040]   I think that's very interesting.
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:01.720]   Is some of this go away if you have multiple monitors?
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:03.600]   Well, yeah.
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:07.360]   I mean, if you have, that's why I have three monitors.
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:10.040]   So, you put segregate stuff, you know?
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:13.960]   I think it's biggest use is when you have one big monitor.
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:14.960]   Right.
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:17.600]   Because the tendency is to keep opening windows and opening windows.
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:19.280]   I have two monitors.
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:23.280]   And if I were a little bit more organized, I would definitely have, well, this is my editing
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:24.960]   workspace monitor.
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:27.680]   And this other monitor is where I open web pages.
[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:30.240]   It just doesn't work out that way.
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:34.440]   And like I said, it's just nice to be able to say, all I want is for the next 20 minutes
[02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:37.680]   for this web page, not to be covered up anything else.
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:39.360]   And so I don't want to have to move anything around.
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:40.360]   I don't want to make adjustments.
[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:42.640]   If I do one drag, it happens.
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:43.640]   Yeah.
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:48.440]   I use to kind of handle as workspaces where I just make everything full screen.
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:52.200]   And then I can use control arrow to go to a different full screen.
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:54.280]   But you can't have two things open at once.
[02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:55.520]   I mean, it's side by side.
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:58.160]   So yeah, I think somebody should work on this.
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:03.080]   There's no reason why Apple shouldn't, Mac shouldn't have that capability.
[02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:11.240]   And until then, from the Mac App Store, Fanette, window, who they, and it.
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:15.800]   And it, and I see that not that I want to not that I want to make work for our editors.
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:19.800]   But like if we all want to pause so that Renee could say the word properly, and then you
[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:24.520]   just overdub that every single time one of the English speakers, Americans tries to say
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:25.520]   it.
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:28.760]   I think that we would make a lot of friends across the border.
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:30.520]   Renee, you're my Montreal accent.
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:31.840]   Are you originally a Francophone?
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:34.400]   No, you're because you're from South African.
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:36.640]   So you speak whatever that language is.
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:37.640]   Yeah.
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:41.280]   So I have the ha the cross sound from South Africa and the sound from French.
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:42.320]   So I got all the phonemes.
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:43.720]   You got all the phonemes.
[02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:45.720]   He's got all the meanings.
[02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:48.280]   Man, phonetra.
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:52.920]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for me to break out my wallet for Lori Gill.
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:54.400]   Oh, good.
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:56.160]   This time you might, you might.
[02:03:56.160 --> 02:04:02.480]   So, you know, I'm sure that we've all heard about how air power has been canceled or at
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:04.440]   least temporarily canceled.
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:08.400]   And there's a lot of companies that are trying to do their own version of it.
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:10.760]   And no bad, which I know you all know that I love.
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:11.760]   I love no bad, yeah.
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:17.440]   They are one of the first to market with their own free positioning charging pass.
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:19.840]   It's what air power was supposed to be.
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:20.840]   Yeah.
[02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:21.840]   And you know what?
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:25.840]   It does make it, maybe they'll do a better job of it, but they didn't make it yet.
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:28.080]   And this is out and it's gorgeous.
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:29.320]   It's thin.
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:32.960]   So I've got a real one right here that I can show you.
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:33.960]   Yes.
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:35.920]   So look at how thin this is.
[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:39.160]   This is the same thickness as their standard.
[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:40.160]   It's big.
[02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:43.760]   The pad is big, but it holds three full-sized phones on it.
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:48.440]   But it's really thin, which I think stands out amongst the few others that are out there
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:49.440]   now.
[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:54.600]   They're kind of thick because they're layering the coils one on top of the other.
[02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:55.720]   And this does not use that.
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:04:57.600]   It uses a different coil matrix.
[02:04:57.600 --> 02:04:59.720]   It has 18 coils in it.
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:06.320]   And so the matrix is, it builds out so that it finds your device.
[02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:12.560]   So instead of you just hoping that you dropped it down on one of the 16 coils or whatever,
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:14.440]   it finds you.
[02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:19.400]   It travels like it travels its power to where your phone is and then picks up on that power
[02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:27.120]   and I've done a lot to try to trick it or break it.
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:30.160]   And the only thing that I've noticed in this picture right here that you're looking at
[02:05:30.160 --> 02:05:32.360]   kind of shows you the edges of it.
[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:38.520]   So the very edges, it's about, I would say, a half an inch on the side and maybe a quarter
[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:43.280]   of an inch or maybe a half an inch on the long edges and three quarters of an inch on
[02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:44.960]   the side.
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:47.160]   That does not allow, that doesn't get power.
[02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:53.240]   So if you throw your phone that far off the edge of it, it won't connect to the power
[02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:54.240]   charging.
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:59.840]   But in any other circumstance, left, right, up, down, alongside parallel perpendicular
[02:05:59.840 --> 02:06:04.440]   anytime, anyway, I've thrown it on there, tossed it on there and it works every time.
[02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:06.040]   And it charges three different devices.
[02:06:06.040 --> 02:06:12.600]   So I have charged an iPhone 11 Pro, an iPhone XS, and an iPhone SE2 all at the same time.
[02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:16.080]   It charges them equally at the equal speeds.
[02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:20.600]   It doesn't like overdo it because there's too many phones or anything like that.
[02:06:20.600 --> 02:06:21.920]   So it's pretty impressive.
[02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:24.480]   Quite a lot of engineering.
[02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:26.000]   You are paying for it.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.000]   It's $220.
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.320]   Yeah, you are paying for it.
[02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:30.320]   Yeah.
[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:35.320]   And if they're using a company called Era and they're one of the new companies out there
[02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:41.920]   that are developing this free power or sorry, free positioning, wireless charging.
[02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:45.920]   And each company is kind of doing their own version of it.
[02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:50.720]   And in this case, they're using one that instead of coils that are stacking on top
[02:06:50.720 --> 02:06:59.200]   of each other, they're using a matrix of coils that are finding your device.
[02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:02.920]   The thing is moving around on the pad and finding your device.
[02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:07.640]   It's interesting because they say that our software will improve over time.
[02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:12.760]   So they've already been, I talked with the Aura about it a little bit, a couple days
[02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:18.560]   ago, and they have firmware updates that they're prepping to send out as soon as they get
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:21.000]   a couple of little things improved on it.
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:24.720]   When you place your phone on the pad right now, it takes a couple of seconds for it to
[02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:25.720]   get started.
[02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:28.560]   It's about two to three seconds.
[02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:33.000]   So you land it on the pad and then you just kind of wait a second to see whether or not
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:37.920]   it charged and it does every single time, but it takes that couple of seconds.
[02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:41.040]   So that's one of the things that they're going to push out in a firmware update.
[02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:48.000]   So you just be plugging your base station pro into your computer, downloading the firmware
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:51.240]   update and then adding it to the pad itself.
[02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:54.520]   So it will get updates and continue to get better over time.
[02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:55.520]   Interesting.
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:59.520]   Sounds like Aura solved the problem Apple could not.
[02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:04.280]   Well, I think the problem is this is not Qi certified.
[02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:08.600]   And I think Apple is probably trying to make a pad that is Qi certified.
[02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:14.840]   And I would argue maybe Qi, the Qi consortium, the wireless consortium, they probably need
[02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:20.480]   to make some changes to Qi certification in order to take advantage of the advancements
[02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:25.400]   in technology instead of forcing everybody backward, they should be jumping forward.
[02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:31.720]   So that's probably part of why Apple couldn't hit that, that the mark that they wanted is
[02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:33.880]   that they can't get it Qi certified.
[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:39.080]   So they're trying to fit within the Qi standards and then they end up with things like overly
[02:08:39.080 --> 02:08:44.680]   hot coils that blow up the pad because they're trying to fit within that standard that Qi
[02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:45.960]   is requiring.
[02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:50.040]   And it doesn't work with all Qi devices, although they say that's coming soon and it
[02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:53.960]   does not work with the Apple Watch because the Apple Watch is not a Qi device.
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:55.760]   But they are working on a solution for that.
[02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:57.000]   It is a pre-order at this point.
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:00.200]   They say the second batch will be made end of September.
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:03.640]   So, but you can go to it's funny because I like Nomad's leather.
[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:08.280]   I have them watch band, but apparently they're doing electronics too.
[02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:12.440]   Oh yeah, I have a half a dozen of their wireless charging pads.
[02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:13.440]   I love them.
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:14.440]   They're all good.
[02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:15.440]   So nice.
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:17.360]   Thank you, Laurie Gill.
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:24.440]   To find Laurie at imore.com where she is managing editor and working hard all the time to get
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:26.840]   you the greatest Apple information.
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:27.840]   It's a really good site.
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:28.840]   I'm more calm.
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:32.000]   Thank you, Laurie.
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.840]   Andy, I want to know what's called you Andy Gibb.
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:36.760]   Andy Gibb will be singing at W.
[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:40.920]   How deep is Hello, GBH in Boston.
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:43.000]   When are you next appearing on GBH?
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.600]   I'm a day early this week, Thursday at 1 p.m.
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:49.880]   Go to wgphnews.org, stream it live or stream it a little later.
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:50.880]   Very nice.
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:55.760]   Renee Richie's YouTube channel is the eponymous Renee Richie.
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:10:01.160]   YouTube.com/ReneeRee and E-R-I-T-C-H-I-E.
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:02.520]   He's also Renee Richie on Twitter.
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:03.520]   Thank you, Renee.
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:08.120]   You just, you're actually, I should have mentioned, Laurie, your review of the 27-inch
[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:10.360]   IMAX came out right on on.
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:11.360]   Not yet.
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:14.440]   I am putting the finishing touches on it today.
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:16.080]   It'll be out today or tomorrow at the latest.
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:17.920]   I know it took me a long time.
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:20.240]   And Renee's video review is up.
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:23.000]   Is it a review or a first look, Renee?
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.160]   It's, well, I mean, the embargo was like 24 hours.
[02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:28.600]   So I always try, I'm always like, if you're going to make a purchasing decision, if you're
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:31.440]   deciding to order it, I've got to give you the best information I can.
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:34.720]   But then I follow up like with a full review a week or two later.
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:36.200]   And that's still to come?
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:37.200]   Yes.
