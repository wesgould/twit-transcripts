[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Renee Ritchie and the Enoco Lori Gill in the house.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.800]   We're going to talk about the Twitter hack and why Lori's high-more account is still down.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.280]   Apple's got new emojis in emojis. We're here, new emojis are here, and then we'll have a lot of
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.880]   fun speculating on what the first Apple Silicon device will be. It's going to be out this year,
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.720]   but what will it look like? That's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.440]   my friend Renee Ritchie. He is at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie, where he covers all tech all the time. Hi,
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.440]   RR. Hi Leo. I'm so happy the mask laws have taken effect in Quebec and I went grocery shopping
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.880]   for the first time in a couple of weeks. Everybody was wearing a mask.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.840]   Oh nice.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.440]   Everything is polite and cool and calm and not entitled, not carrining, not anything because
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.240]   we all just want to go back to work. I forgive a lot of what you did as a province for the last
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.880]   month.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.640]   Yeah, grocery shopping is an adventure. I look like Jude Law and Contagion. I wear so much
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.800]   protective gear. But then it's kind of fun because you feel invulnerable. You feel like Ironman.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.520]   Well, yeah, I feel like that's it. But it's not like Batman or Ironman. It's when they lose the
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.520]   first time and then have to put on the extra special costume armor and then go back to the
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.440]   event. That's what I feel like. Yeah, like the extra gloves and you do that whole scene where
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.200]   you put everything on. I feel like Ironman, but I look like Bane. That's the problem.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:38.160]   There's Andy and I. There's Andy and I co-wgbh Boston, I H N A T K O dot com. Hi Andrew.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.720]   Hello. See my problem with I do wear the mask everywhere. The only problem is that
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.400]   with the mask covering most of my facial features, it's hard to show to other people who aren't
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.840]   wearing masks, how judgmental I'm being of them. Instead, usually I could just go.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.400]   But now I have to do it all through upper body sort of stuff. And it kind of looks like I'm
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.960]   putting a hex on them. Yeah, it's hard. And actually, yeah, coronavirus, it's hexing them. Yes,
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.080]   yes, it is hard. It's hard. It's almost as if I'm expected just to be simply content that I'm
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.960]   protecting myself and others around me and not judge other people, even though I really is one
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.840]   of my core competencies. And we welcome back to our dias. I don't know what this is. Table.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.480]   You guys are on monitors, so I don't know what the hell's going on. Lori Gail,
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.640]   a managing editor at iMore. Hi, Lori. I have my dais in front of me that where I worship at the
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.720]   altar of rock and roll. So it's okay. We're good. Yeah. Do you have a picture of Aussie right in
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:48.640]   the middle of going? So did I more get its Twitter account back? No, not yet. By the way, if anybody
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.920]   wants to help us out, please add Twitter support and tell them that iMore still has not had their
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:01.600]   Twitter account reinstated. So it's very frustrating. When you when we were all hacked on Wednesday,
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.400]   all I wasn't. But when the when 30 blue checks were tweeting out spammy messages about I'll double
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.440]   your Bitcoin if you send me some, they response from Twitter, ham-handed, though it might be,
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.200]   did I guess work, they shut down all blue check accounts. They said, no, that's it. You're frozen.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.840]   They quickly unfrosed. Most of them except for some reason for the former mobile nation sites.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.920]   I'm more crack buried. Anybody who changed their password was extra frozen.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:40.720]   Yeah. And you know, we are our tech team. They were very forward thinking in that they saw
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.880]   as soon as they saw the Jeff Bezos tweet, they didn't even wait for more information.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.600]   They immediately went in and they reset our password. So they did the right thing. They did
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.640]   what they're supposed to do. And well, we're. They did the wrong thing for the right reasons.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.360]   Yeah. Yes. It turns out that was the best way to screw yourselves.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:08.240]   Yeah. We're still we're still trapped in the black hole limbo, but we're all as a team trying
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.880]   to tweet out each other's articles to get word of mouth out on Twitter about what's going on.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:20.160]   So I will be glad if you just DM me whatever you want me to tweet, I'll be glad to tweet on my
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.480]   account. I'm a way, man, no, because I made mine private. My response to the hack was to make
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.960]   mine private. By the way, none of that turns out would matter because what really happened was
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.760]   this bad guy whose name is Kirk. Yes. And the only the only explanation I come up with is
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.040]   maybe he wants to say, I'm the captain now. But for some reason, this guy named Kirk,
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.960]   who had not been seen much before, was able to get the administrative console, the high level
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.800]   administrative console that a presumably a trusted Twitter employee only would have access to.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.880]   The New York Times said it was because I hope this isn't true.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.600]   Yeah. It's true. Say it. Say it. They pin Twitter,
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.800]   pin the credentials for the admin console in their Slack channel.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.680]   And there it is. It's like channel that was open that that public could have access to, right?
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.040]   No. No, he hacked into it. That's what he hacked into the Twitter to this. But Slack is
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.360]   easier to post it notes. Yeah. It's like putting a post it note on your desk. It's like that's
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.520]   he. No, it's like, it's like putting a post it note like in the bathroom that maybe the general
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.160]   public is supposed to get into. Yeah. That's executive bathroom. That's safe.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.200]   It was really a shocking, I think, dereliction of duty on Twitter's part. But now I'm even more
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.880]   upset because your people did the right thing. I know. That's so frustrating.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.160]   Of course. Now I was slowed on the draw. Your people were too quick on the draw. You tweeted it.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.920]   And then that was the last tweet. Yeah. That was the last tweet.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.280]   I was slower on the draw. We didn't find out about it. We were doing this week in Google and it was
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.200]   already an hour and a hack. And people are saying Elon Musk is tweeting. Jeff Bezos is
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.080]   tweeting Bill Gates is tweeting Barack Obama's tweet. And as soon as I saw Joe Biden's name on the
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.640]   list, I said, all right, this is an inside job because there's no way you could say maybe
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:24.080]   Elon didn't have the best ops sec. But there's no way a candidate for president or even the most
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.480]   followed former president. Yeah. Former president who's the most followed guy on Twitter doesn't
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.640]   have at least a security thing. What did you think like after Trump's account was deleted and
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.480]   after Jack's account was taken over that they would take all the top accounts and give them
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.960]   elevated security, not just like one or two. Well, I think they did do that with the president's
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.400]   account because no, it's that the president wasn't in on this. And Jack's apparently
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.440]   the second time. There was like a handful of accounts that had enhanced security.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.880]   But not Barack Obama's Elon Musk's Bill Gates and Joe Biden.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:57.120]   Well, it's a very, very hands-on approach for those accounts. It's not they haven't written.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.480]   They have my understanding that they haven't written infrastructure for that sort of thing.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.280]   Yeah, it really is a case of. They're people. Yeah. Exactly. So they can't. It's a solution,
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.480]   but it's not a scalable solution. Well, Twitter is inherently not scalable.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.080]   And Justin Bieber became very hot on Twitter. They gave him his own server.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:18.960]   And you know what? I understand because if you think about what Twitter does, it's insanely
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:26.320]   complex. Justin Bieber puts up a tweet and then Twitter has to figure out who to show that tweet
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:32.560]   to because that's to be his followers, right? And it's and that means it's a very it's not a simple
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.400]   database query. It's a very complicated. It's an advanced analytical query.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:42.400]   Yeah. So I understand, but still. I think it's a classic problem that affects pretty much all
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.840]   industries where you build a tool as a group of six to eight people and you have an idea of what
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.920]   this tool is going to be is going to do what's going to be used for. You build it and then you
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.640]   scale it based on those things. And then it gets insanely popular. And now the community is telling
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:03.440]   you what that thing is supposed to be used for. And you absolutely don't have either the what you
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:09.680]   built should have been built with that built in right in, but you didn't. And now you have to try
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.840]   to retroactively figure out how to make that support that in addition to making sure that
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.360]   your whole organization's philosophy embraces this idea of, oh, we're not just a fun way to send
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.240]   little short messages to people via your text messaging system. We are and we are now an
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.880]   international infrastructure for communications, emergency alerts and news.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:37.040]   This is why a lot of these services have a problem differentiating. Okay. I know that you say that
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:43.760]   you want to be you want to you're based on free speech and you don't want to control what anybody
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:49.920]   says on your platform. And that's great. I mean, that's great. Love to hear it. But now that you
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:56.160]   are a platform of 2.8 billion users, letting anybody say everything without any restrictions
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.360]   or controls or retribution, not working for our planet. Maybe you should try it on another planet.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.560]   But for us, speaking as a spokesperson for Earth, not working for us, we'd really like you to address
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:14.000]   that. The best moment was the best they turned off all the verified and the blue checks. Oh man.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.720]   And why it says Twitter's at its best when verified accounts can't wait. They were having parties,
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.760]   right? They're like, who the blue checks are gone. The real people are good.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:27.360]   Yeah. But I was shocked to see that that all of these I'm you know, I'm Warren and
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:33.440]   Crackberry, these former mobile nations accounts, I guess it's you have the same IT guy. And
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.600]   I guess they all did the same. He did the same thing to all those accounts.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.880]   And all of them. And Twitter has which was the right thing to do until you realized it couldn't
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:48.160]   possibly be just a password hack. This is worse. Right. Oh, Rick's, Rick's Eagle was retweeting the
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.680]   Todd, because he already from I hope I'm saying his last name right from ILM did the same thing.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.800]   And he hasn't been able to get back on. So anybody changed your password at the proximate time of this
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.200]   is presumed to have been hacked. And now obviously they're going to get through all of these accounts,
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.360]   but it must be a million. Well, the thing that's super complicated is that like,
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.760]   like we're discovering more all the time, but just to get through it just really quickly,
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.080]   this guy named Kirk approached a couple of people who do sim swapping and said, Hey, do you want to
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.320]   find these OG Twitter, like one character, two character names and we can make some money and
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.320]   sell them. And they're like, cool. But then they got bored. And while they got bored, he started
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.480]   doing this Bitcoin thing. And then it turns out while this Bitcoin thing was happening,
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.440]   he also downloaded messages from eight accounts that they Twitter says were not verified accounts,
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.440]   but we don't know what accounts it. So it's like layers with it. Like, was he really?
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.240]   Did he really waste the upper the hack of a lifetime on a stupid Bitcoin scheme or was a Bitcoin
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.080]   scheme like pay attention over here while I get this data that I really want to.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.480]   It's super complicated. And I think they're still sorting it.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.400]   It's not as stupid a Bitcoin scheme as it seems on first glance. It would be he got probably $100,000.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.960]   It's hard to tell with Bitcoin wallets because you could put money in. They can't tell who's doing it.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:04.080]   But I think it was Coinbase said they blocked $280,000 worth of attempted transfers.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:09.280]   So it could have been lucrative, but it is an interesting exercise to think you have the
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:15.600]   hack of the century. You have the keys to the Twitter kingdom. What would you like to do today?
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:23.520]   Well, but see that's where all the really cool like speculation goes on that it is possible that
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:30.960]   like if I saw if the Metropolitan Museum of Art like just cleaned out all of its trash and one
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:38.240]   early night at 2 a.m. I find a multi million dollar piece of artwork just in their trash.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.000]   And I impossibly think, oh, this is clearly a mistake, but I think I'll have it.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.680]   Now I've got like something that I could not stop painting this worth millions and millions of
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:51.280]   dollars. But I absolutely do not have the infrastructure on how to make millions of dollars off this
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.640]   painting. And so if I find some some guy who will just simply give me $50,000 in cash for it,
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.440]   I might take it. And so this is what a lot of thinking a lot of thinking was over the weekend
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.080]   was either this. I think most of the stuff that was most interesting was that one of two either
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.120]   sides of the spectrum that one somebody hacked happened into this really, really valuable hack
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:16.560]   didn't have any what didn't have the ability to like take the offer to the highest bidder
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:25.040]   on the black market. Or somebody this was a front operation to distract Twitter security
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:30.640]   while they were running the actual operation that is going to go undetected. And hopefully it seems
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.560]   as though it's the first one and not the second one. But oh, kind of depends on his Twitter.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.960]   And if Kirk's real name is Vladimir, it might be the latter.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.600]   But someone was saying I forget who that like, you know, it's too hard to steal the painting these
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.160]   days. It's just too easy to track that down. So you rewire the payment from the auction house
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.680]   instead. And you get the value of the painting without ever having to actually go there and
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.640]   steal it and and all those things. And who knows what information is in the DMS of those accounts
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:03.760]   that got done with it. Yeah. So why does this keep me? I keep thinking of the movie hackers like
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:10.000]   all of this is just like straight out of hackers. Somebody who happens across some bit of information,
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.640]   they didn't realize how big of a deal it was. They play around with it and oh no, it's much
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:20.320]   bigger than they thought. I was thinking of a better movie sneakers. Yeah, I was thinking
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.480]   sneakers too. So good. C tech astronomy. I don't think I've seen my voice is my password.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.880]   Oh, you have to be sneakier. I've intentionally avoided both because I know they will get me angry.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.320]   Right. Oh, yeah, it was so bad. No, no, no, sneakers is actually very, no,
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.920]   sneakers is actually very, very good. He's a robber. Robert Redford is a hacker.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:47.440]   Yes, no, or he's sorry. No, no, sneakers. Snickers is the one where the launching off point is that
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:53.360]   they're as a hippie in that Harvard like in the sixties, he and his friend, Ben college friend,
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.320]   Ben Kingsley are hacking into like Republican fundraising accounts. I'm giving it to like
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.560]   good charities. I don't know. Redford does the hacking, right? He's like the suit and he's
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.960]   like the pretty safe. Yeah, anything that happened to be he happened to be going out to get a pizza
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.120]   for them when the feds actually came in and arrested. Everybody knows hackers were hoodies,
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:17.520]   so it couldn't be even when they're rolling. Yeah, they rollerscade and they have weird personal
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:23.520]   habits. That's why I don't want to watch these movies. And I really, the things I hate the worst,
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:29.600]   what is that thing that the in the movie and TV industry, the person in charge of the screen is
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.720]   called called the playback guy, right? It's the person. And a lot of times these guys are
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:40.080]   sophisticated. We've occasionally been contacted. Can you use can we use Twit as one of the tabs
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.440]   in the I think Mr. Robot people want enough one of the tabs to be Twit, that kind of thing.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:51.920]   So there's somewhat sophisticated, but most of the time it's really big text, really stupid hacks.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.800]   And there's not, you know, it's just it's just a no. It gripes me a little bit.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.360]   So I remember a computer typing is always something like.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:07.760]   Hackers was a lot of fun because as it happened, like I saw it in a screening room
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:15.200]   with like Chicago film critics. And so, and so all the critics were like, they're just like,
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.920]   again, watch, watch, Andy, can that is that true? Can they do that? Is that possible?
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:26.560]   No, but here's so I was I was there with Roger Ebert and Roger and I went out to lunch afterward.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.720]   And I'm like, over the entire screen, I'm like,
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:36.560]   because their lines like, oh, I see you have the new upgraded model 51 to one laptop. Yes,
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:41.840]   it has more R A M, which makes it faster. And so, and so we're talking about over lunch.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.960]   And I, I'm not really realizing the effect that like what I'm saying is having. I said,
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.680]   come on. Okay, first of all, if you want to like control traffic lights, you don't go to the to
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.360]   the magical center. Here's how you can actually control a traffic light. You just mount a strobe
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.280]   light, blah, blah, trick the light to thinking that you're an ambulance. And also you really
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:06.240]   want to you don't want to do I told them like what a DDOS was like. I told them that social
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.920]   engineering would do that. I could probably get access to this by doing that. And I see
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:15.680]   them getting quieter and quieter as I seem to be saying that no, I could I could ruin you your
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.800]   newspaper, your entire city with just 10 board minutes and a Senate on registered cell phone.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:26.400]   I love the poster for hackers. This will give you this in 1995, their crime. By the way,
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:34.160]   that's Angela Angelina Jolie is a hacker tattoo. Yeah, their crime is their curiosity.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.320]   Hackers, but the best is the tagline boot up or shut up.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:50.160]   A game boot up or shut up. Yeah. So I have avoided those movies, but now I think there's enough time
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.560]   and distance that could make it be funny instead of just annoying. Yeah, you can just laugh at it.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.360]   Yeah, we'll have a movie in space camp would make a good double feature in terms of having
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.000]   no technical understanding of exactly what they're talking about. But I was watching like a bunch
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.600]   of shipfaring YouTubers take apart the new Tom, like the new Tom Hanks movie. You cannot watch a
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.160]   movie about anything in which you are an expert. I know. It doesn't. I know. But I have to say,
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:19.840]   Greyhound is a great movie. Are they saying it's not realistic? I haven't seen it yet. Yeah,
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.960]   they're saying like the radius of the turn here and blah, blah. And I'm like, like,
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.400]   you know, I had a friend who was a race car driver and he's like, those fast in the furious
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:32.880]   movies are just completely inaccurate. Okay, so I can acknowledge that when Tom Hanks says,
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:40.400]   hard a port that the ship doesn't go. But I can understand that. It was it was more of the
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:47.280]   ballistics of an airplane than an actual Navy destroyer in 1941. But I thought it was a gripping
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.720]   movie. Loved the movie. That's the point, right? Like, like,
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.160]   if anyone was in an airplane can't watch flight movies, they're like, Oh, Liam,
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:58.240]   Neeson wouldn't bounce around the cockpit that way. Whenever I see those podcasting movies,
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:06.480]   I just have to laugh. Yeah, that's not. I'm a millionaire. I'm going to retire now. Like,
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.760]   really? What? It's like, or like all the books, like the shows about like, I sold my first book
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.120]   on a millionaire. Aren't there any tech blogger movies yet? I think there should be.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:20.320]   Because we know there won't be any podcaster movies until there's a tech blogger movie.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:26.480]   Well, yeah, show is about a podcaster and he's like trying to get his podcast sold entire
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.640]   for a season. I was watching it at my mom's place going, Oh, no, it doesn't work like this at all.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:35.360]   He's trying to get his podcast sold. He keeps meeting with massive media companies to buy his
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:41.760]   podcast. Of course, like, famous. What show is that God God God friended me God becomes a
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.120]   Facebook friend. It's like the new version of Joan of Arcadia, which is a new version of.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:49.040]   It's like God becomes his Facebook friend and sends him out to to right wrongs in the world.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.560]   I now know why I've never heard of it.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.960]   And he's an atheist. His father's a preacher and they disagree with each other.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:59.680]   And he vents it. Is it Canada only? I don't think it's Canadian content.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:05.440]   Where's that many TV shows? So he said Christian Bale should play me in the
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.880]   Twitter. I scream at the rest of his Batman. Yes.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:17.120]   Okay, let's get to our first big Apple story of the week.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:27.040]   So it's almost three o'clock. Why not? The new, the new emojis coming to iOS in 2020. Finally,
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:31.520]   what you've been waiting for, the lung emojis of actually that might be timely.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:37.440]   That goes right. We'll do it's wearing a mask at least. Yeah, there's a ninja. There's Boba T.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:44.320]   You know, I thought those were tapioca pearls. I'm completely getting this one. No, no,
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:49.600]   they're cornstarch balls. So I thought that was Starbucks, Moore's Frappuccino. And this was a
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:55.520]   COVID-19 preparedness emoji. Am I completely getting these wrong? There's a dodo, which is
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:00.960]   also, I think, appropriate. That's your that's your climate change emoji. A babushka doll,
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:08.000]   a pinata, a decent tamale. I have to say the Google version of this tamale emoji is disgusting.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.320]   I don't know what's it. It's a Mexican food and no protein though. I mean, this really seems like
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.960]   it should be. It should be America should be annoyed. And I don't think that's a Canadian hand gesture.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:23.520]   No, that's an Italian gesture. They skid car pinched fingers. A little tip of the head to Australia.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.040]   I thought that was a weird pain. Oh, they do, Lori. Just not in polite company.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:35.200]   Or the north end. It could be like, that's delicious. I thought Tony Soprano use it once and
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:39.840]   good things that not happen to the person. I feel like and maybe it's just me. And we were
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.880]   talking about this on Twitter. I feel like that's dirty doing that.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.640]   Doesn't there's a polite version? But I think you open your hands the wrong way.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:53.200]   I don't even know. And then my speculation was all Italian hand gestures have something to do
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:22:00.080]   with your wife is sleeping around on you. I think they I think all of them mean that you're
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:06.240]   been cuckolded. That's my I just think that's I will I will say that my grandfather was an Italian
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:12.320]   immigrant and a proud member of the sons of Italy. And I did occasionally see that at the in big
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:18.240]   like family gatherings, neighborhood gatherings at the at the grown-ups table. And when we were if
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.880]   someone was a children, if they saw people doing that, then the children were hushed away.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:28.000]   And the Italian viewers are going to say angry at us right now.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.800]   So I'm going, Leo, don't you know that this is really a gesture from the hills of Napoli that
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.320]   means infervent love of your soul and peace and happiness. Of course it does.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:42.320]   Here is the text from Emojipedia, which is the authority Jeremy Brueger's site. And of course,
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:48.160]   he's on the Unicode committee for Emoji. So he does know. Okay. Boy. Okay. Boy.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:55.360]   It says pinched fingers as a variety of in Italy, this hand gesture tends to be used in
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:01.600]   disagreement frustration or disbelief and can mean what do you want? What are you seeing or your
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.480]   wife is sleeping around on you outside Italy? Anyone performing a caricature of an Italian
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:12.480]   person, regardless of context or tone, my useless gesture. Well, that's good. So in other words,
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:19.040]   it's a it's a stereotype. Okay. Good. Pinched fingers has a variety of other culturally specific
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:27.440]   uses in Israeli culture. It can mean hold on, relax, be patient. The K-pop star Yuri uses it as a
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:35.600]   signature gesture to represent a dumpling. And it's a general warm sentiment. It can also be used.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:44.640]   Well, we won't go on. So I missed that usage. Never underestimate the power of K-pop.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:53.520]   So I'm going to choose. It means that might be why that's why that's on the list. If the K-pop star
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:24:00.320]   makes this. Yeah, that's a powerful people. This is to benefit the stands out there.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:07.280]   Then there's a boomerang. Nice tip of the hat to Aussies. A ninja, which I don't think is
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.920]   something the Japanese were dealing with asking for. I'm thinking that's a comic book thing.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.520]   Not even historically accurate ninja. That's a very like. It's American nerds.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:19.120]   Like if you're supposed to be hiding and you dress like that, everyone's going to know you're
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:23.440]   the ninja. Yeah. And then you show COVID. Like only ninjas dress that way. No ninjas should
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:29.360]   wear flannel shirts, should look normal. It might not of course. Yeah. There's a quarter,
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:35.520]   which is interesting. That's a very American looking coin in apples. Why does that particular
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:42.400]   version say the crazy one? Because it's apple. Because apple. Here's to the crazy ones. If you
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:49.200]   are a flip it over. Is this apples? Yes. These are apples. Oh, that's why. Okay. These are apples.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:55.120]   Well, I could show you Googles, but they're so horrible. Google, it's like they have.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:02.000]   It's on Brady there. So they got a child doing the illustrations. There's a very anatomically
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.520]   correct heart. Yeah, that's a very curious Valentine message to send somebody to protect.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:14.560]   I'll rip your heart out with my pitch fingers. Dumpling. There's a beaver. We know what that's
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:20.320]   going to be used for. What the hell? This is like every gender. Is this a transgender
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:25.680]   sir? Firewire. Yes. Okay. Or fire. A lot of people. Or firewire three either one. Yeah.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:32.400]   That's that's the Thunderbolt four or logo. There's Boba T. Alliation for JK Rowling. Good for them.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:39.520]   So this so this is transgender, basically. Yes. Male, female, and then the transgender. Yes.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:44.000]   That's cool. I think it's I think it's meant to be inclusive. It's basically all.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:51.680]   Yeah. All genders. And then there's lungs again, anatomically correct. Although I believe that
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:57.680]   trachea should be a little bit shorter, but I don't know. I'm just guessing. There you go. Those are
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:06.000]   the those are the new emojis. The anatomical heart and lungs coming to the emoji keyboard
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.640]   later this year. There is a lot of discussion over the pinched fingers.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:19.600]   Babushka. I like that. That's nice. And asking dolls. Those are pretty. That's what
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.760]   you could call it. Yeah. Yeah. They should have they should have they should actually if
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.800]   they're going to they should do it all the way. They should make sure there are smaller versions
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.320]   of it. So you can actually do the full. Like you hold down and they pop up the smaller version.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.600]   Well, I think Apple's done something clever instead of just showing the outer layer.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:38.400]   They actually have the bottom of the outer layer and then the next layer in peeping out.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.880]   So you do get the idea. It's nested. I wonder. I wonder.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.840]   The emoji for a little sister. Little sister. Oh, it could be middle. Yeah. Middle sister.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:52.000]   There's actually meat filling in the tamale, which is again better than Google's.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.280]   When you blow these up, they're really quite detailed, I think. Whereas my
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:01.360]   protein emoji. I've been asking for. Because you know, what would put in what would it look like?
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:05.360]   People would not know it's put in. They think what is that vomit? I don't know how many people
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.840]   recognize a tamale though. I mean, in China, they probably think it's one of those Chinese dumpling.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:15.200]   Yeah. Well, it doesn't really matter because the reason why they released these so many months
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.840]   before they actually put them out on software is so that the entire internet community can figure
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:25.200]   out what sexual thing are we going to use this as a shorthand for? Obviously.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.720]   She said burrito emoji plus this emoji plus plus. Why the carrots that of the eggplant?
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.280]   What did I do? What did I do? The carrots that of the eggplant.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:44.240]   So this is let's find the Google version of the. This is apples. Oh, wow. That's a burrito.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.480]   No, I don't want burrito. I want tamale. Wow. They're really that you know what? That's interesting.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:52.080]   The that burrito doesn't have french fries in because it's not from Sacramento.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.760]   Yeah, forget it. It's not a California burrito. Don't eat it. It's interesting.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.480]   Tamale was approved as part of the boy, they haven't finished the century apparently.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.160]   It's just a little lipses. It's a 01F84.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:11.200]   Here you can copy and paste 01F84 from this page.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:16.960]   Why? There's a lot of Mexican food. That's interesting. Well, it's great cuisine,
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:22.880]   but I mean, I think spread the love. Who doesn't love it? There is stuff flatbed bread and falafel.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.840]   Falafel. There's a you know, originally there was a lot of Japanese food. So, you know, rice cracker,
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.680]   rice ball cooked rice curry rice steaming. There's like three rice is right there.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:39.680]   Steaming bowl spaghetti roasted sweet potato. Oden, which is you know, again, that like the
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:46.640]   tamale. I think Oden is probably something mostly Japanese or maybe just Asian users with no
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:54.640]   fish cake with swirl, moon cake, dango, dumpling. So yeah, that's good. It's good. We finally know
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:29:03.200]   Mochi though. I was hoping for Mochi. Mochi. Yeah. Did you submit a request for new emoji?
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.960]   Because you can do that. You can submit it to the Unicode conclusion. I know. And it's what's
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:11.520]   interesting and Jeremy Burushi has been on his show as many times has told me that, you know,
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:19.280]   sometimes like I think Tanya, our former, our former Booker, Tanya Hall, I think was the
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:24.240]   milkshake emoji. Wasn't she, John? I think she submitted it. I think Jeremy said, yeah, yeah,
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:29.600]   this is Tanya's emoji. That's so great. Wasn't that a nice feeling to know you've got, you know,
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:35.360]   an emoji named after you. Tanya comes from a small gentleman,
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:48.240]   tiny suburb. So these will come out with iOS 14.1, probably in October.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.640]   Oh, not in with 14. They're not in the bay. They're super smart because they release
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.240]   in you update and they know like some percentage of people will do it just because it's new.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:01.760]   But then a month later, when the numbers, it's not everybody has an updated yet. They put out
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:06.080]   the new version and then some people get it and you start seeing those squares on Twitter because
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:11.200]   you're not hip enough to have the latest and then the real upgrade stats happen because people
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.760]   got to have their emoji. That's why I didn't get it to Molly emoji. I'm not hip enough.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:20.320]   I just got zero one F4 to you instead of the real deal.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:26.720]   Does anybody know what fondue is anymore? That seems like such a 70s thing.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:31.680]   Oh, there's rest. Whenever you say that, I hear the album music my parents played while having
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.920]   fondue. How have you been to the melting pot?
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:41.120]   Don't you know? Don't you know about the melting pot? The original fondue.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:46.720]   I actually, Lisa and I used to go there and we got in a fight every time we went there and I
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:52.000]   finally realized is because they use so much MSG in the fell in the fun too, that I was getting
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:59.680]   cranky and we had to stop going there. So just a little tip. If you find yourself
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:06.240]   fighting with your SO after going to the melting pot, it could also be that you have to share
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:13.760]   a pot of melted cheese that could make you cranky too. Definitely not for a long time.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.320]   Will we be going back there? Also really not very lower GI safe either.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:25.440]   By the way, according to Forrester, speaking of COVID, Apple was the only Fortune 50 company
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:35.120]   to ensure itself, ensure itself against COVID. Here's the little paragraph from the Forrester
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:41.360]   report. COVID-19 wasn't a black swan. Any infectious disease expert could have told you
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:46.640]   a pandemic was inevitable. Yet when we reviewed the Fortune 50's current 10K reports,
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:51.680]   we saw that while 50% mentioned a pandemic in their risk profile for investors,
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:58.560]   they classified it as an act of God, only Apple had ensured the downside.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:06.320]   That's so incredible that that's the only company that sort of predicted this and that saw this.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:13.360]   Lots of companies work with China suppliers and it seems like they would have just kind of
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:18.000]   foreseen even some version of a slowdown because of it.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:23.840]   That's why Tim Cook gets the box. Well, they did have what was there?
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:31.200]   The bird flu was 2009. I think there was another. There's been plenty of warning
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:37.440]   during 2016. Yeah, but yeah, it's telling that so basically all this evidence was out there.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:41.760]   Exactly. Thank you. It was out there for everybody. Yeah, but it is kind of amazing to
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:48.400]   yeah, you know what? Given that we are fortunes are absolutely crystal clear tied to
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:53.200]   tied to China or tied to the east, we are going to make sure that we can't get bitten
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:58.800]   but too badly by that. It's amazing that that would happen. By the way, Beatmaster,
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:04.800]   who is our Swiss representative in the chatroom, says that they still do want to
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:08.560]   with Switzerland. There you go. Well, if they have to, they got better cheese there.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:14.480]   They do want the cheese because if you do it with oil, which you know, you could put the boiling
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:20.800]   oil and put beef in it, which is really cruel. But you know, according to Beatmaster, that's
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:27.040]   fondue sheen was in Switzerland. Can I say that I could have predicted that because
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:31.840]   one of the greatest roadblocks, my favorite roadblocks in amazing race history was in Switzerland
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:37.600]   where they had to eat and the team has to had to eat an entire pot of fondue. And of course,
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:42.160]   because they do such good editing, most of the editing is just these contestants after like,
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.120]   okay, great. We just get to this roadblock and then we get to the finish line and like,
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.040]   and after like two minutes, we're all like,
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:52.720]   just eating up the gallon of water. Well, that explains because Beatmaster says,
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:58.960]   mostly it's tourists eating the fondue in Switzerland. They flirt, not doing stay away from the fondue,
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:07.280]   if you want to, if you want to walk again. Okay, don't diss the fondue, Beatmaster says,
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:11.680]   I'm not dissing the international audience to be saying. I love fondue. I love it too.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.840]   I just didn't think it was common enough to get an emoji, but apparently it is.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:21.840]   When we discovered the melting pot, we, that's another reason we were cranky. We ate there a lot.
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:28.880]   I am going to put it in a proposal because if we can have something as regionalized as a fondue
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:35.760]   part, aerosol cheese needs to be an emoji. That's nothing more American than let's take something
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:41.040]   that's beloved and ancient and let's take it, turn to this oil orange filled monstrosity and
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.440]   make it under compressed air that you can pull whippets off of while you're having your crackers.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:52.560]   Can you make it on a cracker? So Andy, submit this to the Unicode Consortium because
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:59.040]   a cracker. It has to fit on a cracker. Spray cheese on it would be perfect. I would love that emoji.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:07.360]   It has to look like it has to little curly Q and a tail coming up like a little pointy tail
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:11.120]   where you left off. And then I would love that. I would use that all the time.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:16.080]   I favor a smiley face and occasionally I will put that on an Oreo cookie.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.320]   The smiley face from watching it right now.
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:25.680]   We have a really strong hankering for some spray cheese right now.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:31.120]   I'm just saying that when I invite you over for like my Tony Awards,
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:37.520]   telecast night party, it's a scene man. I'll bring the fun. I have both the white and the
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:42.720]   orange version of the spray cheese. Oh, yeah, you've got it. So if you search.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:50.560]   Yes. You do search for spray cheese on a cracker. There's that one is the one I want.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.000]   There was one with the little point coming off of it. It all looked like Pokemon to me.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.880]   This is the Bulbasaur and the Taros Charmander. It is. It's like clouds.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.200]   It's like clouds. You just see what you want in there.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:07.600]   That's that little point. That's that's that's what I'm talking about.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.280]   It's how you know it's fresh.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:14.880]   There it looks like there are multiple brands of
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.320]   as craft calls it, Easy Cheese.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.600]   Easy there, boys.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.560]   There's like bacon, bacon cheese and.
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.600]   Wow. Can we get a hybrid emoji where you got some
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:33.680]   deviled ham with cheese? Oh my god. This looks terrifying.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:42.480]   You call it terrifying, but if you but if you were to open any issue of like like family circle
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:48.560]   or women's day in 1971 about elegant party making boy you'd have you'd have like you'd have like
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:52.640]   double double ham with aerosol cheese and a slice of pickle.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:58.080]   From the Pinterest Cute Snacks folder.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:03.920]   Usually it looks like Mr. the Monopoly man on a cracker.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:08.160]   A little mustache there. They look scared. I don't like that.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:13.360]   After he's been eviscerated. Wow. Who knew that spray cheese was so virtual?
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:20.880]   Do you have a preferred brand Andrew? At the dollar store it's usually get what you can.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.280]   It's a volume business I find.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.720]   Kroger house brand is called Go Cheese.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.400]   Go cheese. As opposed to cheese go.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:35.360]   There's Clover Valley spray cheese.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:40.000]   Easy cheese which is pasteurized cheese by craft.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:47.120]   The holiday sampler kit. Wait a minute. Craft makes easy cheese cheddar and bacon.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:50.000]   Look at this on a burger. That sounds delicious.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.200]   We're agreed though that we all know none of this is actual food.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.240]   Right. Well, I had this conversation on another show believe it or not.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.760]   So there's something going on. We've been talking about spray cheese.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.960]   Not spray cheese. We're talking about velveeta because we were talking about queso.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.040]   It was me and we did talk about it. Yes. Yes.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:15.600]   Well, it turns out and Stacy explained it to me.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.920]   There is a chemical in velveeta that makes cheese more meltable.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.000]   So if you're a calcium salt.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.720]   Yeah. Thank you. You knew that too.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.880]   No, we did this. We did this.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.440]   We did this.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.480]   Oh, all right. Maybe I'm confusing Stacy and Lori.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:36.240]   Because I thought because she's the Stacy Higginbotham on twig is the queso.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:40.000]   Yeah. I did not talk about the chemical makeup of velveeta.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.520]   All I did on a different episode.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.200]   I think it was last last time we did.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:43.920]   This is bad.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.760]   I just talked about how velveeta is.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.480]   Is a good cheese.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:51.440]   I know. Maybe we were talking about the fact that I have a smoked queso recipe for the
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.480]   Traeger. Is that why?
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.760]   Which I use by the way.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:54.480]   Oh, was it good?
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.680]   It didn't taste any different smoked.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.840]   It was good, but it didn't taste any smoke.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:04.800]   It was from the fabulous meat church in Waxahatchy, Texas.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.600]   Apple wins.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.000]   That's it.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.360]   Apple. I just said the word Apple.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.120]   Bring us back on track.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.280]   Oh, wait. What?
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.600]   I thought this wasn't the cheese episode.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.280]   This is an act like weekly.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:17.840]   We are.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:18.960]   Act like weekly.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:22.320]   God, I think that's what we should do.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.520]   Forget this max stuff.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.360]   Okay. Somebody at Twitch, get that domain now.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:27.680]   Now.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.320]   Break weekly.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.120]   You're about to lose it.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:31.680]   I'm just saying.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.400]   Apple wins.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:34.880]   Fight.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.440]   This happened the day after our show last week.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:44.880]   In Ireland, remember the EU wanted Ireland to rescind the tax deal they made with Apple,
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:49.520]   forcing Apple to pay a $14.9 billion tax bill,
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:54.400]   which incidentally Ireland wouldn't even get that goes straight through to the EU.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:58.880]   The EU general court has said, no, wait a minute.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.320]   And the judge was so salty.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:00.880]   It's so funny.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.320]   It's like every analyst, at least,
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:08.640]   analyst I read every one, even include like Neil cybert and Ben Thompson.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.880]   And they're all saying like, legally, this is nonsense.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:14.160]   You can make an argument about it, but it's legally nonsense.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.320]   And the judge is like, this is legally nonsense.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.920]   Like you can make a better law, but you can't
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.600]   have to actively go back and just take people money.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.080]   It was pure as Tim Cook said, political crap.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:27.280]   In fact, it's a longstanding tradition for municipalities,
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.720]   for governments to make deals with companies
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.720]   as incentives to say, remember New York City was going to do that for Amazon.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.160]   Say move your stuff here and we'll give you tax breaks.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.960]   That's very common because they want the business.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:47.040]   Ireland wanted the business and Apple saved a lot of money.
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:52.880]   And you tried to give them the business, but the judge says, no, now they can't appeal.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:58.720]   It's not the highest court in the EU, but the EU says we're considering.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.080]   They can say you have to do this going forward, but going back in time and saying, you know,
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.240]   what's this is, is hard argument to make.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:12.640]   Marta Vastayer, who is the competition commissioner at the EU and was the one who kind of,
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:19.280]   you know, spearheaded this, said if member states give certain multinational companies tax
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:22.720]   advantages, by the way, I think Ireland's also done this to other companies like Google.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:22.960]   Yes.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:27.680]   Not available to their rivals. This harms fair competition.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:33.040]   She said the EU will continue to look at aggressive tax planning measures under EU
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.880]   state aid rules. What they should do is you can't do it retroactively.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:40.880]   I think that's a big problem. You can't say, no, that's no good. Give us our 15 billion.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:46.560]   But maybe they could say going forward, we need to review these rules and approve them before you do them.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:52.720]   Or just going forward, it has to be in accordance with these general guidelines
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:53.840]   agreed upon by the European Union.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.040]   Well, there are EU guidelines. And I think that was the contention is that
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:04.160]   that this violated the rules. The Irish finance ministry said, we've always been clear.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:08.400]   There was no special treatment provided to the two Apple units.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:14.240]   Yeah, we'll give this break to anybody. Anyone wants it.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.840]   I think it is worth the discussion, like, because a lot of people get upset that these
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:22.400]   companies don't pay more taxes. Like Apple, I think is one of the world's biggest taxpayers.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.920]   Amazon manages to pay almost no taxes. But people want to claim those taxes back,
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.760]   but they don't get upset about the tax breaks they're getting. And it's way easier just not
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.000]   to give them the tax. I know it's not convenient, but it's ways you're not to give them the tax breaks.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.920]   And it's always complain about the lack of double taxation in some cases.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:46.240]   I think that the tax break, I mean, there's a lot I don't understand and don't know about
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:52.080]   business tax. But in where I live, it also seems to hurt local businesses a little bit because
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:58.080]   the idea of the tax break incentive is to bring a large corporation into your economy.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:03.840]   But that can sometimes be at the negative, that's a negative to the local businesses that will
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:11.200]   lose out on something like that, like taking over in their area. So, you know, they're taking,
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:16.880]   telling somebody that you have to pay me taxes on something that we promised you wouldn't have to
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:24.000]   pay tax at us. That's just wrong. But there is an argument to be had for maybe we should start
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.760]   questioning these tax breaks that we're giving these large corporations that already have
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:31.120]   millions and billions of dollars. Why do they need a tax break?
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.360]   Oh, I agree. And it is a finagle.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:40.160]   Because Apple essentially signs intellectual property rights to its technologies to a small
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:45.840]   division in Ireland in order to get a tax break. It's not even good for Apple because that's why
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.560]   Apple had more than $100 billion in Ireland.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:53.040]   There's also like this Delaware building, this little building in Delaware that's the home to
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:59.920]   like 100,000 US corporations. Including Twitter, I might add. But I just, you know, we're in LLC,
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:05.600]   but we made it a Delaware LLC only because somewhere I read, oh, that's a good thing to do.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.200]   It doesn't save us money. We still have to pay corporate taxes.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.600]   The part where it's hard is that some places believe that you should pay taxes based on where
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:18.080]   you're doing business. You sell a MacBook in Germany, the German should be able to tax it,
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:22.080]   where other people believe that you should pay taxes in the area where you're creating the value.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:26.480]   So if you design that MacBook in California, you should be paying California taxes.
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:30.080]   And a lot of companies are like, well, figure it out, please. But it's hard if both Germany
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.280]   and California want to tax it.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:36.480]   Yeah, we don't want to be double-text. And of course, the MacBook is taxed with value added tax.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:45.200]   So the state's getting its share of that revenue. Anyway, it's above my pay grade.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.760]   I agree with you, Loretta, I think that's a tax policy.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:57.600]   I do say it feels unfair. And it feels like a finagle, a little chicanery,
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:02.240]   only available to big companies. I can't transfer my intellectual property rights to Ireland.
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:05.280]   And then have my pay income tax, zero income tax in Ireland.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.880]   Well, have you tried, Leo?
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:13.040]   Even if I did that, for individuals, the US federal government says, no, no, come here,
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.000]   come here, kid.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.800]   Well, US is amazing. I think it's like, I could be living in Ireland.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:17.840]   I really still want it.
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:23.840]   About Imperial measurements and taxation policies, because it's always the US and one African country
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:27.040]   that says we're going to stick with the imperial system and we're going to tax you
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:30.800]   for the revenue or even tax stock. Like the two things that work.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:35.840]   Honestly, if you think about it, tax policy is always made by the big companies that are
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:42.240]   confor-for to lobby and give money to members of Congress and all of that. So our US tax policy
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:48.320]   absolutely favors big companies. I can't let lobbies sufficiently to get
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:53.040]   diad finds to change my tax law. It's not going to happen. I don't have a
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.600]   Diane, I'll give you a buck 50. That's about it. That's all I can do.
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:02.000]   One of those emoji quarters. I'll give you a hundred emoji quarters. You can eat.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:11.360]   Apple has committed to be, and I'm very pleased to report this, 100% carbon neutral.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:15.360]   They're already carbon neutral for their buildings and so forth, but they want to do
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:20.880]   this now for the supply chain for all their products by 2030.
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:24.560]   There are companies that do that, but they're not of Apple scale.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.720]   The thing is that it's a company of Apple scale. That's applied to that scale that
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:32.240]   wants to get to carbon neutral. We actually were working on making
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:36.720]   Twig carbon neutral, but you don't do that by putting a wind machine on your roof.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:40.160]   Actually, the best place that a wind machine would be right here on the table.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:46.240]   But what you do is you buy carbon credits and we started doing that for
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.920]   at least when I started doing that for a travel and we were working on before COVID.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:55.200]   We were working on doing that for Twig. You just have to figure out what your usage would
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:00.400]   be. Then you go to a company that does this and they say, "Okay, well, we will offset that by
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:06.240]   either planting trees or doing other carbon sequestration projects, and this is what the bill will be."
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:11.760]   I'm sure that's what Apple is doing. Although you saw all the solar panels they put on the roof
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:19.840]   of the new campus, some of it is actually direct. In fact, they say 80% of the renewable energy that
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:25.120]   Apple sources comes from Apple created projects. That's pretty impressive.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:29.360]   We're claiming materials like they have that new robot that's going to take the
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:32.640]   rear earth magnets out of touch, out of the tap again.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:37.280]   That's awesome. Apparently, it's hard to ship those through Europe because they still want to
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.360]   treat it as hazardous waste, but I figured that out.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:44.000]   His name is Dave. They have Liam. There was one other robot.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.600]   Daisy. Daisy and Dave. I'm sorry, Dave.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.720]   They're going to start a band together.
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:54.800]   Yeah, Liam, Daisy and Dave. I don't know where Liam came from. I guess Liam Neeson,
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.840]   but Daisy and Dave clearly come from 2001, right?
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:59.360]   It had a particular set of skills.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:06.080]   I have a verb, particular. Oh, that makes sense. Yeah. So Dave disassembles the Taptic Engine.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:14.880]   That's tiny, right? It's got rear earth magnets and tungsten, both of which
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:23.440]   are tricky to get. If you can recycle them, good for the environment, good for the people who are
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:30.320]   working in those mines. They're also recovery. And also the fly is not that high, so like anything
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:33.680]   we can reclaim the better. That's right. Until we start farming the asteroid.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:36.400]   Yeah, no rear earth magnets. Yeah, that's right.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.360]   And a lot of them are in China and the policies change.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:46.320]   They're also have a rare, they have a material recovery lab in Austin, which is looking at other
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:51.920]   ways to recycle. They're partnering with Carnegie Mellon to develop further engineering solutions.
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:58.720]   All iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch devices released in the past year. I wish they had the
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:04.720]   air pods in here are made with recycled content, including 100 recycled rare earth elements
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:09.520]   in the Taptic Engine. That's a first for Apple and for any smart phone according to
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:15.440]   Apple's press release, they've decreased their carbon footprint by 4.3 million metric tons in
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:22.320]   2019 through design and recycled content. That's really good. And over the last 11 years,
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:29.120]   they've reduced average energy needed for product use by 73%. I guess that means better battery life.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:36.320]   It's good all around. Yeah. I kind of wish they'd extend that to making sure that the life of
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:40.640]   the life of an Apple product can go way beyond the integrity of the original product.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:49.120]   It still really burns me that if the simplest thing happens to a simplest component failure on
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:53.200]   a MacBook can mean that, "Oh, well, we're going to have to replace the keyboard, the trackpad,
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:59.200]   the lower assembly, the motherboard and the battery assembly because this is all one
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:04.880]   complete one simple configured component. It'd be nice if once something becomes obsolete,
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:13.440]   but it's still an intact notebook. You could get past the startup security utility,
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:18.720]   the security boot loader, install your own and basically say, "Guess what? You are no longer a
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:23.760]   MacBook of any kind. We're going to disable security features so that if you want to put a third party
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:28.080]   operating system like Linux on it, yes, that's perfectly fine. You can continue to do that."
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:33.600]   So there are a lot of it's the press release they sent out was very comprehensive. It says,
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:39.200]   "Talking not just about, "Hey, we're buying credits, but here's all the steps that we are taking,
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:46.160]   including creating monetary incentives for other companies to become more environmentally
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:54.000]   conscious. But part of the thing that's missing is, what if you are you willing to add two millimeters
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:01.680]   to the thickness of a device, if it means that you have more replaceable components in that product,
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.120]   or even better, more user replaceable components in that product?"
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:10.800]   I think there's a lot of e-waste that is not going to be solved by being able to take my
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:16.960]   $2,000 MacBook, send it back for basically a $200 credit towards the purchase of another Mac,
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:20.640]   and then hopefully the hope that the robots are going to be able to salvage everything out of it.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:25.520]   Well, yes, so it's at both ends. You got to do it in production. You got to do it in recycling
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:30.480]   at the end. I have to say it would be easy for Apple to skate in China, where I imagine they don't
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:37.040]   have particularly strict laws on all of this, but they're doing big investments. They have
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:43.040]   commitments from over 70 suppliers. The suppliers are mostly in China to use 100% renewable energy
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:49.040]   for Apple production. That's 8 gigawatts in commitments to power the manufacturing of its products.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:56.480]   That's a big reduction in CO2. They have new and completed projects in Arizona, Oregon, and Illinois,
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:01.680]   bringing Apple's renewable capacity for its corporate operations to over a gigawatt.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:07.920]   80% of the renewable energy that Apple sources is from its facilities are from now from Apple
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:12.720]   credit products. We mentioned that. They are building a giant solar array in Scandinavia,
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:17.440]   as well as two new projects providing power to underserved communities in the Philippines and
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:23.920]   Thailand. I think this is Tim Cook. A lot of times I look at this stuff and I say,
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:29.040]   "It's just corporate BS." But I really think that he has a genuine commitment to climate change.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:33.600]   This is showing up here. They're spending money. They're putting their money.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:36.480]   And Lisa Jackson, that's a heck of a hire.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.000]   Lisa Jackson, you're really serious about what you're doing.
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:44.160]   They're working on a carbon-free aluminum smelting process that instead of releasing
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:51.200]   greenhouse gases releases oxygen, which is interesting.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:54.000]   They were in Quebec for that. They were up here with a lot of the Quebec
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.760]   aluminum companies talking about that recently.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:59.280]   That's when they say the low carbon aluminum. That's what they're talking about. That's in the
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:04.640]   16-inch MacBook Pro. I think they use Hydro. There's like places in there's Iceland and Quebec
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:08.240]   and New Zealand and places that work on it.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:14.720]   This is really impressive. They are working with Conservation International
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:26.080]   to build mangrove, swamp mangrove, groves in Kenya and Colombia and the World Wildlife Fund.
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:32.800]   When Steve was at Apple, he made sure that any charitable stuff Apple did was secret.
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:39.360]   Yes. Either secret or not. It's not clear. But I think he probably did. Knowing Steve,
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:43.520]   he probably did a lot, especially actually knowing his wife. They probably did a lot,
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:48.160]   but just did it personally and in secret. But I think this is really great to see a big
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:54.720]   corporation like Apple that does, in fact, contribute dramatically to the use of these
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:58.400]   difficult materials to pay some attention to this.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:02.640]   Weird. Because they could be big evil company and do like latter stage Marlon
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:06.400]   Brando Tiddley-Twatt about the environment. They could also, they're a trillion-dollar company,
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:10.640]   they could do way more. I'm glad that they are setting this as a standard. Because once you set
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:16.880]   these standards, it's inconvenient to go less than the next time. Each of these has been more
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:21.600]   than they have been in previous years. I'm hoping that's a hard trend that continues.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:28.160]   If you get that 16-inch MacBook Pro, that's the first carbon-free aluminum.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:34.480]   I guess that's new. The existing 60-inches are not carbon-free.
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:36.480]   They're made from raised cycle aluminum, I think.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:43.840]   They're doing that new smelting technology that eliminates greenhouse gases.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:50.720]   That's very cool. It's made by Ellisys, which is a joint venture of Alcoa and Rio Tinto,
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:56.000]   which is a little bit problematic. They're backed by $144 million in funding,
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.600]   and that's in Canada. That's with the help of the governments of Canada and Quebec.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.160]   Thank you, Canada.
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:04.160]   Thank you, Candida.
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:06.960]   I'll pop this Justin Trudeau's selfies to prove it.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:19.920]   A lot of Foxconn movement to other nations. I've seen stories that hint or imply that Apple is
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:26.080]   trying to prepare for a post-China manufacturing. You think that's credible, or is it merely to
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:32.000]   get their phones in Brazil and India? Why can't it be both?
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:39.040]   It could be both. Brazil won't let you sell a phone that's not made in Brazil.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:42.320]   I think India has similar... They at least have high enough tariffs that there's a lot of this.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:46.240]   They'll tear up... Both of those countries will tear up the wazoo if you don't.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:53.680]   This is good across the board for Apple because they need to be spreading out their supply chain
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:56:00.160]   anyway to protect against things like the way the earlier this year when China had the epidemic
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:05.600]   of the COVID-19. It was isolated there, but all the supply chains shut down for it.
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:11.600]   Any circumstance under which one country has to have some version of a shutdown,
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:15.200]   Apple needs to protect itself against that by spreading out throughout.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:23.920]   Some of the other things that our government is putting in place could have negative
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:27.280]   effect on Apple's being in one country alone too. That's the other side. Trade rules.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:34.800]   I don't know what the status of that's going to be, but that is an issue too.
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:42.480]   You'd be smart. Tim Cook is the supply chain guy, and he probably has a lot to do with
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:49.520]   Foxconn and why Apple makes so much stuff in China. Jeff Williams and I forget Cahn,
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:55.200]   something I'm forgetting his first name. I always got the sense that it was Cook who really spearheaded
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:59.200]   that. He started it. He came over from Compact and that was his first thing. He was like,
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:05.200]   "Well, if we can do this at 10%, why can't we do it at 110%?" But it would be prudent at this point
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:10.080]   despite the advantage you've got by making it. It's not merely economic, by the way,
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:14.000]   and I think we've mentioned this before. The supply chains in China, so you're closer to your
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.440]   supply chain. The manufacturing skills and technologies that have been built up since the
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:26.480]   iPhone was first made in China in 2007 have really put China in a perfect position to be
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:31.120]   the factory of the world. And it invested in cities to do this exact job. They literally spent
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:36.720]   all the money to make cities that would do this for companies. Not only that, but they've also
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:40.800]   been building shipping ports and shipping routes so they can get manufactured products to other
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:45.360]   ports much, much more quickly. This is what when a government makes something in a national
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:49.760]   priority on the order of putting a person on the moon, this is the sort of things that happen.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:53.520]   And there are negatives to that as well. And we're also seeing a lot of follow-up by that
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:58:00.000]   Japan as part of their COVID response, emergency funds. They're underwriting help for Japanese
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.080]   companies that want to move their operations and want to move their manufacturing out of China
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:11.360]   for exactly that reason. But yeah, it'll be tough for them to do, but it's definitely overdue for them
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:18.000]   to put some other manufacturing outside of this one country where you might find yourself in a
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.640]   human rights. Particularly when you might find yourself in a human rights situation sometime in
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:28.240]   the next one to seven years, that's going to make you not have a lot of answers for people
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:31.200]   who are saying, why are you still doing business with these people?
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:38.720]   Interestingly, Wistron, which is one of the people involved in iPhone manufacture,
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:47.360]   is it Taiwanese company just got sold to a Chinese company Luxshare for $472 million.
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:55.680]   So it can go both ways. I don't know if Apple had anything to do with that acquisition,
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:59.440]   probably not. I wonder if they were if they gulped a little bit when they saw it.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:08.480]   I mean, you always want to have some sort of reciprocal threat. Right now,
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:14.240]   people think Apple is vulnerable because China owns all the capacity to produce these phones,
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:18.080]   but Apple's a huge part of the economy. And without Apple, they're hugely damaging. And that's
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:24.400]   one of the few things that can still affect the Chinese government. They're insulated against a
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:30.560]   lot of factors, but economic downturn takes down many a government. So the threat of losing Apple's
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:36.000]   economy is still in the Sanjian area, is still harsh. But if Apple has multiple venues to assemble
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:43.600]   as well, then that's just one more arrow in there, when they're talking about trade with China.
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:50.240]   I should point out that Wistron is owned by a Taiwanese company, but actually manufacturers
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:55.680]   in Kunshan, which is next to Shanghai, it's in mainland China. So maybe that doesn't change very
[00:59:55.680 --> 01:00:01.920]   much in terms of where the phone is manufactured. Just who owns those actually isn't Foxconn,
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:06.400]   Taiwanese company? I think it is. And Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.240]   TSMC is yeah. Yeah. So
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:16.160]   anyway, I would also be nervous. This is a geopolitical discussion, which we're not
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:22.560]   qualified to enter, but we've never stopped us. I would also be nervous.
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:26.960]   You can be along with China as anybody. Yeah. I mean, at some point,
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:34.000]   China's never liked it that Taiwan's independent. You could see how they've slowly merged Hong Kong
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.680]   back into the Chinese sphere. I wonder how I think Taiwan would be a lot more difficult
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:43.680]   politically. And Thompson's been doing a lot of good writing about this lately.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.680]   What does he what he lives in Taiwan? What does he think? Yeah. Well, I mean, one of the things he
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.760]   did recently was he said we always frame our discussions about China from a Western point of
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.720]   view. Right. I love that article. Yeah. The Chinese point of view is very, very different.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.520]   Where is our co-water? Which says we should ban TikTok.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:06.400]   But not let Facebook buy it. It was a double edged sword there. But yeah,
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:12.080]   you know that these are rhetorical. We tend to think that we'll send Beatles tapes and
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.960]   blue jeans to every country on earth. And that will cause them to become westernized where he's
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:23.680]   saying you're like these are tools that they're using to achieve goals. Their ideology is purposeful.
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.280]   You know, and that's very different than the way that we implemented. And it's to our peril.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:31.920]   If we sort of conflate what we think is like a winning strategy with the game with the actual
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:36.800]   game that they are playing. We're playing two different games. Really. And that's the problem.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:43.280]   We brought a knife to a gunfight. We also can't we also can't overlook the history of trade with
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:50.160]   China where it's been foreign companies essentially trying to inflict misery upon China, its government
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:57.600]   and its people for the benefit of foreign companies. And this is deeply, deeply ingrained in the history
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.240]   of the country that say, well, we're not going to let that happen again, are we?
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:05.600]   When you have when you have it, it's soft power. Not even China, the hand nation,
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:10.720]   which is a small part of, well, I don't know, it's part of China, but it's not China and that
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:15.440]   creates its own dynamics. No, but I think China has been very adept at manipulating soft power and
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.720]   they're using economics to do it. And they've been very effective. And you're right. We think,
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:25.040]   well, we'll just do, you know, we'll just do the voice of America and send them blue jeans
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:29.520]   and they'll go capitalism. It's a great thing. And they've been very good at like blocking any
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:36.640]   form of Western influence and also making it almost stigmatizing Western attempts to discuss
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:41.840]   how China should be doing things. But they have been fearless and like relentless in saying NBA
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:46.560]   don't do like in saying how they want Western companies to behave and that, you know, that
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:52.640]   is not going to do a treat for a long time. No, but if you think about if you're Chinese in China,
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:59.440]   just like we're patriotic, look what happened with Huawei as soon as Huawei got cut off from a
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:05.280]   America. Now they're not going to be able to buy chips from TSMC. But it didn't hurt their profits
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:12.080]   because in China, they suddenly exploded because of it on music and Google Play Store in China,
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:16.960]   either. Yeah, but it didn't matter. Right. Because they didn't care. The market didn't care. And
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:23.760]   it didn't hurt them at all in China. So I have a feeling it's a, you know, as I said, we're not
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:29.200]   geopolitical experts, but it is a complicated story. And I'm sure it is some good people working
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:34.720]   on it. Yeah, it and it gets more complicated, like, especially with the way the government is
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:40.640]   is treating Muslims. I mean, when you've ever, when you when you start to have like secret footage of
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:45.920]   we're Muslims being blindfolded, kneeling and being loaded under trains,
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:52.320]   that becomes something where it's a very, very powerful stink that you need to that
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:56.560]   company needs to address. They're not responsible for anything that happens inside that country.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:03.040]   But if you're contributing that much to a certain economy, you can't claim that your hands are
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:10.720]   completely clean. And it's been sort of like to bet over the year, like it's become a thing where
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:14.800]   like, you can't talk about Tiananmen, you can't talk about Tibet, you can't talk about. There's
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:22.560]   just, there's almost becoming like a, I don't like a purposeful decent desensitization to what you're
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:30.080]   allowed to talk to China about. It's so, I'm so glad I'm a diplomat. It's a very complicated
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:37.600]   conversation. And to be fair, I'm glad that I'm not a business person. Yeah. It's, you don't,
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:42.640]   you don't really, it's not as though you have a great many options because if a country controls
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:48.000]   a certain resource that you absolutely need, it's not like you're just shaving 10 cents off of a
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.600]   $40 product by going with this supplier instead of this supplier. And you also realize that as a
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:05:00.400]   as a prime influencer in the economy, perhaps you do have the ability to say, to, to, at least in the
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:04.320]   way that you do business with this country to say, okay, well, here's how the factories that
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:10.000]   do business with us are going to run and you're going to help us be able to run this factory and
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.440]   run this business the way that we want it to be run. We're going to make sure that people get paid
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:17.600]   correctly, people get breaks correctly, people have their rights, rights honored, and hopefully
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:21.280]   have some sort of influence on that. But when it comes down to, do you want to make it, do you want
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:26.400]   to be able to manufacture and sell consumer electronics, or do you not want to be able to do that until
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:33.120]   2034 at the very earliest? You just got to. And not to be, not to be false equivalency guy, but
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:36.880]   also you get to a point where the minute that starts happening, people in America go, well,
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:41.120]   why don't you care about what's happening to native populations or indigenous populations here,
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:47.120]   or what's happening along the border? You know, they, again, not geopolitical geniuses by any
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:51.600]   measure, but there's enough, there's enough humanity to go around.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:57.200]   I hope that one of the things that sticks from 2020 is the idea that corporations do have
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:02.320]   responsibility for at least what happens within their own companies, that they can't, they can't
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:07.040]   control how workers are being treated in another nation, they can control the diversity of the
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:11.280]   people in their executive suites, they can't control how they're treating their own workers,
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:16.880]   they can control their impact upon the country that they're the countries that they're operating in,
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:21.840]   and that it's no longer a throw your hands up in the air. So, well, what can you do?
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:26.480]   Well, you can actually, as a group, say that, you know, it just-
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.000]   That football team to change his name.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.200]   Yeah, no, exactly. And you know what, if just just the other day, one of the board members of
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.920]   one of the most influential and prestigious like opera grants, like they have an opera
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:46.320]   competition every year for like the greatest, for basically upcoming talent, and it's a very,
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:52.720]   very prestigious award. And one of the, the son of the artist that the fund was actually named after
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:58.800]   decided a mouth off on Facebook about thugs and how the police should crack down. And within two
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:05.360]   days, all the star performers that were like supporters on their boards and all of the people
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:09.840]   who were concerned and say, okay, guess what? We are pulling our support 100% until you get this
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:16.160]   guy off of your board. And 24 hours later, he was off the board. It's nice to know that collectively,
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:21.440]   we have people have a voice and that they can actually make things done. It's sad that the
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:26.240]   Washington football team only finally decides that perhaps we should do something about this
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:31.680]   filthy racist name when federal Express says, hi, we control your destiny.
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.920]   It's too long to think. And we're not going to have it anymore. Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:41.360]   Actually, if you want to add another country to this, you know, both Google and Facebook have
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:51.280]   just made massive investments into geo, which is a Indian telephony company. And actually,
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:57.040]   Reliance geo is the Reliance is a parent, parent company. And I think Google has Google and Facebook
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:03.840]   both have 10% equity now in Reliance geo. They are clearly seeing India. If look, if we can't get into
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:09.200]   Google's had trouble getting into China, Facebook too, we can't get into China. You know, there's 1.1
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:17.840]   billion people in India too. That's a very big market with with fewer, you know, political issues,
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:22.880]   certainly. What is that? I don't even know. I mean, Apple sells phones in India.
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:27.600]   Yeah, they're working on producing them there so they can get them into retail outlets there. But
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:31.920]   it's a it's a I think it's a longer play than Apple originally anticipated. Right. Yeah,
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.560]   right. And that's one of the reasons Google bought stake in geo. They're going they current
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:43.600]   geo phones inexpensive, very popular phones. I think they've sold 30 million in India run on
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:49.680]   something called KaiOS, which ghouls an investor in, but it's kind of a medium, not smart, not dumb
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:54.400]   kind of medium phone. And I think they would like to get Android go on all of those phones. And I
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:57.920]   imagine that's one of the reasons. But even like their business works on scale, like Apple's works
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:02.800]   on profit scale, Google's works on deployment scale. And the more they can get any form of
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:07.680]   Google software on any phone or operating system, like they they eyeballs at what matters to them.
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:11.840]   They're not precious or religious like they obviously like you to be using Android, but
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.360]   you know, we've they've got Chrome browser on Windows and on Mac. That's right. That's right.
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:21.520]   They just want the user data. It's super significant. It's in our patch. I, you know, is from that
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:25.600]   region, he understands the problems of technology in that region that every single part of the
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:29.840]   cut you can't you can't make one phone or one product and expect that it's going to solve the
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:34.320]   problems that are that are universal because there are no universal problems. You have you can deploy
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:39.520]   a phone in one country that has built full digital telephony infrastructure within the last 15,
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:45.680]   20 years from the ground up where everything is like anybody in my office right now, I would be
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:50.000]   very, very happy to have the the bandwidth that's anybody in Tokyo has on their phone.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:56.160]   In some places, the way that the way that broadband is deployed, the way that it's metered,
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:00.560]   the way this charged for this is this is why this is why Google,
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:07.360]   Google's Go apps were such a big deal to say not just to be able to run on less expensive hardware,
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:12.400]   but with the awareness that every single byte of data that's being transmitted
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:17.680]   is a not terribly not necessarily reliable in all places and be very, very expensive. So
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.040]   we're going to do everything that this operating these versions of these apps and this version of
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:25.520]   the operating system is going to do everything it can to communicate as little as possible
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:30.320]   with the outside world. But how they how they still manage to send as much tracking data
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:35.360]   as it does like off the desktop in the United States, I don't know. But that's the sort of
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:40.960]   VEM phones member. They were just almost zero data proxy VBM phones for a long time in Africa.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:46.800]   Just to put it in perspective, there are 1.1 billion mobile phone users in India.
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:54.800]   And there are 22 different, they call them telecom circles with multiple carriers in each.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:11:02.240]   It is a complex market. That's right, because you can go across circles easily within a city.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:09.120]   So this is clearly a market you'd love to have participate in with 1.1 billion users,
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:13.600]   but a very complicated market as well. No, it's incredible. This is why you
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:18.640]   sometimes every now and then there's a story about the iPhone or another phone saying,
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:23.360]   hey, did you know that this phone that this phone actually has FM radio receiver
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:27.600]   hardware in it? It's just not being activated by the operating system. It's like, well, yes,
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.640]   that's because in certain parts of the world, one of the biggest to get the most efficient way
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:37.760]   to get news and particularly like soccer scores and cricket scores is through radio.
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:41.440]   And so if you want to sell a phone in this market, it better be able to receive FM radio
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:45.920]   broadcast. That's how interesting these individualized markets are.
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:51.840]   Do you think it's impossible for Apple to penetrate that market with any of it's existing products?
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:56.480]   They're probably too expensive and they're not capable enough, right?
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:02.400]   They don't have it as a radio. It's going to be tough.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:07.680]   They have TV on their phones. Yeah, right. I'm really convinced that Apple can do anything
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.480]   that it decides is an important thing for the company to do. And sometimes I use that as a
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:16.560]   well. So then why aren't you putting Apple watches in the hands of Android users?
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:20.800]   But it's also that if they really decided that they want to create a really good competitive
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:25.680]   market or if they were in a part of the world where they don't think that the phones,
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:29.600]   if they were part of the world in which they looked at what was available to users there
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:35.760]   and has a, here's a problem that all of these people across a wide, wide spectrum are having
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:39.360]   with their technology. Here's something we could do to address that and create a great business
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:43.440]   for ourselves. I think they would absolutely have the ability to do that. Even if I'm not
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:46.880]   sure if they would ever go so far as to create a completely regionalized product,
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:51.920]   that's something that I would love to see them try to do. I would love to see them try to do a
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:57.360]   folk. I mean, just as a just as a spectator, not as necessarily a shareholder, which I'm not.
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:02.320]   But it would be great to simply say, we're not going to build a phone that could conceivably
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:09.200]   be shipped everywhere. We're going to create that weird kind of offshoot animal where it has
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:14.320]   like a nose that's like a foot long and eight inches wide and it has six legs and it has
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:19.440]   vestigial wings because in that one, the Lylon that was never discovered by rats or cats,
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:24.800]   but it is, but does have snakes and flying and flying predators. This is the creature that can
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:29.280]   survive and thrive in that one environment. I would love to see Apple make a product like that that
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:35.440]   is so focused on one region, but you get a good idea of exactly what their design principles
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:41.040]   and whether the design chops actually are. Let's take a little break. When we come back,
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:49.040]   we'll find something else. There's a lot of rumors. I guess we could I hate delving too deep into
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:53.840]   rumors, but what the heck there's not going to be like the reliable ones from the total.
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:14:00.160]   Okay, we'll do that. Crazy one. The rumors scorecard coming up next. I all I really care about is,
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:05.600]   when can I get Apple Silicon on my desktop? I want I would like that MacBook or a new I-Man.
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:08.640]   I thought you were going to say, when can you get express espresso pouring out of your lightning
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:12.240]   port? But like, yeah, we're taking this in stages. I had never even thought it's not.
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:17.040]   You have that right now just for espresso into the keyboard. The key word to come right at that
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:23.280]   lightning port. I'll show today brought to you by Roman. If you are suffering, guys, I know,
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:30.720]   I know we're taught to be stoic. We're taught to put up with it to to walk it off. We remember
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:36.640]   little league you get hit by a ball and it hurts like hell. No crying in baseball. Walk it off.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.600]   Rub some dirt in it. It'll be better. And that as we grow up,
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:47.520]   honestly, teaches us a bad habit, which is when we need help, we don't seek it. And the last thing
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:52.800]   most guys ever want to do is go to the doctor, especially if it's about a condition that's kind
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:15:00.400]   of embarrassing. You don't want to tell anybody, for instance, that you're suffering from erectile
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:06.480]   dysfunction. You know, bad enough that she knows what you don't want to tell some stranger
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:13.200]   that's why Romans here for the last couple of years, Roman, his building and building this amazing
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:20.000]   digital platform that connects you with a doctor licensed in your state. It's not just ED,
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:27.200]   not just sexual health hair, skin, dandruff, eczema, supplements, daily health, prostate health,
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:34.560]   bone health, they've got stuff for guys that guys often are too ashamed to ask about.
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:41.680]   Help is here in a supportive environment that's not humiliating or embarrassing.
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:46.720]   Anybody who's dealt with erectile dysfunction knows how awkward it could be to talk about it in
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:51.920]   person. But this is the convenient, simple solution to get the treatment you need without leaving
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:59.680]   the couch. It's so convenient. Just grab your phone, grab your computer, complete a free online
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:06.240]   visit. You'll hear back from a US licensed physician within 24 hours. And it's a real, by the way,
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:12.080]   it's not a pro forma. Oh, yeah. Okay. What do you need? I'll write a prescription. It's a real doctor
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:17.600]   who cares about your health, who will talk to you about your health and talk to you about your
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:25.200]   treatment. That that kind of comes from Romans DNA, because it was started by a father and son,
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:32.720]   the son, who's the founder, suffered from ED in his 20s. And fortunately, his father,
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:37.360]   it was a men's health doctor, he could talk to him. His father said, "That's unusual at your age.
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.280]   We better get you a workup." They found out he had undiagnosed heart disease,
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:47.920]   had several surgeries. He's fine now. But that lesson taught him that it's important to talk to
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:53.600]   a doctor. He felt fortunate that it could be his dad. Now you can get that same kind of advice.
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:58.320]   This is not a doctor who's just there, you know, filling in some hours. This is a doctor who
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.720]   cares about you, who will help you find the right treatment. See, all of the conditions,
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:07.200]   heart health, bone health, stress relief, prostate health, testosterone, support. Actually,
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:11.360]   I'm taking their testosterone supplements. As you get older, that becomes an issue. I love them.
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:16.720]   You get free unlimited follow-ups with your doctor anytime. You have questions or want to
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:22.080]   adjust your treatment plan. With Roman, there's no commitments you can cancel at any time. Yes,
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:27.680]   they offer generics so you can save money. They're just great. I just think they're great. Roman is
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:35.120]   a source of wellness, giving men something that we, frankly, really need. Somebody to listen,
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.400]   somebody who'll talk with us, somebody who'll get us the help we need. There's no reason to
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:46.160]   suffer in silence. Go to getromen.com/macbreak for your free online visit and free 2-day shipping.

[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:16.560]   Apple did say Apple Silicon will come this year. Am I mistaken? A system. A system. A system.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:24.640]   The rumors have been a 13-inch MacBook Pro and an iMac. Which one would you
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:27.920]   of the two do you think is most likely? I would say the laptop, right?
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:33.680]   Yeah, that would be my guess. Total guess. Especially because one of the big benefits of
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:39.360]   Apple Silicon is power per watt. Wouldn't it be cool if Apple could come out and say,
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:44.400]   hey, we got a laptop. It's great. It performs better than our existing 13-inch MacBook Pro.
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:48.480]   You get 32 gigs of RAM, whatever. And oh, by the way, 20-hour battery life.
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.720]   Line-up.
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:55.280]   Line-up was very kind and let me do an epic rant on iMore about, because I saw a lot of people
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:00.640]   going, oh, it's really just Mac on ARM. I'm going, yeah, yeah, AMD is really just PC on x86.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:07.040]   Because when you look at what they did and you start breaking down, especially that one slide
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:11.040]   where they showed, it wasn't the real SOC, but they kind of showed you what they were doing.
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:17.040]   And they're making a family of SOCs for the Mac. But I think ARM is great. I would think one day,
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:22.080]   maybe Apple will release Swift architecture instruction set, but whatever. It's great,
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:26.880]   but it is only the instruction set of the CPU. And Apple is making the entire system.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.960]   It's like x86. It's not what--
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:29.440]   Yes.
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.200]   It's a compatibility thing.
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:36.480]   Yes. It's not like if you build a gaming machine, you might have an x86 CPU, but you've also got
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:41.760]   that monster Nvidia card. You've got all this, like, all this RAM. And the SOC is really all
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:47.440]   those things. And Apple takes it to ludicrous extremes. If you remember the A13 unveil,
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:55.360]   they had like OLED display accelerators and H.265 accelerators and storage controllers and machine
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:00.160]   learning controllers that don't only dispatch between the neural engine, but between Apple
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:06.000]   accelerators on the machine learning cores and the CPU. The amount of custom silicon they're
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:11.920]   bringing there is way beyond just the ARM CPUs. It's like the ARM CPUs are a nice little bullet
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:15.520]   chicken on the side of the buffet, but that entire table is going to be very full.
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:19.760]   So Apple, and you point this out in your article, has an architecture license.
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:21.680]   That is--
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:21.680]   Yes.
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:25.920]   It's mind-to-face. It's mind-to-face. It's beyond architecture license. They have probably the most
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.840]   liberal license that you can get from ARM.
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:33.280]   They basically have the right to say this. This is an ARM compatible chip is what they're paying.
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:35.360]   Which doesn't mean anything because nobody else needs to--
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:37.600]   Like, there's not like other people making Apple chips.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.360]   Well, they can do what they want.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:42.720]   It's only meaningful. And Apple didn't make a point of this if you wanted to run
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:47.760]   Linux on it, for instance. And there's Linux on ARM. I guess there's Windows on ARM,
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:51.760]   although Paul Therat says it's really more Windows on Qualcomm because it's so dependent on
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:57.600]   the Qualcomm chipset. I wonder if what Apple does will be incompatible with
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:00.080]   other ARM operating systems.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:03.600]   Well, I would argue that it goes beyond that, that it doesn't matter because if they decide
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:07.520]   it's in their best interest to have Linux on ARM running, they can just make sure they have the
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:10.240]   right silicon for that. Because we've already seen that they--
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:13.920]   You have a little part of the chip that's the Linux section?
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:18.880]   They could do-- They have a hypervisor accelerator in there just so that when you do virtual
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:21.600]   machines, you'll have much less of an overhead hit.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:25.600]   And I wouldn't be surprised if every single thing that they want to be performant on those
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:29.200]   computers because they're going to want to get the best first impression ever
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:34.240]   has specific silicon accelerating it beyond what any Cortex-core ever could be.
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:40.080]   How important is it to Apple that Linux runs on Apple Silicon? Is it important at all?
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:41.280]   A list of 1,200?
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:42.560]   Two?
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:47.360]   The only reason it's important is there is a segment of the population,
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:54.480]   sys admins, developers who need Linux. I mean, there's also a portion of the population
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.960]   in these windows and they're kind of ignoring them.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:02.160]   Maybe this is an important-- Maybe they-- In fact, why do ARM at all? Why don't you say,
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.600]   "Look, this is--"
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:09.520]   I do think one day if it's in their best-- So I think Johnny Saruji explained it really well.
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:13.520]   They want to do absolutely everything they can to provide a differentiated experience,
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:17.280]   but trying to do everything would be arrogant because there are ways that you will just face
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:21.280]   plant if you try to reinvent something only for the sake of reinventing it.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:25.360]   And I think they're going to move to ARM V9. I think that's my guess because they haven't said
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:31.920]   anything, but ARM V9 comes out curiously around the same time that Mac Silicon is supposed to come out.
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:36.880]   And there's a variety of other technologies that should be ready, like the USB 4,
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:43.120]   and just a variety of next generation technologies that all line up really, really nicely with the
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:47.440]   Apple Silicon SOCs that should give us really, I think, better performance in every
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:53.360]   vector than what we're anticipating. So you make a really strong case in this article
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:56.320]   that compatibility with something else is not important.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:23:02.320]   I mean, I guess what would they have to be? Where would they face plant?
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:08.240]   Devices like you've got to have printer support? No, because that's all in software.
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:15.360]   Where would they care about compatibility? Honestly, now that I think about it, they did
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:21.280]   mention Linux, but what do they care? They have a Unix. You can't hear me?
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:28.320]   I can hear you. I can hear you as well. It's him. It's you, it's you, Renee.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:35.440]   Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, again, getting that fixed. I don't, I don't think that
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:41.520]   Linux has to be a big deal for, for Max and if going on to the future, because what Edmonds
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:45.840]   needed, but they would, I think that they were be okay with doing it as a virtual machine,
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:52.160]   or VNCing into a remote machine. The people who are using Linux as a command line sort of thing,
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:56.240]   they, they, they don't want just simply compatibility. They want to be able to run
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:24:00.560]   full bore Linux. If you want Linux, you can get Linux easy. Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:04.960]   Yeah, a lot cheaper hardware too, by the way. I'm wondering, I'm wondering if their choice of
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:10.000]   the first computer isn't most constrained by what is the, what would be mechanically the easiest
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:16.560]   thing for us to retrofit at this juncture? Because if I, if my, my outside of opinion is that if they
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:22.000]   were to pick one machine to be the debut, to be the debutante of this platform, it really should be
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.680]   the MacBook nothing to be because Apple has some really, really super fast machines out there. So
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:32.480]   they're not really going to impress a lot of people by saying, here's how fast our new, our new
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:37.760]   silicon is just as fast as our old fast machines. But if they can have again, the super light,
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:43.520]   super transportable, like iPad sized version of the back that like you said, instead of having
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:49.680]   eight to 11 hours of battery life now gets 15 to 20 hours of battery life. Not only will that be
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:55.440]   the absolute stellar banner thing to say, and here, here's something that is everybody can absolutely
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:00.880]   understand about the benefit of this shift to this new silicon. And not only that, but the people
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:06.320]   who are running that, they're not necessarily expecting supreme con performance. They're expecting
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:10.960]   supreme convenience. And so the sort of apps that they're going to be using are probably going to be
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:17.280]   the sort of apps that are going to be the easiest to modify to take advantage of Apple silicon.
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:23.040]   And also the ones that are going to be the first ones out. So I would be,
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:28.880]   it would be, it would be surprising to me if it were one of the pro line machines, because those
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:32.320]   are the people, those are the consumers that are going to say, okay, let's start off with these
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:36.080]   benchmark scores. And let's see how long it takes for me to build this project.
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:41.680]   Obviously, Apple's going to have X code and pro tools and final cut running fine.
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:46.240]   Isn't there a risk though? Don't you want to prove to pros that because there is this misconception
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:52.080]   that arm is low, low functionality as well as low power? Don't you want to prove to them? No,
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:56.080]   no, you know what? We can make a very good pro machine. That's a pretty high priority.
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:01.760]   I would be thrilled if they made a Mac book and fix the keyboard and then put it on silicon,
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:07.280]   Apple silicon with 20 hour battery life, I'd be thrilled. But I think there is going to be
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:15.680]   pressure on Apple to stop the existing designs completely and have completely new designs with
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:18.880]   Apple silicon. Laurie, you sounded like you wanted a Mac book, nothing.
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:26.240]   Well, I just agree that this is probably the first Mac that Apple will put on.
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:31.520]   It's easiest. Yeah. And just like Andy saying, you're not going to impress people
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:37.280]   with having the Mac book pro be a little more pro. You're going to impress people with having
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:45.840]   their bottom baseline Mac just skyrocket to a new level plus. Pros aren't going to buy the first
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:49.360]   iteration of an Apple silicon Mac. They're going to be scared of something like that. They're going
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:54.880]   to hold off. So you want to sell it to people who aren't as invested in whatever silicon is on a
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:59.440]   chip. They don't care. They just want a computer. This computer will work fine. They don't even
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:07.200]   know the difference between one chip or another. So it's the perfect computer for Apple to do this
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:16.640]   on to impress us with what they've done and not scare people that have more demands of their
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:20.320]   software and their processors and things like that. We got Renee back.
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:27.440]   Yes. You think that's what it's going to be? I don't think it's going to be a Mac book, nothing.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:32.560]   I really don't. My guess is that they're going to smooth the transition.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:37.360]   Like when they went to our PC to that's too slow. Yeah, when they went from power PC to Intel,
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:41.840]   they didn't change designs. Like even the Mac, like they just dropped the G4 name and changed it to
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:46.320]   the Mac pro name. And it was the same cheese grater. I think part of that is they don't want to
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:50.960]   Osborne things too hard out the gate because if it looks too far, that's a good point.
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:54.240]   People aren't going to buy those Intel Macs and they're still selling it.
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:58.000]   Are they just in timing? Aren't they just in timing production? I mean,
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:03.360]   this is a very different time than 20 years ago. But it's going to take like a year to two years
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:07.280]   to make the new Macs. I don't think they're going to. I think yes, they want people to anticipate
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:12.960]   the new Apple Silicon Macs, but not so hard that no one buys a Mac in between now and 20.
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:17.520]   If I'm Tim Cook, I want to make a clear demarcation between the old and the new.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:24.560]   Let me just say this is my sales pitch. Let's see if I can convince you guys.
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:31.600]   I'm a hardcore believer that Apple Silicon will be the best SOC ever made that it will kick
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:37.040]   the butt, not only of Intel, but of Qualcomm and Exynos and every other arm chip.
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:40.640]   I'm not going to use the word arm because we're going to make something so good
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:45.360]   that people will go, this is what a computer is. It will leave the rest in the dust.
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:52.560]   I do not want to do legacy designs because I want to be very clear when you walk into the coffee shop
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:59.760]   or you have the new one. That's what you want. You also want to reassure pros because really,
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:10.080]   frankly, who buys Macs anymore? Right? I mean, it's either luxury buyers, old timers like us,
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:16.800]   or pros who want the Unix shell underneath. You want to impress that most important market that,
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:20.400]   yes, Apple Silicon, you want to say this is the best computer you could buy.
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:26.720]   What would the ultimate flex be making a 13-inch MacBook Pro that's even thinner than the current
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:31.840]   Intel version that's cooler, that has much longer battery life, and maybe doesn't even have a fan.
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:34.000]   Yes. And you're like, no bezels now.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:40.960]   And no bezels. You make it completely different. So it's important to be
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:45.200]   recognizably different when you walk into that coffee shop. It's completely different.
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:52.080]   And you reassure everybody by making the worst thing you could make right now is an interim device
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:57.120]   that's kind of like a Mac, but it's kind of like the Intel ones, but it's a little bit better.
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:00.800]   No, you don't want that. You want to make it come on? You want shucking off.
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:09.200]   Yeah. I don't know. I think that I don't think anybody who has a MacBook Pro is wishing it were
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:13.760]   thinner. I think that would be visually, it would be a good marketing angle, but I don't think that
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:21.440]   will cause anybody to buy lack of fans. I think that that's a big deal, but only people who know
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:27.760]   what they know the importance of fans know that, well, look, if I've got if one of the chances
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:30.960]   that this silicon is going to have to throttle down because it's overheating.
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:33.760]   That's why I said 13 inch stay far away from the 50.
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:39.360]   That's why I think that Laurie had a good point that I think that most of the people who are
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:44.000]   investing in pro level equipment, they're going to be cautious because for them, if they make
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.600]   a mistake, that's going to cost them a lot of money. That's why they may not buy it.
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:50.000]   At least they might not buy it. People like me will buy it.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:55.120]   No, no, that's right. You're right. Alex Lindsay, they're not selling it to Alex Lindsay,
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:59.280]   but they're going to sell it to me. And then Alex will say, how's that run? Oh, it really runs well.
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:02.480]   And then Alex will buy the next thing. Well, you know, by both, we know that.
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:07.760]   Well, what Alex is a bad example for that reason, but the pros, I honestly,
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:13.600]   if you made first of all, wasn't the Mac book a flop, honestly, the Mac book nothing.
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:17.440]   Why did they make it once and never make it? I mean, they updated it.
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:21.920]   Well, see that's that's that's another thing that I'm thinking about that it hasn't had a major
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:26.160]   redesign in a long time. They've been giving it incremental internal upgrades.
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:28.800]   But if like Renee said, they want I'm sorry, I think it was Renee.
[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:30.800]   If there were a market for it, they would be updating it.
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:33.920]   Well, they never got like four M was a disaster. Like it was a
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:37.440]   they could really that's right. They couldn't make it better because of Intel,
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:40.800]   actually. That was the reason. And they were stuck with that crap keyboard.
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:43.440]   I don't know if you could make something that's in with a better keyboard.
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:47.040]   So that's why I think dump the Mac book.
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:49.360]   Old.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:55.360]   I think also get it made a perfect Mac book 13. That's almost as thin that gets 20 hours of battery
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:32:00.400]   life that's faster, better, no bezels. We'll give you a 12 inch and a 14 inch.
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:04.720]   You can choose Leo. Yeah. The other argument against what I'm saying is that Apple can be
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:08.000]   saying that people who really, really want the battery life and really, really want something
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.960]   that in compact, we're going to try to steer them into a 10 inch 10 inch iPad Pro, particularly
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:17.120]   with the new keyboard that they got with it. That's a point. Yeah, you don't want to analyze that.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:20.800]   Yeah. So that's that's why I wanted to make that great argument against myself or someone.
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:27.040]   Which do you really want, Andy, when you really wrought a perfect Mac book Pro 13
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:34.960]   over a Mac book? Nothing. Yes. If it were about realize that perfect Mac book Pro 13 would also
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:39.600]   have a SD card slot and would probably have a slightly better keyboard. But I think I better
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:44.160]   have a better keyboard because I'm not that's the Mac book was a startup for that. My my constant
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:52.160]   dream is for Apple to always have like a $949 Mac book of some kind. So that people can people
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:58.080]   who have a reasonable budget for a Windows notebook can talk themselves into well, what if I find
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:03.040]   a little bit more money in the budget and buy something that will probably last a lot longer than
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:09.120]   the 600 or 700 dollar resources. Because the first app, the first Mac books are going to be expensive
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:14.320]   because the initial outpouring of resources for Apple Silicon is going to be a super expensive
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:18.800]   bet. But if it goes like two, three years, what if they can start doing what they did with the
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:23.360]   iPad and that's like the first Mac book is a thousand dollars. But then three years from now,
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:27.840]   they're like, and now we're introducing this new Mac book for education and it's $500.
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:35.120]   That was actually like, you raise an interesting point. I think Apple should absorb the R&D costs
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:40.000]   and not build that into the price yet. That's an interesting question.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.840]   I think you'll maintain price to pay it off. And then once it's paid down, they'll start
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:46.560]   they'll start doing what they've done with iPhones and an iPad.
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:50.320]   If you really wanted to get the world excited about a Mac book pro 13 and you could
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:56.640]   at you know, with all of the benefits we just described, bezel this 20 hour battery life,
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:01.680]   it's thinner. It doesn't have to be as thin as a Mac book 5G 5G. Oh, and by the way, it starts at
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:07.120]   $949. Now there is savings in the long run and making your own silicon, right?
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:11.200]   In the long run, but they're going to if they put the stuff into it that we all want them,
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:15.360]   it's the same thing with like the Galaxy 20 Ultra and the one plus eight. It's like,
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:18.400]   we want you to add all this stuff and then like, what did you do to the price?
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:22.400]   So it's like, if we get like the two depth camera for face ID, it's a couple hundred,
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:26.400]   like it's like a hundred bucks and they add in like whatever it turns out to be to put
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:30.720]   Thunderbolt four USB four and whatever it turns out to be to have the bezel is designed. Like
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:34.160]   it's just the bill. I think they're going to eat into that bill of goods pretty quickly and the
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:38.240]   pricing will stay the same until they pay it down. Lori, can I sell you a MacBook 13 instead?
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:45.200]   Yeah, because all of the things that you're talking about point to this possibility that Apple's
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:50.160]   going to bring back the Mac book and they're going to make it ultra cheap because if the only thing
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:55.760]   they do, they keep the same chassis as the Mac book. Yeah. And all they do is replace it with
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:35:00.160]   the Apple silicon. They can drop the price of that. They can keep it low. They're not going to put
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:04.400]   it in their new camera. They're not going to put in a new keyboard. I'm sorry. They're going to keep
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:08.880]   it exactly the way or maybe maybe a new keyboard. I mean, because really,
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:16.480]   let's be honest. But they could do that and they could drop the price of the new Mac book with
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:23.440]   Apple silicon is now coming in at 899 or some like crazy cheap price that I think they could
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:29.440]   actually get away with. And just like you're saying, they would eat the cost of that research
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:36.000]   and development for that first computer, but also to Renee's point when they start putting it,
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.400]   because we're talking about the first Mac. We're not talking about the rest of the lineup.
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:47.680]   And if they wow us and surprise us with something that is sort of just a step up,
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:52.640]   but it's cheap and it's fast, I think that's going to win a lot of people over. And what's the one
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:59.920]   big complaint that a lot of people have about access to Mac? It's the cost. And right now,
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:05.600]   I think we all understand that Apple has built a huge loyal following in a younger generation of
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:10.960]   people, millennials and zoomers. I'm sorry that to use those phrases to people who don't like
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:17.440]   having labels on their generation, but it's been there's research done that they prefer
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:23.040]   Apple products over things that aren't Apple products. And so Apple won their hearts,
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:28.000]   but they can't afford it. They didn't win their wallets. So they might be able to get those kids
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.800]   who won an iPhone more than anything else to also get them back if they can keep that price down.
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:37.920]   >> I'll just point out the iPhone 10 came before the iPhone 11. I think that's generally how they're
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:42.240]   going to roll. >> Yeah. Well, the thousand-dollar phone came before the $600 phone.
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:49.520]   >> Yeah. >> I guess my basic point is that I think that the first Mac to ship with Apple Silicon
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:54.240]   for everyone that they sell that they sell to people, there's going to be a thousand people
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:58.880]   watching to see what happens to the people who buy them. And so that will help people next year
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:01.200]   to buy the one thing- >> That's why you make it the best right-time.
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:04.400]   >> And I think your analogy is excellent- >> That's one point of view.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:08.480]   >> Yeah. >> That your analogy is excellent Renee. What did they do with the iPhone 10?
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:14.720]   Because that was also a discontinuity in the iPhones, right? I don't know if anybody remembers,
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:17.280]   but we were talking about the iPhone 10. We were talking about it. Things like,
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:22.560]   what if you threw price out the window? You said, "Let's make the best phone we could make."
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:27.360]   And we'll make it our 10th anniversary iPhone. And that's kind of what they did. Now it's kind of
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:33.040]   obscured by the fact that all the successor phones have been equal or better. But at the time,
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:37.280]   that's what they did. I bet you this is more an iPhone 10 moment where they say,
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:43.120]   >> Well, brand new. >> One argument I would make against that is that we're both,
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:47.280]   we're talking about the prices of iPads going down. We're talking about the prices of iPhones
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:52.800]   going down. Those are both markets in which Apple felt a lot of price pressure. Where the
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:58.960]   availability of really good $500 or $600 Android phones was really have, and particularly the way
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:05.520]   that Verizon and other co-markers were able to sell them in retail stores, was really telling Apple
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:11.840]   that we can't ignore this part of the middle market. The reason why there is a $299 iPad for
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:15.920]   education was because Apple was getting its lunch money stolen by Chromebooks and other
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:19.840]   machines that were both less expensive and more appropriate for education.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:25.120]   I don't believe that there's the same sort of competition for Macs because they really are a
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:30.320]   product in and of themselves. And if anything, we have seen that if Apple is given the choice between
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:40.240]   your $1800 MacBook year after year, version after version after version is always an $1800 MacBook,
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:46.080]   but it just becomes more powerful, more advanced features. They don't see you be interested in
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:52.880]   finding a way to make that $1800 MacBook for $1400 or $1500. >> They have a MacBook error for that.
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:57.600]   That seems to be like they have their price. People get confused by this, but it's not like
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:00.880]   Apple goes to the parts store, picks a bunch of parts and says, what can we charge for this?
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:05.200]   They're like, we need a computer that will eventually come in at $1000. What can we build within that
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:11.760]   pricing model to attain that? I think it will be, I think just like exactly to both your points,
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:16.640]   I think just like we saw with the iPhone and the iPad, Apple uses the highest end to be able to
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:21.920]   fund their technological dream experiments and then to sort of make that up to the market and to
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:25.920]   maintain average selling price, they then like one year later, two years later, start trickling
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:32.960]   that technology down the line until you have a 329 iPad and a 399 iPhone and a 199 Apple watch.
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:37.120]   And I'm hoping that that's sort of the model they follow with the MacBooks over time.
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:40.800]   >> That's what you do with a mature product. That's when you start chiseling away at the edges of
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:48.560]   that market. >> But isn't the Mac a mature product to some degree and especially if we're talking
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:54.080]   about a non-redesigned Mac, isn't that kind of what we're looking at right here? And I don't know,
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:58.880]   I just, I keep thinking like this is a really great opportunity for Apple to do something like this.
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:06.320]   What you're saying, Leo, the fastest, best completely redesigned zero bezel, completely
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:11.440]   different architecture, that's a dream, that's something we want because it sounds beautiful and
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:20.240]   wonderful. But I think this is an opportunity for Apple to really make waves by selling a Mac
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:26.080]   that is under, not just under $1,000, but like quite a bit under $1,000.
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:28.080]   >> But doesn't that cannibalize the iPad?
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:37.040]   >> You know, I've kind of always thought of them as two different things, but I'm not in the
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:42.000]   majority on that. So, but does Apple care about cannibalizing its own products? Because,
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.040]   you know, they want the iPad to succeed.
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:47.920]   >> I don't know, I think they want to cannibalize each other, but my thing is, I think they're
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:51.280]   going to want to, and this is a horrible thing to say, but I think it's true of most companies,
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:56.160]   it's why like an Android phone comes out at $1,000 is in on sale for $600 two months later,
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:59.840]   is that they want to extract as much money as possible from their best customers up front,
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:03.600]   because we're willing to pay anything to get the latest and greatest, the minute it's announced.
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:07.840]   And then it really quickly goes down to Mark Goodeck, we'll live right after that.
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:12.640]   >> And I have to be fair, Laurie, you did bust me because I'm just describing the machine I want.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:13.440]   >> Yeah.
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:15.280]   >> And coming up with reasons Apple should make.
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:24.160]   >> Yeah, I get that. I want that too. Like, actually, the first Mac that I want to be on
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:33.760]   Apple Silicon is an iMac with a completely new redesign with the iPad design language,
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:39.520]   and way smaller bezel. That's what I want, but I probably won't see that until late 2021,
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:43.760]   or maybe 2022. That's just the reality of the situation with that one.
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:51.200]   >> That's very true. I'm hoping that it'll be a Mac mini, because that's the design of Mac
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:54.640]   that I really have to use for in this office. And the one that I was probably going to be buying
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:57.200]   at the end of this year, had they not announced Apple Silicon this year.
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:58.480]   >> I can pretty much promise you.
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:00.640]   >> In my video, I used the Steve Jobs.
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:02.240]   >> Andy, go ahead.
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:09.600]   >> In my video, I used the pick that old 2010 footage of Steve Jobs picking up the black Apple TV.
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:14.400]   I mean, he picks up and goes, look, look how tiny it is. It's so tiny. And I'm just thinking,
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:17.040]   you know what Apple could do with Apple Silicon and Mac Mini?
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:17.360]   >> Yeah.
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:18.720]   >> So it's like a Mac and Apple TV.
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:22.080]   >> Oh, an Apple TV so it's been mini. Now you got me.
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:23.280]   >> Yeah.
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:28.000]   >> I've been saying that for a while that if Apple were able to create a Mac mini style with
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.480]   Mac, even if they were to say that there's the only limitation on this is that you're limited to
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:38.720]   apps from the Mac App Store, things where Apple can absolutely control what it can and can't run on.
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:44.800]   And they were able to price it competitively so that it would be a good the second your kids
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:50.000]   first computer doesn't have to be a second-end Windows machine. It could be a brand new $499
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:59.680]   or $349 Mac, even though all it has is a couple of USB-C ports and an ethernet port for connectivity.
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:02.160]   >> Can you imagine Mac Stadium with like eight of those per square foot?
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:03.360]   >> Yeah.
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:11.600]   >> Yeah. So Carsten has a thought. This is kind of like a Liger or a Camelope.
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:18.480]   What if you build a MacBook Pro that when you detach the screen turns into an iPad?
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:26.080]   >> That's a very Samsung idea. Maybe it's not bad but it's not Apple's idea of elegance.
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:31.120]   >> I think of all the problems Windows, Microsoft had with their Surface Book where you could detach
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:32.560]   the screen and then it didn't work.
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:38.320]   >> But that's what the iPad with the Magic Keyboard is right now. So it's kind of...
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:39.360]   >> Honestly.
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:43.280]   >> I think that's the extent of what we're going to see with that kind of thing is what Apple's
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:45.600]   already done with the iPad Pro and the Magic Keyboard.
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:50.800]   >> The Magic Keyboard has changed my perception of the iPad and where it sits in that lineup
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:55.840]   because it is a computer now with a trackpad and the Magic Keyboard. That's a great computer.
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:00.560]   So I buy into the notion now, Laurie, that Apple's filled that niche.
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:06.640]   >> Yeah. No, that's a very... Again, I've always been honking on about Apple needs more
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:12.560]   entry-level machines and affordable machines on the iPad. Even the $329 iPad that's available for
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:17.440]   everybody, that's a very credible choice. That is not a cut rate machine by any risk.
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:22.640]   If someone had $500 or $600 to spend for a Windows notebook or a Windows tablet,
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:26.640]   I would definitely put that in the decision tree for them and say that if that's your budget for
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:30.400]   a low-cost machine, this is one of the greatest values that's out there.
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:34.000]   And to be honest, if it might not that low-cost, I wish they would bring the price
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.720]   because you're spending $1,400 by the time you get the keyboard.
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:41.200]   >> Oh, that's the Mac Pro. I'm talking about the 300, the entry-level iPad.
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:45.680]   >> Yeah, yeah, yeah. But if you're going to get the one with the trackpad and the keyboard,
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:50.960]   it's going to be $1,400. It's actually more expensive than the low-end Macbooks.
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:55.360]   >> But from what you're talking about that, my idea of a dream machine that I know Apple will
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:03.600]   never make is literally take an iPad 12.9-inch iPad Pro form factor. Do nothing in it, but
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:09.440]   add whatever silicon you need in order to give it all the drivers and address lines you need to
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:14.480]   run Mac software. And then give me sort of like a modern version of the PowerBook Duo,
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:20.160]   where I have it in the Magic Keyboard when I'm out using it as a notebook. When I'm on the sofa,
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:24.160]   just browsing, I can use it sort of more like a tablet just browsing and stuff.
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:30.160]   And when I'm at my desktop, I can put it into a desktop dock, use that screen as a display,
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:35.680]   but also have two HDMI displays and all my peripherals connected to it. That would be such an easy,
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:39.760]   I would be such a sucker for that product that I wouldn't even wait to see if it actually works.
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:42.720]   [laughter]
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:47.040]   >> This is actually a good conversation. I forget the rumors, the best rumors of the ones we're
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:54.320]   making up right now. Again, that shows off some of the brilliance of this move. We can talk about
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:59.280]   all the reasons why Intel was letting them down. And this is the best way forward for them to
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:03.280]   maintain their independence over their product line and their product schedule. But the greatest
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:08.400]   thing about it is that it opens up so many possibilities. This time last year, when this was
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:14.000]   just a rumor that you may or may not choose to believe, there was such a limited amount of products
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:20.640]   that Apple could possibly make. And there is still a good reason for some people to wonder if Apple
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:26.960]   wasn't trying to just find time to turn the Mac into a developer platform to write iOS apps with.
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:31.360]   And now it's like, I feel as though the Mac has gotten at least another 10 years, at least on life,
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:35.920]   because I'm actually more excited about what Macs could be coming up in the next 10 years
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:40.560]   than I am about what new iPhones and iPads could be coming up. I'm very grateful for that.
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:43.360]   >> I think that's one of the cool things. He's so plain spoken, and it's the same thing Steve
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:49.120]   Jobs said. We want to, it's not faster Macs, it's not better battery life, although we assume those
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:54.320]   things will be true, but it's better Macs. We have ideas for Macs we want to make, and we just can't
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:58.880]   make them using Intel's roadmap. So we're going to use Apple Silicon. And the last time when Steve
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:02.800]   Jobs said that, we ended up with the MacBook Air that defined a generation of UltraBooks.
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:04.960]   So I'm super interested to see what they come up with this time.
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:08.400]   >> I just hope I'm not disappointed now, because my hopes are up.
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:11.440]   >> Oh, you will be. They'll be like the first couple is the point you and then it'll come out
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:14.000]   and they'll go, "Oh, this is what they should have put out the first time."
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:19.520]   >> That's just so high for what we're going to get. And I'm just afraid that it's going to be
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:25.520]   something boring. >> What about a Mac Pro that has an Apple Silicon massively multi-parallel
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:30.960]   core in it, but that instead of traditional expansion cards, you have things like the
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:35.600]   A6 that you can reprogram for logic or final cut and things like the storage module that can
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:39.440]   take large amounts of RAM or large amounts of SSD chips. And it's just that.
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:41.680]   >> It'll just make me cry more. >> That's why they invented it.
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:42.880]   >> Because I won't be able to afford it.
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:43.680]   >> Yeah.
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:49.200]   >> Oh, what a really bad. It'll be like the Lisa, which all I did was press my nose against the
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:53.280]   glass day after day after day. Wish I could afford one.
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:58.240]   >> I thought his office had one. So beautiful. And then I just dragged everything into the trash.
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:02.480]   I'll never love to touch it again. >> Really? How old were you? 20?
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:03.760]   >> I don't know, 10 or so.
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:04.480]   >> Not okay.
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:10.640]   >> That's really sad. So you actually got to play with it.
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:13.360]   >> Yeah. And it was just so much. I thought it was a game. It's like,
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:15.520]   oh, look, I can drag all this stuff to trash can. They're like, no.
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:21.200]   Am I going to be disappointed, Andy?
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:28.400]   >> Well, if you're expecting RGB internal lighting, which I think that any of us could
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:30.560]   hope for in a pro level machine, yes.
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:37.360]   >> Well, I think we're all going to be disappointed because there is, it could be.
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:44.160]   We're all with good reason speculating about everything that could happen when I'm sure the
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:50.880]   Apple's biggest nightmare is that there is a spectacular piece of news. I think on their
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:58.480]   chalkboard of desired results high on the list is that we continue to sell Max as usual to the
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:02.880]   same people, but they're all just much, much better and our customers are much, much happier.
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:03.920]   >> Oh, happy so disappointing.
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:09.840]   >> That's not, that means I think that's a single when you should hit a home run.
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:14.080]   What, Laurie? >> Will you buy it no matter what it is?
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:18.960]   >> Of course. That's a given. Unless it's $10,000. I mean, if it's in my eyes,
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:22.080]   obviously. >> Yeah, like I would love a Mac Pro, but I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:30.320]   You know what? If they made a Mac, meaning I'd buy it. If they made a MacBook, if they didn't
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:36.000]   fix the keyboard and they, I mean, I guess a Mac, like it'd be amazing to have a super powerful
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.920]   computer in that form factor. That'd be interesting. >> Yeah.
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:44.720]   >> Yeah. >> Well, there's a lot of people who are like Alex Lindsey who have these massive iMac
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:48.640]   pros and Mac Pros and all these things that they're studio and they just want to get on a plane
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:53.120]   and not have to carry anything. And if they could have a computer that actually accelerates,
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:57.120]   the apps that they use, like accelerates Final Cut or all these things. And it's that small
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:01.680]   and it's fanless and they're only using it in between at the coffee shop, between the drive,
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:05.600]   you know, those things. That's hugely appealing to pros who have their Pro machines,
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:11.120]   but want compatible machines for in between. >> Yeah. That's Apple's biggest challenge as a
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:18.960]   hardware, as a desktop hardware maker, because you really, it really is kind of gosh to dismiss
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:26.320]   any users needs by saying, well, you've got a niche need for a machine. Well, a market is filled with
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:30.400]   lots of people who expect that for a couple thousand dollars up to $30,000, they will get a
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:35.760]   machine that is exactly what they need for a certain purpose. And all they care about is
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:40.560]   their own personal needs because they're the ones spending the money. And whereas on Windows,
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:45.520]   there are multiple manufacturers that are addressing any need. And if you can't find anything that
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:49.680]   addresses what you want, you can just simply build your own and keep upgrading it as you go.
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:54.320]   Apple has the really, really tough job of they have to build every single Mac for every single
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:58.960]   Mac user. They're going to disappoint a whole bunch of users every time they make a change or
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:04.080]   introduce something new. All they can hope for is that whatever change they inflict upon these
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:06.480]   people, it's not going to drive them to another operating system.
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:16.000]   >> I'm just going to try to tamp down my expectations.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.880]   >> That's going to be surprised and disappointed.
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:26.800]   >> See, that's another reason why I personally like the idea of them doing a low-end Mac first.
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:34.800]   Because it would be a huge win if they say that here's our budget for a Mac, our least expensive
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:41.360]   Mac. And then just simply not say anything about pro apps for it. And then suddenly,
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:45.040]   at iMore and all these other sites, they're like, oh my God, we read Final Cut, we were editing
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:50.560]   4K video easily with this budget level thing. And let's compare that to what was running on an
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:55.200]   M3 processor in which we were getting basically two frames per second, like what we were getting
[01:51:55.200 --> 01:52:01.280]   on an Apple IIe 30 years ago. Whereas if they started off with, here's our pro editing machine,
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:05.440]   and they were able to say, oh, well, I see the very drop one frame per 80,000 here.
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:06.640]   >> I don't know about that.
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:09.680]   >> What if it's, what if, okay, just go with me for a second. What if Tim Cook comes out and he goes,
[01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:12.400]   good morning, good morning. >> Good morning.
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:14.320]   >> The Apple reinvents the X-serve.
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:17.680]   >> Well, but there is a big opportunity actually.
[01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:18.640]   >> No, it's twice as low.
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:23.120]   >> I could see Apple going back into the server market, there's an opportunity there.
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:25.760]   I mean, it probably won't.
[01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:29.440]   >> But, you know, and what could they do with that? What could they bring?
[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:30.480]   What magic could they bring?
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:34.080]   >> The magic is, and I think there's already a market trend towards ARM in
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:40.240]   server land because the problem with servers is power and heat. And Apple making it.
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:42.160]   >> They don't want to make the software for it. >> I know.
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:44.240]   >> They just want to get the energy to make the software for it.
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:47.520]   >> I agree. It doesn't make a lot of sense. But honestly,
[01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:54.640]   with their silicon, they could make very fast servers that are low power and low heat.
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:57.440]   >> Whatever Apple makes, I'll figure out a way to rack mount them and lease them to us.
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:58.240]   >> Yeah. >> Yeah.
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:01.520]   >> Yeah. >> Yeah, I mean, I would say that there's such a
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:08.880]   competitive market with so many really successful entrenched market leaders in there. It would be
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:12.240]   just wouldn't be worth the effort. But that's the same thing that we could have said in 2005,
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:14.720]   saying, well, I don't know why Apple wants to compete with BlackBerry.
[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:16.160]   >> People make their own, I think. >> They have like,
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:19.840]   they have like, I was making all their own ARM server chips today for themselves.
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:24.640]   >> Yeah. Eventually, I think ARM is going to own everything. But, yeah, we shall watch.
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:28.480]   >> We're going to see some cool stuff, I think, in five years. The really bizarre stuff,
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:34.080]   we're seeing five years. They have to make sure that they get everybody supplied with
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:38.640]   eggs, milk, bread, and toilet paper. Once everybody has the necessities and the MAC line,
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:41.920]   then they can start going freestyle. >> Yeah, but in five years, they might be doing quantum.
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:49.440]   I mean, this is what's interesting about Apple Silicon. It's not tied to ARM, as you point out,
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:53.920]   right now. I think that's a very astute point. They're going to mention ARM now because
[01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:59.360]   compatibility is an issue. But over time, it's Apple. It's not ARM. It's Apple.
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:04.560]   Apple sees a new technology come down the pike in five years. It's still Apple Silicon.
[01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:08.960]   It could be something. >> I think there is a chance. We'll see a WWDC where they announce
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:14.240]   a Swift-based architecture. >> I love that idea. I really like that idea.
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:18.800]   >> We announced that they said we built this to make operating systems all the way up to
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:21.680]   client apps. They haven't shown us any of the operating system stuff yet.
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:24.880]   >> Yeah. It's Swift in the microcode. >> Yeah.
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:34.160]   >> A couple of new -- what do they call these? Made with MAC ads? Or, Apple has a name for them.
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:39.920]   This is in the series that Apple does. >> This isn't work from home, though. So,
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:42.640]   you don't have to worry. >> No, I'm going to skip that one.
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:48.320]   This one is Tyler Mitchell, who is a black photographer working at a bed-sty.
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:54.080]   And I think these are so well made. They're just fun to watch.
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:59.120]   This is the guy who shot the Vogue cover, which got a lot of attention.
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:06.880]   And it's really cool how he takes this loft in bed-sty and turns it into a studio.
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:14.480]   It's freaking awesome. So, that's worth watching. Black and white, beautifully done.
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:20.560]   And then if you're more into music than you are, photography, oak-felder in the studio.
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:23.120]   >> I love oak-felder. He's so good. >> That's actually an older one.
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:28.000]   There was a newer one I wanted to show. Where is it? Let me go back to the list.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.360]   The oak-felder is cool. That came out in March, but there's one that just came out three days
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:38.400]   ago. James Blake creates a new song also from his home. So, that's kind of cool.
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:45.840]   You can watch him using Logic Pro and a real piano. >> I don't know how they made pianos out
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:50.880]   of wood. Did you know that? >> It's an old timey whammy.
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:55.680]   >> The conceit behind both of these is that they just set up cameras. It's kind of a reality show
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:01.600]   vibe in their house and watch them as they worked. I also like it's black and white, which is kind
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:02.320]   of fun. >> Yeah.
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:11.360]   >> A couple of new videos from Apple. Now time for your picks of the week. Lori Gill,
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:16.560]   let's start with you this week. >> I might end up having you spend some money this week.
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:19.920]   >> Oh, crap. >> I was going to take this one already
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:24.000]   beat me to it. >> Oh, I want to know how to get this. You just said the right word for me.
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:28.560]   >> You're talking about this in iOS today. Oh, my God, this looks interesting.
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:37.120]   >> It's the Folio Touch for the iPad Pro. So, this is a touchpad keyboard by Logitech
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:43.360]   for the iPad Pro. They have a model for iPad and iPad Air. This is the first time they've done it
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:54.400]   for the iPad Pro with the touchpad. And I cannot explain what a joy it is to use a touchpad with
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:57:01.920]   an iPad. And if you can't afford Apple's very expensive one, this is another one for the books.
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:08.880]   And I have actually, Logitech is my favorite keyboard, iPad keyboard company. I think they make an
[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:17.680]   excellent, excellent keyboard. I love the way it feels, the tactic feedback, the bounce. I love it.
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:23.680]   The curve of the keys, how far apart they are, the travel. I've loved Logitech's
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:30.800]   keyboards for a long time. So, now that they have one with a touchpad for the iPad Pro,
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:34.800]   you can spend a lot less money and get a really fantastic experience.
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:39.600]   >> Almost half as much. >> Yeah, it's a lot less expensive.
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:44.320]   >> It also, it does use the smart connector. So, you don't need, it's not Bluetooth. It's not a
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:48.480]   battery powered. These are rare. There are not a lot of key words.
[01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:50.800]   >> It looks very surfy. >> Yeah. It also has a
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:53.280]   kicked and infinite kickstand it looks like. Is that right?
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:58.720]   >> Is it infinite? So, I don't have it because it's not available yet.
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:03.280]   >> But you always get this stuff before anybody else does. In fact, we were talking about this on
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:07.600]   iOS today. Mike and I said, let's ask Laurie if she can get us on the list.
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:19.360]   It's fabric. I love that. I want this badly. So, available for pre-order, do they say when?
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:25.920]   >> Let me see. You know what they don't actually say when I'm on.
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:29.680]   >> Here's one other thing that bugs me. It doesn't say what size iPad Pro.
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:35.600]   >> Well, have you tried when you click on pre-order it? I think it gives you the options.
[01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:38.480]   >> No, it's the 11, wasn't it? >> Is it only the 11?
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:45.520]   >> Oh, yeah. Sorry. It's only for the 11, which I should have known that already.
[01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:48.720]   I apologize. >> I'm going to cry.
[01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:49.760]   >> I know. I have the same reaction.
[01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:52.960]   >> Well, Michael, you chose. >> Not me because I've got the right size.
[01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:56.080]   >> Yeah, Michael. Well, you're always smarter. You're always a step ahead.
[01:58:56.080 --> 01:59:02.240]   >> You know, they always eventually shortcut row, which Apple does not.
[01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:08.080]   >> Right. It's going to be a paper cut. >> The difference is it doesn't float the screen
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:15.360]   as Apple does. >> Yeah. And as much as I like floating screen,
[01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:23.680]   I do find a little bit of lap imbalance. Though I can tell though, here's the thing,
[01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:32.000]   the kickstand for that particular model, if you're actually using the keys,
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.800]   I betcha that kickstand is not going to be very stable.
[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:42.480]   The keyboard, Logitech's keyboard for iPad Pro, I can't remember what model
[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:46.640]   number it is or model name it is. It has a kickstand that's the same way.
[01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:52.160]   Don't love it on a lap. It's not a very good experience on a lap. So I think that there's just
[01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:55.760]   a lot of nobody wants to make a keyboard that's stable on a lap.
[01:59:55.760 --> 02:00:02.160]   >> Yeah. You and Mary Jo Foley both seem to type in your laps a lot. I don't understand that, but.
[02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:07.200]   >> Yeah. Well, if I'm going to sit at a desk, I'm going to use my computer.
[02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:09.440]   >> I get it. That makes sense actually.
[02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:10.880]   >> Yeah. Yeah.
[02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:16.400]   >> If I'm just casual and sitting around on my couch, I grab my iPad. It works really great as
[02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:20.240]   a computer. I'm sitting it on my lap when I start typing. I get a little jiggle.
[02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:24.880]   >> Scooter X says you can order it now at the Apple Store and they'll get it in three days.
[02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:25.120]   So.
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:28.240]   >> Are you sure that's the right one?
[02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:30.880]   >> Is that right? Well, Scooter is rarely wrong.
[02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:31.920]   >> Yeah.
[02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:33.120]   >> So.
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:36.320]   >> I'm going to check it out right now while you're talking about the next people's kids.
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:38.080]   >> Yeah. That's because boy, that would be.
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:39.360]   >> Yeah.
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:41.920]   >> I'm so sad. I wanted it for my 12.
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:43.760]   >> Well, I have to buy an 11-inch iPad Pro.
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:44.000]   >> Oh.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:44.720]   >> Is that your next time?
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:45.760]   >> Oh, I didn't think of that.
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:46.560]   >> Oh.
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:49.920]   Renee Richie, your pick of the week. Thanks for spending my money.
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:54.720]   >> So I was going to pick Lori's and since she picked that so well, I decided to go the complete
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:56.560]   opposite way and pick a free silly app.
[02:00:56.560 --> 02:00:57.200]   >> Okay.
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:01.120]   >> Like, if you remember long ago, there was AutoTune by T-Pain.
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:01.520]   >> Yes.
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:03.360]   >> And now it's back with a vengeance.
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:07.520]   And I included the link to the video there because there's no way I can do it justice.
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:08.320]   >> Let's play some.
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:13.680]   >> But it's basically a voice disorder for the iPhone and it takes you and transforms you
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:16.160]   into what I'm sure will eventually be a very in-app purchase,
[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:18.800]   felt licensing experience of different celebrity voices.
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:20.080]   >> Oh, and T-Pain involved.
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:20.560]   >> Yeah.
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:26.640]   [MUSIC]
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:27.920]   >> So it's more than AutoTune.
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:29.440]   >> It's not a voice model.
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:31.120]   >> Well, the Darth Vader is-
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:34.800]   >> Oh. Can we get it now? Should I download it and try it?
[02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:35.680]   >> Downloadable, sure.
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:36.560]   >> Well, why-
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:40.320]   >> I was watching iOS today just on the off chance that you and Mike are going to spend
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:43.200]   30, 37 hours doing it before the show started.
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:45.760]   But I was lucky and that you hadn't seen it yet.
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:46.640]   >> We blew it.
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:47.440]   Oh, man.
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:48.160]   >> What's it called?
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:49.040]   >> Voice mod.
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:50.000]   >> It's called voice mod.
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:50.880]   >> Voice mod.
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:51.520]   >> Yeah.
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:52.240]   >> I just came out-
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:54.880]   >> Now when I was 14, I can't find anything on my phone.
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:56.480]   >> [LAUGH]
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:58.160]   >> I've always used spotlight.
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:01:59.280]   But there's a reasons folder.
[02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:01.360]   If you download it recently, it'll be in that folder.
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:04.160]   >> Yeah, no, it's not-
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:04.800]   >> I'll see if I can get them.
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:06.000]   >> I'm just trying to find it in the app store.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:09.840]   Voice mod, clips, voice changer.
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:12.240]   >> Yeah, I think it's voice mod clips.
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:12.720]   >> Is it?
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:15.440]   >> Yeah, the YouTube videos.
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:16.240]   >> No, this is funny.
[02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:18.880]   >> Oh, yeah, there's T-Pain's face.
[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:20.800]   Yeah, voice mod, clips, voice changer.
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:23.920]   And it is free, but obviously,
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:25.280]   if you really want to do anything fun,
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:27.360]   you're gonna have to spend thousands of dollars-
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:28.320]   >> Yeah, I bet.
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:30.400]   >> In many hours of your time.
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:33.520]   All right, while I'm downloading it to play with it,
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:35.280]   thank you for a great tip.
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:36.720]   Oh, wait a minute, it's already downloaded.
[02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:38.000]   >> [LAUGH]
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:38.800]   >> There you go.
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:40.640]   It has a bit of an annoying onboarding procedure.
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:41.680]   >> Okay.
[02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:44.640]   >> Okay, you could do video or audio, create new audio.
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:47.520]   Allow microphone access, okay.
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:50.400]   Head sets work best, okay.
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:52.800]   Now, what are my choices?
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:57.280]   Oh, I get 11 randomly selected voices,
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:00.880]   and I get three hours and 27 minutes to the next set.
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:02.480]   So got it.
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:09.840]   So, clean, cop chase, speechifier, dark angel, fear,
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:13.520]   Wawa, storyteller action, exo, android,
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:16.400]   alien, or second life or game over?
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:16.800]   Which one?
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:18.640]   Which one do you say?
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:20.800]   >> Second life, I don't know.
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:21.840]   >> Game over, man.
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:22.800]   Let me do game over.
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:24.480]   >> Okay, now what do I do?
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:24.880]   Apply.
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:29.200]   Now I press.
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:32.640]   It's time to get to back to work because
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:34.960]   Mac break is over.
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:35.680]   No, it's not though.
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:37.360]   That's just for the purposes of the-
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:40.240]   >> Don't stop, don't stop.
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:40.720]   >> Don't stop.
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:41.680]   >> I press stop.
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:43.600]   Now what?
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:44.000]   Next.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:48.080]   Save and share over.
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:50.080]   Okay.
[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:50.800]   >> Is this it?
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:52.080]   >> Hey, no, she's there?
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:52.640]   >> Hey.
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:53.840]   >> Who's-
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:55.120]   >> Do you hit my voice, mate?
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:58.960]   >> Because it is safe.
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:01.120]   >> How do I play it back?
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:04.160]   Oh, that's funny.
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:06.320]   >> Oh my God, that's crazy.
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:07.280]   >> Who's doing that?
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:09.360]   >> Me, I'm just holding up to the microphone
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:10.160]   and pressing the buttons.
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:11.760]   >> I can't.
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:12.800]   >> I can't.
[02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:13.520]   I'm kidding.
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:17.520]   >> I love you on the mask singer, by the way.
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:19.360]   I don't know what this is.
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:21.360]   So, Andy, you're pick of the week.
[02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:24.640]   Oh, mine is a really, really good one.
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:27.680]   The Sandman was Neil Gaiman's like,
[02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:31.680]   "Master of the Greatest Series in Comics history."
[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:35.920]   And it's just been adapted into an 11-hour,
[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:38.880]   20-episode audio books on Audible.
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:40.480]   >> Is it the whole thing?
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:43.360]   >> It is the first three collected editions.
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:45.280]   So, 20 episodes.
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:49.760]   And Neil Gaiman plays the voice of the narrator.
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:51.200]   And let me tell you what they did.
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:52.240]   They didn't just say,
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:53.680]   they didn't just farm this out to say,
[02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:55.840]   "Okay, someone type in like a novelization
[02:04:55.840 --> 02:04:58.160]   and we'll just have one person read it."
[02:04:58.160 --> 02:05:01.040]   It was Neil Gaiman handed over the scripts,
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:04.480]   his original comic book scripts to this director
[02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:07.520]   who had been one of his previous credits
[02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:08.480]   was the hit chart,
[02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:10.720]   the reboot of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:13.120]   And so, in the original scripts that he wrote
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:14.080]   like back in the '80s,
[02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:16.400]   obviously he has to describe to the artist
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:18.720]   what everything looks like and what the moods are.
[02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:21.440]   Like, dream entries of "Palace."
[02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:24.320]   It's made out of a million high-long spires
[02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:26.720]   made out of bones and chocolate cakes.
[02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:29.520]   And so, all of that stuff is put into the audiobook
[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:30.240]   from the narrator.
[02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:33.040]   Now, it's creating these pictures in your mind.
[02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:36.000]   It really is like a radio drama series.
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:39.440]   It isn't just, again, somebody reading a text.
[02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:41.680]   They really did all the atmospherics.
[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:45.760]   A huge cast, including James McAvoy,
[02:05:45.760 --> 02:05:47.760]   is Morpheus Michael Sheen,
[02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:49.040]   is Lucifer, Andy Serkis,
[02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:50.720]   is Matthew the Raven.
[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:52.720]   Josie Lawrence, as Matt Headey,
[02:05:52.720 --> 02:05:55.680]   who's sort of like an immortal,
[02:05:55.680 --> 02:05:56.560]   but a street person.
[02:05:56.560 --> 02:05:59.920]   Joanna Lumley, as Lady Johanna Constantine.
[02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:02.080]   So, it's a huge, rich tapestry.
[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:03.120]   It was one of those things where,
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:06.080]   I know that it's a digital download,
[02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:09.440]   but I felt the need to like go to my comic book shop
[02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:11.280]   and like camp out there
[02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:12.640]   so I could buy it at midnight,
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:13.760]   like in front of a comic book shop.
[02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:16.240]   Are they selling it on DVDs, on CDs?
[02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:17.600]   No, no, no, it's out of cassettes.
[02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:19.360]   Go to Audible.
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:20.880]   Why did you go to the comic book store?
[02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:22.480]   I'm joking.
[02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:24.000]   Oh, it's such an idiot.
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:25.520]   It's such an idiot.
[02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:26.560]   I believed you.
[02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:27.360]   I'm sorry.
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:29.760]   I was being my usually amusing and confusing.
[02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:31.600]   I actually bought the fancy,
[02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:33.280]   you know, leather-bound sandman,
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:35.200]   which I love.
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:36.560]   Oh, I can't wait to hear this.
[02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:37.040]   It's not the absolute one.
[02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:37.520]   They're so good.
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:38.480]   I get the absolute.
[02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:38.720]   Yeah.
[02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:40.800]   It's, I have those two,
[02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:42.560]   and I have to say that nothing,
[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:46.400]   I would almost recommend it alongside the comic book version.
[02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:48.880]   Obviously, the original comic book edition
[02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:52.480]   is going to be, you know, the canonical version,
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:55.680]   but nothing can really replace the visions
[02:06:55.680 --> 02:06:57.120]   that you have in your head,
[02:06:57.120 --> 02:06:58.400]   particularly with Neil Gaiman,
[02:06:58.400 --> 02:06:59.600]   who is such a good,
[02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:00.800]   like audiobook narrator.
[02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:01.200]   Yes.
[02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:02.880]   But also, he's an amazing,
[02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:05.440]   anything that any time you have Neil Gaiman
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:07.040]   narrating his own stuff,
[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:09.600]   it increases the power by two or three times
[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:10.880]   because he's a terrific actor.
[02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:13.760]   And as the author, he knows the intent of every line
[02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:15.040]   and every passage.
[02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:18.560]   And so it's $35 if you want to buy it outright.
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:19.920]   If you become a, as usual,
[02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:21.920]   if you become a member of Audible,
[02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:23.920]   you can get that for free.
[02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:25.120]   And then buy a couple of,
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:27.200]   you got a 30-day trial,
[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:29.280]   which means that if you give this buy for,
[02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:31.360]   I'm saying you either buy it for like $35,
[02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:33.760]   or you can basically be a member for two months,
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:35.200]   get two free books along the way,
[02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:36.320]   plus and then cancel it.
[02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:38.640]   Make sure you set a reminder to cancel it.
[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:40.960]   But even if you just want to not try to,
[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:44.800]   you know, scam Audible out of additional books for $35,
[02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:46.800]   it's one of the best pieces of entertainment
[02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:49.200]   I've bought in a long, long time.
[02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:51.280]   I get my credits tomorrow.
[02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:52.240]   I'm so excited.
[02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:55.840]   We got to wait one more day.
[02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:56.560]   Yeah, one more day.
[02:07:56.560 --> 02:07:58.240]   But thank you, because it's only one credit,
[02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:00.560]   which is nice, because this--
[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:01.200]   11 hours.
[02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:01.440]   Yeah.
[02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:04.640]   And once again, it is broken up into chapters,
[02:08:04.640 --> 02:08:06.320]   just like the,
[02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:08.080]   and it's the first three books,
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:10.480]   which means like the first arc is like six issues,
[02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:11.520]   or six episodes,
[02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:13.520]   but then there are individual episodes
[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:15.600]   that are individual, like standalone comics.
[02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:18.960]   So it's not as though you're in for this 11-hour long haul.
[02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:22.320]   It's sort of like getting like five or six or seven titles,
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:26.160]   because I usually break up audiobooks into what project,
[02:08:26.160 --> 02:08:27.920]   what home project do I have to do?
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:28.640]   Yes.
[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:29.520]   What do I want to listen to?
[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:31.680]   So you get the one project that will be good
[02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:33.600]   for cleaning my kitchen from top to bottom,
[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:35.200]   but then like the one issue,
[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:37.280]   sort of one episode that's good enough for
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:38.560]   just vacuuming the living room.
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:41.280]   I get highest possible recommendation.
[02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:43.440]   It is just an amazing thing.
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:45.040]   It's volumes, one's three.
[02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:45.840]   Like your house, sir.
[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:49.360]   Yeah, it's barely within the old house in Dream Country.
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:50.560]   It gets Dream Country, too.
[02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:50.960]   Oh, nice.
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:52.000]   But they're going to do more.
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.080]   Dream of a thousand cats.
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:54.960]   So they're going to get,
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:56.320]   I presume do it all,
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:58.080]   which is even more--
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:08:59.200]   What did he say to you, daughter?
[02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:00.160]   True, Thans.
[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:00.640]   So good.
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:05.120]   Baby Newworth is the Siamese cat in Dream of a thousand cats.
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:06.640]   Oh, this is amazing.
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:07.760]   I'm going to buy it eight times.
[02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:09.280]   It keeps going.
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:10.720]   It really is.
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:12.480]   That's the highest call I can give is like,
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:14.000]   when I listen to it and I've already bought it,
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.360]   but it's like, I want,
[02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:17.680]   you want to say,
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:19.840]   I wish I could just throw money into a box
[02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:21.280]   and mail it to you,
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:24.880]   because I feel as though I didn't pay enough for this.
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:25.520]   It is just--
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:28.400]   So are we happy or sad they didn't get Tom Ellis from Lucifer
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:29.600]   to play Lucifer?
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:30.640]   Probably two different characters.
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:32.400]   I've got Michael Sheen, who's pretty good.
[02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:33.520]   That's pretty good.
[02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:34.480]   That's pretty good.
[02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:35.360]   You're doing okay.
[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:36.080]   Yeah.
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:36.400]   Wow.
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:38.880]   This, I cannot wait.
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:39.680]   Thank you.
[02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:42.000]   In fact, let's just end the show now so I can start.
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:42.800]   Yes, thank you.
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:47.040]   Everybody wants to run off and download this.
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:48.240]   Thank you, Andy and Aco.
[02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:50.800]   You can catch him on WGBH in Boston, when?
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:58.000]   This Friday, tune into WGBH 89.7 on the terrestrial airwaves.
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.200]   On Friday, I think at 1130 this week,
[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:05.280]   or go to wgphnews.org, either live or later on.
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:05.760]   To stream it.
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:10.320]   Lori Gills, she's the big kahuna.
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:13.680]   Are you on the phone already?
[02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:16.640]   You're telling another writer to buzz off?
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:17.600]   Your deadline is--
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:18.640]   Taking the role of Delirium.
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:19.600]   She's demanding a recap.
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:20.880]   She can't hear us anymore.
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:23.440]   I had to switch my headphones really quickly.
[02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:25.280]   I just lost audio, just like we're needed.
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:26.000]   The same thing.
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:26.880]   Thank you, Skype.
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:29.200]   I got it, though.
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:29.600]   I got it.
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:31.520]   I thought you were firing another writer.
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:32.640]   She's managing editor.
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:33.600]   No, she doesn't do that.
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:34.240]   And I'm more--
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:35.040]   I was the last one.
[02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:35.680]   Dot com.
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:37.600]   You were the one that she didn't fire you.
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:40.480]   She gave you the keys and said, drive off--
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:41.840]   Get out of the nets and said, fly.
[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:43.680]   Thank you, Lori.
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:44.480]   Great to have you.
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:46.000]   We missed you last week.
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.400]   Before I go, I just want to say, was it Scooter?
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:50.240]   Scooter X.
[02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:51.760]   Scooter X was right.
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:54.800]   You can actually order it from Apple right now.
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:59.600]   And you can have it delivered as early as two days from now.
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:02.320]   If you paid the extra or three days from now,
[02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:04.080]   if you just do regular shipping.
[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:04.560]   So, yeah.
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:05.600]   We can get it right now.
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:06.560]   We'll expect to review next week, Lori.
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:08.640]   Can't wait.
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:10.000]   Thank you, Lori Gill.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.200]   Thank you, Renee Ritchie.
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:15.760]   Now, a YouTube celeb at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:17.280]   @ReneeRitchie on the Twitter.
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:18.160]   He's R-R.
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:19.120]   Look for the R-R.
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:23.920]   Anything exciting in your universe you want to tell people about?
[02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:28.080]   I just did a trilogy on what Apple Silicon means,
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:30.160]   what kind of Macs we can expect to see from it,
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:32.320]   and also why you might still want to get an Intel Mac.
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:33.920]   But in those three videos over the weekend.
[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:34.480]   Nice.
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:34.800]   Yeah.
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:36.560]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:39.200]   We do Mac break weekly every Tuesday at 11am,
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:41.920]   Pacific 2pm Eastern time 1800 UTC.
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:44.320]   Join us live if you want.
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:46.880]   We do stream the audio and video of us making the show
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:49.840]   at twit.tv/live.
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:53.040]   You can also catch it on demand.
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:54.160]   I think that's how most people listen.
[02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:56.880]   By either going to the website, twit.tv/mbw.
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:11:58.880]   We're on YouTube, of course.
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:11:59.920]   We have a YouTube channel.
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:04.800]   And best thing to do is get a podcatcher of your choice
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:07.600]   and overcast pocketcast,
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:10.240]   Stitcher slacker, Apple podcast, Google pod,
[02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:12.400]   whatever it is that you like and subscribe.
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:13.040]   That way you'll get it.
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:15.280]   The minute it's available of a Tuesday afternoon.
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:17.600]   Thanks for joining us, everybody.
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:18.000]   And now...
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:23.840]   One more twit.

[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:32.720]   with iOS, iPadOS, TVOS, watchOS.
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:36.480]   It's all the devices, all the best apps, games and services,
[02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:39.680]   everything in between, plus a whole lot of laughter.
