[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.920]   covers Apple all the Apple topics Macintosh. Zoom. No that's wrong. I'll figure it out
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.560]   before the end of the show iPhone. Andy and I goes here for the Chicago Sun time. Zenda
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.520]   a classic Macintosh logo the old rainbow logo behind it. That is an Andy Warhol silkscreen
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.360]   print. Whoa. I found I found online from ArtNet and recently auctioned for like $56,000. The
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.760]   original or the a print no no it's it's a series of whatever prints that were made of
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.240]   this issue. That's nice. Yeah. And and unsolicited tip if you want like really good like background
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.640]   art or or desktop art or just things to just have around because you like art go to auction
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.800]   sites because they want to get people to up their bids so they will give they will put
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.960]   in huge mega resolution scans of all of these pieces. And so I've just got folders and folders
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.640]   are comic book art and like old masters and and pre Raphael lights. It's like oh that's
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.280]   nice. I should do something. And of course I can't do anything with it because I don't
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.920]   have any rights to use those images but it's pretty to have this like screen saver in your
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.600]   HDTV or I guess I guess it's just incidental in the background of the show. I don't think
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.280]   that we're not getting trouble with the Andy Warhol estate. Well it's it's it's it's related
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.880]   to Apple news. So we're doing a journalistic thing by commenting on the auction price of
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.920]   this. So if you have one of these if you're if you're at one of those macro exposed where
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.640]   they had like just those stacks and stacks of Andy Warhol's original silkscreen prints.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.400]   You probably don't want take it down off of your kids bedroom wall because you can probably
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.680]   get tens of thousands of dollars for it. Did they did they really do that? No they didn't.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.480]   It wasn't our friend. It was he did a he did a series of prints about where he did put
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.720]   his own spin on corporate logos as probably some sort of commentary on how easy it is
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.920]   to be Andy Warhol and sell a print series for a lot of. He didn't even the irony of it
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.080]   is many of these prints he didn't even make himself he had a fact the factory with a bunch
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.200]   of people doing them. It was it was it's almost admirable how he had this level of cynicism
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.920]   about like art as commodity and that miraculously became part of the package that he was selling
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:02.680]   you. Isn't that amazing? Brilliant. Hey let's also let's also welcome Renee Richie from
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:12.400]   imore.com. Renee is here from Montreal where he is enjoying the perfect summer weather.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.800]   It is it's a strange place Leo. We went from minus 20 to plus 20 in about a couple weeks
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.600]   it's just this is why we can't have nice weather. Well it finally happened. I'm so relieved
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:30.960]   10.9.3 is out. You can get it today downloaded onto your Mac and Tocch and the big the reason
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:38.120]   I'm excited about it is it it finally gives us true support for 4k displays. If you have
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:45.080]   a Macbook Pro with a 15 inch retina display late 2013 or the late 2013 Mac Pro and you
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.360]   and I can now talk about it because we were in the aid that I was really neat that Apple
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.880]   did the the open beta. Yeah and they've already announced 10.9.4 open beta so if you're worried
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.360]   that all the rest of the unwashed masses now had your exclusive 10.9.3 you can just grab
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.960]   10.9.4 when it comes out and I wouldn't run out but so the one that we're getting today
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.480]   is that the same as the bits that were pushed in the beta program a couple of days ago or
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.840]   is there something new and wonderful in this too. I didn't have a chance to look at it.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.480]   Typically if they're pushing it again there might be a couple new bits in there. So improves
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.200]   4k display support on the Mac Pro it adds the ability to sync contacts and calendars
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:32.880]   between a Mac and iOS device using USB no longer do you have to go through iTunes I guess.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:44.080]   That's nice. Improves the reliability of VPN connections using IPsec in Safari 7.0.3.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.600]   I have been using 10.9.3 for a couple of weeks on your recommendation so it would support
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.080]   my 4k display and I have to say in the last iteration they added essentially the same
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:02.000]   kind of high DPI you know pixel doubling that you can do on the retina displays. So it was
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.040]   the scaling modes. The scaling modes make a huge difference because of course on the
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:18.080]   4k display which is running what is it 3820 by 21.80 I think you're yeah 2160 that that
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.800]   native resolution the menu is this all the icon and you can make stuff bigger but it really
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.120]   so but what I did and it seems to have done pretty well that there was a little tearing
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.320]   on some of the scaling things that's the 4k display in the middle that's the Asus PQ
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:41.080]   was it 3 2 1. There's only two 4k displays that have 60 Hertz refresh rate this is one
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.160]   of them the other is the sharp that Apple sells in the Apple store and I'm told that
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.200]   the same IgEZO panels just wrapped in different companies.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:55.680]   Corey just Leo it really looks good and what so what I've done is set it to 19 20 by 1080
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.000]   half resolution but correct me if I'm wrong it's my understanding that high DPI means
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.320]   that when I have something of higher resolution a movie a photo it will show those 1 to 1
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:13.360]   in the pixels but the UI just like on the retina right the UI is and now it's really
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:20.000]   and the text is man the text looks good it's like a giant retina it's like a 31.5 inch
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.480]   red in the display.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.360]   It's amazing because they played around with resolution independence which sounds like the
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.680]   ultimate idea but it turns out that that's a lot of overhead and scaling PDFs or SVGs
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.560]   is not that efficient so now they do this thing where exactly that interface elements
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.160]   they just pixel double them so they stay the same size but they're twice the density but
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.880]   that means you also actually still have the pixels that make up all those points and they
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.320]   can show your final cut video or your aperture or light room photo your photoshopped document
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.440]   whatever those things are actual size so you really get the best of both worlds without
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.720]   all the overhead it may not be the perfect solution for you know millennia to come but
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.200]   it's a really smart solution that works right now.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.520]   I love so I've got the left and the right are just 27 inch seven displays in the middle
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:05.000]   is the 31.5 inch Asus and I just love it I just love it you can see I have the chat
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.880]   room running at all times Twitter running at all times Bitcoin on the right my calendar
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.520]   a terminal I've always wanted to have a terminal app open I can't do anything with it but I
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.040]   just always wanted to have that's what the geeks have is a terminal app always run NORAD
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.000]   off that display set up the O and don't don't judge me but you'll see in the middle I'm
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.760]   actually watching video of Microsoft surface announcement this morning it's it is I it
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.400]   is a very satisfying arrangement and I don't mean because it's so expensive and impressive
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:37.680]   but it's very the utility is very high and I and I and the big screen I missed my 30 inch
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.280]   apple display which Jason Howell has right now this is this this is the nicest display
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.880]   I've ever used there's still a little the way they do these Renee correct me if I say
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.160]   this wrong but the way they do this is as if it's two displays it's coming through the
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:57.600]   Thunderbolt display port and they in effect send to display so occasionally they'll get
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.160]   if I scroll real fast it'll get a little bit out of sync so there's some tearing in the
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:07.160]   middle but I noticed it 1920 by 1080 exactly half that's minimized it's very there's very
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.720]   little of it other scaled resolutions not so much I see a little bit of that yeah I'm
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.640]   not positive on the details but you're pushing the boundaries of Thunderbolt 2 which is why
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.240]   they're working on Thunderbolt 3 right so it's probably like an old dueling dvi when they
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.640]   send half a signal through each exactly like that right yeah because I think Thunderbolt
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:28.920]   2 isn't twice the size it's doubled so you have double half of each right it really it
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:36.240]   really works well and the text is so readable in fact it's kind of big at 1080 so the old
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.800]   monitors scrape your eyeballs now you all right like you can just see that you really
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.880]   can so welcome to the world of retina at a great cause with a twenty five hundred dollar
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:50.280]   monitor it's not cheap but do you think that the fact that apples pushing out 10 9 3 with
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:55.760]   support for 4k monitors is some indication that apple might at WWDC announce a 4k display
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.720]   of its own I don't know I mean I've heard for a long time that they're making one but
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.120]   for them it's always a question of math how many panels what quality panels what technology
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.120]   because they're not going to make one they're going to try and make you know tens of thousands
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.320]   if not millions of them and typically they go for iMacs first the iMacs get the panel
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.040]   first and then when they're in supply balance they do the cinema displays but because there's
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.520]   a Mac Pro now out already and because they have all these computers I can support 4k
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.120]   maybe they'll give the panels to the apple 4k display first there's a lot of questions
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.800]   evolving supply chain stuff yeah the other question is the way they can make a big enough
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:32.640]   markup on them even if they're just selling them to Mac Pro owners at this point so I would
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.760]   guess they're going to hold off on that until they know how many they can actually push
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:41.120]   through but let's sharpen Asus get all the money define all the money
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.280]   I mean it's it's a no it's my $12 I understand what you're saying the market well exactly
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.400]   they're perfectly okay with letting sharpen Asus and Samsung and all these other people
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:55.360]   make 12% margins they're very they're very very happy to sell fewer but make five or six
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:01.720]   or seven times as much money off of each panel so the two monitors I mentioned are capable
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:08.800]   of 60 Hertz at that full resolution there are many much less expensive 4k displays out but
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:14.000]   they're 30 Hertz is that right Renee I believe that you can drive them at 60 Hertz now with
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.920]   me because I know that yeah the dull one is running at 60 Hertz with 10 9 3 I don't know
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.880]   if it's as good as the you know the the panels at Apple is selling but they're much cheaper
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:32.440]   so you always you know you have to make that calculation on your own it looks good just
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:37.160]   from a purely subjective point of view it looks good and I don't and because it's the
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:44.160]   I'm using the Mac Pro base model but still that's got dual graphics cards in it I don't
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.400]   that doesn't seem to slow it down or make it hot or anything it does make you wonder
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.920]   how this is going to affect whatever new interface is coming along for Mac OS because
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.120]   remember that iOS 7 really was a response to the fact that most iOS devices now have
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:03.080]   these retina display screens and you don't really appreciate how kind of crummy the old
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.640]   interface was until you really compare them side by side and so I wonder what happens
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.640]   when Apple starts planning for a world in the near future when more people will have
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:18.120]   4k displays or anything with a retina retin a interface on it whereas the right now the
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:24.600]   Mac book air is the first buy in type of of Mac portable the iMac is still the first buy
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.920]   in type of Mac desktop but I wonder if they're going to be planning that far ahead to say
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.920]   we have to make a user interface that will look great once we have no need for drop
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:38.200]   shadows no need much for as intense anti-aliasing or any bit twiddling that we used to have to
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:44.600]   do for iOS 10.9. Here is Ryan Shrout reported this on this week at Computer Hardware the
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:51.560]   other day and the PC perspective has a story Samsung is now to 4k 28 inch for just 700 bucks
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:13:00.840]   and it is 3840 2160 60 Hertz so I think we're going to start seeing and no I don't know how good
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.720]   the quality is and all of that but I was going to say I mean I think people who are buying 4k
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.960]   displays at this point are video editors they're photo editors they're graphic designers they have
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:15.160]   a real need to be able to see as Renee said the full billboard at full resolution pretty much
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:20.120]   and they're not going to set they're not going to be satisfied with a non-calibrated display that
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:25.320]   is a little bit too green it's a specialty market obviously and those people are willing to pay
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.880]   what seems like a lot to us but really isn't a lot for a professional
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:35.400]   for that quality yeah their time is more valuable than their money they just want display that's
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:40.360]   color accurate and high depth and everything K forward in our chat room is reporting that the
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:48.520]   10.93 he says broke a lot of open CL apps like Premiere Pro and resolve he said no problem with
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.880]   Final Cut in fact I used Final Cut Pro last night and it seemed to be working fine
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:59.960]   I imagine updates will come out for Premiere and resolve but and I don't know I haven't seen it so
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:04.520]   I don't know but that's something to be a protection to these things happen and maybe that's
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:10.600]   production machine yeah production machine don't upgrade yeah as always on the other hand I'm
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.760]   really happy that I did the early upgrade and I'll do the final upgrade today and see what happens but
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:20.840]   you rest your home theater for us Leo that's not my home theater that's just I use that for email
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:29.880]   and surfing the web but doing it with style people in the chat room probably those of you who are
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.760]   late up late at night early in the morning normally I'm only here when I'm in the studio now because
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.200]   I have it running at all times on my display you'll note that I am off frequently in the
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.600]   chat room and one of the great joys I have is you know it's about three in the morning and somebody
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.200]   says something snotty in the chat room and I respond I just love that I just
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:56.040]   they back back back up very rapidly oh oh oh I'm always in there now
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:03.240]   so let's briefly since I was watching the uh uh Microsoft Surface 3 announcement I know this is
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.040]   an Apple show and it's the last thing we do but it looks like really what uh Microsoft has decided
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:15.720]   to do is not assault the iPad directly but go after the MacBook both Air and Pro with this new
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:21.480]   Surface 3 it is absolutely MacBook pricing if you want an i5 you're talking $12.99
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.080]   if you want an i7 you're talking almost three almost $2,000
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:30.920]   um have you guys looked at the specs on the Surface Pro 3 and compared it to
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:36.920]   the Mac uh books and uh does it it seems like that's the cat that's where they're aiming
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.680]   yeah I mean I've had I've had a look and I was watching the live stream I wasn't I wasn't in
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:47.080]   New York today but it definitely looks like they are not scrimping one one bit they really want to
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.960]   sell the point that we are selling this to you as a laptop consumer we're going to sell you a
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:58.120]   machine that has the exact same specs exact same build quality as a nice ultra book or as a nice
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:04.680]   MacBook Air but with the following list of added features among them being a really really good
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:11.400]   stylist now that makes it far more suitable for for creatives to use one of the reasons why
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:16.600]   Surface was such a big win for so many so many artists was that you basically have a
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.640]   a wacom tablet built into it so you could actually use this as your field drawing computer
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:27.720]   they're also using demos of having a in final draft actually producers actually and studio
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.480]   executives writing comments directly onto script pages I don't know if that's going to be a really
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.000]   super popular feature I love the demo of that though I thought that was kind of interesting
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.480]   exactly and it and it wakes and it's totally pen intuitive you'll wake up when you touch the pen
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.280]   to it if you want to take a note during a meeting and do something with it within the office
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:49.560]   infrastructure it's really really easy to do that and it's also the other big point they were making
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.760]   is that they actually had a balanced scale to show you it is actually lighter than a MacBook Air
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.840]   so what they're trying to do is that I don't there's really not trying to go after anybody who would
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:05.800]   be thinking about buying an iPad mini or even a baseline 500 dollar iPad Air iPad Air they're
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:12.360]   really going after people who might have either a might have considered going for a a MacBook
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:18.360]   Air because it really is the only really good premium ultra book out there and also going after
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:24.200]   people who might have been considering getting an iPad in addition to whatever the laptop they're
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.040]   going to be getting because they did a very they did a very good job of underscoring the main point
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:33.560]   which is they think it makes no sense to have a really expensive tablet and a really expensive
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.040]   notebook what you can have a really expensive notebook that also removes the need for a 500
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:44.680]   dollar tablet yeah there were rumors there would be a surface mini a inch and that did not happen
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:50.200]   and so I really have to say you know they were this is Intel this is an arm this is with full
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:58.280]   blown windows it's 12 inches 3 to form factor nine hours battery life and priced pretty much
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:03.800]   right across the board at least if Mary Jofoli is right and she seems to have the prices on this
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:11.800]   the same way apples pricing it's it's MacBooks really interesting thing for me in this is that
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.400]   there's this old joke that it takes Microsoft three years to get it right and I think when a lot of us
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:20.840]   saw the surface we all said this this is not a tablet this this is maybe what the next generation
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:27.080]   of laptops will look like but Microsoft was insisting on the no compromises motto on on advertising
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.840]   it against tablets and it didn't make a lot of sense and you know Steve Jobs when he sold the iPad
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.160]   came out and said it's got to be better than a phone and better at a laptop at certain key things
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.720]   and this event was the one where I finally think Microsoft understood what they wanted to say this
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:45.160]   is better than a tablet better than a laptop at these few things and one of the most hilarious
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:49.320]   things for me is I watched you know a lot of television and they did a ton of product placements for the
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.560]   surface and I remember watching Hawaii 501 week and they took out their iPads and did something
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:58.040]   quickly and then the next week they were in a car and a suspect ran away and they took out their
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:02.280]   surface tablet and put the keyboard on the car locked it into place started going through it and the
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.680]   guy was halfway down the street and it was clear they didn't know what it was meant to do but now
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:11.240]   you see a surface for example on arrow and they're using it to watch TV it seems like they finally
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.840]   got comfortable with what the surface is supposed to be and I think that's the most exciting thing
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:21.800]   for me in the announcement here's the pricing the base model which is an i3 processor 64 gigs of
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:30.200]   storage four gigs of RAM minus a keyboard 800 bucks add the keyboard to talking 929 bucks
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:39.320]   which is you know and that's $900 for a MacBook Air 11 inch this is a 12 inch you go to kind of a
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:47.800]   more kind of normal configuration the i5 128 gigs of storage four gigs of RAM thousand bucks plus
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:55.000]   the keyboard for 130 bucks you're right these are almost parallel to the similar MacBook prices
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.840]   and I guess the difference is the keyboard's not attached in fact it's optional and you have a pen
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.880]   which of course Steve Jobs very famously said that's stupid and I thought welcome this time they
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.720]   switched to the welcome oh it's not wack them yeah exactly yeah interesting yeah
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:15.720]   it's it's it's a similar type of system but yes it's it's not they switched away from that which
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.880]   was hilarious they were using for for the surface previously still pressure sensitive and all of
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.880]   that stuff exactly it'll do everything that they wanted that an artist would want to do it that
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.600]   they even showed off a pressure sensitive version of Adobe Photoshop that will work with it but
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:33.560]   they're it's interesting to see them trying to modify their aim a little bit this to bring it back
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.560]   to to bring Apple back into this this has always been a really interesting
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:45.640]   debate about philosophy yeah where is do you want to sell is it more correct to have a bespoke
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:52.280]   device for multi-touch and a bespoke device for laptop sort of things or can you basically
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.760]   put both of those features into the same device does that make sense and that is
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:02.680]   really just a Berlin wall of ideological difference between apples thinking and Microsoft's thinking
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:08.280]   and as Renee said there's there's there's the common wisdom that every other Star Trek movie is
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.200]   really really good or really really bad whenever you look at it and there's the other common wisdom
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:16.760]   maybe true maybe not is that Apple takes three tries to get something right and this is the
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.960]   third version of it and you see them making some critical adjustments to this number one being
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:27.000]   most obviously they have ditched the widescreen form factor and now it has an iPad form factor it
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.800]   has four by three exactly what you'd see on a laptop screen because that that addresses one big
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:36.280]   stumbling block that they had with the previous one because I've used them and you just they it just
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:43.240]   it it when you turn it on its side to go to use an important registration like if you're reading a
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:49.240]   book it almost like says okay I'll do that but I want you to know that I really really hate having
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:53.880]   to do this because it just looks like you're reading a legal document and they also try to fix the
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:22:00.280]   idea that it really isn't so much of a laptop replacement as a desktop replacement because
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:05.400]   the one thing it really is hard to do and of course the right in the middle of this live press event
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:10.360]   is the perfect place to show it you can't sit in a chair and have a surface in your lap and actually
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:15.240]   expect to get anything done you're going to be spending most of your caloric body consumption
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:20.040]   trying to keep this thing balanced because it's a fold-out kickstand so now they change that type
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:26.760]   pad cover so that it actually attaches magnetically it still magnetically attaches and really holds on
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.880]   good but it also clicks on a little bit higher than it used to and the kickstand has also been
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:37.800]   redesigned a little bit so that it's easier to have that thing on your lap so this is the next
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:49.240]   stage of that ideological battle hmm I don't I I feel like we're almost in a post tablet era
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:55.400]   so well we're definitely yeah I'm really you see I've been thinking a lot about this over the past
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.080]   three four months because you know what a big advocate of the iPad I am I love you and I think
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.200]   more people should try to use it as a notebook replacement but I don't think that message has
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:09.240]   really been taken up by the general populace right now I think that they're really thinking that a
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:14.280]   notebook is a notebook a tablet is a totally different thing and if you can make a tablet that's
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:19.800]   more like a Kindle that's even better which is why everybody seems to be putting so much effort into
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:25.720]   making these pocketable eight inch seven inch and even smaller tablets and it's because it comes a
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:33.080]   little bit harder to explain the purpose of a 9.7 inch iPad Air because you're basically telling
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:39.160]   people that telling people who want to have a separate device for their quote real computing
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:43.480]   unquote and you're telling them but spend more money for the one that's harder to carry around
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:49.080]   even though it doesn't run any apps any differently than the iPad mini does so I think this is
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:56.600]   I've been saying all along that I don't even think that Apple had a real clear picture of who must
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:02.040]   buy an iPad which is why in the first introduction to the first iPad they were not really willing to
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:06.360]   lock it down as a productivity thing or an entertainment thing they really wanted to put it out there
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:11.080]   no people come up yeah they wanted they didn't want to tell people what it was so that people
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:16.520]   could judge it as a notebook or judge it as an expensive e-book reader it's a new thing yeah
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:23.160]   exactly and so I think that we're in a phase where this is an interesting test case to see if
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:29.000]   people are buying the idea of the multi-touch tablet as a true next generation real computing
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.560]   device or if this is going to be really a case where everybody who would have bought a full-sized
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:38.520]   iPad has bought one right now and now that there are more options in the market those people who
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.920]   would have might have been buying one next year are now going to be looking at alternatives
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:48.840]   so that's interesting data my gut tells me there's two distinct devices there's a computer
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:55.240]   desktop or laptop and there's a phone and this idea that there might be something in between and
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:00.200]   that's how apple presented the iPad from day one I think it's going to disappear I really think
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:05.880]   that it's either you want a laptop or you want a phone it could be a range of things so that old
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:11.240]   Steve Jobs truck and car analogy you might get wearable it depends how much computer do you need
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.680]   and for a lot of people a traditional computer is still not accessible still intimidating
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.280]   it's still not what they want so maybe a phone or a tablet is better but then you get into
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:22.200]   wearables which are like motorcycles there's sub phone you go from phones to tablets and you
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.760]   have tablets in between which are you know maybe like an SUV or a hybrid or something then you get
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:31.000]   the tablet and then maybe you have something between the tablet and the and the truck or the
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.240]   the computer which is like the surface and you have this range of things just like we have a range
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:40.520]   of cars and I think that's only a symbol of the market maturing because mobile is so new and it
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:44.680]   was we're so unused to it and now you have primary and only computing platforms that
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.120]   aren't traditional computers and that's what I think makes all this so exciting right now
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:52.600]   we're gonna take a break when we come back lots more to talk about Annie and Akos here from the

[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:39.720]   hey good news Siri integration into the podcast app Siri play Mac break weekly car play support
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.600]   proof browsing I'm actually thrilled to see apple put more energy into the podcast app I don't know
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.120]   if you guys ever saw there was a blog post two years ago by guy English that was one of my favorite
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.600]   things he's ever written where he was talking about looking into Siri about the API's and whether
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:57.960]   developers could ever use it and he writes this this sort of dramatic play between people inside
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:03.400]   apple and it's it's really accurate it's almost the Siri manager comes up and says are you are you
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.920]   integrating with Grenada and he says I have no idea what that is and he goes weren't you disclosed
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:11.000]   none of you guys are ever disclosed he says we'll find out about it so he wonders over to the
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.120]   Grenada guy and he says what are you working on he says Siri goes what's that he goes I don't know
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.960]   he goes can I tell you I don't think so can tell me what you're doing and it ends up that Grenada
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.200]   is find my friends and there's no way for them to work together except through usual URL schemes
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.200]   and resource sharing and it just showed how complicated it was to build this car and
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:31.240]   a way it strikes deep into your heart it will creep and I think this is an unfortunate legacy of
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:37.880]   Steve Jobs's incredible drive to secrecy and that can hurt you as a company I feel like Tim Cook is
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:42.440]   backing down a little bit and I'm curious I think I think the fact that they've buried the hatchet
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:47.400]   with Motorola this happened this week or last week yeah they announced that you know what not only
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:52.040]   are we going to drop our lawsuits against Google and Moatarola we're not going to make a licensing
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:56.680]   deal and we're going to work together to kind of improve this patent situation because it sucks
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:01.560]   that's not a Steve Jobs move that's a Tim Cook move and I'm hoping Tim might do the same thing with
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:08.120]   secrecy well to be fair Steve Jobs could have made that move after talking with a lot of his own
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.560]   people who would then be telling look it's now it is now in Apple's best interest to set aside
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:21.160]   battles that are no longer in this company's best interests but the Apple certainly was going
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:26.760]   to be having trouble defending all these patent wars at the same time claiming that the patent
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:31.720]   system is broken it needs to be fixed there's in every time you look at the stack of patents
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:37.000]   that were being that were in dispute with all these suits you see a big pile that Apple absolutely
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.480]   innovated there's something they invented there's something that did not exist they created before
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:45.320]   and they created something unique that seems to require patent protection but then there
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:50.840]   also there'd also be these things where really something that I know that I've seen well before
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:56.440]   iOS is now you on the okay whatever so I think I think we can never know and that's why it's
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:01.160]   stupid to say well Steve we've never done that we can't but was Steve I believe under Steve Jobs
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:05.080]   they did write the settlement with Nokia they did do the settlement with HTC I'm not sure if they
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:09.400]   sued Motorola or Motorola sued them but that was standards involved in central patents were involved
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:14.040]   in that it's really the Samsung one that I think was the driving thing for Steve Jobs because of
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.560]   both sound because Samsung and Google were both his partners and he felt personally
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:22.200]   right affronted by that I don't think Motorola was ever part of that thermonuclear war strategy
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:27.560]   since Samsung really is that one company where you look at the first two phones they made after
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:34.680]   the iPhone and you say come on guys so I don't if Apple ever said you know what give us a token
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:39.480]   $10 settlement it just just a handshake all we wanted was the moral victory no that's the
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:45.400]   that that is the Popeye versus Bluto fight that happens until the heat death of the universe
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:48.120]   and Motorola couldn't have looked more different I mean Motorola even the early
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:52.120]   droids looked like Corellian Starships nothing like Apple let's watch with interest though because
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.200]   they the rewards are diminishing instead of a billion it's a hundred million and
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:02.040]   Samsung got a little bit out of Apple which is and and there's you see the the price that both
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:08.360]   companies pay to secrecy because these of the of the disclosure the discovery process that goes on
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:13.880]   in these lawsuits and the public relations laws I think cannot be minimized it people get pissed
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:20.360]   off after a while what you're suing suing just make a better iPhone now the real test will be rock
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:27.560]   the rock star patents Microsoft Apple Blackberry a bunch of companies bought the Nortell patents
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:32.360]   and these this is this could really be the thermonuclear device in the in the patent wars
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:36.680]   so we'll see if they back down on that and of course you're right we'll have to see what happens
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:41.320]   with Apple Samsung you know if they settle they say well give us your hundred ten million and
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:46.360]   we'll give you our hundred thousand and now we're done this is a time that you could walk away from
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:51.800]   it without losing any face and say we won we won both times and Motorola I mean I'm not an
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.840]   expert but it didn't seem like it was an agreement of any kind it was just sort of a
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:59.000]   detente where they said we're not going to continue with these lawsuits and no licensing deal
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.520]   yeah so it was just we're walking away basically I I don't know I feel like that's a bellwether for
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:09.560]   a new way of looking at this stuff I hope it is it's it's it's just a sign that the real realization
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:14.520]   this was an unproductive lawsuit even if they won what would they have won by winning this
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:20.600]   it's not as clear as well as the lawsuits against Samsung and I'm not sure that ordinary
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:28.120]   consumers are as sensitive to these issues as we are but nonetheless I do think that Apple could
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:32.120]   my personal opinion is that I think that Apple could be a lot more open about what their future
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:37.960]   directions and their future plans are because I do right right now there's a certain level of
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:43.000]   counter-fud going on with people that come to me for advice on buying Apple stuff because
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.440]   they will I want to buy a new laptop I don't know if Apple's going to be coming up with something new
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:51.480]   in the next two months or if this is they're planning to to make this obsolete or not and I can say
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:55.880]   well I'm pretty sure that they're going to be doing this I don't think that they'll be doing
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:00.920]   that I think you'll be safe if you want to buy a new MacBook pro in the next two or three months
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:06.760]   but then again maybe not we're asked almost every other almost every other area of tech it's
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:13.960]   positive either through a direct leak or through a preview a preview event or even just you know not
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.040]   really slapping around growing plays enough it's possible to say no no don't buy the Sony
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:22.040]   ARX 100 model 2 because they've got the model 3 that's definitely coming out in two weeks it's
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.960]   going to be a vent on this date and this is when we know that here the specs here here the leak
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:30.680]   here the leak product images I think that's the stuff the consumers care about more than who's
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:36.360]   who has the IP for who I know I think there's a natural prejudice against companies at
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:43.080]   Sewalot I do I do think that people are very aware of Apple Samsung do they do they even really
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:47.320]   Apple Samsung yes because that's that's really a lot of the national news yeah they don't they
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:51.320]   don't know and they don't care about the agreements that Apple has with Microsoft about mobile devices
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:55.960]   they don't know and they don't care about this thing between Motorola and Apple probably possibly
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:02.840]   because this was released after the close after like what 8.05 8 10 p.m. on a Friday this is this
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.920]   and even if even if they did make it the lead item on Monday morning I don't think anybody would
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:12.360]   understand it enough to rustle up any care about it right and again like Apple absolutely did fire
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.040]   everything in Samsung and HTC and some other vendors but Motorola was incredibly litigious
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:20.520]   before they went after Apple I think it was I forget the gentleman's name son the guy who
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:24.600]   ran Motorola before Google bought it he was threatening to see other android vendors I mean
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:28.040]   they have a good history of being litigious all their own so it was sort of yeah I'm
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:33.720]   what a role invented the modern cell phone so yeah they could be in that they could be the Apple
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:39.800]   from that era hey we invented this stuff yeah and that is an area where I kind of agree with you
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:44.680]   because when these lawsuits then happen and now Apple has to really release all of these
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:50.600]   documents that talk about conversations that they meant to be private Apple sometimes does lose
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:54.520]   face so a couple of years ago what what really does the thing in the in the first round of these
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:59.320]   lawsuits that really disappointed me was that presentation that Samsung presented as evidence
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:05.320]   about here is here is how Apple decided here's the licensing agreement that Apple offered and as
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:10.360]   part of that slide deck they were giving examples of here's the this specific type of this specific
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.360]   device here's how much you would always per unit and they were including phones that had come out
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:19.160]   long before the iPhone that had a blackberry style keyboard that had nothing close to the
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:23.800]   iOS interface but the slide itself was saying things like well because it is an iPhone like
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:28.360]   functionality you would owe us $12 in each one of these you sell and when when things like that
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:34.600]   get out and if somebody that has an ordinary consumers aren't going to be pouring through this
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:39.080]   and reading this but then people in the tech press will do it and if they get upset about it they
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:44.120]   can put it into words that they can confusingly and haltingly make understandable to the mass
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:51.000]   media to the mass audience and then it doesn't work out well for Apple. Renee Holtz still fruit
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.240]   just a second here I think you missed a spot I'm just going to put a little of this
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:37:02.360]   very scream on there. Oh you move don't move don't worry sorry how do you like that delicious
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:07.880]   mentholated death oh this is so good minty good Leo isn't it oh man that smells good
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:14.520]   and then of course we've got the beautiful steel handled blade these are these are made in Germany
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:21.720]   the the king I love that the king of of great steel blades and let me just you're not going
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:26.280]   to feel a thing here Renee watch this I trust you completely Leo right there
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:36.200]   look at that clean this a wistful I'm going to need a rag to to towel you off there I forgot
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:42.520]   the hot towel I begin with a great shave is awaiting you at Harry's everybody you know it's
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:47.880]   not just the plate I mean these plays are beautiful and the and and affordable and so forth but the
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:53.320]   people are constantly we sent one of these to a Steve Gibson and he said this isn't you know I'm
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:59.480]   using an Gillette gel to shave with this is something completely different it's creamy
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:06.120]   it gives you the best shave you ever had in your life people for years have been you know I frankly
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:11.720]   think taking advantage of by the razor blade companies four dollars a razor a blade for the
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:17.640]   Gillette fusion I mean that's that's crazy four dollars if you get it for four dollars you're lucky
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:23.240]   I mean I'm paying more than that in fact there these things are so expensive the retailers are
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:26.520]   putting the theft protection devices on the blades you can't even take them off the shelf
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:31.400]   you have to get a clerk time to lock it for you that's great it's like they're diamonds
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:36.040]   so many people I know don't want to do that they get the disposable blade oh my god that's
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:42.360]   just a nightmare that thing is it's made to cut your face up this is a better choice Harry's a
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:47.320]   great shave at a fair price it was founded less than a year ago now by two guys Andy and Jeff

[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:13.880]   I usually forget to shave but if only I were using my kid from Harry's I would also smell just
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:19.800]   as good as I look yeah there are a lot of similarities between Harry's and Warby Parker Jeff
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:26.360]   co-founder and Warby Parker great design meticulous craftsmanship amazing value in a marketplace where
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:33.400]   monopolies and marketing have really inflated the costs and dedicated customer service very
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:38.280]   personal I want you to go to Harry's take a look at the Winston set that's the one I have it's

[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:34.440]   that's I mean just it's a great slogan just to cover all bases if Harry's and chocolate just you
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:41.080]   know go to both have a half pound bag of minimums just no then you're then you're cooking with
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.560]   a ton of guests sir and you're happy inside and out
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:48.600]   hey how about that big beets merger
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:55.080]   what the hell is that gonna happen or is that was I write and it's a bogus rumor
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:00.440]   what do you think did that video scotlet for him to the minute Tim Cook looked at Facebook
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:06.040]   looking Dr. Dre well Dr. Dre posted and for those who don't know Dr. Dre who was the founder of
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:12.040]   beats and I think still has like 25% stake it you know if you look at how beats his finances of
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:16.600]   I mean they were bought by HTC then HTC sold back a chunk it's owned by an investment company
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:20.680]   now and they sold back the rest of the their investment and then it's gone up and down and
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:26.040]   crazy and I don't know who owns it but Jimmy Iovine the record producer and Dr. Dre involved
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:33.640]   apparently will I am as a silent partner in it from the red hot black strawberry cherries whatever
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:39.320]   the name of that group is a elephant funk what is their name I can't remember anymore
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:45.240]   let's get let's get it started in here black eyed peas black eyed peas
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:50.440]   will I love will I am by the way I think he's the coolest guy ever he said I you know they did
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:56.520]   brief I didn't know this beats did briefly lady Gaga headphones what they were called and then
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:07.720]   they did some headphones for P Diddy and yeah they didn't do a will I am he said I don't want a
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:12.760]   headphone in fact you got to wonder if will I am he's like doesn't want to be associated with
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:20.440]   beats I don't know he wants the money anyway beats is a headphone company I think pretty much
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:25.640]   everybody agrees there's no there's no reason Apple would want that except it's got good cash flow
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:30.280]   although why steaks parts of it keep getting sold off is a little that's a little odd
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:34.280]   and then and then of course they have the streaming music business
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:41.640]   Dr. Dre did post a video on Facebook which was almost immediately taken down but somebody
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.880]   already scraped it and put it on YouTube of him saying he's the first hip hop billionaire based on
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:50.040]   this I think he was on the I didn't see it was he on the phone it was Tyreus Gibson was doing
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:56.040]   the video and he had Dr. Dre in the background and then everybody danced yeah yeah I I have
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:02.440]   to say I my opinion is why is our is this is our this is us because both at both of these guys
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:07.400]   the bandwidths just declined I've been chatting with with pandrick um it happened at the exact same
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:12.680]   time I noticed it in both video at the exact same time so it's us I just want Apple to know that
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:21.320]   the fine Twitter organization is also available for sale anytime just we'll use face time millionaire
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:27.400]   all the time I'm the first podcast billionaire yeah see that and that see that is the point
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:31.560]   too because if so if if I woke up one morning and found that there's a rumor that Apple had
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:36.760]   agreed to hire me for like an 80 dollar package and I knew and I knew that was absolutely
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:41.560]   bogus the first thing I would do was put up a video or have my friends oh oh yeah congratulations
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:46.520]   Andy it could be a billionaire it could be because it'd be funny it would be funny as hell and also
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:52.200]   because maybe that will convince someone to come up with a real offer for 81 I personally think that
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:59.560]   both both I of I of I of Veen and Dre are jinnying this up because it makes them more valuable now
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:05.640]   Steve Jobs biographer Walter Isaacson always a credible source says he thinks that Jimmy Iovine
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:13.640]   is gonna be running Apple's content business which I think is a total non-starter we said that
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:19.560]   last we can do something at EQ's workload yeah but I don't think I of means the right guy I really
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:27.080]   don't in 2002 I of being helped Jobs persuade the music labels to sign on to the iTunes store
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:31.720]   according to Isaacson at the time he was running it her scope Gefan and an M part of the universal
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:37.160]   music group in 2004 he helped broker the deal with you two to get that special red and black
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:46.920]   iPod which was really cool so Dan Lyons fake Steve Jobs writing for Billboard says he called Isaacson
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:51.320]   Isaacson went back to the notes he had taken while preparing the biography and found something he
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:58.440]   didn't include in the book a comment from Iovine that back in 2002 he wanted the apple chief to
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:05.480]   acquire universal certainly Apple has enough cash to in fact acquire the entire music business
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:13.080]   if they wanted to yeah see that's and I'm still not in the headspace where from saying this is
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:17.240]   happening this is why this is why Apple is doing this it's a it's still in the wrong
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:23.400]   home of an experiment and Apple is interested in a company like this where I'm at right
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:29.720]   idea that maybe they're trying to make a move to what Sony made about 20 years ago
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:34.840]   which is to say well why why should we just be in the book make consumer on a
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:41.160]   I can you I should have given Comcast that hundred million dollars they wanted yeah for full access
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:47.800]   to Skype damn it but you both are brought to you both of your own you can yeah both of you I just
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:52.120]   we will we'll give it a little chance maybe we can how about call them both back while I continue
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:58.200]   to read the story I just called Renee back and it didn't help I knew I should have given Comcast that
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:05.480]   money can you get your bid your bid coming through there yeah no no I'd say it's you coming
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:11.560]   the screen but yeah okay can you get Brian Roberts on the phone Lisa and say we'll give you the money
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:17.800]   because you're right it would be very nice for you to have full access to all your contributors
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:24.760]   over the internet apparently Isaac said thinks that the beats deal such as it is
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:33.400]   whether it exists at all it's not about headphones or music get this about video video
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:39.640]   he thinks that Cook wants to bring an Iovine to negotiate deals with the cable companies with
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.240]   the television companies those deals that we've been talking about you know they've been in
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:47.800]   negotiations with with time Warner then when Comcast said we're gonna buy time Warner now
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:51.880]   they're talking to Comcast and we've always said it's a non-starter for both companies they're maybe
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:57.000]   they're being polite but there's no way they're gonna let Apple have special access to their their
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:05.560]   stuff and of course Apple's not made a deal can Iovine come in put put a deal together as he did
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:11.240]   with you two and the music industry he doesn't have as far as I know he doesn't have any track
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:16.920]   record with the with the television industry but it's an interesting idea American Idol
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:22.760]   did he do American Idol oh yeah he was he appears on it yeah I am Jimmy Iovine I think you suck
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:27.640]   the honest thing Leo is that the reasons didn't leak along with the supposed deal and if you think
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.000]   if there were solid reasons that would have been part of the leak along with the price and everything
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:37.960]   else no deal this is and why but now would Apple should Apple deny this deal or if it didn't exist
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:42.200]   would they see this is what people tell me well Leo okay maybe you're right maybe there's no deal
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.480]   but wouldn't if that's the case wouldn't Apple step forward say what do you what are you nuts
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:49.800]   they might be in negotiations for stuff that's not exactly this deal or for elements of this
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:53.240]   deal they're not going to say anything until they've got whatever they want out of it and if they
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:58.120]   never get anything they'll never say anything they're all there they're all there also has to be an
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:03.080]   upside to them talking about this if they saw the stock was taking a dive because investors are
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:06.680]   starting to panic that they're getting into the the headphone business or they're they're
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:11.400]   making a major major pivot that they don't approve of then you would see Apple try to put out the
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:16.840]   fire a little bit but abs and a reason to do so then I can do it can I play can I play this Dr.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:23.480]   Dre video or is it really profane it's profane can we uh okay so what you're about to hear
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:32.440]   no let's just let me won't play it you use your imagination I'm rich be-otch did he say that
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:39.320]   sort of yeah a lot a lot of daycare workers do play Mac break during work hours okay I should
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:44.760]   be careful okay but it would be it would be interesting and again this is nothing this is not
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:50.040]   prediction this is just me thinking that you look at a company like Sony that has been around
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:54.760]   now for 50 years so if you discount the time they spent as an electronic store they they're
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:59.480]   their story starts in the mid 50s so now that they're basically a 50 60 year old company and you
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:04.920]   ask yourself how does a consumer electronic company survive 50 to 60 years and one of the
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:11.000]   reasons is to stop being a maker of transistor radios and walkie talkies and even TV sets and just
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.360]   be in every single sector of whatever they figure their business is going to be and I don't think
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:20.360]   Apple whatever articulate in the form of well yes we absolutely need to start manufacturing Apple
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:26.760]   label headphone cable extenders and Apple labeled battery extenders and Apple label accessories
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:33.160]   I do think though it I can see a future in which Apple decides that we we have all this money on
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:37.640]   we have all this money and we have products that right now are still making profits handover
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:43.640]   fist now is the time for us to buy music companies to buy movie studios to buy the providers
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:48.600]   of the entertainment so that we can not only control the sales of it we can also have an idea
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:54.600]   in the promotion of it the creation of it and then the final display of it by the way this Dr.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:51:00.280]   Dre video now has an ad for LA hair in front of it so they're at least they're going to make some
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:06.120]   money there I was joking yesterday that it could just be that apples decided they really need
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:10.200]   someone to take over the negotiations with Hollywood and their music studios it has to be
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:17.720]   Jimmy Iovine and beats his signing bonus I agree that's a big bonus no no I I'm with you
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:21.960]   or me I think that whatever whatever they're planning for business I think the idea of having
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:27.800]   a team that is that is not an electronics executive that had to train to negotiate with
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:32.680]   entertainment companies but an entertainment executive that speaks the lingo of tech I think
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:37.960]   that's a really really that would be a very very interesting acquisition although I we probably
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:42.920]   shouldn't say acquisition in terms of another human being but in terms of how do you get someone to
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:47.400]   stop making beats audio their focus while you buy beats audio and you make sure that everybody
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:52.200]   that signed on as a as a partner beats audio is now a very very happy happy dancing naked in the
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:57.320]   backyard for having money fights with raccoons happy and that's that's probably that might be
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:03.480]   an explanation for this you didn't have to buy burberry to get dame angela orrence in
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:08.440]   I mean can't you just say hey Jimmy you leave the beats thing behind it's a lot of overhead though
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:11.880]   beats doesn't sound like it's that much overhead yeah I guess you're right because you got a billion
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:17.240]   dollars a year also burberry is different you apple already has retail stores all you're doing
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:20.680]   is you're bringing in someone else to manage this business that you already have
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:27.240]   and and also that was a that was a legitimate open slot because they weren't there were some
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:32.840]   problems for the previous guy and there's certainly room to make some changes there this wouldn't
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:38.360]   this wouldn't be as dramatic as a beat as a beats acquisition yeah well be the largest acquisition
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:44.600]   uh in apples history oh yeah no absolutely absolutely but still pocket change yeah and they make
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:48.920]   middle and quality in your headphones Leo they can make middling quality over the year headphones
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:54.680]   yeah yeah that's easy but but the other but the other thing is that I think that it's easy to
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:59.960]   overanalyze this because remember that apple got their first their their first VP of retail
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:04.840]   from from target so it's not as though it's a really real freakish thing to hire someone who's
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:10.040]   successful in retail to come in and do things in retail it would be interesting if this is part of
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:16.280]   a five to ten year plan to have apple have a portfolio of services and features and products
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:21.800]   that goes beyond selling selling consumer hardware and really becomes we want to make sure that the
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:27.320]   apple brand on something means that you might enjoy this tv series this movie this this this
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:31.800]   uh music collection in a way that you might not have if we're being produced by a different label
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:40.600]   or something like that i i gotta think that the the Comcast is is not like swayed by a pretty face
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:45.240]   oh oh it's Jimmy iovine notion negotiating well let's put aside all our concerns about apple
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:49.480]   eat taking all the oxygen out of our business and good make a deal because we love Jimmy
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:54.600]   but it's not going to change the again it is of the matter it does it's not going to say
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:59.480]   we were intimidated by or we were going to negotiate an apple with apple through the different way now
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:03.320]   but now we're going to change our statue it's more it's more like we now have someone who can have
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:08.360]   an idea that would not have occurred to us as a bunch of people who grew up who've been living
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:13.240]   and breathing the tech industry for the past ten or fifteen or twenty years it's not so much that
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:17.880]   the their specific deals that can be cut it's that this person this team can have ideas that apple
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:22.680]   would not have had the same way that again someone who's a successful uh a CEO of target
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:26.680]   could figure out how to build an apple store that is not going to make the same mistakes as the
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:31.320]   gateway store or god forbid a radio shack and also instead of being one of nine different
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:35.160]   things i had accused play you know he's got to run the app store the i-tune store the i-book store
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:40.040]   i-cloud apple server center all these different things you just have one guy who knows the industry
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:48.040]   and is doing that for you every day ah he's working too hard poor poor ed q has no time for his Ferrari
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:57.080]   Leo i i don't i really don't want ed q's workload i just i want his money i want one hundredth of his
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:03.880]   money i don't i i will take maybe his monday schedule from one forty five until two thirty
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:09.960]   that's probably about as much of his job as i could ever do um i'm gonna just stay on record
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:15.640]   as this deal was a non-starter never was a deal they were that was just a bogus rumor i just don't
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:20.600]   apply it's just interesting thing to talk about but it's still rumor rumor rumor and we're still just
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:25.160]   anybody who talks about this as it's a done deal and explains it well i know exactly why apples
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:29.080]   made this choice it's like okay i think you've got strike one and strike two there right they
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:33.480]   assuming this is definitely happening and be assuming that no not only do you know this rumor is true
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:39.160]   but you know the reasons behind the rumor thing that may or may not be happening so yeah you know
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:44.920]   Samsung put out a line of luxury headphones so it's competition there and there's 70
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:50.840]   bigger than apple headphones so you know they're better Angela Aron's has been three weeks now at
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:57.480]   apple already reshaping the retail team visiting stores holding calls with store managers according
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:03.480]   to uh mark german who's everywhere these days you know i found out mark's 20 it's ridiculous
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:10.040]   he's he was on t&t this morning okay he's a kid he's also got seems to be the guy
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:13.960]   he's he's gets we quote him more now than Jim dallerimple
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:27.720]   so Angela Aron's has reorganized or re-architecting the top retail brass to better fit with her vision
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:34.360]   Bob Bridger who is VP of app or real estate retail real estate the guy who buys you know the store
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:41.720]   properties or is the actual land or releases it and Jim Bean he was VP finance he's VP of apple
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:49.560]   retail operations will stay there uh Steve Kano who is vice president of retail will going off he's
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:56.680]   gonna do we're gonna send him to do international sales somewhere else uh and the head of apple
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:02.440]   european retail Wendy Beckman head of china retail denny tuza are coming in with broader
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:07.320]   responsibilities she does online as well as the the physical stores
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:15.640]   uh and uh earlier this year apple appointed um Bob cupbins who is a former delta
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:21.880]   airlines executive to run online stores um not sure what his role will be going forward but it
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:27.080]   looks like he maintains his role according to apple employees with whom this is mark german
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:31.080]   writing according to apple employees with whom arin says shared her vision for the future of apple
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:35.960]   retail further growth in china one of three critical pieces on which she will focus
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:42.520]   um she believes the tastes of chinese consumers are critical applause to the globe not only in china
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:47.160]   and apple needs to listen to this focus on making its stores and retail marketing initiatives
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:52.040]   friendly to that growing sector of the world does that mean all the stores are just the chinese
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:58.440]   stores she's been touring apple stores in the the nearby area the stanford store multiple stores in
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:03.480]   san francisco employees who have met with her described her as warm and genuine honest and
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:11.080]   passionate and she is one snappy dresser one scene no i added that as one as one senior ranking apple
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:19.800]   retail executive put it she is so apple um is that like being so raven i haven't seen that show
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:26.280]   but i don't know i am so apple so uh people did not like browad by the way the dixon's guy i think
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:32.120]   it was because he was such a the dixon's is really a low end retailer and and angela comes from a
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:37.720]   higher end fashion background yeah even over the phone one retail manager said you feel like you're
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:45.000]   speaking to her as if she's sitting right next to you second area she wants to focus taking apple
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:51.720]   retail into the future mobile payments so pat you know a wallet has been just sitting there what is
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:58.360]   it called the past past past book has just been sitting there uh be nice she apparently uh is
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:06.840]   gonna work with eddy q to build a mobile payment service for the ipone ipone yeah that that's long
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:12.760]   overdue i was i was as soon as past book made its appearance i really thought that you would be
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:17.800]   able to use your apple id to purchase things inside the apple store because what better place to test
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:24.200]   out a system like that uh and a make the apple story an even more special uh experience for people
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:28.360]   but also to collect the data that they can present to other per other retailers saying well here's
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:32.600]   how here's how this affected here's how this positively affected our revenue as soon as we
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:37.000]   allow people to make payments through their phones here is how many transactions that we produced
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.320]   here's how much money we put through and here's how many problems that were created by this and
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:45.400]   it's a very very low number and a very very low bar on the graph and that's how you then sell
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:49.640]   mobile payments to pharmacies to clothing stores to other places in the mall
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:56.360]   but you do that 30 area of yeah 30 area focus will be the apple store app in fact that the entire end
[00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:02.360]   end apple store sales experience from the point in in which you find the product you want to purchase
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:05.640]   to how they discuss the product with apple store employees to how they pay for the product
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:11.160]   german says arance would like to redesign the complete experience she told some retail managers
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:18.760]   i got my mba at burberry but i will get my p hd at apple me to to Andy's point you can use the apple
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:23.000]   store app now in many countries to scan the barcodes and use your iTunes account to pay for the
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.640]   the goods it's just not integrated with past book or past kit at all so it's sort of that last
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:33.800]   loop that's not there yet it's clear that the apple rank and file lover uh which is important
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.320]   you you know if you're gonna be a leader at apple you better have the support of the people
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:43.880]   underneath you uh it seems like she's a very very very good choice um for this position
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:50.520]   yeah i mean the the i don't know i i have not spoken anybody about uh her 10 year and what
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:55.480]   while they're what retail store trans actors are about that uh but i was talking to people about
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:01.480]   that with the with her predecessor and the the amount the the the speed at which he was creating a
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:06.920]   demoralized spirit inside those stores when you get these people who are they are they are
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:11.880]   often people who are working there because they love apple they love their products and they know
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:15.560]   that they're not part of you know apple coopertina they're not part of the legacy of apple but they
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:20.440]   make it so they they are very very pleased to be sharing products that they really really like
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:25.080]   with other people and so when they feel as though they're starting to be treated like you know
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:29.480]   anybody it's anybody who's working at sunglass hut anybody's working at the gap is saying you
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:32.840]   know i we feel as though we can cut down your hours we feel as though we can start paying you
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:37.320]   less we feel as though we don't need to treat you as well as we always have that that really has a
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:41.960]   domino effect that's it makes people certainly expect okay fine we will we will act like we will
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:47.240]   act like typical like mall employees now we will simply we will be aware of exactly what we are
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:52.200]   required to provide to you our employer and to our customers and we will not be very well motivated
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:57.880]   to do much more than that dan rayburn writing for streaming media blog we've had dan on twig before
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:04.360]   he's he's one of the you know most astute observers of the behind the scenes stuff that goes on with
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:13.320]   content creators content distribution networks and the big isp says that apple has decided to
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:18.840]   negotiate deals with isp's for their own content distribution network apple has for years use
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:23.560]   akamai which is the king of content distribution the idea of a content distribution network is
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:30.920]   the company owns servers close to you close to your isp so that the content comes faster to you
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:37.560]   uh apple has has used akamai at great expense i might add akamai is not cheap to make it
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:42.760]   faster and easier to download stuff from iTunes to watch netflix on the apple tv and
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:51.560]   and other stuff but the idea that apple might create its own cdn is uh very interesting they
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.840]   care about the experience they care very very deeply about how good the quality of your
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:59.480]   iTunes is and your point they pay for their own netflix delivery which is why netflix is so good
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:04.120]   on the apple tv and this looks like just a logical extension of that apple takes up
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:09.800]   according to san vine about two percent of total internet traffic at peak hours of course netflix
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:19.000]   about 34 percent uh so uh but but i have to say this is this is an interesting example of why apple
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:25.400]   is a different kind of company because this is money you spend that is not uh on a more beautiful
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:30.840]   store or a more beautiful product or marketing or advertising this is money you spend on consumer
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:36.440]   experience and it is not insignificant it's a lot of money to do this right i sort of like painting
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:39.960]   the back of the fence in steve jobs lingo because it's not something that's obvious to a lot of people
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:44.200]   they'll just notice the quality you know you're counting on them to notice the better experience
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.200]   and to associate that with apple's brand but you're not it doesn't give you an advertising advantage
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:53.960]   or branding advantage copy yeah but it makes people who have apple tv happy and they don't
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:59.320]   know why they're happy by this is why this is why these interconnect deals are are kind of hidden
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:03.400]   because if you get bad netflix service you don't blame your internet service provider even though
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:09.560]   that might be at fault you blame netflix uh apple does apple tv works better you know i don't know
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:13.880]   if you're gonna say hey i that's my apple tv you're just gonna say hey i really netflix is working great
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:18.440]   right now it's a it's it's paint in the back of the fence i think that's a very apt way to put it
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:23.400]   but uh again one of the reasons apple is uh is where it is
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:30.760]   uh got to got to support that developers are going to be able to provide promo codes for
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:34.280]   in-app purchases you'd think that's something they would have had for a long time but no this is new
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:40.280]   um uh that it'll be easier for people to try out freemium games and apps
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:47.320]   uh with promo codes initial uh the way it's been so far i guess you could use a promo code for the
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:52.600]   initial download but you couldn't do it for in-app purchases this is really i mean this is more of
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.520]   an inside baseball thing because apt there's not a lot you can't still give unlimited promo codes
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:01.000]   so they mostly give it to reviewers i've always paid for my own apps i've paid for my in-app purchases
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.280]   but i could i can understand if you're a small site and you have a lot of apps to go through it's
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:09.080]   very beneficial but it's not something that's going to help an everyday user of apple products
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:13.640]   so this is not for users for the press you could give them out as contests or something but i think
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:18.040]   it's still you get 50 or 100 codes every time you get a ton of pressure oh okay so you can't have
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:23.800]   hey this week only 50 percent off with the offer code macap no all right i mean there's
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:28.840]   there's certain provisions for vouchers for enterprise and schools and things but not for everyday customers
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:34.360]   what's apple going to do now that word lens is a google company apple's been in the most
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:38.520]   their most recent i-phone app powerful word lens was featured this is the really cool
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:42.040]   i-phone app that lets you take a picture of a sign and it translates it
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:46.600]   font and all into english google just bought them last week
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:52.280]   i don't know if that means they won't do an i-phone app google makes plenty of money on i-phone apps
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:56.760]   is very happy to do i-phone apps so i imagine a word lens will continue yeah but i doubt i'll see
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:02.520]   it in an apple ad going forward yeah i i don't i i don't see them uh it's it's gonna be it's gonna
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:06.120]   be rolled into the google apps so you're you're still gonna be able to get it you'll still get
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:10.040]   the advantages of that technology if you're putting photo if you're putting photos on google
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:14.680]   plus i think we're talking about that before the start of the show uh i don't think it affects apple
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:19.400]   at all and what platform value thing though i mean instagram was a great apple on i-phone and it was
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:23.960]   bought snapsy there's a lot of terrific apps that just get bought out from the app store and
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:27.880]   whether that means they're still available or not and even apple once in a while they'll do that
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:32.280]   with syri but it makes you wonder again when that sort of platform exclusivity and first party apps
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:36.280]   and apple starts buying more and more of the apps that they show off in commercials kicks in yeah
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:45.240]   yeah i mean the word of the day is graphene i was watching tnt last week a lot of conversation about
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:56.440]   both apple and sam sung racing for patents on graphene uh it's the according to the article in
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:04.360]   bloomberg it's the high tech version of cling wrap it's it's a transparent material uh that
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:10.520]   conducts electricity so you could put it over the screen of a phone or a tablet to turn it into a
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:15.320]   touch screen it's thinner stronger and more flexible than what they currently use uh it will
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:23.720]   allow flexible for instance uh screens smartwatches tablets sam sung apple and google are both a mass
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:31.240]   are all three amassing arsenals of graphene related patents um sam sung uh an apple perhaps coming into
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:36.360]   battle over this one sam sang has four hundred five published applications four hundred and five
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:43.320]   uh in the u.s that's worldwide in the u.s sam sang has 38 patents and 17 applications using the
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:53.480]   word graphene apple has two patent applications i bm fox con this is going to be an interesting
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:08:00.200]   uh an interesting technology with uh with a lot of people claiming parent you know if they all
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:04.600]   get a few patents then they can just say hey you know we'll yeah cross license to ignore it yeah
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.960]   the one thing i've heard this really interesting is still graphene and battery technology because
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:12.680]   we're still using lithium ion batteries not only are they big but they're also an insulator so it
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:16.840]   means you have to throttle down the processor and all these devices so quickly because it just the
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:22.120]   heat gets intolerable right and if they can figure out a way to get past that then not only uh do
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:25.880]   you have all the advantage of the graphene but you get thinner devices that can stay faster for longer
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:30.200]   graphene is really the holy grail durable and steel and has high heat conductive
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:36.440]   ton kabilligity high heat conductability conductability i haven't been drinking
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:43.400]   yet i'm gonna start right after the show and conduct electricity a hundred times faster than
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:47.960]   silicon well that may that makes sense silicon isn't silicon not a conductor isn't that the whole
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:52.600]   reason they use silicon i don't know say semi-conductors it's a semi-conductor right i don't think that
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:58.360]   that means necessarily what you think it means um european commission announced a one billion
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:05.320]   dollar ten year funding initiative for graphene development and research this is uh this is uh
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:09.640]   you know i don't know what it means but that's the word of the week keep it in mind future Leo the
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:16.920]   future uh one word Benjamin one word with a future graphie with a future graphie
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.240]   wait it's not plastics anymore it's graphene
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:25.000]   graphene son that's my father i do not do i phone rumors but let's just get him out of the way
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.680]   rene richie uh you know he's got his finger on the pulse at a room and beat we're gonna see what
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:40.280]   bigger screen yes ten seven tens why well how 1704 by 960 that seems like a very uh specific
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:45.800]   rumor so i think that's probably markerman as well right yeah that's markerman again so uh
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:50.920]   i've heard only of one bigger iphone um an apple prototypes everything right so it's meaningless
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:55.640]   to say we they're they've got a screen at this resolution is meaningless well i mean they've got
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:59.880]   like us like we discussed really they've got touch screen you know max and i max and and
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:03.320]   mac books they just don't like them they they prototype everything mark might have heard that
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:08.440]   they've chosen the at three x iphone as the most likely candidate i don't know because i haven't
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:12.440]   heard that yet right but in order to scale they have a couple options they can just make the
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:16.280]   resolution bigger like they made the ipad mini smaller so the same amount of pixels but the
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:21.560]   density goes down to you know roughly ipad error levels they could also go to three x which means
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:28.920]   every pixel on the original iphone uh the iphone one two three and three g just it is made three
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:33.400]   times you you instead of doing two of them like the iphone four you do three of them but then some
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:38.120]   pixels fall on the grid so it looks a little bit blurry but if you try to do four x which is pixel
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:42.520]   double or retina display then you've got to have a gpu that drives it you got to have leds that
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:46.920]   shine light on it uh and it becomes an obscene amount of power and you know pixels beyond what
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:51.480]   the human eye can look at and then you could maybe go 1080p like android phones or 2k like the
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:55.240]   upcoming android phones but in that case that you're just throwing everything out and developers
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:11:00.200]   have to start from scratch so it's a really interesting problem for apple to solve and three x could be
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.120]   it's not it's not a great solution because android already is much higher than that
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:10.280]   but it's a pragmatic solution if they go that way 4.7 inches is that the size or is it bigger
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:15.400]   sounds about right it sounds like i believe that i don't think they go crazy stupid big but i think
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:19.880]   they want to go bigger four seven is exactly right i mean that's the um moto x and that's
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:24.040]   anything bigger is a little big anything smaller is too small it just at least for my hand and i
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:29.160]   think for a lot of people that's the size and i know apple really still probably will continue to
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:34.840]   prioritize sync one hand use right yeah that'll move to software as well as hardware though you
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:38.200]   won't just be because the phone is physically thin it will be because there's a lot of things
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:43.560]   like the persistent back gesture and controls maybe moved around a little bit that kind of stuff
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:46.920]   blackberry did a lot of good stuff with that with blackberry 10 where you just make the gestures
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.240]   take over the navigation for the phone
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:53.080]   um
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:01.080]   oh what is it let's talk a little bit i this seems to be a minor thing but i guess a big thing if you
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:06.760]   are if you had an iPhone and you went to android people cannot seem to get text messages to you of
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:14.440]   course apple uses messages and apple keeps in the contact information a checkbox that says
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:19.640]   whether you support i message or not right or messages it's called now um apple's being there's
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:25.080]   a class action suit going because uh people say so i got an android phone and there was no way to
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.760]   stop the iPhone from trying to use messages to send it to me and i don't see anything
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:34.360]   have you have you experienced this i've i've gotten calls on the radio show from people
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:39.720]   with this uh you know it's a particular set of circumstances has to happen
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:46.520]   yeah what i mean when i i'm sorry go ahead rene no well i was going to say it's a very hard
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:49.960]   problem to solve because and you steeve gifts into the brilliant job explaining how i message
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:55.400]   works on security now it works by intercepting sms and apple can deliver a phenomenal experience
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:00.440]   because they bolted it to sms um and that's includes not you having to make your own certificates and
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:04.360]   all these crazy things that you would do in a trust nobody's solution but apple's doing a lot
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:08.280]   of heavy lifting there and there's no mechanism to tell somebody that you're leaving i message like
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:12.920]   apple's not doing a pop up to say are you still using i message are you sure so uh unless you turn
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:18.120]   it off when you leave um apple has no way to know you've stopped using it and also unfortunately
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:22.520]   it's a little bit buggy because that the propagation of you telling it that it that you've left is not
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:26.360]   always perfect and even when you call them up and say i've left and they say yes yes we've
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:31.960]   deregistered you that propagation is not perfect either yeah it seems like is a bug some say apple's
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:37.000]   doing it on purpose adam pash at life hackers said a lot of quote a lot of users have the problem
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.440]   um i've heard you know complaints from a variety of people some people say hey i'm you know i
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:47.560]   almost cost me my marriage because my wife thought i was ignoring her i guess it could be serious
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:53.800]   he i'm a bug should be fixed go ahead any uh to say any time a message is supposed to be sent but
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:58.600]   it's isn't sent or isn't received that is a big deal i don't i i think it's ridiculous the idea that
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:02.440]   apple is doing this on purpose uh partly because i don't think apple's that kind of company but
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:08.280]   mostly because i know exactly how poorly i message often works our message is because they're there
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:11.720]   are times when i'm logged in i'm logged into two or three different places and will come into two
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:16.840]   but not the third or i will have logged out and it will just and logged out and then log back in
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:22.840]   again and i will then go back to the uh to the old macbook that's on the nightstand in my bedroom
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:27.320]   and find out that i can see half of the conversations that have been happening but not all of them
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:32.520]   it's just that i i think there should be a little bit more transparency in how apple pry
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:38.040]   how message is prioritized prioritizes and sends along messages right now because
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:43.400]   these sort of things are just old hat with uh with i message and now messages one woman says her
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:48.840]   daughter's winter break from college was ruined after she received a free moto x from the jimmy
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:55.960]   fallin show do not accept free moto x's because i took lots of pictures and they were all crappy
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:03.400]   yeah really um and apple's advice is uh inconsistent at best they don't seem to really know how to fix
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:08.040]   this that's the problem well i mean a lot of people are quoting apple support technicians which
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:11.720]   like you know god bless them any customer service representative for any care or any
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:16.200]   manufacturer they don't always have up-to-date knowledge and they often read things on blogs and
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:20.040]   pass that on is you know stuff that they've heard it's you can't ever sort through that mess that
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:24.760]   mess is just intractable yeah but yeah you have to the apple has to fix that bug because to Andy's
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:29.080]   point that happens all the time but on top of that the way i message is set up is designed to
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:34.040]   benefit hundreds of millions of people who use it but it comes at the cost of not being easy to
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:38.600]   leave for the whatever percentage of people choose to leave is there if you're an iphone user now
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:42.680]   and you're thinking of getting an android phone is there a way to ensure that you'll continue
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:47.720]   to get text messages or no your best chance is to turn off i message on your phone and then go
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:51.320]   to the people you know who have iPhones and say look make sure that i'm not set up as an iphone
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:56.440]   contact on on your device because the iphone contacts is sort of a special contact right yes
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:00.920]   see that that's that's nothing that still just gets me very very confused because every time i keep
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:05.800]   getting new devices new apple devices to test out maybe for 30 40 days and then of course as soon as i
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:09.720]   turn on my other ones is like oh do you realize that this email address and this other device is now
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:13.560]   and added i message so even if you have two or three it's very hard to be come
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:18.600]   now i have three different email addresses that are associated with my iChat account i really
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:23.480]   want to be able to tell the i will i really want to tell the system that at no point should you ever
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:28.920]   use this email address or this phone number as a transport as a way of finding me so the advice
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:33.640]   that i give people is that if you switch to android just go to just make sure that you physically log
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:37.800]   out of the service on your previous phone and your previous mobile devices and then log back in
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:42.440]   again when you start using them again because that is the that's what i did just out of defense
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:46.040]   it worked fine for me i told that i've been giving that tip to other people and they said that
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:50.520]   that's they've been having success with it but there's just so many variables in solving this
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:55.960]   problem that you just don't know when you've killed that last cockroach some people said that apple
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:59.480]   should make i message for android as a solution to this because then you'll still be getting your
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:04.440]   i messages you know that that's theoretically that sounds good but it's cross-platform
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:08.360]   and services to things at which apple is not traditionally excelled and also doesn't fix it for
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:12.280]   windows phone users or people who switch to blackberry or or just switch away from a smartphone but
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:16.520]   to something else so it's again it's a tricky a lot of people complain about it but it's hard i've
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:20.920]   been thinking for a month on this and i haven't thought of any really clever way of fixing it and i'm
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:26.760]   my homies intelligent but it's it seems like a difficult problem to solve i've never i've never
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:32.920]   liked messages never ever well it works great i mean once the it only it's it's it's it's
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:39.080]   it's such a signature thing it's uh it works great so long as all of your friends are using
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:44.280]   iPhones but as soon as you put somebody into the mix that is not using an apple piece of software
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:49.480]   on an apple piece of hardware that's when you start lighting candles at your nearest catholic
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:54.200]   church because it might work it might not work it might work really really well it might just sort
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:58.280]   of half work and you might decide well it wouldn't cost me that much to simply
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:02.360]   maintain my contract on my phone and keep that one in my pocket as well just to make sure that i
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:06.520]   don't miss anything and this has been a problem for years i mean it's getting attention again now
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:09.880]   because of that blog post but it's something that a lot of people have oh yeah i've been getting
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:14.840]   calls on the radio show for a long time i've never had a solution for anybody i just shake my head
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:21.880]   go hoooh panic has decided when they update coda which i love coda to 2.5 they're not going to
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:27.720]   offer it in the app store they say the sandboxing is uh onerous and we just we're gonna have to
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:32.520]   start selling this direct instead of throwing selling it through the uh app store that's because
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:39.960]   coda is a special kind of app or what do you think uh rene it's sandboxing and sandboxing is
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:44.360]   something that apple introduced when they introduced the mac app store as a way it's a security feature
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:48.600]   and they have something called entitlements which lets you do things like punch through the sandbox
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:53.240]   access files that are outside the app itself and apples did a bunch of special entitlements
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:57.960]   because they knew there were a lot of legacy apps that do a lot of fancy things but the problem is
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:02.520]   there's not enough of them and there's no clear way to balance everyone's interests so coda is a
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:06.760]   development app i use it all the time for web development me too it's got to do yeah it's got
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:11.080]   to do a lot of really interesting things we spoke to rich seagull about this yesterday and he was
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:15.320]   talking about how something even like bebe edit on the he's never sold that in the app store has he
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:19.240]   it is no bebe edit is an app store but it can't do everything it's a different version that's right
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:22.840]   yeah it's got some things that it can't do because he's pulling your projects and he's scanning your
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:28.440]   disc and he's so coda sounded really classy about this they said they talked to apple for a long time
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:32.120]   they're not mad at apples the reality of the way things are but it looks like there's just
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:35.960]   going to be a class of applications which are you know admittedly they're fifty dollar plus
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:41.400]   developer centric or or or tech or um expert level apps that aren't going to fit an apple's vision
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:46.600]   for a secure map this is a specialized app and i it doesn't seem like that's especially to the
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:51.400]   people who use it or web developers this is two owners i think panic has done a really good job
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:57.720]   of transitioning when you download to five it'll it'll see your mac app store copy it'll unlock it
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:02.440]   and uh you'll now be uh you know kind of transition to the new way of doing things
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:09.720]   they can't use uh iCloud anymore so they've created panic sync uh for free uh so uh if you know
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:14.360]   it'll automatically sync all your uh you know your setup to your other cotas so it sounds like
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:21.720]   they've so they've come up with a solution that works um so good on panic because i think i really
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:28.520]   like them and this is not a sign of things to come because it's just a specialized app yeah although
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:32.040]   that sandboxing is an incredible pain and it would it would be great if apple could figure out a way
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:37.720]   of letting developers do more but still maintaining the security i mean i like the the whole notion
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:43.640]   of uh it's like it it's not called intense what did you you said it was um yeah sorry uh entitlement
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:47.400]   settlements i love that notion where you say you have to say ahead of time look i'm gonna need
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:53.160]   this this and this or an explicit user action has to trigger this functionality right yeah also apple
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:57.480]   has worked very closely with a lot of developers when developers have say that we have a problem in
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:02.280]   in sandboxing apple will work very closely with a lot of developers to get a solution to that problem
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:09.160]   right it's not really uh it's not really a landslide of disapproval from developers although there are
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:14.760]   a number it's it's it's it is interesting when you see a developer like omni decide that okay we
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:18.040]   are not going to use iCloud for syncing we are going to create our own syncing service because
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:23.080]   we're having such a hard problem working with whatever standard that apple is giving us so if apple
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:27.160]   pays attention to this sort of stuff it won't turn into that problem two or three years from now because
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:32.200]   one one app store that has everything and controls our updates is such a big big win for the user
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:38.440]   users and most developers that i know they they don't like so much of sandboxing they don't like so
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:42.840]   much of dealing with the app store but at the end of the day you put it in this place where people
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:48.760]   can find this app really really easily updates happen so easily that their support calls are not
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:55.480]   are not as frequently a problem of someone is trying to use a 2007 app with uh with uh with mavericks
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:22:01.240]   uh so something to take a look at though we're going to prepare your picks gentlemen we're going to go
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:07.480]   to our picks so that we can just a second first a word from shutter stock 35 million plus stock

[01:22:54.840 --> 01:23:00.440]   could save on that subscription check out their search engine too it's incredible you could search
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:06.840]   for nouns but you can also search for nouns plus adjectives so you could search for a bear

[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:36.840]   image to be angry there there's some angry bears i love those and then uh one of the things you can
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:43.160]   do is you can narrow it down by color uh by the kind of image whether it's vector drawing or
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:50.680]   there's a really angry bear photograph of an angry bear you'll see it comes in all sizes including

[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:07.400]   is is going to be that pq 321q monitor from a sus i couldn't be happier with it now that to 10
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:14.040]   9 3 is out it if you're looking for a 4k monitor and you have a macbook pro retina late model you know
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:23.640]   like 2013 edition or the new mac pro oh it looks good looks really nice um i've been very happy
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:30.280]   uh ladies and gentlemen rene richie has a pick too what is your pick of the week not to caveat
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:33.640]   this by saying it's one of those rare times where i haven't actually had a chance to try it yet but
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:39.080]   it is a game called uh thomas was alone which i've been hearing nothing but raves for i downloaded
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:43.320]   it fully intending to start playing it today but the day got away from me but all the people
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:48.440]   whose opinions i trust on twitter just were raving about this so i really want to want to try it and
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:53.800]   i figured i would share it before you know eight other eight hundred other apps came out so it's
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:26:00.440]   it's an indie app just became available on ios i think last thursday or friday um a lot of people i
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:05.000]   know the entire weekends went away into playing this but it's one of those things where it's just
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.840]   whimsical it's just humorous it's a platformer but it's abstract right i mean it looks yes
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:15.640]   huh so if you're a mario if you grew up playing mario this this reminds me of monument valley there's
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:22.920]   a really a whole growing a group of games that are uh kind of beautiful music abstract art puzzle
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:27.240]   solving games yeah and i had a chance to talk to the monument valley guys and i think it's very
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:30.840]   much like this is they just want to make great games they're not subject to the race to the bottom
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:33.960]   they don't they're not going to give it away for free they're not going to you know do a lot of tricks
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:38.040]   or or do in app purchases they want to make great games the same way a great storyteller wants to
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:43.160]   tell great stories and the ipad and ios and you know android all these other things mobile is
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:47.720]   giving them the ability to do that in it's not inexpensive but it's way more reasonable than old
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:54.200]   style you know consoles could ever do this is uh both ios and apps uh mac app you can get it on steam
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:27:00.840]   you can get it uh direct mac pc ipad seems like playstation as well so you can get it in a lot of
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:07.400]   different ways um what is disura it sounds like a steam a new kind of steam
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:13.720]   what's possible you're not familiar with it looks uh huh but again if you're looking for you know
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:16.600]   something fun to do over the weekend a great distraction something to spend a couple hours and
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:20.920]   just really enjoy this is what i'm going to be doing in the next few hours sounds good i'm going to
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:25.560]   try it you've i've been playing black was it who told me about black was it you handy i think so
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:34.840]   last week yes thanks for wasting a whole week i'm now i'm now stuck here at level 29 and i just
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:41.640]   can't solve it it's such a fun game highly recommend blek ipad or iphone what do you got for us Annie
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:47.960]   well i've got this incredibly super sophisticated and sexy no-name import
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:54.840]   import blu ray reader drive complete with like you know random imports
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:28:00.840]   inspection sticker uh the this is my this is my pick of the week because uh Dave Hamilton over
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:07.080]   at mac observer wrote a really cool piece three four days ago explaining a trick if you like to rip
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:11.800]   blu ray discs into a more useful format than something that is either locked up with drm or
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:17.400]   locked up on a disc uh you've always had this thing there's a bay there's a five-year beta
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:22.920]   a little app called make mkv that could take your blu ray and divert it into a humongous file that
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:28.440]   then handbrake the free video converter app and ripping app could then deal with and transmogrify
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:34.280]   into a into a video file but it's always an extra step he basically came up a found a trick on a
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:39.480]   mess uh on a support forum just add a couple of different a couple of lines in terminal so that
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:46.520]   handbrake and the o s could see the library that make mkv uses to take the copy protection off of
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:52.520]   the blu ray so now it works exactly as quickly and excuse me exactly a streamlined uh as a process
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:57.640]   as when you try to get handbrake to rip a dvd we just toss in the disc it finds it it
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:02.520]   catalogs the information and then you simply click a button and it rips it um because but he
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:08.360]   also did it did me a solid by recommending this little drive and a little aside which is a 41
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:17.080]   dollar yes cheap no name drive you can get on amazon but it is a combo dvd reader burner reader
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:23.400]   and also a blu ray disc reader only uh i've uh been sort of had my eye out on a mac compatible
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:28.120]   blu ray external drive for a while but i've always shied away because really the only reason why i
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:32.920]   wanted is so that i can rip blu rays without having to go to my windows machine uh but i didn't want
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:37.880]   to spend 150 dollars on something and not know for sure if it would work with make mkv or will
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:42.920]   actually work with my mac so by simply pointing out that hey i use this and it works just fine and
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:47.880]   also it's a 41 dollar drive somehow you're going to be using a few times a month when you you know
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:51.640]   when you buy that that blu ray that you're really really liking you want to throw it on your ipad
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:58.040]   that's that's almost as cheap as free and let me make no bones about this this is your basic cheap
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:03.320]   ass you know import no name drive but it works it works fine enough it doesn't doesn't copy
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:09.400]   protection doesn't away with all of this stuff i mean doesn't uh hdcp this is that's hdcp compliant
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:15.880]   that blu ray disc uh there is copy protection on it that make mkv is able to get around wow
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:21.640]   uh and so and make mkv is free for it's still in beta but it's been in beta for like since like
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:27.400]   2010 or something uh and uh when it comes out of beta it will cost money about while it's in beta
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:31.720]   it's free but it works perfectly fine uh i've been using it for about a year and a half two years
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:36.600]   uh and it works just great and it's rare that i come across a blu ray that i can't handle
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:43.240]   and because i have i have an ethical problem with uh torrenting uh a movie of i don't i have no
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:48.120]   ethical problem with buying a movie legitimately and then deciding that i want to turn this to a
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:52.760]   file that's more useful to me by making it unlocked making sure that i can put it on my home media
[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:56.840]   server without having to have iTunes running all that you're transcoding it but it still looks
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:31:02.600]   as good pretty good just about as good as as the original the problem is that you do have a couple
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:09.880]   of problems in that uh it's if the the movie that i ripped yesterday is typical and that's a 1080p
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:15.640]   full HD movie so if you were to rip it without making any customized settings uh it would wind up
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:22.040]   being about a seven gigabyte file that not all of your max will where devices will be able to play
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:26.520]   without stuttering so what you can do instead is that you go into handbrake and you adjust certain
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:30.840]   settings you say please don't make this large file size please make sure that the bitrate is low
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:35.560]   low enough that uh even a mobile processor can handle it or maybe even knock off a couple of
[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:41.240]   different copies of it after you after you have a handbrake make the canonical master seven gigabyte
[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:45.720]   version right then maybe if you want if you if you really want to put this on your on your phone
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:50.440]   as well as have it streamed through your really super cool brand new tubular mac pro maybe you want
[01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:56.680]   to burn off another copy that is still 1080 HD but is lower bitrate so that you would notice the
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:32:00.760]   pro you would notice a problem on your 60 inch tv but on a small phone screen you wouldn't notice
[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:04.680]   that the compression is higher or that uh there were that some of the details have been lost
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:08.200]   do you guys ever use uh something called think remember think
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:15.560]   i don't know if this is a good pick it's for it's for a very small slice of you who want to
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:20.440]   install Unix utilities on your Macintosh think was yeah yeah package manager remember it would
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:24.440]   allow you to install and it's kind of been deprecated there was a replacement the new one that everybody
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:29.640]   uses is homebrew and i i discovered it the other day and i was surprised it's not more talked about
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:36.120]   if you want a Unix utility like let's say w get installed on your Macintosh in a very slick easy
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:44.520]   way to do it uh homebrew is very simple it's ruby uh but installing it is really literally just
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:50.920]   pasting a command line uh into your terminal it'll run through a script uh and then once it's
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:58.840]   installed uh you can do things like uh brew install w get and it will automatically
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:03.720]   download it compile it you have to have the uh xcode command line tools installed do it all for
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:07.640]   you now you have w get uh and the other thing that i really like i don't know if you can see this
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:14.120]   but when it's completes brew will put a little beer mug uh next icon you could turn that off but
[01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:21.160]   it's i like it there's a lot of uh a lot of beer analogies in the brooding open source and free
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:25.880]   and if you do use Unix utilities and uh you don't want to build them yourself it's very easy to
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:34.120]   create uh brews that others can install and uh there's a very long list of already and this is
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:43.320]   fairly new of um homebrews out there it's brew dot uh sh and um it's it's it's you know it's a good
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:48.840]   thing to know about well only for those of you who want to use command line utilities uh it's
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:55.560]   all through github and there's just hundreds now of brew formulas they call them uh available
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:34:01.720]   so i just thought i mentioned that brew dot sh hey thank you everybody it's great to talk to
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:08.600]   you rene richie i'more.com thanks Leo thanks for being here and for inspiring me to spend thousands
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:15.160]   of dollars on a three screen setup your eyeballs will thank me Leo i have yet to find and i really
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:20.600]   want to find a game that will just use all three try like an yeah yeah it's gotta be a flight sim
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:24.200]   and i don't want to that's boring what's the word we do is you put a different game on each
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:31.400]   screen Leo because yeah a driving game probably you'll do it uh ryan shrub said sieve five would do
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:37.480]   it and it doesn't so uh i gotta find a game that will just let me immerse myself to use those
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:43.720]   multiple graphics card Leo put a different game on every screen well as it is now i have my terminal
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:49.560]   my chat and my game so i'm happy happy you do that if you do that i'm going to ask you to have like
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:56.920]   an actual crt tube tv tv set not a monitor running in a an a television or notary 2600 as part of
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:05.160]   that screen setup deal deal hey thanks any an anako chicago sun times great to have you don't
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:10.920]   forget an aco zalmanek and he's reading his old columns too over there at five by five dot tv
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:17.560]   we will do coverage of ww dc it's coming up june second will be that's a monday unfortunately
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:25.000]   uh so we'll be doing it live uh i guess what nine a.m is that one the keynote is and uh and then
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.720]   a special mac break weekly on a monday the monday uh right after the live coverage so we're going to
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:35.640]   flip flop our monday and tuesday programming that's a june second and i i'm starting to think
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:40.760]   they might be some uh some significant announcements at ww dc i'm just feeling it's it's kind of we
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:46.040]   might have a lot more to talk about next week because if that usually one week before an announcement
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:52.680]   is usually when they can't keep a lid on on on a big secret yeah because it's at some at that point
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:56.440]   too many people have seen it too many people have been through a run through too many people know
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:01.240]   about it so at this point if if we haven't heard anything major about certain products by next
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:05.160]   tuesday i would start to doubt that we're going to see anything about a certain major product
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:16.040]   on ww dc all right thanks everybody koi about that yes koi i love koi that's my favorite fish
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:21.480]   uh we do mac break weekly every tuesday levin a m pacific except for in two weeks we'll do a
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:27.080]   different time but normally 11 a m pacific that's a two p.m. eastern time 1800 utc we love it if
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:32.360]   you watch live the chat rooms are valued asset uh but if you can't we make on demand audio and video
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:40.520]   as with all our shows available after the fact on our website twit.tv/mbw mac break weekly or wherever
