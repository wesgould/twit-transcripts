[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.800]   >> Welcome to MacBrige Weekly Episode 23.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.800]   We're live from the 21st Amendment,
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.800]   RuPub in beautiful San Francisco, California.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.800]   It's a steamy, hot phone booth full of Mac addicts.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.800]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.800]   >> I think somebody cross-pollinated this show with
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.800]   dignity because we're all drinking beer.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.800]   And the irony is Kevin is going to do dignity
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.800]   tomorrow at the Mac world show floor and he won't be able
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.800]   to drink beer.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.800]   >> He's actually got a plan.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.800]   >> What's he going to do?
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.800]   >> He's crowd sourcing.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.800]   He's going to have lots of people bring in separate
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.800]   beers for him.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.800]   >> Somebody was suggesting you get one of those bras
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.800]   that has a beer reservoir in it.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.800]   >> The beers here?
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.800]   >> The beers here.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.800]   Ladies and gentlemen, that's Merlin Mann of 43folders.com.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.800]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.800]   And the funniest productivity guru you've ever met.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.800]   Of course, the competition is Dave Allen, so.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.800]   >> You're correct, sir.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.800]   >> That tells you something right there.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.800]   To his left is a man we've just recently revived with
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.800]   smelling salty, could pass out again at any moment.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.800]   Ladies and gentlemen, the iPhone lover Scott Borne.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.800]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.800]   >> He's going to take a victory lap around the 21st Amendment.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.800]   >> The first amendment is I would just like to say a couple
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.800]   of things about the iPhone.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.800]   First of all, I think we should have an entire podcast from
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.800]   here on out every week devoted to nothing but the iPhone.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.800]   >> I thought that's what Mac Break Weekly was.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.800]   >> I sent you up.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   >> It's all the last three months.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.800]   >> So, come on.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.800]   Is everybody pretty excited?
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.800]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   >> We'll get to that in a moment.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.800]   Alex Lindsey is also here.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.800]   Hello, Alex.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.800]   >> Hello.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.800]   >> We've got a busy day today.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.800]   He always does that.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.800]   >> He always does that.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   >> What is that voice?
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.800]   >> I don't have anything better to say when you say hello.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   >> Have you noticed that by the way that there's a certain
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   spatiality?
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   I don't mean it's spatial, but we are kind of coming at you from
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.800]   different angles of your head.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.800]   That would be some sort of new technology.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.800]   >> Ladies and gentlemen, this is the first Mac Break Weekly,
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   the first Twit podcast of any kind done in Dolby headphone.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   >> It's spacious.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   >> We thank Dolby Labs for putting this together.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   John Kellogg is sitting there and also thanks to our friends at
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.800]   Mo too, the market unicorn helped us with equipment.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   And if you're listening on headphones, we're all over.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.800]   Yeah, it's kind of cool.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.800]   >> Yeah, no, it's really cool.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   And so hopefully we'll be able to show people a little bit more
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.800]   about how this works on Mac Break.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   >> We want to head over it now.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.800]   This is the guest area all the way to the right.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   The left is you're listening.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.800]   >> I can see this is going to work.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   >> It's really going to be a problem.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   >> If you start rolling the Wizard of Oz right now, it actually
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   matches out.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.800]   >> It's amazing.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.800]   >> It's amazing that we're saying.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   >> We're out of the woods.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.800]   We're out of the deck.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.800]   We're out of the night.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.800]   >> Would you like to introduce the newest contributors to Mac Break
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.800]   because you found these young women?
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   >> Yes.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   So we went hunting for -- that didn't come up too well.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.800]   We decided we really needed to find -- it was a little too much
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.800]   of guys -- >> It's a bunch of white men.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.800]   >> A bunch of white men.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.800]   We needed to find some more estrogen in the friends.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.800]   >> And ever since Amber left us, we've really kind of been with that.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.800]   >> It's really hard.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.800]   We thought that when Amber was really, really busy, we were in
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.800]   this, well, we'll find somebody else.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   It won't be that hard.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   And finding someone who understands Macs, understands
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.800]   technology is smart, able to do all that stuff is much more
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.800]   difficult than we thought when we started the --
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.800]   >> You had to go to Pittsburgh.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.800]   >> I went to Pittsburgh.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.800]   I went -- so we have Kendra -- and now Kendra we found here.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   And now, Justine, I'm going to hopefully not screw up your last
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.800]   name here.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.800]   Esarick.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.800]   >> Esarick.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.800]   >> Esarick.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.800]   I say it wrong every time.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   >> Esarick.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.800]   >> And Justine, I found at the Pod Camp Pittsburgh in -- earlier
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.800]   this year.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.800]   >> So our two newest contributors to Mac Break, you'll probably -- no,
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.800]   you will see them.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   You will see them this week.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.800]   You may have seen them already depending -- >> Kendra's already got a
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   dorky intro just like me at the beginning of the Mac.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.800]   >> Yeah, I left maniacally right alongside Marlin.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.800]   >> Is that your thing?
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.800]   Is that going to be your thing?
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.800]   >> Hey.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.800]   >> The maniacal laugh.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.800]   >> Maybe.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.800]   It depends on how often I'm around Marlin.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   >> Oh, you're lucky I'm over here down.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.800]   >> And thanks to Dolby Headphone, we know exactly where you are.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   >> That's tricky.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.800]   >> You're just below my left knee.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.800]   >> Look at that.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.800]   >> That was pretty nice.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.800]   >> That was -- >> So Kendra, what's your background?
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.800]   >> My background is I graduated from Stanford University.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   >> Oh boy.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.800]   I'm feeling inadequate already.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   >> Yes, yes, yes.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   And then I've been here in San Francisco working full-time as an
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.800]   actor and hosting various things.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.800]   >> And we actually had her on Mac break weekly -- or Mac break
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.800]   once talking about those head -- >> Yes, the I theater.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.800]   >> I theater.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.800]   >> It's not how yet.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.800]   >> This is the last one of the bunch.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.800]   >> Okay.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.800]   >> We take it a while ago.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.800]   >> We've done plenty of green screen work with Pixel Chorus.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.800]   >> Yeah, have you?
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.800]   >> That's cool.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.800]   >> And you're going to cover gadgets for us.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.800]   >> I'm sure I'm going to check out gadgets for the expo I focused on
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.800]   iPod gadgets and accessories and whatnot.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.800]   >> We'll look for that.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.800]   It'll be on twitter.tv soon any day now.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.800]   >> Like in the next day.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.800]   >> Like in the next day.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.800]   >> Yeah, next day.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.800]   Probably tomorrow or the day after.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.800]   We've already cranked out a bunch of stuff.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.800]   >> I already cranked out about six to death stuff.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.800]   >> It's amazing.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   >> Yeah, we did the -- >> It's going to be a crazy week.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.800]   >> Wow.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   >> And by the way, if you're not subscribed to Mac break, you want to
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.800]   check out the Mac break page.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.800]   We're putting them all up one at a time as fast as we get them done.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.800]   >> You get to see that intro with Kendra and me a lot, which we're very
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.800]   not going to laugh at.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   >> Is that going to be on all of the Mac breaks now?
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.800]   >> You know, the thing is, you know, Emory already got the good one.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.800]   Does Emory already do the Isaac?
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.800]   >> He's got the super.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.800]   >> He's got the pointing.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.800]   See, that's the one I want him to take.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.800]   >> Oh, you're talking about that open where we can float people through
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.800]   the head.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.800]   And I'm just doing some simpy little -- >> You look confident.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.800]   >> Have we tried Justine?
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.800]   Has she done anything yet?
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.800]   >> We haven't gotten Justine.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   >> Justine, you're going to want to work on your trademark, you know.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.800]   >> Well, you're not going to get a second chance.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.800]   And they're going to put it in and then they're going to make fun of you.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.800]   And then you're going to put in something even less.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   >> I suggest going all cross-side.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   >> I hear I just have to laugh a lot.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.800]   >> Yeah, maniacally.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.800]   >> So, Justin, you're from Pittsburgh and your background is a graphics
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   design?
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   >> Graphic design, video, web, animation, pretty much everything.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.800]   >> Great.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   Well, welcome to the team.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   >> Thank you.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.800]   I'm really excited.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.800]   >> Getting bigger by the moment.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   I don't know if Dolby has enough headset presets to put everybody around the table.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.800]   Justin, you haven't taped anything at Macworld yet.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.800]   You're going to do that tomorrow?
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.800]   >> Yeah, I'm doing that tomorrow.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.800]   >> And so we don't know what you're going to cover yet.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   >> Oh, it's a secret.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.800]   >> You'll walk onto the floor and go that.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.800]   >> Exactly.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.800]   >> I told her she should look for a good Macword processor because that'll
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.800]   keep her a little while.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.800]   >> That's gross.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.800]   >> Hard to find, sir.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.800]   That's what we do with the new ones.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.800]   We haze them.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.800]   >> No, that'll be fun.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.800]   So, it's great to have you both.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.800]   >> Thank you.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.800]   >> Welcome.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.800]   Are you excited?
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.800]   You're going to run out and buy an iPhone?
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.800]   >> Yeah, we're already planning to begin buying.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   >> Yes.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   >> Trio, what?
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   >> Goodbye, Trio.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   Because you got your Trio there, I see.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.800]   >> Now, wait a minute.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.800]   I'd like to comment on how I tell the Trio.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.800]   >> Justin has a Trio too, young lady.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.800]   >> Shut up.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.800]   >> I just want to say I'm the only one with singular in the office this
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.800]   morning when it was announced.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.800]   >> I get singular too.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.800]   >> I win.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.800]   >> Leo, I win.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.800]   >> I win.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   >> I win.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   >> I win.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.800]   >> I win.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   >> Leo, Leo has singular.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.800]   What other covers do you have?
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.800]   >> I got T-Mobile and Verizon.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.800]   >> Oh, no.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.800]   >> I got singular.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   I'm ready.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.800]   I bought all of them just in case.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.800]   So they make sure they have.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.800]   >> So you have a Trio, Justin, and you don't hide your razor, Kendra.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.800]   >> I've got the classic razor.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   >> Don't hide that.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   That's a nice phone.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.800]   That was a nice phone.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.800]   >> It was a backup because I dropped my first phone in the toilet,
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.800]   which was a blackberry.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.800]   >> That's not good.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.800]   >> That's not good.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:15.800]   >> Well, that's pretty much where all cell phones are the iPhone
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.800]   below.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.800]   >> Oh.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.800]   >> You can tell they're just ditching.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.800]   We've been waiting for Scott.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.800]   Do you want us to do?
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   What do you want us to do?
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.800]   You want us to lie down and roll around?
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.800]   What do you want us to do?
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.800]   >> I would think --
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.800]   >> Didn't Merlin say he'd eat something or --
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.800]   >> Yeah, I made some kind of a dare.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   I was like, "Hey, born there's no way they're going to put this
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   thing out, and you're so full of it."
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.800]   I think I promised to sing you some kind of an impromptu song.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.800]   >> All right.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.800]   >> When I get my iPhone, you get your damn song.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.800]   >> Okay.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.800]   Well, if it's something you're doing for me, can I ask that you
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   not sit down?
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   >> Yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.800]   >> Okay.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.800]   So we have a member of our audience who has a calculator.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.800]   We've asked him exactly how many hours until the iPhone comes
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.800]   out.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.800]   How many hours, sir?
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.800]   Justine --
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.800]   He's calculating right now.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.800]   >> 3,384 hours.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   >> Start the timer.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   >> Thank you.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   Now, come on.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.800]   >> Kendra said she wants a Myspace widget with the
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   count.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.800]   >> Yes, if someone could please come up with that immediately and
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.800]   then message me, that would be great.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.800]   >> Now, let's -- really, come on.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.800]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.800]   You know, it exceeded all of our expectations, if we're going to
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   be honest.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   >> I'm going to assume that all of the people listening have either
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.800]   gone to the Apple website or watched our Mac break.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.800]   So we won't go in a lot of detail about what was announced.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.800]   The kind of the bottom line Apple is going to do a phone.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.800]   It's called the iPhone, which is a little odd since we thought
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.800]   Cisco had that trademark.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.800]   They did, but they must have made a deal.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.800]   >> That's what I heard Jason Snell from Macworld magazine said
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   that he heard they were negotiations.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   Apple has worldwide trademark.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.800]   Cisco has US trademark only.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   So there was some negotiation going on.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.800]   >> Well, of course, you know, Apple just turned on a thousand
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.800]   lawyers and made it go away.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.800]   >> That's another possibility.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.800]   >> I really don't care what it's called.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.800]   I just like the fact that it's possibly the slickest than
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.800]   snot thing I've ever seen.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.800]   >> Should we talk about our predictions?
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.800]   Because it's a singular GSM.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.800]   We kind of missed on that one, maybe.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.800]   >> Well, we did talk weeks ago about the singular deal because
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.800]   we had some intel on that.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.800]   >> And we thought it made sense to do a GSM.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.800]   On the other hand, we thought it was a disadvantage because the
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.800]   edge 3G network is so much slower than Verizon's Efto.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.800]   >> Yeah, that's a problem.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.800]   And hopefully they'll get that sped up.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.800]   But the fact that we can do all those other cool things like we
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.800]   can send photos, we can make them bigger or smaller, and we can
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.800]   touch things without having clunky buttons.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   >> That touch screen user interface.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.800]   >> Beautiful.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.800]   >> It's gorgeous.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.800]   Beautiful.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.800]   >> You're a productivity gimer.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.800]   Do you think that that makes a difference in how it will work?
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.800]   >> Well, you know, the thing with all the Mac stuff, you know,
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.800]   you can make all the predictions and prognostications and you
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.800]   can watch from afar.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.800]   But the proof is in the pudding.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   When you got it in your hand and you use it, and so much of
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.800]   the time, it can be really surprising to see how well,
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.800]   how finished these products can be.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.800]   So I'm going to be very anxious to actually hold one in my hand.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   >> Somebody we know has.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.800]   In fact, a little later on, hoping he'll come by David Pogue of
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.800]   New York Times said he would stop by.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.800]   He has in fact played with the iPhone for about half an hour.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.800]   He said Phil Schiller, the president of Apple, said,
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.800]   "Gee, nobody asked."
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.800]   So, of course you can.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   I guess we should be asking.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.800]   >> We had a big set up with that.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.800]   >> I'm kind of disappointed that they didn't ask me.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   >> I've got to get a little more pushy.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.800]   That's what I --
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   >> But anyway, but he had some -- I won't tip his hand, but he
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.800]   had some thoughts about it and there weren't all positive.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.800]   >> Well, I'll tell you one thought I have, and I have to point
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.800]   this out, even at the keynote, and you were there, Scott, there
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.800]   were fingerprints already on that phone in Steve's demo.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.800]   >> They were mine.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.800]   >> You wish, in your dreams.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.800]   But that's going to be an issue.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.800]   And I wear a lot of makeup, and when you get the makeup on the
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.800]   phone, it's not great.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.800]   >> Dust in the screen.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.800]   >> Dust in the screen, it's bad face powder.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.800]   >> You know, we don't even have the thing.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.800]   And here they are.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.800]   >> Oh, boy.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.800]   >> They're already apologizing.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.800]   >> Whoa, the I-ter.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.800]   >> I just want to point out.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.800]   >> Step by step.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:01.800]   >> While you're an insane iPhone fan boy, we may have -- we
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   haven't seen it yet.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.800]   >> You know, the thing is, I put poo with this idea because I
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   just didn't even -- I didn't see what the point was because
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   Scott just wanted something called an iPhone.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.800]   I could have given him a big piece of styrofoam that had an
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.800]   Apple and myriad gold on it.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:21.800]   But the thing that blew me out of the water, I sat in the room.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.800]   You guys were in the room.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   We were almost in tears.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   >> We were crying.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.800]   >> When they got to the point where they were talking about
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.800]   running OS 10 on your phone, we're talking about something
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.800]   completely different here.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.800]   >> I think that's really the point.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   It's a computer.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.800]   >> It's an computer with telephony.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.800]   >> And this changes the game completely.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.800]   >> Everybody in my eye, we were sitting in the seventh row,
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.800]   everybody simultaneously said, "Boo-yah."
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.800]   >> Really?
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.800]   >> It was just a styrofoam.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.800]   >> It was a kind of --
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.800]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.800]   >> A client, Boo-yah.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.800]   >> I think it's still sinking in.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.800]   I think the folks that I've been talking to are still going -- I'm
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.800]   still working out the ramifications of running co-op
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.800]   applications on my phone.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.800]   >> Well, we don't know yet.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.800]   And this is something that he didn't say, "Can third party
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.800]   developers write co-op applications for the phone?"
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   They call it OS 10, but it doesn't mean you can develop for it
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.800]   as you would OS 10.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.800]   >> Well, you know, one thing to think about that I haven't
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.800]   heard many people talk about, I think Craig might have mentioned
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.800]   it, but there's a 30-pin dock connector down there.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.800]   >> Can you imagine all the add-ons, GPS's, you know, all kinds
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   of cool stuff that you can put in.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.800]   >> I thought -- >> Go ahead.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.800]   >> Go ahead.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.800]   >> And I was a little disappointed there wasn't a GPS in
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.800]   it all.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.800]   >> We don't know.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.800]   You didn't say there wasn't.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.800]   >> There were some sort of a directional backup.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   >> I got the impression from the slide that there maybe was a
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.800]   GPS and he didn't mention it.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.800]   >> But that would be extra, perhaps.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.800]   >> I think -- remember that one of the requirements of all
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.800]   cell phones now is this E911.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.800]   They have to be location capable.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.800]   And you'd either do that with GPS or you do a triangulation
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.800]   of the cell towers, and many new phones have GPS.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.800]   It's not that expensive.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.800]   Of course, it's an awfully thin phone.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.800]   >> When you've got GPS on your phone also, some of the
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.800]   spread phones that are coming out now have this built-in thing
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.800]   they call, I want to say, "spring fusion" or something.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.800]   But the thing where you can go, like, show me where I am
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.800]   when I'm at right now.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.800]   You feel like maybe you had a lot of forebrain damage as a child?
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.800]   The ability to with one button, show me where I am in San
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.800]   Francisco is really powerful.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.800]   >> I thought that was the result of your parents denying
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.800]   puberty.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   >> I'm sorry, I said it again?
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   >> I just thought he was in the under fall.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.800]   >> You know, I said that off Mike Scott, I thought that was
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.800]   between friends.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.800]   Okay, so my parents couldn't afford puberty.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.800]   It's hilarious.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.800]   I moved right to Adeles, it's really funny stuff.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.800]   >> Ha ha.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.800]   Don't make fun of a man when he's down.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.800]   >> All right, so let's, I tell you what, let's bring in
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.800]   Chris Breena, as long as we're going to talk about the iPhone,
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.800]   one of the elements is it is the only new iPod, so this, you know,
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.800]   Macworld.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.800]   So Chris Breena is, of course, the author of The Secrets of the
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.800]   iPod and knows more about the iPod than any living human being.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.800]   Chris, welcome from Macworld Magazine.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.800]   >> Thanks very much.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.800]   >> Thank you.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.800]   >> Here's one question I have for you.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.800]   Can you hear me here, can you hear me here?
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.800]   >> Yes, I can.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.800]   >> Here's, I'm in Dolby's headphone.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.800]   >> Yes, this is fabulous.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.800]   >> Watch this, actually John, watch this.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.800]   I'm going to actually streak by you at the speed of light
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.800]   Chris Breena, this is amazing.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.800]   Here I am over here, and now here I am over here.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.800]   >> Wow, look at this.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.800]   I'm behind you.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   I'm in front of you.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.800]   I'm over around.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.800]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.800]   >> It is shocking.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.800]   >> I think half of it is just vomiting.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.800]   >> Ha ha ha ha ha.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   >> Thank you John Kellogg.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.800]   Dolby Labs, they're amazing ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.800]   All right, so Chris, one of the things I thought is why don't I
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.800]   have an iPod with these features?
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.800]   I mean that touch screen, that user interface.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.800]   >> Yeah, I think maybe this is just the beginning.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.800]   This is a new product for them, it's a new form factor for them,
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.800]   and so the phone comes out first, and once that's all done,
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.800]   they've done all the FCC stuff.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.800]   Okay, next product, no phone, just the iPod.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.800]   >> I kick myself a little bit in our prognostication because we
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.800]   should have realized that no matter what, no matter what
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.800]   happened, they couldn't announce it and ship it the same day
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.800]   because the minute they announce it, then they enter the FCC.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.800]   >> You know we will miss the ball there.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.800]   >> Well, no everybody did.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   >> Yeah, and that's what Steve said.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.800]   He said, well, and just as you did with the ITV, which is now
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.800]   the Apple TV, he said, we have to pre-announce it because
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.800]   otherwise when we file for FCC, they're going to announce it
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.800]   for us.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.800]   >> The place we were hearing from Apple people was we want to be
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.800]   the ones to announce this, not the FCC.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.800]   >> Right, exactly.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.800]   >> So that makes sense.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.800]   So there was no way it was going to be sooner than June.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.800]   >> No, no, and although it took an awfully long time, you know,
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.800]   not only to name the price of the phone, but then to finally say
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.800]   when it's coming out.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.800]   >> Right.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.800]   >> So everybody's, yeah, yeah, I'm going to buy it today.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.800]   I want to write down, and it's June.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.800]   >> Oh, and I, and I, and I'm a poor Scott.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.800]   >> Well, he stepped on his Verizon phone.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.800]   Did you see that?
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.800]   >> I did.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.800]   He smashed his phone thinking he was going to get it that day and
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.800]   then he passed out.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.800]   >> I've been working on a deal to get myself cryogenically
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.800]   stored until June, so I can just wake up tomorrow.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.800]   >> How many hours?
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.800]   3,400?
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.800]   >> You can update me.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.800]   >> Can we get an update on how long it's to the phone now?
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.800]   >> No, we saw that episode of "South Bar 2."
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.800]   >> I know how that works.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.800]   It doesn't come out good.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.800]   >> But you might get to hang out with Ted Williams, William,
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.800]   for us.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.800]   >> Yeah, there you go.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.800]   Since, since we can no longer talk about predictions on the iPhone,
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   let's make a prediction on an iPod with this user interface.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.800]   How long before you think Apple could do that?
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.800]   >> I would say --
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.800]   >> I want one.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.800]   >> Yeah, I would say at least by June.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.800]   >> Because sooner?
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.800]   >> Maybe sooner.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.800]   >> What if they did it --
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.800]   >> I'm thinking Valentine's Day?
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.800]   >> Well, you know, I think that Apple has got six or seven
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.800]   planes circling in the air of announcements that they need to
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.800]   make because they didn't make them here.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.800]   >> The first thing Steve Jobs says when he gets up is he does
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.800]   little news and he says, "By the way, I'm not going to tell you
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.800]   about any new Macs today."
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.800]   >> Right.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.800]   >> Right.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.800]   >> Or I work or I life or this, that and the other.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.800]   >> And we know they're all coming.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.800]   >> The funny part about that, though, is I mean, so we were
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.800]   all sitting there in the nerd lounge reloading all the
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.800]   rumors pages during this.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.800]   But I think it's kind of interesting that he says that on
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.800]   the same day that they're not Apple computer anymore.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.800]   >> And so to me, this is a company that's saying, you know what,
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.800]   we really are a lifestyle hub.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.800]   >> Right.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:55.800]   >> And we're going to help you take all of this stuff.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.800]   We're going to help you take your movies.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.800]   We're going to help you take your telephony connectivity.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.800]   And we're going to wrap it all together for you.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.800]   >> The irony is this might be the most exciting new computer
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.800]   that I've seen in years.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.800]   It's a computer.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:07.800]   >> That's right.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.800]   >> And I think that what Apple gave us was really something that
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.800]   we all said we wanted.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.800]   I mean, all of us have said we want something that I don't want
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.800]   to carry my phone in my iPod.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.800]   >> This is good.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.800]   >> And my head, and it on.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.800]   >> Just the sinking alone.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:18.800]   >> Just the sinking alone.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.800]   But when you get outside of that, all the other things you want
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.800]   to do, I don't want to carry a bunch of devices.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.800]   I don't have one device that does it.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.800]   >> But four gigs, eight gigs.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   >> I don't know.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.800]   >> Six hours battery life.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.800]   I don't know if I'm going to listen to music on that phone.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:30.800]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.800]   >> You're certainly not going to watch movies on a plane because
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.800]   we get on a plane and you can't take the battery out.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.800]   So what are you going to do?
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.800]   You get off the plane with a dead battery and you got to sink it.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.800]   I mean, you got to charge it somewhere and where is that
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   charging that it comes from?
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.800]   >> Right.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:46.800]   >> That's a disadvantage.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.800]   Although most smartphones don't have that one.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.800]   I mean, the battery life is not much less than a typical
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.800]   smartphone.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.800]   >> Right.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.800]   >> But it is if you start watching movies.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.800]   And again, it's because it's locked in.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.800]   If I'm a real phone geek, I've carried two batteries with me.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.800]   So when I run one down, I get off.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.800]   I put the new battery in, but I don't have that option here.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.800]   >> So I have to go for a movie.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.800]   >> Are we sure that you can't open it up?
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.800]   >> It sure looked like you couldn't.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.800]   And Steve didn't mention anything like, oh, look here.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.800]   And look how it flips down here.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.800]   And here's your battery.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.800]   >> Kendra had something to say.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.800]   Pass that mic over to Mike.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.800]   >> Oh, no.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.800]   I was just saying I bet they're going to come out with another
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.800]   battery that you have to buy separate so that if you can
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.800]   plug into or zinc it.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.800]   >> I mean, not be part of all the accessories.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.800]   With protection and skin.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.800]   >> Well, God knows the accessory.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.800]   When you talk to all the accessory companies, they must be
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.800]   jumping up and down.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.800]   This is a whole new market.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.800]   I mean, they get to pretty much do everything they did for the
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.800]   iPod and do it for the phone.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.800]   >> Well, don't forget that connector on the bottom might be a
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.800]   wonderful place to put an ad on battery.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.800]   And they already make them for iPods.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.800]   And also, Apple's jumping up and down about that too because
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:51.800]   that's their proprietary port and they make 10% wholesale on
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.800]   everything that plugs into that port.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.800]   >> No.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.800]   >> Baby.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.800]   >> That's a nice port to have.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.800]   >> Shocking.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.800]   >> Very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.800]   >> She's saying this is a profit thing.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.800]   >> I'm willing to sell my ports for 5%.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.800]   >> Any tankers?
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.800]   >> No.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:06.800]   >> No.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.800]   >> I just thought I'd put it out there.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.800]   >> I love part of this that I think is fascinating, Leo, though,
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   is you're talking about how we're not sure yet how easy it's
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.800]   going to be to do the entry and maybe we're not going to like
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.800]   the thumb stuff.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.800]   The thing that's been hanging me up with Sprint, one of the
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   many things, is how hard it is for me to sync up, obviously,
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.800]   with my phone.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.800]   It's a Mac use, right?
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.800]   I'm completely locked out on anything you want to say about.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.800]   >> You know what?
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.800]   It sucks for Windows users.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.800]   >> Is that right?
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.800]   >> Sinking sucks.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.800]   >> Not any more.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.800]   >> Here's the part I love is that the funny part is in 1999,
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.800]   the syncing was better on Sprint.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.800]   You could actually go to a website and arrange your bookmarks,
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.800]   something you can't even do anymore on Sprint, God love them.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.800]   But now I love the idea that today they understand that all
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.800]   the heavy lifting that I do is going to be on my box and then
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.800]   when I go out into the world, I just want to access that stuff.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.800]   And then there's going to be a minimum amount of entry that I
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.800]   do on the road, chances are.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.800]   I mean, there's limitations to that, but I do like the idea of
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.800]   saying like, you know, we don't want to have to put on a
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.800]   whole keyboard if ultimately you're just going to be looking
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.800]   stuff up, which is what a lot of people want when they're on
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.800]   the go.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.800]   >> I still say this is a computer.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.800]   The user interface is revolutionary.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.800]   I'd like to see it on the OS 10 desktop.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.800]   I mean, I think this is more -- you said it.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   This is more than just another phone announcement.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.800]   >> In the developer's right now, I just saw John Gruber and
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.800]   Cable Sasser talking at the Mac world booth.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.800]   And Cable's saying like, well, now we've got to start thinking
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   about what do you do with two thumbs on this phone?
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.800]   >> Now, I mean, we've never had a device with two mice before,
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.800]   and that's essentially what's happening now.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.800]   And how does that kind of stuff spread out and back into the
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.800]   desktop?
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.800]   >> There's gestures.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.800]   I love the way you wake up the phone.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.800]   >> I love gestures.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   >> Oh, that was cool, man.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.800]   >> You're just waking up by sliding your fingers on the
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.800]   phone.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.800]   >> I almost needed medical attention when I saw that.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.800]   >> I got to tell you, back in the Pixel Core office, there was a
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.800]   lot of concern that you were getting the medical care that we
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.800]   knew that you were going to be there.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.800]   >> We just all imagined that Leah was like quietly, like kind of
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.800]   rubbing at the end of the clock.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.800]   >> We need compressions.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.800]   >> We need salt.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.800]   >> We need salt.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.800]   >> The gesture to turn to wake to unlock the screen is just a
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.800]   very simple rub your finger along the bottom.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.800]   >> In fact, as I walked through the Expo Hall today afterwards,
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.800]   I would just occasionally swipe at the air.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:12.800]   >> He's getting ready.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   >> You're also with --
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.800]   >> You're also with --
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.800]   >> -- your balsa wood pro-to-phone.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:16.800]   >> I thought the other thing that was interesting, Chris
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.800]   Breen, that Steve made real pains to mention is we've spent
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.800]   two and a half years on this.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.800]   We have 200 patents.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.800]   >> Yes, they do.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.800]   >> And he said we intend to enforce.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.800]   >> Did he actually say that?
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.800]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:29.800]   He was talking about it.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.800]   >> He was kind of drowned out at the end.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.800]   He said we intend to protect him.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.800]   >> And they didn't do that with the iPod.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.800]   I mean, this is really kind of the first Steve step forward and
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.800]   say, we know how cool this is.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.800]   You cannot touch this.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.800]   And don't even try because this is such a huge business for us,
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.800]   or potentially a huge business for us.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.800]   Don't bother.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.800]   >> Reading the tea leaves a little bit, I think what I'm sensing
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.800]   there is some insecurity on Steve's part.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.800]   He's entering and he even alluded to it a very, very competitive
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.800]   market.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.800]   You've got Nokia, you've got Motorola, you've got Sony Ericsson.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.800]   It is a tough world, a cell phone world.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.800]   And I think in a way, all of this bravado from Steve, if I may
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   be a little psychological, is a way of saying, I'm a little
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.800]   insecure about this.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.800]   >> Well, perhaps, but look at this too, that again, like with the
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.800]   iPod, they own everything, right?
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.800]   They've got the software, they've got the hardware in the cell
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.800]   phone world, you own the hardware, and then you're putting it on
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.800]   to some computer that works with something maybe part of the
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.800]   time, and it's not that kind of integrated solution that you get
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.800]   with the iPod and iTunes, and now with this phone, and iTunes
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.800]   is again doing it also.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.800]   This isn't even a kind of relationship that people are
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.800]   talking about yet, but this gives them a huge advantage beyond
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.800]   what the phone can do itself.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   So other companies then have to go out and somehow get in to
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:48.800]   windows in that way, good luck, or the Mac, impossible.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.800]   >> And companies that have been basically participating in a race
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.800]   to the bottom for these cheap units that they're going to give
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.800]   away with service, I mean, to quote our friend, the
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:57.800]   Macalo.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.800]   >> Oh my God.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.800]   >> Please don't bring that back.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.800]   >> To quote our friend, the Macalo, all those people who were out
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   there saying, oh my gosh, what would Apple ever have to offer
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.800]   in terms of a cellular mobile phone offering?
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.800]   Well, what they're going to do is basically take your stupid
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.800]   commodity business that's going down the toilet and figure out
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   how to make people want to spend an extra $300.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.800]   >> Hey, it's not that bad a business, $975 million handset
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.800]   sold in 2006.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.800]   >> Yes, but as with the iPod and as with the Macintosh, they
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   just raised the bar on what you can do with something that's
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.800]   otherwise a gray box.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.800]   >> And I think that the other thing is is that for a lot of
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.800]   the manufacturers, when you look at the Nokia, the Samsung,
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.800]   the LGs, the problem that they're going to have is that the
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.800]   market above about $300 to $350 is gone.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   I mean, it is just new toast.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.800]   If you've got a person who's willing to spend $350 on it.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.800]   >> Let's ask Justine.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.800]   Here she's sitting with her trio.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.800]   Is that a 700W or is it a palm base?
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.800]   >> It's palm.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.800]   >> Is it over for palm?
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.800]   >> I think so.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.800]   I'm actually, I consider throwing it away, but then I had to wait
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.800]   till June.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.800]   >> You should have Scott stump on it for you.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:00.800]   >> I think the Windows-- >> Oh, not yet.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.800]   >> The Windows platform might survive, but you can't think that
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   the palm platform has a chance.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.800]   >> Yeah, it looks like it's from the '50s.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.800]   >> It looks archaic.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.800]   >> It looks archaic.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.800]   >> I've registered the domain, I'll stomp on your cell phone
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.800]   for you guys.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.800]   >> But this is about a perfect example of it though.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.800]   You're seeing the world through Blazer versus seeing the world
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.800]   through Safari.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.800]   >> Blazer is the palm-- >> Yeah, the built-in trio.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.800]   >> The palm, the browser.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.800]   >> Blazer makes me cry in pain when I try to check anything.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.800]   >> Blazer is-- yeah, you're living a lot.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.800]   >> Now I noticed you're using that earlier.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.800]   Were you chatting on your phone?
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.800]   >> I was text messaging.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.800]   >> Text messaging.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.800]   >> Oh, I just don't want to.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.800]   >> In fact, here comes a response.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.800]   >> All right, she's got a friend on the other side of the country,
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.800]   I think.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.800]   So looking at that compared to the text messaging, and boy,
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.800]   I was blown away with the SMS on the phone.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.800]   >> It was beautiful.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.800]   >> Do you know for the first time in my life, I think I actually
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.800]   understand.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:53.800]   >> You would use it, and all the kind of people I use are--
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.800]   >> I don't understand how do you send a text message now.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.800]   Because I have a-- I have a problem.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.800]   >> See, but I can't use it.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.800]   >> I gotta get-- I gotta put that context on that.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:06.800]   It was-- I sent Scott-- I saw him open his trio, and so there was
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.800]   the last Mac world I needed to get ahold of him.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.800]   So I just SMSed him.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.800]   You know, I SMSed him, and I said, "What?"
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.800]   He didn't realize he had SMS until he got the message.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:16.800]   >> What's this?
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.800]   Somebody who sent me text.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.800]   >> Apparently, my TV gets other channels.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.800]   >> Oh, I'll be.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   >> It gets worse.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.800]   It gets worse.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.800]   We're sitting-- all three of us sitting together at the keynote
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.800]   last year, and I'm like, "Hey, I want to take a picture,
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:30.800]   but I forgot my camera."
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.800]   And Alex goes, "Well, you got a camera right there."
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.800]   I'm like, "Well, show me how to use it."
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.800]   >> Yeah, I remember that.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.800]   >> Or the photographer for 32 years.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.800]   >> I heard you remember that.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.800]   That was a great moment.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.800]   >> How do you get the jiggaerts type out of the camera?
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:40.800]   I understand.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.800]   >> I have a little bird in there drawing pictures.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.800]   >> I do want to make sure that's changed.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.800]   >> I'm still trying to figure out how to get that picture out of the phone.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.800]   But I do have--
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.800]   >> I occasionally look at it.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.800]   >> See, but here's the deal.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.800]   No, but that's-- I want to point that what you just said there is that
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:55.800]   is the problem.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.800]   >> It's not easy to use.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.800]   None of these phones are easy to use.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:00.800]   >> Especially when you're 40.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.800]   >> And because we're talking about 40.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.800]   >> 40.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:04.800]   >> You're 40?
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.800]   >> Well, I have shirts that are 40.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.800]   >> I got shoes all over the deal.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.800]   >> But the thing is seeing that all in an adiab or iChat like window
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:12.800]   where the thread has been named.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.800]   >> It even went boop, boop, boop.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.800]   >> Just like iChat.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.800]   >> Just like iChat.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.800]   Although he didn't mention iChat.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.800]   >> He did not.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.800]   >> So would you be content to use-- now you're using SMS Justine completely
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.800]   comfortably as if it's a chat application.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.800]   >> Yes, almost too much.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.800]   >> To the young people today.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.800]   Are very comfortable with SMS.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:33.800]   That's fine for you.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.800]   >> I guess the good thing with the trio is it kind of makes it like a chat
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.800]   so it keeps all in the same window.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.800]   >> Very similar to the iPhone.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.800]   >> Very similar to the iPhone.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.800]   >> Yes.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.800]   >> But it looks a lot better on the iPhone.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.800]   >> And it does go boop.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.800]   >> That's true.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.800]   >> That's true.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.800]   >> I love the quote that in fact in a way for all the people who've been
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:53.800]   saying all along, why does an apple just put OS 10 out as a software
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   package, he quotes Alan Kay who is perhaps I think certainly to me one of the
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.800]   great visionaries in this business, a brilliant thinker if you've ever seen
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.800]   Alan Kay speak, I mean you just walk away in awe.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   He quotes Alan Kay, Steve does at the keynote, people who are really serious
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.800]   about software should make their own hardware.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.800]   That's apples justification for existence all along.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.800]   I mean everybody says OS 10 is so great.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.800]   It's great because of the hardware and this is a really good example.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.800]   I mean that hardware makes the software sing and vice versa.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.800]   >> And I think that's been the problem.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:27.800]   That's the problem that PC manufacturers have that Microsoft has that
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.800]   always occurs is that they control the platform.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.800]   >> They control the platform.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.800]   >> And I think the reason, now I'm sure the phone will work well for
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.800]   PC users as well.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.800]   I bet you they'll have some kind of sync and everything else, but it will be
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.800]   nothing like the experience for Mac user.
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:42.800]   Mac user it will be seamless.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.800]   It will be the first time that we really have a seamless interaction with our
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:47.800]   phone.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.800]   >> Right.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.800]   >> Anybody at that level, you know, where everything is.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   >> Normally your internet interaction is literally nothing but
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.800]   seems.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.800]   >> Yes.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   No, that's exactly right.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.800]   >> It's a, it's a seem full.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.800]   >> Seem full.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.800]   >> Seem full.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.800]   Because I mean the whole thing, you see these, you see these really tragic
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.800]   hacks that are out there.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.800]   It's like, well, there's one way you can sync and you basically Bluetooth,
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.800]   all of your contacts, what are the time.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.800]   And it's like, oh, and I can put fondue forks in my eyes.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.800]   It's like, why does it take so long?
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.800]   I know we're only 5% of the population, but how hard is it to understand that we
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.800]   want to be able to take this stuff with it, with us?
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:24.800]   >> I've spent more money buying things like missing sync versions,
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 to try to get that stuff at work.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.800]   >> But you guys think it's-
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.800]   >> I would have paid for the whole phone.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   >> You guys are Matt guys, you think, oh, it must be better over there on Windows.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.800]   It ain't, it's not any better.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.800]   It's a nightmare situation for everybody.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.800]   >> I'm sorry, it doesn't suck as much as Windows is not my metric.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.800]   >> Chris Breena, thank you for stopping by.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:42.800]   It's really great to see you.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.800]   >> Thanks for having me, it's great to be back on.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.800]   >> And, come on, just, you know, give us a prediction.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.800]   You think by June we'll see an iPod with this touch screen interface?
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.800]   >> I hope so.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:52.800]   >> Okay, let's say May.
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:53.800]   >> May.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.800]   >> I'm trying to bid you up.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:55.800]   >> Okay.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:55.800]   >> May.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:56.800]   >> Thank you, Chris Breena.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.800]   >> Okay, thank you.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.800]   >> Mac, he's the Mac Daddy, Mac 9-1-1 and Mac World Magazine, of course,
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   the author of those great secrets of the iPod books,
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.800]   and really nice to have him stop by.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.800]   We do have some other people who will be stopping by from time to time.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.800]   And as I said, I hope David Pope comes by because he's the only one among us
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.800]   who's actually got his hands on one of these phones.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:22.800]   >> For people who are there today, for folks who were not in here in San Francisco at Mac World,
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.800]   it's like a museum.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.800]   All you guys here, are you all at Mac World?
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.800]   All the folks are in the room here.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:32.800]   So did you guys go to the booth and appreciate the fact that it's under like a bell jar?
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.800]   Like, it's like, we found the last remaining phone of these human beings
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.800]   that we're preserving it under glass.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.800]   And all these nerds are up there with their camera phones extended,
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.800]   taking this, what they wish were the last camera phone picture
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.800]   with their current janky phone.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.800]   >> Someday we'll be able to take that last picture.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.800]   Two megapixels is pretty exciting, but you have to send it over the edge network,
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:56.800]   which is not so exciting.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   >> Why do people not like edge?
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.800]   What's the deal with edge?
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.800]   >> It's slow. It's slow compared to Efto.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.800]   >> Compared to 3G.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.800]   >> Now, well, remember, everything we saw on the show floor was Wi-Fi.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.800]   So much faster than it will be on the cell network.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.800]   >> Can I ask a question?
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:10.800]   What I'm curious about?
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:14.800]   I don't know if I'm going to be fully ready to pull the trigger
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.800]   and move to phone functionality.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.800]   If you decide not to enable the phone functionality,
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.800]   what all will you get out of this and not get out of this?
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.800]   >> Are you crazy?
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.800]   >> I might be crazy, but I'm curious.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:25.800]   Now, here's my question, though.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.800]   >> I mean, just use it as an email client and as a browser.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.800]   >> It's got a lot of fun, right?
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.800]   >> I mean, I can potentially still use it.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.800]   >> I'm not using the phone.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.800]   You don't want to pay singular?
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.800]   >> You just come here.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.800]   It's a Mac in my hand.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.800]   >> I think the people are just going to, I mean, as soon as I saw it,
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.800]   I was just like, "Well, my Verizon is over."
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.800]   >> That's right.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.800]   >> Like, experience with Verizon is over.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.800]   It just didn't even work.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:44.800]   >> Let me ask you this, dude.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.800]   Do you think it will function at all without enabling the phone?
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.800]   >> Sure.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:49.800]   >> I'm sure the function is fine, but I just think that people are
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.800]   going to buy it and they're just not going to buy it.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.800]   They're going to get rid of whatever phone they have and they're
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.800]   going to get something else.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.800]   >> Well, even a one step further, people are already asking,
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.800]   "I've talked to some Canadians who are saying, well, you know,
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.800]   what could we get an unlocked version and use it on the Rogers
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.800]   network?"
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.800]   And probably you could, but a lot of the functionality singular was
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.800]   smart.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.800]   A lot of the functionality comes from singular things like that
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.800]   voicemail that looks like email.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.800]   >> That's beautiful.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.800]   >> That is the Yahoo integration.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:13.800]   Things like that.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.800]   >> That was smart.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:15.800]   >> Hey, let me introduce Jackie Chen.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.800]   She is the editor of Infinite Loop, which is the Mac column.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.800]   The great R's Technic.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.800]   I'm a big fan of R's Technic.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.800]   >> Hi, thank you.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:23.800]   >> It's nice to meet you, Jackie.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.800]   >> Yeah, we -- R's Technic has gone from being basically an
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.800]   enthusiast hobby site to it.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.800]   I think one of the best tech news sites on the web, just fantastic.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   >> I think so, too.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.800]   >> Thank you very much.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   >> So you were at the keynote?
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.800]   >> You know, one of my writers was at the keynote.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.800]   >> You didn't get to go.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.800]   >> We had kind of a last minute mix up with passes.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.800]   >> You know, they were funny at Mac.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.800]   They're very stingy at Mac for it.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.800]   >> Yeah, they had some XSS troopers out there.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.800]   >> Well, they sent me a pass, and then they sent me an email
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.800]   and said I couldn't have it.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.800]   One of the things they said is only one person from each.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   >> Yeah, that's pretty much what happened.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.800]   >> So R's only gets one person there.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.800]   You know, toy only gets one person.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:01.800]   That's crazy.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:03.800]   >> That makes no sense.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.800]   >> Yeah, it ended up kind of working in our favor because I had an
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.800]   exhibitor's pass, and then --
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.800]   >> That's what Alex did.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.800]   >> We're able to ask more questions with the exhibitors
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:12.800]   pass than with the press pass.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.800]   >> Yeah, I was wandering around last night.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.800]   >> Were you?
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.800]   >> Ask me questions.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.800]   >> Yeah, but you couldn't see anything behind those sheets
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.800]   in the head.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.800]   >> No, he got sheets.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.800]   >> Yeah, no, he can't look behind those.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.800]   So what do you think, Jackie?
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:23.800]   >> Oh, of everything.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.800]   iPhone, everything.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.800]   >> Yeah, we haven't talked much about the ITV.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.800]   Let me ask you about the ITV.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   >> You know, Apple TV, as we should.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.800]   >> I was actually excited about it before today.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.800]   >> Less so now.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:36.800]   >> Less so now.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.800]   When I was asking the Apple employees who are demoing it,
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:45.800]   you know, a bunch of questions, and there's no HD content on
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.800]   iTunes.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.800]   >> Right.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   >> So what's the point of the HD hooking up on it?
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.800]   >> We have heard a rumor that there would be this deal with
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.800]   Netflix, and maybe there'd be rental HD.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.800]   They're never going to let you store HD content.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.800]   >> Right.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.800]   So, I mean, it seems -- at least right now, it seems really
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.800]   kind of superfluous that it's there.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.800]   >> Right.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.800]   >> Especially with things like Slings, Slingscatcher from
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:10.800]   Slings Media, which in many ways kind of out does the Apple TV.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.800]   >> Exactly.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.800]   >> And you can't buy from iTunes straight from the Apple TV.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:15.800]   >> You can't.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.800]   >> You have to buy it in iTunes and then sing it.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:18.800]   >> Exactly.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.800]   Which I was -- I mean, that kind of eliminates the whole, like,
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.800]   you know, media center and you're living your own thing.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.800]   >> Yeah, don't you want to sit looking at your TV and purchase
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:25.800]   something right there?
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.800]   >> I want to be lazy and be sitting on my couch.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.800]   >> I can do that with Comcast.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:30.800]   >> Exactly.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.800]   So, that's what I asked.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.800]   I was like, can't you buy something straight there?
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.800]   And he was like, well, you know, you could -- you have to go to,
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.800]   like, your power book and download it first and then
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.800]   stream it over.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.800]   And I was like, that adds, you know, like three extra steps.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   >> I do like the part of it is that a lot of people came out
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.800]   of the woodwork to go, oh, gosh, if you're a nerd, you've
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.800]   already done this with your 360.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.800]   >> You've already hacked your own home box or whatever.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.800]   And the thing is so the only appeal of this thing, the
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.800]   current appeal is for, theoretically, for the consumer who
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.800]   wants to dip their toe into this kind of digital lifestyle
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:58.800]   stuff.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.800]   But if you've got all these stupid extra steps for that kind of
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:02.800]   money, I don't know.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.800]   >> That's what -- I mean, they have to add in that functionality
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.800]   at some point.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.800]   >> It's so far of all the stuff in the keynote.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.800]   This is the thing that most people are kind of going, well,
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.800]   you know, that's cool.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   I don't know if I'd buy it, but, you know --
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.800]   >> Exactly.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.800]   >> Remember what Chris Breen said about his test with 802.11B
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.800]   and G transmission of things?
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.800]   He said it was so dog slow it wouldn't work.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.800]   >> But Steve mentioned that this has N as well, but the fact
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.800]   that they've even appended B and G to it.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:28.800]   >> But it's N draft.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.800]   >> But I think it's --
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.800]   >> Well, there is no N final, so N draft.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.800]   >> It's N draft.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   >> The other thing is most -- there are some Macs within.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.800]   If you have a core to --
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.800]   >> Do it.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:37.800]   >> Just not enabled, but it's in there.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.800]   >> It's infirmable.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.800]   There'll be a firmware upgrade.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.800]   You could do it.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   But that's not all.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.800]   My Mac book won't do it.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.800]   It's a core to it.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.800]   I might have to upgrade.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.800]   >> I think the answer for most of this is still SnickerNet.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   I'm using --
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.800]   >> SnickerNet.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.800]   >> I've got an old Mac and an old Mac.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.800]   >> I'm using -- I've got an old Mac and a USB key drive.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.800]   And I'm just moving stuff to --
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.800]   >> Well, but it's sinking.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.800]   It's got to drive in it, so it's going to be able to sync up.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   So what's going to happen is -- and it just depends on how
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.800]   you watch your stuff.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.800]   I have to admit that I am so disconnected from things happening
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.800]   when I --
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.800]   >> You and your wife sit watching stuff on your laptop.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.800]   >> Which is sad.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.800]   >> That's so pathetic.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.800]   >> It's really sad.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.800]   >> Although we are --
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.800]   >> Your wife deserves better than that, actually.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.800]   >> I have to.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.800]   >> You should provide some.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   >> We were looking at -- I know we're at Mac world, but we were
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.800]   looking at CES and I was telling you --
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.800]   >> I said my wife, you know, we could put 103 --
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:22.800]   >> You know, like --
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.800]   >> 180 in shell CD now.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.800]   >> Right up over the mantle.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.800]   >> That's what I call extreme.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.800]   >> 15 inch laptop to 103 inch LCD.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.800]   >> Alex doesn't mess around.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.800]   >> And then a media server with 15 gajillion gigaflops of
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.800]   Caroline in the city or whatever.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.800]   >> Oh, dear.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.800]   I guess the new thing is --
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:39.800]   >> You know, that wasn't what I thought.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.800]   >> Not who gets the remote, but who has to have the laptop in
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.800]   their lap.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.800]   >> That's right.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.800]   >> Who has to put up with the heat.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.800]   So, Jackie, what were your readers saying?
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.800]   Is the response positive?
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.800]   >> Oh, man.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.800]   I would say overall it's positive.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   People were probably slightly less enthused about -- about
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.800]   ITV stuff.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.800]   Like I said, you can't buy iTunes directly from there.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.800]   Also, USB -- the USB port is not for external storage.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.800]   It's only for service reasons, which the --
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.800]   >> No, you're making me angry.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.800]   >> No, that's exactly what they told me today.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.800]   >> And what, how did you drive 40 gigs?
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.800]   >> 40 gigs.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.800]   >> But if you can't have an external drive, come on.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.800]   >> I don't have 40 gigs.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.800]   >> I have to tell you, I know -- I think I know where this is
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.800]   coming from, and it's not from Apple.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.800]   This is about content protection.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.800]   And if you have a real live USB cable, you can take stuff off
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.800]   of that drive, and they don't want you to do that.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.800]   And I think ultimately that's what you're going to see.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.800]   And people are going to -- when people really realize what
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.800]   content copy protection means in terms of functionality,
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.800]   it's not just the Apple TV.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   They're going to be furious across the board.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   >> The thing is, if it was going to be there for service
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.800]   reasons only, you would think they would put --
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.800]   >> Of course.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.800]   >> Put it, like, inside.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.800]   >> Yes.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.800]   >> And don't have it accessible to the user.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.800]   It seems like it's too -- I don't know, something's wrong
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.800]   about this whole situation.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:55.800]   >> I'm just excited that we're going to be able to -- as a
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.800]   video podcast producer, I really like the fact that when
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   you're sitting there in front of your TV, you can go watch
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.800]   my TV shows and you can click four more down and say,
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.800]   "Watch my podcasts."
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.800]   And the thing that's important for us, of course, is that we
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.800]   produce podcasts that are higher resolution than most TV
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.800]   shows.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.800]   So we're really excited about getting ahold of those
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.800]   HD -- you know, having an ITV that downloads Mac
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.800]   Break and watches it at 1080p, you know, and --
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.800]   >> Once again, we have to thank Apple.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.800]   I mean, it almost pains me to do it, but Apple's the only
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.800]   company coming forward and supporting podcasts,
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   supporting independent programming in that way.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.800]   >> And I think the ITV is going to be very, very important
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   for us as podcasters.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.800]   I think that -- especially video podcasters, I think that
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.800]   ITV is going to mean a lot, a lot.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.800]   You know, I think there's a lot -- because we're still
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.800]   getting this stuff from the iTunes.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.800]   We're still downloading all those pieces.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:47.800]   And it puts us in a very, very good position to really expand
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.800]   our market, which I think is exciting.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.800]   >> So, Jacky -- >> You guys remember when this came out,
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.800]   I was kind of non-plus.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.800]   >> All right, all right.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.800]   You're right.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   You're right.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.800]   You're right.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.800]   You're right.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.800]   >> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:59.800]   >> You're right about everything's fine.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.800]   >> Just give me a second.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.800]   >> Give me a second.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.800]   >> I'm now going to take a new position.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   Oh, now you like it.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.800]   >> Ladies and gentlemen, Scott Bord has a new position.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:06.800]   >> And I'll tell you one.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.800]   >> John Kellogg, to flip you on your head before you say it.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.800]   Okay, go ahead.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.800]   >> And here's why, because what Alex just said, because I think
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.800]   this creates an opportunity for folks like us, since Apple is
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.800]   dragging the ball behind them so slowly of getting the movie
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.800]   content and everything else up at 720p, we'll do it.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.800]   We'll come in and we'll own that space.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.800]   >> Yeah, we will.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.800]   >> And now that thing will matter, can I get an amen?
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:29.800]   [applause]
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.800]   >> I see why don't you graduate with this, dude.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.800]   >> I don't know what you said, but I'm glad they like it.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:34.800]   >> Yeah, Scott.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.800]   >> But no more diet tabs for Mr. Born here.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.800]   Is that what you're drinking tab?
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.800]   I have no idea.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.800]   It's wet.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.800]   Nothing like tab and pizza.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.800]   Okay, so Jackie, you hate the ITV.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.800]   >> I don't hate it.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.800]   >> You hate the ITV.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.800]   >> It's okay for me.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.800]   >> Everybody's saying you hate it.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.800]   >> All day people were talking about how you hate it.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.800]   >> Why don't we make you be the negative person.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.800]   >> I can be the haters.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.800]   >> What do you hate about the iPhone?
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.800]   >> Who do I hate?
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.800]   >> Now be very careful here.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.800]   >> It's not available yet.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   >> I hate what I hate is that it's singular only.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.800]   I know that it takes advantage of singular technologies, but it's --
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:13.800]   I mean, that kills us.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.800]   >> Singular doesn't have such great technology.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.800]   >> I think one of you guys were talking about how costly singular is --
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.800]   >> I pay 50 bucks for my Blackberry service alone on singular.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.800]   >> So wait a minute.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.800]   Your Blackberry costs $199, but you're paying $50 a month.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.800]   >> They're polarizing you.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.800]   >> That's ridiculous.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.800]   >> No, actually the Blackberry costs more than $199 bucks, I'm sure.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.800]   But anyway, yes.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:34.800]   >> Well, what --
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.800]   >> The data is very expensive.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:40.800]   >> How much was your -- who had a -- oh, it was Nicky that had a Blackberry, just
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.800]   it was $199.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:42.800]   So how much is your Blackberry?
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:43.800]   >> I don't know.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.800]   I didn't buy the Blackberry.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.800]   >> Jeez, I'm legal important.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:46.800]   People give me stuff for free.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.800]   >> They actually give it.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.800]   >> I just show up and give bills to people.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:50.800]   >> Normally I don't, actually, but --
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.800]   >> But that's pretty costly.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.800]   And I know on Sprint, trying to get the Efdo modem functionality on Sprint was --
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.800]   >> It's pricey.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.800]   >> Close to a bill a month.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.800]   >> Really?
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:09.000]   It's pretty expensive. You used that fairly afford up. Hey, hey, hey. This is a guy I want to get to know.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.580]   The same guy who did the original calculations is now written a program is that on a website?
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.340]   You do that JavaScript?
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:19.320]   Ruby on rails.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.800]   I can't believe this this week.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.900]   You know, in the front row.
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:27.760]   Trokingly requesting a program. And having it appear while you're still on the air.
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:34.780]   Thank God for Ruby on rails. 3422 hours point two eight till the iPhone.
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.480]   That's a central born time.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.780]   Sir, what is your name? What is your name? So we got to give this guy credit here.
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:45.780]   Pass the microphone over to him because I think we this guy now is officially earned our thanks and trust.
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:46.780]   What is your name, sir?
[00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:47.780]   Shane Sweeney.
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.780]   Oh, it's Shane Sweeney. Thank you, Shane. I know you are.
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:54.780]   Shane, Shane did a lot for us on tech TV. We do have an audience, Mike.
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:58.780]   We should probably get that in a position where people could actually use it.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.780]   Jackie Chang, I want to thank you very much for coming by.
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:04.780]   I love ours Technica. Infinite Loop is their Macintosh coverage.
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:05.780]   Awesome.
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:07.780]   You do a great job. Thank you for coming by.
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.780]   Let's bring Adam over.
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:13.780]   Adam Christensen from the MacCast is also here.
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:14.780]   Come on down.
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.780]   Hey, look, it's Adam.
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:23.780]   It's really fun. One of the fun things about Mac world and just the Mac community in general is it's really a community.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:27.780]   Oh, man, I'll tell you, it's so fun to go to Mac world and have like a mutual nerd experience with somebody.
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:29.780]   Even people you've never met.
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:33.780]   Oh, exactly. It's like, "I know you from your RSS feed."
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:38.780]   I know you too. I love you. I love you too.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:42.780]   Well, you know, it's funny because a guy came by with your photograph and showed it to me, Merle.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:46.780]   And he had a caption that says, "This guy, least likely to have ever kissed a girl."
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.780]   Oh, man. I don't know.
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:52.780]   That is gonna make my boyfriend so mad.
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:55.780]   It's gonna make Madeleine surprise is what it's gonna do.
[00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:56.780]   Is this Nodleine?
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:57.780]   I don't know.
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:58.780]   I shot who in the what now?
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:05.780]   MacCast is, of course, one of the great Mac podcasts Adam Christensen started this over a year ago.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.780]   And you have a lot of fans here.
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:09.780]   Thank you.
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:13.780]   Thursday, we're gonna get together. We're gonna have a Mac podcasters of meetup.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:15.780]   Yes, absolutely. Over at the Apple Store.
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.780]   Although, you know, this...
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:18.780]   It's a little nicer.
[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.780]   I went to the Apple Store. I'm out of the loop. I don't know what happened.
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.780]   And was it quiet over there?
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:24.780]   It was very quiet.
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:28.780]   I ran into Travis and he said, "You gotta go over towards the other side."
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:31.780]   So they didn't kick you out, though.
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:32.780]   Okay, just checking.
[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:33.780]   Just checking.
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:34.780]   Just checking.
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:36.780]   What do you think?
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:37.780]   Mac...
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:38.780]   Yeah, this is my first Mac world.
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:39.780]   What? Wait a minute.
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:41.780]   Oh, that's crazy talk.
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.780]   Have you been doing the spanking machine yet?
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:44.780]   Unbelievable.
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:45.780]   I never had the opportunity.
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:49.780]   For work last year, I had to go to CS and I couldn't do both.
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:51.780]   Aren't you glad you're not at CES right now?
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:52.780]   Shout out to people.
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:55.780]   How many people are glad they're not in Vegas right now?
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.780]   Hello, Luja!
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:58.780]   But the media server.
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:43:59.780]   The media server.
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:01.780]   Oh, it's a new media server.
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:04.780]   So I got my first Steve Note experience.
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:05.780]   And?
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.780]   It was everything that I thought it probably would have been.
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:10.780]   That would have been nice if he shaved for the event.
[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:11.780]   That was my only criticism.
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:12.780]   You didn't like that shirt.
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:13.780]   Wait a minute, Kendra.
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:14.780]   We are not...
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:15.780]   Kendra, what do you say?
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:16.780]   Come on now.
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.780]   Kendra, we talked about it this morning to say it.
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:20.780]   She made a rude gesture.
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.780]   Okay, number one is the shirt color, but what's number two?
[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:24.780]   Well...
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:25.780]   Does he have man boobs?
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:26.780]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.780]   The man boobs were a bit of a letdown.
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:31.780]   He doesn't have man boobs, does he?
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:32.780]   Those are from way to way.
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:35.780]   You know, it could have been the overhead lighting and the shirt.
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:40.780]   If Alex had lit him with the kind of very bright key lighting that we do on that break.
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:42.780]   He didn't have a woman boobs.
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.780]   Well, he would have had more gentle kind of buns.
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:45.780]   But as it was...
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:46.780]   Jesus.
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:49.780]   He had kind of a be cut thing going on.
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:55.780]   Okay, because this is a Dolby headphone, we're mixing this down straight to air and we cannot edit this.
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:57.780]   So just, I warn you now, sir.
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.780]   Do not step over the line.
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:05.780]   Steve Jobs is one of the most thoughtful, intelligent, brilliant, insightful men.
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.780]   Now, let me ask you, Kendra.
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:08.780]   Okay.
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:09.780]   Should he have shaved?
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:10.780]   You know...
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:15.780]   When you come out with a phone like that, it doesn't really matter, but it's a good thing he had the phone.
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.780]   I like her more and more.
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.780]   Good thing he had the phone.
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:20.780]   I'm just...
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:21.780]   I'm just...
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:22.780]   I'm a little razer.
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:26.780]   Or a phone that would shave for him, but maybe that'll come out in July.
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:27.780]   Ooh, razer.
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:28.780]   Ooh.
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:29.780]   Wow, there's a feature.
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:30.780]   That'll be the new add-on.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.780]   Oh, wow.
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:33.780]   All right, thank you, Kendra.
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:34.780]   So let's get back to...
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:35.780]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:37.780]   I kind of got sidetracked by the...
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:39.780]   It was the manboob gesture that got me.
[00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.780]   Can you do that again, Kendra, just so I know...
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:42.780]   Okay, that's what that means.
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:43.780]   Sorry.
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.780]   I'm just going to sleep tonight.
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:46.780]   So the one thing of...
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:53.780]   I mean, obviously there's the presence you walk in the room and there's that anticipation going on and energy and stuff like that.
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:58.780]   Yeah, but even more so is what kind of blew me away was how giddy Jobs was.
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:03.780]   You could tell he was thrilled about this announcement and we really saw a different side of Steve Jobs.
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:11.780]   So you're talking about his physical appearance, but towards the end he had that little tender moment when he was kind of thanking the families of all those people at Apple.
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:13.780]   And I thought that was...
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.780]   Maybe he's just aging and we're seeing a softer, gentler Steve Jobs.
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:18.780]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:19.780]   I think Steve comes and goes.
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:22.780]   I think a year ago Steve was clearly out of sorts.
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.780]   He didn't feel well.
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:28.780]   It was a very choppy presentation at the Showtime event in September.
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:31.780]   Clearly there was something missing in Steve Jobs demeanor.
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.780]   Maybe he's been working long hours on the iPhone.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.780]   I don't know, but you're right, absolutely.
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:37.780]   That today he was in his element.
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:38.780]   He was happy.
[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.780]   I've seen him like this before, but it hasn't been recently.
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:46.780]   I get the impression that this was something that definitely sounded from the rumors.
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.780]   It took a long time to get this thing right.
[00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:49.780]   Two and a half years.
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:52.780]   It sounded like they were close and they were close and they were close.
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.780]   I'm sure that it was very frustrating.
[00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:56.780]   I'm sure that this was supposed to...
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.780]   I think they probably planned to have this come out a lot earlier than it did.
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.780]   I think he's happy that it's fine now.
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:02.780]   Even for an Apple release.
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:03.780]   There's such an extraordinary...
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:07.780]   We were talking in the office today about the extraordinary number of things that has to come together for an Apple release.
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.780]   On an event like this.
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:10.780]   You think about operationally.
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:12.780]   This is the stuff you think about as you get older.
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:17.780]   The operational stuff that's involved with the website and the banners going up.
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:20.780]   All these new URLs that are going to show up on the site.
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:23.780]   Add to that all of this technology piece of this.
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:28.780]   Taking a working prototype for something this sophisticated on stage and having it work.
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:30.780]   There have to be some white and echolments in the last six days.
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:34.780]   Very gutsy to actually show this thing and it didn't crash.
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.780]   It worked great on the demos all day on the show floor.
[00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:40.780]   It worked great and even like David Pogue played with it half an hour.
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.780]   That is pretty impressive.
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:43.780]   That was amazing.
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:46.780]   The fact that it didn't hiccup...
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.780]   The only thing that hiccup was his clicker.
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:51.780]   Not made by Apple.
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:55.780]   Not the iPhone and just the UI was incredible.
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:58.780]   Maybe because they've been working on it so long.
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:01.780]   But he seemed to be using it flawlessly.
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:07.780]   Although I have a feeling that somewhat due to the fact of how usable the device is.
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:14.780]   That's what's truly amazing about the iPhone is they really did completely reinvent I think a user interface for a cell phone.
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:15.780]   Yeah.
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:17.780]   We're all pretty excited I would say.
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:19.780]   I think that's safe to say.
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:20.780]   Now you're excited.
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:21.780]   No, not really.
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:22.780]   I'm just doing it for you.
[00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:24.780]   I don't want you to feel bad.
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:28.780]   You know, I think that it's easy to love something that has been carefully demoed.
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:30.780]   We always have to be a little cautious.
[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:33.780]   A good demo guy can make anything look good.
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:37.780]   And we have to get our hands on it before we're really new.
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.780]   I did notice that the singular guy didn't demo it.
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:43.780]   Boy, the singular guy should probably have stayed home.
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:44.780]   You think?
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:50.780]   You know, one of the things that I find funny is that you realize how good Steve is when he brings just about anybody else on stage.
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:53.780]   I want to hear what Kendra thinks of the singular guy.
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:54.780]   No, no.
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:55.780]   No, no.
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:56.780]   I love singular.
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:58.780]   Singular is the love.
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:00.780]   We all love singular now.
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:07.780]   It's important because you know, I did really call my stockbroker and the large buy order on singular.
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:08.780]   I really don't look like that.
[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:09.780]   Now I have to be honest.
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.780]   I don't think this is going to be such a significant product that would impact singular's price.
[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:15.780]   And the short sell I put on all the other phone and stuff.
[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:16.780]   Oh, come on.
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:17.780]   Seriously.
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:18.780]   Now you're a financial guy.
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:19.780]   You know this stuff.
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:21.780]   Do you think it really will make that big a difference?
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:22.780]   Bubba, I picked up the phone.
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:23.780]   I'm as serious as a heart attack.
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:27.780]   You know what surprised me is that Apple stock went up two and three quarters.
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:29.780]   Didn't surprise me a bit.
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:33.780]   You would have thought that all of that would have already been in the price because really
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:35.780]   this is what we all expected.
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:36.780]   Yeah.
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:38.780]   So I think it's a little more than we expected.
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.780]   I mean, to be honest.
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:44.780]   There's always a leading edge effect and then a trailing edge effect and blah, blah, blah.
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:45.780]   My broker gives me all these terms.
[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:48.780]   Bottom line is you got to go with your gut sometimes.
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:50.780]   We knew something was going to happen.
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:56.780]   I think that last bar that he showed during the demo on the graph kind of tells the story.
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:59.380]   You look at hitting a home run to win.
[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:00.380]   That's one thing.
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:01.380]   Here you got a bunch.
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:02.820]   You got to put what on the ball.
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:07.060]   I think he was being very conservative saying we're going to get 1% of the market.
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:12.860]   In his heart of hearts, I bet there's some sort of document that says 3% and yes, I bought.
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:14.700]   I bought and I'll buy more.
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:17.140]   I talked about this on the show floor today walking around.
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:22.060]   It's that there was this really sick, sad part of my mind that was kind of marauding through
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:27.860]   the expo floor going walking by boots and going dead.
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:28.860]   Trouble.
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:29.860]   Start over.
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:33.700]   I just thought of something we could have just seen do tomorrow.
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:34.700]   Business buy, yeah, exactly.
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:35.860]   Go ahead and do the sad death march.
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.420]   She could say here's the company's going out of business.
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:41.380]   But it's certainly, I mean, like the way that I look at it and I come at this from kind
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:47.460]   of an application guy standpoint is, you know, I think about, let's just start with
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:48.460]   one thing.
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:51.820]   Yahoo push I'm at mail.
[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:55.020]   Well, how many of you are going to sign up for Yahoo mail tonight?
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:58.060]   I'm going to go home and sign up for a Yahoo mail account, right?
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:50:59.900]   We want to do that with a dot Mac account, right?
[00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:01.260]   They need not take a huge job.
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:03.140]   Why did they do that with dot Mac?
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:08.220]   Well, I think that I think our inner I think it will be the interoperability with this and
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:11.100]   dot Mac will be very well and you don't have to buy a dot Mac account.
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:12.820]   You don't have 99 bucks.
[00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:13.820]   It's free.
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.620]   Yahoo is going to give you this free push mail.
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:18.780]   That's interesting because frankly, I don't think they're going to eat blackberries and
[00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:19.780]   lunch on this.
[00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:22.340]   I eat blackberries and lunch, but they're not in a position where people can say, oh,
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:24.740]   I love my blackberry because it is good or bad.
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:25.740]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:26.740]   You don't have that excuse.
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:27.740]   It's interesting.
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:29.740]   I don't think that was something that they needed a check bar for, but it is an interesting
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:30.740]   thing.
[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:33.540]   It isn't that they're necessarily going to eat the lunch of anybody, but a lot of the
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:39.060]   a lot of what a Macintosh Apple product has to do is remove objections.
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:42.420]   And I saw a lot of objections get removed today because because all the stuff, oh, I
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:46.700]   love my pocket PC because I can do Excel when I'm on the bus or whatever.
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:51.300]   I saw a lot of those objections falling aside today as this opportunity for having OS 10
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:54.900]   functionality on your mobile device that opens the whole world.
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:57.540]   Any other thoughts, Adam, before we let you go?
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:02.620]   No, this is just an incredible experience and looking forward to the rest of it.
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:04.340]   I should say one thing.
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:05.540]   I should say one thing.
[00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:07.580]   Don't expect every Mac world to be like this.
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:09.460]   Yeah, this one was pretty over the top.
[00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:13.500]   I think so in terms of the announcements, but I got to do my dwork moment because we
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:16.660]   have the podcast for meetup on Thursday and everybody's invited to that.
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:18.580]   And there's also a party following that.
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:19.580]   Yes.
[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:22.340]   Being hosted by myself and Deb Shatovitz from Mac petitions.
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:23.340]   And I'll be there.
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:24.340]   And that's cool.
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:25.980]   But all you have to do is wear your Mac world badge.
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:27.980]   We've got light orders and it's a no-host bar.
[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:28.980]   Who's that going to be?
[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:32.940]   It's right at Gillians, which is like right across from where the keynote was.
[00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:35.580]   Do exhibits only badges count?
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:37.380]   Yeah, any Mac world badge.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:38.380]   Sweet.
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:39.380]   And it's just an easy.
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.380]   You got the cheap badge.
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:41.380]   Get up for exhibits only.
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:46.860]   I'm not going to pay a lot for this ex-bow.
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:51.460]   Shane Sweeney, how many hours until quick whip out your laptop?
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:53.620]   Adam, I'm kind of on withdrawals already.
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:58.340]   Adam, Chris, you've seen the Mac cast by Macgeek.
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:01.540]   It's at maccast.com and we'll see you on Thursday.
[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:09.460]   Ladies and gentlemen, 3,422 hours and .09 minutes left until the iPhone comes out.
[00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:12.260]   Shane Sweeney, you rock.
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:13.700]   Now let's get David Pogan here.
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:18.500]   He is, of course, the New York Times columnist who is perhaps one of the most powerful writers
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:22.940]   in the computer industry and just happens to be a little bit of a Mac fan.
[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:23.940]   OK.
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:24.940]   David, good to see you.
[00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:25.940]   Me too.
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:27.940]   How did you get your column done?
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:31.620]   I haven't started it yet, but I've been thinking a lot about it.
[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.660]   Because David said I'll come as soon as I get my column done because he's got a column
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:35.660]   to get out.
[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:36.660]   That's very nice.
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:38.100]   My editor kindly said, hey, we're three hours later here.
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:39.100]   I'm going to bed.
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:40.340]   Just have it waiting for me in the morning.
[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:41.340]   Wow, that's generous.
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:42.780]   What will your column be about?
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:47.740]   Apparently, Apple has some kind of phone.
[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:50.940]   You're the only person I know who's actually touched this thing.
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:54.620]   My friend, I believe I'm the only person outside of Apple who's handled this thing.
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:55.620]   So wait a minute.
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:57.700]   Can I haven't washed the hands yet?
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:53:58.700]   If you'd like to.
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:53:59.700]   Kendra's getting all the time.
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:00.700]   Hey, touch me.
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:01.700]   Please.
[00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:05.900]   I finally, finally figure out how to get women by being a geek.
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:07.900]   I touched the Apple iPhone.
[00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:08.900]   There is it.
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:11.420]   There was an old British song I danced with the guy who danced with the girl who danced
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:12.420]   with the Prince of Wales.
[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:13.420]   Remember that?
[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:14.420]   No.
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:15.420]   Okay.
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:17.060]   I'm not that old.
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:18.060]   Apparently I am.
[00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:19.060]   Yes, you are.
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:20.780]   So tell us all.
[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:25.340]   Well, every year, John Markoff of the New York Times and I are invited in for a meeting
[00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:28.940]   with Mr. Jobs to talk about whatever he just talked about.
[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:33.900]   And in this case, we had an extended session where Markoff asked all the questions and
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:37.580]   I sat in the corner playing with a phone.
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:40.300]   John got the raw end of the deal on that one too.
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:42.460]   So first of all, was Steve in a good mood?
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:43.660]   He was in a great mood.
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:44.660]   He was polite.
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:45.660]   He was excited.
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:46.660]   He was down there.
[00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:50.740]   Because last year he kind of ripped you a little bit.
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:56.820]   You know Markoff actually asked him about the options scandal and Markoff had been concerned
[00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:58.300]   about Steve's reaction.
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:02.260]   But he gave a great answer, which he'll read about in the paper tomorrow.
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:04.620]   And yeah, Jobs is great.
[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:06.580]   And he totally let me play with this thing.
[00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:11.100]   You know, I discovered a ton of things that I'm probably going to forget some of now, but
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:13.180]   that nobody has mentioned because nobody knows.
[00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:16.660]   I've been blogging, the New York Times is a special Mac world blog.
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:17.940]   I don't know if you've seen this.
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.620]   It's on the front page of NY Times.
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:20.980]   That's like, "Wow, that's great."
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:25.900]   And I listed out these 15 things that I discovered that you wouldn't discover unless you handle
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:26.900]   it.
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:30.420]   Like first of all, maybe you guys have already mentioned this, but has anyone noticed that
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:35.100]   all the demonstrations that you've seen and my own demonstration for an hour with this
[00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:37.380]   thing were all using the Wi-Fi.
[00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:39.740]   No one has seen how it does over singular's network.
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:43.340]   I'm guessing it's not going to be, look at his split.
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.820]   But, um, considerably slower, no doubt.
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:46.820]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:48.380]   In fact, that's one of the sad things about going with singular.
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:51.540]   I'm glad that they made a GSM phone, but it isn't the fastest 3G network.
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:52.540]   Well, that's right.
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:58.180]   And he said, you know, HSDP, whatever the hell the next thing is, maybe a year from now
[00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:00.500]   that will be widely deployed enough to make it worthwhile.
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.300]   But right now it just, it would be pointless.
[00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:06.460]   Of course, as a resident of San Francisco, we're going to have Wi-Fi by the end of the
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:07.460]   year, everywhere.
[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:13.380]   Yeah, but that's not HSDP, HDS, no, but you'll have 300 kilobits Wi-Fi.
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:15.780]   I think it's actually G-O-O-G-L-E.
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:19.500]   I made a phone call with it.
[00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:20.500]   Did you?
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:23.740]   Which interestingly, you might have committed a felony.
[00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:27.460]   That has not been approved by the FCC.
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:28.900]   My wife approved it just fine.
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:30.540]   So how did it sound?
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:31.540]   It sounded really great.
[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:32.980]   It sounded perfectly fine.
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:36.180]   I actually checked my voice, my answering machine at home.
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:38.340]   Did your pictures show up on it?
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:41.620]   No, it did not.
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:42.700]   Let's see.
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:45.220]   It is made of four materials.
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:46.780]   The front is glass.
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:49.300]   The silver ring is stainless steel.
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:55.860]   And Jobs said that if you look at it tomorrow behind those glass museum cases, you will see
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:57:01.140]   that the rim, the bezel is rounded to stainless steel.
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:06.300]   It turns in on itself, which according to Jobs, when they looked at the metallurgy textbooks,
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:08.220]   it is impossible.
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:09.220]   It cannot be done.
[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:13.580]   And as I so wiggly added, "Well, Mr. Jobs has never stopped you before."
[00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:18.260]   So he didn't hear me.
[00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:21.060]   So that's stainless steel and then the back is aluminum.
[00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:24.900]   And then the bottom, like fifth of it, is black plastic.
[00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:28.180]   So the signal can get out of the aluminum.
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:32.380]   And then I had a meeting with Phil Schiller, where I got to play with it for another 20
[00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:37.340]   minutes while sort of paying half an ear to him.
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:41.060]   And he pointed out some of those finish things that Apple does so well.
[00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:46.500]   Like one of them is you know there's a little thumb switch on the side for Ringer on and
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:49.180]   off, which is I think every cell phone should have.
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:50.180]   Absolutely.
[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:51.180]   And very few do.
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:52.180]   Like the palm.
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.180]   It's the palm.
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:54.180]   It's only trio.
[00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:58.380]   And what's really cool if you look at it tomorrow, you'll see the only buttons on the
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:04.940]   left edge of this phone are the volume up and down and this Ringer on off switch, which
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:10.700]   when it's on is in a direct line with the volume buttons.
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:14.140]   So you can tell by feeling in your pocket if the Ringer is off.
[00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:15.140]   Very sweet.
[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:16.140]   Because it's in a line with the volume.
[00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:17.140]   It's so intelligent.
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:18.140]   I'm on Twitter.
[00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:22.300]   But that's exactly the kind of thing cell phone companies never do.
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:23.300]   They never buy.
[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:24.700]   Or how about this?
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:28.340]   He pointed out how many phone speaker phones have the speaker on.
[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:30.100]   Scott's got to need a minute.
[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:35.380]   We get to take a break.
[00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:36.380]   He's over excited.
[00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:37.380]   It's okay.
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:38.380]   He'll get better.
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:44.580]   He also pointed out how many smartphones are speaker phones but have the speaker on the
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:45.660]   bottom.
[00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:49.380]   So when the thing is lying on a desk it's awful.
[00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:50.380]   Apple.
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:51.380]   Exactly.
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:52.380]   Thank you.
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:53.380]   You can realize you're a trauma player.
[00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:54.380]   It's my specialty.
[00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:55.380]   Yes.
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:59:01.140]   This one has the speaker shooting out the bottom at you when it's on the table.
[00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:02.300]   Is it near that home button?
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:03.300]   Is that with the screen?
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:05.660]   No, no, it's on the bottom where the my pocket is.
[00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:06.660]   Oh, I see.
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:07.820]   So if it's sitting flat, I get it.
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:09.140]   It's speaking at you.
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:10.140]   Great.
[00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:12.500]   I also tried the camera, which nobody's talked about at all.
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:13.500]   He never demoed it.
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:14.740]   He never demoed it.
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:20.420]   And he should have because you know what, have you ever had a digital camera with a 3.5 inch
[00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:21.420]   screen?
[00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:25.180]   I think there's only two models like that and both of them require a moving van.
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:27.100]   You know, they're huge.
[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:31.580]   You, this thing is like taking a picture with the developed drugstore print.
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:32.580]   That's how big it is.
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:33.580]   It's huge.
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:34.580]   It's so close.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:35.580]   That's really nice.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:37.020]   Looking out a window at your subject.
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:38.020]   Right.
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:40.340]   Did you hammer out exactly how many pixels by how many pixels that screen is?
[00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:41.340]   I counted them.
[00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:43.380]   One by one.
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:45.500]   And that's why the New York Times is where they are.
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:46.500]   Thank you very much.
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:47.500]   It's true.
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:50.580]   No, it's two megapixels.
[00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:53.660]   And by the way, this was an interesting little exchange.
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:55.660]   I was taking pictures around the room.
[00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:59.820]   Oh, the singular guy, the CEO was there with us as well.
[00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:00.900]   I have to tell you one for it.
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:02.460]   I know I'm like eating up everybody's.
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:03.460]   No, no, no.
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:04.460]   We want to hear.
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:05.460]   You got the inside track.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:06.460]   All right.
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:10.380]   Well, anyway, so, and I thought the refresh rate of the LCD was just fine.
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:13.220]   You know, the same as any normal's camera phone.
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:17.940]   But jobs was very quick to apologize for it and say, by the way, this is so pre-release.
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:19.700]   We have a lot of optimizing to do.
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.220]   It's going to be really, really live refresh.
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:24.420]   Are they going to do video?
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:25.420]   I don't think it does video.
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:26.420]   How interesting.
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:27.420]   It's kind of surprising.
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:28.420]   I wonder why I'm not.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:31.420]   But I have to say, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:37.940]   Listen, listen, this thing is so pre-release that there were some programs on there that
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:38.940]   are just JPEGs.
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:45.220]   It's like a Western town or the International Saloon behind the front.
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:46.220]   Exactly.
[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:48.740]   There's six months away.
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:49.740]   It's June.
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:51.140]   It's a long time off.
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:53.660]   And by the way, did you know it reads PDF documents?
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:54.660]   All right.
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:55.660]   All right.
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:56.660]   See?
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:57.660]   Thank you.
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:59.980]   David, did you get any sense of what we were talking about before you came in?
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:02.620]   Wait, just to finish my thought before I forget it.
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.620]   Yeah, please.
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.980]   So there's a long list of things that Markoff and I asked them.
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:07.820]   Does it do voice memos?
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:10.820]   Can you make your own ringtones out of your iTunes songs?
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:11.820]   Whole bunch of questions.
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:12.820]   Voice activation.
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:13.820]   I'd like to be able to make voice calls.
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:14.820]   I bet you would.
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:15.820]   Speech recognition.
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:16.820]   You will.
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:21.260]   And so in the answers to all of these was, we're working on it probably.
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:22.260]   We don't know yet.
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:23.260]   So it's really, really early.
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:24.260]   So I didn't know about video.
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:25.260]   Who knows?
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:26.260]   And yeah, it felt very responsive.
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:28.820]   I mean, it seems like it's a fast processor in there.
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:29.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:30.820]   Oh, and you wouldn't say what the processor is.
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:31.820]   We asked him.
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:32.820]   It's a trick.
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:33.820]   Still, he won't say.
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:35.900]   No, he said it was part of our secret sauce.
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:36.900]   TM.
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:37.900]   Wow.
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:38.900]   Part of the 200 pounds.
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:39.900]   Yeah, you can keep that to himself.
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:43.580]   The thing that we talked about before you came in is how a lot of the real hardcore application
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:47.980]   nerds are very excited about the idea of having OS 10 running on this device.
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:52.220]   And we were curious, did you get any sense that you play with any of the applications,
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:53.220]   Safari, et cetera?
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:57.420]   And did you get any sense of will you be able to take other applications, other kinds of
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.060]   information outside of these?
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.060]   I X apps.
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:02.820]   I played with all of the applications.
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:03.820]   Every single one.
[01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:07.260]   Did you just sort of say, I am so incredibly jealous of you right now that it's not even
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:08.260]   funny.
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:09.260]   I know.
[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:10.260]   But you know what's so funny?
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:11.260]   I have to say this.
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.260]   You know, I'm a cool guy.
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:13.260]   It doesn't.
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:17.020]   Because Apple totally ignored me before I got the job of the New York Times.
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:20.020]   And they will totally ignore me again when I leave the New York Times.
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:22.860]   It's just the byline folks.
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:24.300]   You'd get this treatment too.
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:25.300]   What's that?
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:26.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:27.300]   How is the keyboard?
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:29.780]   So listen, this is not a blackberry killer.
[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:31.620]   I found typing to be very difficult.
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:34.580]   You can't obviously do it without looking.
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:39.460]   And you know, my big fat finger, I kept missing the little keys.
[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:42.260]   Now jobs was very fast at it, as you saw in the demo.
[01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:44.220]   I had a lot of trouble inputting text.
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:50.580]   However, I made tons of typos, but something he barely glossed over was the auto correction.
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:52.140]   So it's pretty new.
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.300]   It's predictive like a T9.
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:54.300]   It's not T9.
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:55.300]   It's not predictive.
[01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:56.300]   It's something new.
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:58.500]   It's not even the little blackberry 7100 thing.
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:04.580]   It's totally new where it studies what keys were near the one that you probably meant
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:08.900]   to get and substitutes the proper letter once it realizes that.
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:09.900]   It's like a Newton?
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:10.900]   It learns your faults.
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:17.500]   I don't know if it learns it, but I will say that I wrote a couple of emails and it
[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:24.420]   got 100% of the English words right despite my missing the keys I meant to hit.
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:28.340]   So if you look at the demo on the web, you'll see the word you're typing.
[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:32.460]   And then underneath it in blue is a little box correctly spelled word.
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:36.780]   And if that's correct, you hit the space bar and it puts that one in instead of your
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:37.780]   messed up.
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:38.780]   I'm not even with my regular.
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:39.780]   I totally went that everywhere.
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:43.900]   I want an algorithm to follow me around with a little dust bin picking up after me.
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.740]   No, you know what you want on your regular PC?
[01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.340]   You want this touch web browser.
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:51.260]   This thing did not get enough shrift.
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.020]   It was amazing.
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:57.180]   So you understand that it puts the entire web page on the screen tiny, right?
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:58.700]   You don't have to shout these microphones.
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:03:59.700]   Oh, okay.
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:00.700]   Sorry, sorry.
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:02.260]   He's a little excited, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:03.260]   I'm getting there.
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:04.260]   Okay.
[01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:05.260]   Well, like the headphones are too loud.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:06.260]   Oh, I can turn them down.
[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:08.660]   I got an amazing thing here called a knob.
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:10.860]   Oh, like, no, I think it's a little cold.
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:11.860]   I'll just turn it down.
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:12.860]   David and knob.
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:13.860]   Okay, so anyway, then you.
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:14.860]   Oh, okay.
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:17.060]   Okay, so actually, I think I better off that.
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:18.060]   Okay.
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:22.420]   So, but then you use your fingers as you showed to zoom in or zoom out, like it's a sheet
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:23.420]   of rubber.
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:29.420]   So you double tap to double the size or you can just go to any percentage scale by dragging
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:31.540]   your fingers apart or together to zoom in or out.
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:35.340]   So what you wind up doing, you can't see me on the radio, but you do like this.
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:40.100]   You put in the URL and by the way, there's a dedicated .com button on the screen.
[01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:41.100]   So I have to do it.
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.100]   Oh, man.
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.100]   And .com and you're there.
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:44.100]   Thank you.
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:45.100]   My idea.
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:46.100]   Thank you very much.
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.100]   What about the .com X button?
[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:48.940]   Have they got that yet?
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:50.700]   Up comes the entire page.
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:52.060]   You see all the articles, the pictures.
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.300]   You tap the one you're looking at.
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.300]   Now it's full readable size.
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:05:00.140]   If it just doesn't quite fit, you drag your fingers a little bit, it scales in real time.
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:01.140]   Unbelievable.
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.140]   Wow.
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:04.380]   I just like that pinch stuff.
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:05.380]   I want more of that pinch stuff.
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:06.380]   Don't you love that?
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:08.020]   Have you seen that before?
[01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:09.020]   Yes.
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:10.020]   At TED, the TED talks.
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:12.500]   That's how Jeffrey Han has been demonstrating that for a year and a half.
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:13.500]   So did you ask us, Steven?
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:14.500]   I did.
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.660]   And I said, do you buy any chance of who Jeff Han is?
[01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:20.140]   And he's like, I don't know why.
[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:23.860]   Because should I have him killed?
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:28.220]   So I basically said he's been demonstrating this on a big screen, the exact same gestures
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:30.620]   with photos and two fingers, the exact same way.
[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:32.660]   And he said, well, let's just put it this way.
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.340]   This has been a development for two and a half years.
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:36.340]   OK.
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:38.500]   Must be one of those two and a half patents.
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.500]   Two and a half patents.
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.500]   Two and a patents.
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:41.500]   Wow.
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:42.500]   Well, it's exciting.
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.500]   I'm glad to talk to somebody who's actually touched this.
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.780]   Can I tell you my last story?
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:46.780]   Yes.
[01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:47.780]   All right.
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:48.780]   This is from the singular guy.
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:49.780]   So I asked the singular guy.
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:51.260]   You actually talked to that guy.
[01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:52.740]   Was he kind of all alone in the corner?
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:53.740]   Like nobody will talk to him.
[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:55.740]   Yeah, I asked him, because he pulled out these index cards?
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:56.740]   That's so mean.
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:57.740]   That's just me, Dave.
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:05:58.740]   That was me.
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:05:59.740]   But anyway, so I'm glad to talk to you.
[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:02.740]   That was me, Dave.
[01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:08.260]   But anyway, I asked him if singular had to adopt new secrecy policies, because I'm sure
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.460]   they'd never had a project this secret before.
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:11.460]   Like, apples were so secret.
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:13.060]   And he said, oh my gosh, totally.
[01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:17.860]   They had never done anything so secret to the extent that every single engineering team
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:19.860]   was just given a piece of it.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:20.860]   Wow.
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:24.420]   So there was one that did the software, one that did the voicemail, one that did the network.
[01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:27.220]   And no one knew what the greater picture was.
[01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:31.540]   It was like, did you ever see the old Miley Python skit where the British come up with
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:34.300]   a joke that's so funny, you die laughing?
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:38.660]   So they use it in World War II against the Germans by teaching each soldier one phrase
[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:39.660]   in German.
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:41.620]   And so that no one ever hears the whole joke.
[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:42.540]   Well, it was like that.
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:51.420]   So in fact, Apple, Jobs told me that Apple even wrote a bogus user interface and gave
[01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:54.100]   that to these singular guys to work on it.
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:56.660]   So they had no idea what it would finally look like.
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:58.540]   It was a, I would love to see that one.
[01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:01.660]   It is amazing that they could work for two and a half years on a product like this and
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.660]   no, nobody knew.
[01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:05.940]   No, but Apple has that whole process mastered.
[01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:06.940]   I have to say.
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:10.020]   He said the same thing at Apple, by the way, that even at Apple they worked on sections
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:14.100]   that no one hardly anyone at Apple knew the whole picture.
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:20.140]   But the singular guy, the singular CEO never saw the gadget until like yesterday.
[01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:21.140]   Wow.
[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:24.020]   It was probably a good idea, you know, given his performance.
[01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:25.020]   They didn't let him see it.
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:26.420]   Not let him have it.
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:27.420]   It's great to see you.
[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:28.660]   I'm going to let you get to your column.
[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:31.860]   But if you'd like a beer or pizza, please stick around.
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:32.860]   Thank you very much.
[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:35.500]   David Polk's the greatest New York Times columnist.
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:40.420]   I'll see you on the cruise and don't forget if you're at the Mac world on Thursday.
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:42.340]   What are you doing Mac world live?
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:43.340]   Oh, tomorrow morning.
[01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:44.340]   Tomorrow, okay.
[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:46.780]   It's a talk show, David Letterman style.
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:47.780]   Really fun.
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:51.140]   Andrew, some cool guests and I'm going to do, I'll give you a sneak preview.
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:52.140]   Yes.
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:54.140]   You've just been sued by the RIAA.
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:56.940]   It's all you're going to get to talk.
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:58.780]   David Polk, yeah.
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:07:59.780]   Thank you, David.
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:04.700]   There's so many new Apple and Singular got together to build a car, what that would
[01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:05.700]   look like.
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:09.780]   It's like you work on the tire, you work on the windshield wipers.
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:12.460]   It's kind of amazing to think of the degree that they went to.
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:15.100]   If you've ever had to, I mean, if you've ever, most of you guys have probably done web
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:19.500]   development at one point or another and just like trying to get a website live in a way
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:22.540]   that it doesn't fall apart is an amazing thing in its own.
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:26.020]   We just, we just, we sat around the office just operationally thinking about what must
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:28.980]   be involved and getting all these pieces to work together.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:32.220]   Especially given when no one has to, no one gets to see the whole picture, which is something
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:33.220]   that Apple does pretty commonly.
[01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:35.740]   There's probably a very limited number of people who had access to making every piece
[01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:38.820]   to knowing, you know, to be the connected thing between each of these.
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:39.820]   And they have to admit after doing it.
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:40.820]   And they're probably dead right now.
[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:41.980]   They probably kill every one of them.
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:42.980]   Yes, I kill every one of them.
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:47.060]   But I have to admit, after dealing with a lot of different departments at Apple, what
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:51.220]   I find interesting is that I probably know more about what's going to come out than any
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:55.020]   one of them when you're talking to them because not only do they not know what else is going
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:58.780]   on, they're not interested because it's their job or somebody else's job or whatever.
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:08:59.780]   So they don't even want to know.
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:01.340]   The less I know the better.
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:02.340]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:03.340]   Exactly.
[01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:04.340]   Exactly.
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.340]   I want to wrap this up.
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.340]   We have a lot of people to thank.
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:07.460]   It's been really a great time.
[01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:09.020]   We have a bunch of things to give away.
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:10.020]   So don't leave.
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:16.620]   In fact, the folks who do the etching, the etching folks, the etching folks that they're
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:17.620]   giving away, they were here.
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:18.620]   They were here.
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:19.620]   They were here.
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:20.620]   We're going to give away.
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:21.620]   And you can't have this.
[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:27.580]   They're going to give away to somebody here, a free iPhone etching.
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.340]   So once you get your iPhone, you can get it out for you.
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:32.220]   We also thank MStation because we have a--
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:33.220]   Oh, we got this.
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:37.620]   We have some of these in the office.
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:40.900]   These are the MStation orbs.
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:42.380]   And Scott, did you like your MStation orbs?
[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:43.620]   I have to say thank you.
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:45.820]   Alex got me one of these and I hooked it up.
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:51.380]   And it's just this little tiny ball, but it has a remote and it sounds amazing.
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:52.900]   You can be anywhere in the house.
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:54.820]   You click this thing, your iPod works.
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:55.980]   It's also a charger.
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:57.540]   I don't know what they cost, but whatever it is.
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.100]   It's like $129.
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:01.100]   It's like $129.
[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:04.660]   Actually, I played with it today and that's $170 less than the boat.
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:05.660]   And I have to say, I have the--
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:06.660]   It sounds great.
[01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:11.940]   I have the-- one of the reasons I asked for one that we can give away is I have the tower.
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:12.940]   You've seen the tower.
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:13.940]   The tower is awesome.
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:14.940]   I was there when you had packed it.
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:15.940]   I feel like a slightly--
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:16.940]   I love the tower.
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:19.940]   It was like-- the MStation tower is my new stereo.
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:20.940]   Oh my god.
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:21.940]   It's like the iPhone tower.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:22.940]   It is so good.
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:26.780]   It's huge, but it sounds so clean and so clear.
[01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:27.780]   And it's like $300.
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:28.780]   Very reasonable.
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:30.980]   Do you think it sounds better than the Apple WIPOT speakers?
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:31.980]   Oh, yes, definitely.
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:34.220]   I have both in my office.
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:38.060]   I have the Hi-Fi and the MStation tower and the tower is much better.
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.540]   We also be giving away copies of JPG Magazine.
[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:42.300]   Thanks to Jason D'Filippo, who stopped by.
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:43.700]   Yeah, this is a terrific magazine.
[01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:46.380]   Our friends Derek Pozak and Heather Champ.
[01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:48.340]   Everybody knows Heather from Flickr.
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:53.140]   Derek and Heather, they put out this wonderful magazine called JPG with user contributed photos.
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:55.140]   It is a beautiful, wonderfully done magazine.
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:56.980]   We're going to have to figure out how we're going to do all this.
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:58.980]   I think people should have to fight each other.
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:10:59.980]   All right.
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:01.780]   And then you look with John Foster brought us.
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:07.180]   These are-- you know how Apple puts the decals in the box when you buy a new computer?
[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:08.660]   This must have been from an Apple II.
[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.180]   This isn't-- it is from an Apple II.
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:13.180]   This is the old rainbow Mac with the old typeface.
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:16.620]   And I think it's appropriate to give away because it says Apple Computer.
[01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:19.700]   It's close to the end of the air because it's no longer Apple's computer.
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:20.700]   It's Apple Inc.
[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:21.700]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:22.700]   So that's going to be--
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:24.700]   I think these young girls were alive when these were printed.
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:25.700]   Oh, don't even say that.
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:26.700]   Oh, we've got that.
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:27.700]   Oh, my God.
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:28.700]   I remember that logo.
[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:29.700]   I remember that logo.
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:31.340]   I have bash sessions that are older than you.
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:33.980]   I remember that logo from the history books.
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:34.980]   All right.
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:38.300]   Oh, the Unix keeps like you.
[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:41.420]   You just got-- how many hours, Jason-- I mean, Shane Sweeney.
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:43.060]   How many hours till the--
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:44.060]   Iphone, Mozart.
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:45.060]   One of the things--
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:48.860]   John Kellogg from the Dolby Labs for making us come to you--
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:56.340]   Three thousand four hundred and twenty one five seven hours.
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:12:00.260]   Thanks to Dolby Labs and John Kellogg for making this in Dolby Headphone.
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:02.140]   What an amazing-- I want to do this more.
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:03.980]   I've always cared for the beginning.
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:06.020]   I said we should do this in Dublin.
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:08.420]   It would be so much better if you did it in Dublin.
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:09.780]   It would have sold.
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:13.020]   And also thanks to the market, the unicorn folks who brought us a bunch of equipment
[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:17.860]   of course, the 21st Amendment here in San Francisco for hosting us.
[01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:19.140]   It has been a great event.
[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:25.900]   And thanks so much to all of you for coming here for Merlin and Scott and Alex and Kendra
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:28.740]   and Justine and John Foster and Craig.
[01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:29.740]   And we didn't get to talk to Terrick.
[01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:30.740]   There's so many people here.
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:31.740]   Steve Steclow from the Wall Street Journal.
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:33.460]   There's so many people I'd like to talk to.
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:35.540]   But really, we've got to run because we're out of time.
[01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:36.540]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:38.180]   We'll see you next time on Mac Break Week.
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:41.020]   [CHEERING]
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:43.020]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:45.020]   [CHEERING]
[01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:47.020]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:49.020]   [CHEERING]
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:51.020]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
