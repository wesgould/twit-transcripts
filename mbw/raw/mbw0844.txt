[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Andy, Alex and Jason. They're all here. We'll talk about
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:14.240]   the class action suit, about privacy with Apple. Gizmodo had a very revealing story.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.880]   Is Apple taking app privacy seriously for its own apps? Were green bubbles designed to look
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.640]   gross and speak in a gross? It's Steve Jobs' Birkenstocks. All that and more coming up next.

[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.560]   show we cover the latest news from Apple. Jason is here Mr. Snell from 6colors.com. Hello Jason.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.800]   Hello Leo. It's good to hear your voice and be on Macbreak Weekly again. Another week is in the
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.120]   can. No wait we say that we haven't been trying to get this to work for half an hour. How about that?
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.120]   Nope we are fresh and ready to go and full warmed up.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.600]   Fresh is Daisy. No one is frustrated. No one. Also Andy Inaco from WGBH Boston.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.480]   Yes we're just like 10s or if not hundreds of thousands of people in two weeks time who
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.960]   bought an instant pot on an Amazon sale and are now looking at this thing and saying
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.600]   how the hell do I make this work and why did I choose I have this?
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:56.720]   It's kind of like that. Sure. Sure it's just like that. Alex Lindsey. Mr. Alex Lindsey from
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.040]   Office Hours. Hello. Hello Alex. Hello. Good to have you all. Big story of the week.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:12.240]   Started with Gizmodo. Gizmodo last week quoting some researchers at a company called MISC.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:21.200]   Not myth. M-Y-S-K. They found that the Apple App Store sends Apple exhaustive information
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.280]   about nearly everything a user does in the app even if you have disabled sharing of device analytics
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.720]   all together in the privacy setting iPhone analytics. Furthermore, so does Apple Music,
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:44.240]   Apple TV, books and stocks but for some reason some other Apple apps do not.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:56.960]   Now as a result on Thursday a class action was filed in a federal court in California saying
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:07.200]   they violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act. In the lawsuit the plaintiff said Apple's
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:17.360]   privacy guarantees are completely illusory. Now I want to say maybe Apple made a mistake.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.440]   We have we heard from Apple Jason. Has Apple responded this in any way? I believe so. I don't
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:29.040]   think I've said a word. Health and wallet did not collect analytics which you would expect
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.920]   for privacy which implies to me that Apple did do this on purpose. Apple Music, Apple TV, books,
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.760]   the iTunes Store, stocks even. Stocks shared your list. Wait a minute. When I read this I'm thinking
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.120]   this is not part of the functionality. Stock shares your list of watch stocks, the names of stocks
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.360]   you viewed or searched for, the timestamps of when you did it as well as a record of any news articles
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.120]   you saw in the app. But since the app is saving all that information to the servers so that you
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.960]   can have the same information on your other Apple devices maybe that's just part of the functionality.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:13.680]   What do you think Andy? That's the difficulty when you paint yourself as a privacy absolutist,
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.160]   when you paint yourself as being the only people who really care about this in this cold hearted
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.120]   industry. Even when you do something that might be quite, we don't know yet but it might be quite
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.360]   innocent. It might be just as you say we're we're retaining this information so that we can give
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.480]   you a better experience as you keep using the app. But the thing is you said that you weren't,
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.160]   you gave us the impression that you're not collecting any information. You're not saving any information.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.520]   You now we have to ask are you creating a profile of us and are you collecting information for
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.480]   your own benefit? You're just not willing to sell advertising based on that stuff yet? You're just
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.640]   using it to help sell Apple products and Apple services. So there's Apple needs to come up with
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.880]   a statement about this. We need to find out what they're doing. As you say, it's still early days.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.120]   It's possible that this was even big companies do make mistakes. I do believe Apple's sincerity
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.360]   when it comes to privacy. But this is this this would be like almost a non-story on every other
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.480]   company with Apple. It's like, oh dude, but you promised us and you promised us and you promised us.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.240]   You totally expect this on an Android phone. That's not that would be a shock at all.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.800]   The app store and this I think it also because it comes on the heels of Apple adding advertising
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.640]   to the app store has raised even more kind of concern about this. According to Misk, the app store
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.400]   appeared to harvest information about everything you did in real time, including what you tapped on,
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.160]   sent back to the server, which apps you searched for, sent back to the server,
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.840]   which ads you saw, of course, they'd need to keep track of that. How long you looked at a given app
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:52.720]   and how you find it. But it also sent information about your device ID numbers, the kind of phone
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.440]   you're using, your screen resolution, your keyboard languages, how you're connected to the internet.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.440]   Again, all of these things browser sent back some of this information because that's part of
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.000]   rendering a page. Yeah. Yeah. And also a fingerprint. Right.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.960]   Right. Because it means that even if you're even if you're doing something to say, hey,
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.240]   specifically do not use these tracking tags, I'm specifically also using plugins that make sure
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.320]   that you can't transmit through information. Fingerprinting of here is the combination of apps
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.400]   that are installed on the device, configure screen size, other things like that. It can
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.960]   basically figure out who you are based on that. Again, common stuff that we're sort of resigned to
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.640]   on other platforms, but we're not we're just not we just don't have our defenses up when it comes
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.840]   to Apple. Look, I mean, there's there's a lot going on here. I mean, obviously,
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.120]   some of this stuff is a bit much, right? This is obviously a coordinated effort by these the
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.480]   researchers and the guy who's filing the lawsuit in gizmodo. There is truth here, and there's also
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.880]   kind of like a narrative going on here. Apple knows all sorts of things about you. It's the platform
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:58.000]   owner. You're probably logged in with an Apple ID. You can only buy software from them. So they
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.760]   know an awful lot about you. Also, a lot of the stuff that got breathlessly described here.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.920]   This is app analytics. Right. Every app has the ability to say what button you press,
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.880]   and they use that information or they throw it away. The problem is not just Apple's reputation,
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:19.600]   but that they have an option for you to opt out of collecting sort of like the telemetry data
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.800]   in Apple's apps. And it isn't being honored here. And I think that is the killer right now.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.640]   And I have I don't think this is a conspiracy. I think one of two things happened here. One is,
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:37.040]   it's a bug, and maybe they don't care, but it's a bug where somebody maybe somebody realized maybe
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:44.320]   didn't, but that switch doesn't work. Or two, it's something that's sort of lazy. And this technology
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.680]   is it's transmitting regardless of that switch. And then maybe they even throw it away, but it's
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.400]   transmitting it, in which case they need to not do that. Right. That's not a good option.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:02.000]   And I think that what we're allowed to check and say we don't want to do is take that data and
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.080]   give it to a third party, or track us around. I think that if you're on Facebook or TikTok,
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:14.560]   they can still collect all of those, all that information for themselves, still within the
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.760]   platform. So I don't think of that. The first party we've always talked about this.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.400]   The first party still has it. It's worth clarifying. First party information,
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:30.960]   whether it's Facebook, TikTok, Apple, Google, not Facebook isn't selling information about Alex
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:37.760]   Lindsey to anybody who wants to know. That's in fact, that's one of the most valuable things they
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:44.320]   have. They sell aggregate information. Advertisers, they say, well, you want users in Marin County
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.600]   between the age of 25 and 55, then you would fall in that pile. But they don't say, here's,
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.800]   let me tell you all about Alex Lindsey. But they may know it because that's first party information.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.480]   The thing is Apple has a switch and Misk said, opting out or switching the personalization options
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.640]   off did not reduce the amount of detail analytics the app was sending. Again, he doesn't know what
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:10.880]   Apple's saving, but the app is sending. He switched all possible options off personalized ads,
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:16.800]   personalized recommendations, sharing usage data and analytics. We're all switched off.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:23.280]   Yeah, it is really important to that is tangential to those a little bit, but I think it is super
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.200]   important, which is when Apple talks about how tracking is bad, they absolutely do mean other
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.520]   people. Third party, yeah. Yeah, because they're the platform owner and they track you. They absolutely
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:37.200]   do. Your app store purchases are tracked by them. They know everything about you and they can use
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.760]   that information. What they will say is, yes, but we don't share it with anybody. People can,
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:47.040]   people can maybe ask us to target you, but we're not going to tell them who you are.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:52.160]   We keep that information to ourselves. We anonymize it in certain ways. They make all those claims,
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:58.320]   but it's not that Apple doesn't know about you. It's what Apple does with it. In this case, again,
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:05.600]   is there any scenario where Apple leaks this sort of information and then uses it
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.840]   nefariously while it's saying that it's got a setting and that it's not? I just can't see it.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:17.600]   This is so damaging to their entire premise if it's not just a bug or somebody,
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:24.160]   like a bug or somebody who, like I said, is lazy and it's like, well, if we don't use the
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.920]   information that's transmitted to us and we throw it away, then that's just as good. I would argue,
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.840]   no, it's not. Yeah. By the way, there's somewhat evidence that they don't,
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.600]   that they were collecting it and they weren't throwing it away. For instance, with the stocks app,
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:45.600]   the information was sent to stocks dash analytics dash events dot apple dot com slash analytics
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:51.520]   events v2 slash async. That transmission was separate from the iCloud communication necessary
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:57.040]   to sync your data across devices. Right. But it's not that you could opt out of.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.760]   And if the switch doesn't work, then or doesn't work in certain apps as an honored and certain
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.320]   apps, then you would get that you would get the app analytics being set back. It doesn't really
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:11.520]   change the fact that they have a switch and the switch isn't working. And that is a, that's a huge
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.320]   mistake. Apple did this came out a week ago. Apple has not responded is also a problem.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:23.120]   Well, I think it suggests something organizationally about how they were completely caught
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:30.400]   unawares of this and are like, why is this happening? I don't want to be that person who gets woken up
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.160]   in the middle of the night about this thing. Because it's like, I think they're trying to get to them.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:40.080]   For them to have no answer strikes me as being we need to get to the bottom of it.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.240]   We don't even understand what's happening here. Right. And it could be, it could be a cloud service
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.960]   issue, you know, where you're trying to make sure that all these devices are gotten together. It
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.800]   seems like it's way more data than you need to do that. But it could be something of how to keep
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.360]   on improving that. But it might be a shortcut that someone took to say, well, we'll take all this
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.520]   data. It makes it easier for us to make the experience more fluid, but didn't really talk to
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.840]   everybody involved at Apple. Like, that's my guess of why we didn't hear anything is because
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:10.800]   that someone there is someone from probably pretty high up went, what the, you know, and
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.960]   and so everyone's like, whoo, you know, and everyone's trying to keep their job now. So,
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.960]   so I have a feeling that that it probably the fact that Apple didn't respond. And you know,
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.720]   they would have explained it in a day or two if they could. So I think that there's, I think
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.120]   someone might have gone, I wouldn't say rogue, I would say they just thought that this would be
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.280]   the easiest way to produce something. And they didn't really think it all the way through.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.840]   The, by the way, you may be saying, well, how could they even know what they're sending?
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.640]   And, and this may be this methodology is problematic as well. They had to jailbreak
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:48.560]   an iPhone running iOS 14.6 because that traffic is, is encrypted. Apple at least protects your
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.400]   privacy to that degree. It's encrypted as it's going to the Apple servers. So they had to jail
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:58.080]   break it so they could decrypt the traffic. Then they tried the same thing on iOS 16. That
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:03.120]   traffic is now encrypted, not jailbroken. But they said it was it was the data was transmitted
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.320]   at the same time under the same circumstances. Turning switches off and on didn't make any
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.120]   difference. They couldn't say what was being sent because they couldn't see it. So it's
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:18.880]   conceivable that the jailbreak or maybe it was broken and iOS 14 and it's fixed in 16.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.680]   That we could be, we don't know. That's a methodology gap.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.400]   And, but it also points out that this is, this is the problem of lockdown systems,
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.640]   proprietary systems. There needs to be some way for outside parties to audit what's
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.200]   happening on the device. Otherwise, you really just have the, the makers of word for it or the,
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:41.280]   and their PR for it. And we need to have analysts have the ability to take a look at all the
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.280]   unencrypted traffic that comes off the phone. Now, it can not necessarily voluntarily with help
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.320]   from Apple, but without these tools, we would not find out that, hey, it turns out that Apple is
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.440]   collecting information about this, about a certain app because it wants to build again,
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.600]   one possibility there. They're trying to build a new VR, a VR strategy and they're trying to
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.320]   figure out how people interact with data on a granular level so that they can articulate that
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:09.120]   in a 3D space in a much better way, but in a way in which they don't, the user doesn't know that
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:14.400]   this data is being collected or disseminated. So this is why, I mean, jail, jailbreaking not only
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:20.320]   discovers new vulnerabilities in a phone that bad people can exploit, but it also allows the,
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.680]   some light to be shined into that black box that I think everybody needs to have.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:29.360]   Apple, as we've mentioned before, has a unique definition for tracking.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:35.840]   And their privacy policy. I did not track that woman. Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:41.600]   And their privacy policy, they say Apple's advertising platform does not track you,
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:48.320]   meaning it does not link user or device data collected from our apps with user or device data
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:54.080]   collected from third parties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:16:02.000]   And does not share user or device data with data brokers. So yes, no, we track you, but we don't,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.400]   we don't correlate it with data from other third parties, nor do we sell it to third parties.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:13.280]   But so their definition of track is not, I mean, they're tracking.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:20.400]   And as Jason says, a lot of this is really benign. Using examples with Google, they often do A/B
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:24.960]   testing without people knowing it that, what if we move this, what if we move this Gmail button
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:30.160]   from here to here, will people engage with it more thoughtfully and more, more directly?
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:35.200]   So a lot of this is actually pro user, but it really is all about openness with the user to
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.000]   make sure that they know exactly what's happening on this device that they've spent a thousand
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.200]   dollars for. Should also point out that MISC did the same tests with Google Chrome and Microsoft
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:49.520]   Edge. And in both cases, when you turn analytics settings off, they're off and no data is sent.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.800]   Oh, that's bad PR.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:17:01.840]   And that kind of thing is why we haven't heard from Apple because I get the sense we're,
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:07.120]   what we're going to get from them is one of these. All right, we need to give you full disclosure
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:11.360]   about what went on here and why it went on and why it was a mistake. Like they can't just say,
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.440]   they can't just say, no, no, no, it's a bug that's been there for two years that we haven't fixed.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.440]   They actually, at this point, this seems to have reached the level where they're going to need
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:25.120]   to do the full mea culpa of like, we didn't intend to do this. Here's why it happened.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.120]   Here's the subsystem affected. And here's our plan about how we're going to fix it.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.880]   And that takes more time because yeah, it's gone beyond the very simple like ads, nothing.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:41.600]   And here's the 100 million dollars to the to the books that we're lucky enough to file this
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.520]   lawsuit and all of you are going to get 10 cents.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.480]   Yeah. So yeah, I mean, look, Google just paid almost half a billion dollars.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:49.760]   Right.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.880]   In, you know, fines to states for privacy violations.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.400]   Well, and I think we're going to continue to see this. I mean, I think that people have
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.960]   have become increasingly sensitive to it. And with the GDPR and with the California laws,
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.120]   I think you're going to see more and more of, you know, for a lot of the larger corporations
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.880]   that I work with, no one wants to touch PII. But they're just like, you know, they're just like,
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.200]   whoa, let's not do that because they just see it as a liability. And I think we're going to see
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:21.360]   more and more organizations think of people's personal information as a liability as opposed
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.320]   to a resource.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:28.080]   It was very similar. Google said that, you know, they have a switch turn off location tracking
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:35.200]   and 40 states sued saying, hey, when you turn off location tracking, it doesn't turn it off.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:44.320]   Google settled on Monday for 392 million dollars. So that, you know, that's also showing you the
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.320]   stakes here. You know, this is this is a big deal. And that's just for one thing,
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:54.320]   turning off location data, right? And California has some very strong personal information laws
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.080]   now that it didn't have before. And so that lawsuit being filed in California,
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:02.560]   that is a knowledgeable person who is going to be able to take advantage of California's laws
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:09.600]   about this, whether it goes anywhere. I mean, it's a lawsuit, right? Like, who knows about that.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.480]   But I think the bigger issue here is, why is this happening? And like, if I turn that off,
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:19.680]   I want it off. And on top of that, just I think what we're doing right now,
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.480]   the big picture is you got to educate people like even no tracking is, you know, no tracking
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:29.280]   doesn't necessarily mean no tracking. Commitment to no third party tracking doesn't mean that it's
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:34.160]   not a commitment to, you know, first party tracking. Like everybody needs to be more aware of that
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.960]   information that's out there. And we're all gradually becoming aware of it.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.720]   I think so. Yeah. But along with the awareness comes a touchiness.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:47.040]   And it was to take it a chord that it's the Google situation is almost exactly analogous.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:52.080]   It was in 2018, Associated Press reported that Google tracked users even when they opted out,
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:59.520]   lawsuits from 40 states. Now here we are four years later, Google's paying $492 million.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.000]   I think Apple's probably in a very similar boat at this point.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:10.640]   And even if it is true, what Alex says that everyone at best, maybe you'll get like an 18 cent credit
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:17.120]   for the iTunes store on certain, on certain select music titles. But nonetheless, a that is a big
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:23.280]   check that any company has to write. And B that puts that puts another black mark on their,
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:28.960]   on their reputation and also brings them to the attention of companies like the FTC,
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.960]   which can start saying, guess what? You're going to negotiate with us on a consent degree that you're
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.800]   going to have to prove to us now that when you say what you say about privacy and the efficacy
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.960]   of your products, you can actually deliver on it. And if you violate this consent degree,
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.200]   we can basically put a Facebook camera on you that you are not going to like one tiny bit.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:51.200]   Yeah. And I think that I didn't mean a bit belittle that too. We're all going to get tensed.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.720]   No, no, I didn't think. I understand.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.000]   Tort, tort laws are very important. They probably have made as much of a difference as regular
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.200]   laws, you know, tort, you know, tort cases, because they they go into a civil area where there's
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:08.960]   different sets of rules and allows people to create pain for something, you know, real,
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:13.280]   a real need to change for companies. And so I definitely think it's fine. I think it's fine.
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:17.520]   I think it's serves a very good, it serves a very good use. I just wanted to manage everybody's
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.200]   expectations that none of us. Absolutely.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:19.600]   Absolutely.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:24.080]   Retire on it. But I do think that that that that the tort action is really put my
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:29.600]   well in a class action could be my father's of tort lawyer. Yeah. Like I, I, there's some money
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.920]   on that. Yeah. But then also this is this could be a this is a class action, but it could be a
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:40.160]   prelude to an action by the States or the or the feds or the FTC. So maybe my guess is that what
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:45.920]   my guess is that ultimately this is going to be revealed that there is an API call that apps do
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:52.320]   or that that switch sets that fell out. But I do think and it's happening on the device,
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.080]   obviously, because it's transmitting that information. But I do think one of the challenges here for
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:03.600]   Apple is going to be probably they assume that if the metrics data comes back, it's it's
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:09.120]   opted into. Yeah. And so they probably been using it, right? I doubt they've been throwing it away
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.600]   thinking that it was invalid. And that I think that leads down a kind of unpleasant path for them
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.880]   because they're going to have data and are they going to have to wipe data or, you know, go back
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.600]   and try to rich reactively. I mean, I don't know. It's a mess. And like somebody in the discord,
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:29.360]   I think said, I are in the in the IRC said, I hate to be the person at Apple that missed this. I mean,
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:34.720]   like, yeah, somebody, I don't know if somebody knew about it, but I would, I would almost bet that
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.920]   there is a bug in Apple's radar system that says this isn't being honored. That's been not
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.400]   prioritized. So somebody's going to be in trouble if they're I mean, somebody's already in trouble,
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:49.840]   clearly, very clearly. I don't remember. Does this Apple have a formal like
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:55.600]   chief compliance officer? I know that many other companies to Twitter. Okay, I'm looking at
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:03.120]   care and TU they have one because of GDPR alone. Yeah. Now the California price. His name is Kyle
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:11.680]   and dear. And he was vice president products and regulatory law at Apple legal. So he's in the
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.840]   legal group and he is a compliance officer. And yeah, you would think, I mean, look, any big company
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.840]   like Apple that has this commitment to privacy, like they need to have, I mean, they really need
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:26.960]   to have a team that is that is basically looking at all of this and investigating it and almost
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:32.800]   doing forensics on it to make sure that they're staying in compliance, because otherwise there's
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.600]   just going to be drift, right? It's an organization so huge, it's going to drift and you almost need
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:43.520]   an adversarial team to make sure that everybody's keeping honest. And this is nobody looked at this,
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.840]   right? I mean, the fact that you're touching things on the screen with that switch term
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:53.760]   doff and data is being sent back is a sign, right? It's a good sign, bad sign, but a good sign
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:58.720]   that something's happening there and nobody was looking. And a lot of times it's one of those
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.880]   things like, oh, you know, like as a programmer, you're working and something really arduous,
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.600]   you're like, well, I'm just going to leave this backdoor in so I can go in and out really quickly
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:11.200]   while I'm working on something or see something. And then you don't don't close the door lock it.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:19.920]   So it feels more, because it's in a bunch of apps, it's sending it to an address that is clearly
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:25.440]   that tracking. I don't know. I think it's going to be pretty hard to say, oh, that was a bug.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.280]   No, I don't think so, because it's a switch you can turn on or off, right?
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.560]   It's a switch you can turn on or off. And the problem is that the switch didn't get read by
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.160]   the app, so they just kept sending the data. So it could be just the switch doesn't work.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:42.800]   Yeah. But it does point to a failure in process that you don't, there is always that
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:47.200]   that group at the end of the assembly line that checks that does a quality check on the product
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:57.760]   going out to make sure that nothing got missed. I think the bottom line is who is responsible for
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:02.720]   that switch and making sure that switch works, right? Somebody should be in charge of all of those
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.200]   privacy switches that Apple cares so much about. And yet this got through. You guys are so generous
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:14.400]   to Apple. You really are. I just don't want to lose. I think they've got a lot to lose. I have a
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.960]   hard time imagining that this is all some sort of a scheme where they say they care, but secretly
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:24.000]   they're harvesting where you're tapping in the stocks app. Like, I mean, the stakes are so high
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.080]   for them that I have a hard time. Again, yeah, maybe we are giving them the benefit of the doubt
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.240]   and this will all be a scheme, but this feels much more like a screw up than a scheme to me.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.760]   But yeah, I mean, they're going to undercut their entire thing if it's a scheme.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:41.040]   Well, they already have a you can imagine every Android user going to their iPhone,
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:47.840]   boasting friends saying, see, I told you again, again, that was that that building size poster
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:54.640]   they put up across from the Google the Google suite at mobile. What was mobile world?
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:59.760]   I think it was. Yeah. Sorry. CES. We're the only one. We're the only one who cares about privacy
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.880]   and I thought, yeah, that's that's consistently that's going to be most expensive ad buys Apple
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:10.480]   has ever made. All right. Well, we'll watch with interest. And as soon as Apple says something,
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:18.880]   we'll talk about it. It'll be big news. And I doubt it will stop the class action. I'm very
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:24.080]   curious if the I'm sure the FTC is at this point going. Let's see what I says.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:29.040]   The great thing is about class action is basically about millions of dollars worth of
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.480]   discovery that the government does not have to pay for, but they just they get to right click
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:37.200]   and download that PDF and then decide on their next step. Yeah. Really simplifies things, doesn't it?
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.640]   Let's take a little break. We got more to talk about. Not a lot more, but there's a little
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:49.920]   little bit more. We'll find something. It's it's that slow period in between product releases.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:54.960]   But there are some stories and we'll get to those in just a bit with Jason Snell and Ian Aco.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:03.760]   Alex Lindsey. Our show today brought to you by IT Pro TV. I love these guys have known them
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:11.920]   since they started IT Pro TV nine years ago. I think it was done. And Tim are great guys who were
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:17.200]   IT trainers who saw what we were doing in here. And they said, you know, this would be a really
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:23.040]   fun way to learn it. IT Pro TV was born. Now they have a beautiful facility in Gainesville. We went
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:28.320]   out for the grand opening seven studios running all day Monday through Friday to create new course
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:33.680]   content because it's always changing. They hired the best, most engaging instructors. People are
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:39.360]   actual working pros in the field, but they hire them because not only are they experts, but they
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.920]   have a passion and a love for what they're doing, which communicates to you. It makes IT Pro TV
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:50.640]   very engaging, very interesting, whether you're new to the IT field or you just want to get into
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.440]   the IT and you want to get those certs so you can get that first job or you're a seasoned pro.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:01.760]   IT Pro TV is online. IT training can change your life. Virtual learning solutions for everyone at
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:10.000]   every skill level, every vendor to start or advance your IT career. It's kind of a talk show format.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.240]   They do it live. So just like we do. So you can chat with them live. And then they within 24 hours,
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:24.880]   get those live broadcasts into the library. They have 5,800 hours of downloadable IT training,
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:29.200]   always adding new stuff. So because, you know, the test change, the software changes,
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:34.800]   there are new certs, old certs go away. Their courses are always 100% up to date.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.920]   They chop it up too, which is really nice. They do a couple of things that really, I think, are
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:44.320]   small things that make a big difference. 20 to 30 minutes per episode, which means you can watch
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:49.040]   it in a lunchbreaker. You know, at any time it's convenient for you. You can watch it almost
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:55.360]   anywhere on your computer, of course, your tablet, but they also support Roku, Apple TV. So you can
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:01.040]   easily watch it on your big screen. You can listen. You can stream it in your car as you go to work.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:06.080]   So you're going to you can learn in those little gaps you have in between your real job and your
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:11.840]   real life. You can learn so you can get a better job. It's hands-on learning too. They have hosted
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:17.600]   virtual labs. All you need is a browser and you can set up a Windows server, set up Windows clients.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:22.640]   You can get access to cloned virtual machine environments to test the skills you're learning.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:28.480]   They've got IT certification practice tests. I think this is the best way to prepare to take
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.120]   the test before you take the test and keep taking the test until you got it right, right? So you
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:39.200]   be ready and even maybe more important, confident when you sit for the exam. This is so successful
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:46.880]   now. In the nine years, they've been around 220,000 people have joined their community of IT learners.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:53.440]   220,000. Those people are around too. They're in the forums along with the instructors.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:58.400]   They're there to help. They're there to support. They're there to be your friends. It's really a
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:03.920]   wonderful community. Apple TV, Roku, desktop, hit the road with your tablet and mobile device.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:11.440]   Look, it'd be silly to go to a very expensive school to learn IT when you could do it online in
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.600]   in the comfort of your own home conveniently while you continue to work your existing job.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:20.960]   You could stay focused on tech with affordable certification based learning that'll get you
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.440]   that job or get you a new job or get you new skills. And by the way, every month they offer free
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:31.280]   webinars live so that you can watch and ask questions or on demand afterwards so you can watch
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:36.240]   them when you can. You can watch them live on ITProTV's social channels. They have LinkedIn,
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:42.080]   they have YouTube, they have Facebook, just look for ITProTV on those platforms. Coming up November
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:48.720]   17th, 2 p.m. Eastern, it's the ITProTV Turkey Bowl. They do this every year. It's really fun.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.040]   Join them for live games and gift giveaways during the holidays. Look, if you don't have
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:57.680]   any experience with ITProTV, this would be a great idea. Go there and have some fun and really get
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.920]   a sense of who these people are because they're so much fun. Tim Broome, our good friend Tim Broome,
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:07.520]   the co-founder of ITProTV with Don Pazette, says it best himself. "We want to make life
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:14.640]   easier for people who want an IT career." It's just as easy as that. I'm a big fan of these guys.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.880]   I really admire what they've done. And we've been glad to partner with them since they started.

[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.320]   Well, all right. I'm going to stay in the apples, nefarious, evil plans segment.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:18.160]   This is a little thing, but it's an interesting thing. It's from a website, UX design.cc,
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:25.840]   the UX collective UX user interface on a medium. One trick, Allen's writing, one trick Apple uses
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:35.120]   to make you think green bubbles are gross. This is actually kind of interesting. This is the Apple
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:42.480]   chat. They choose a green that is low contrast. In fact, it violates the web community access
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:48.800]   guidelines. And Allen gives us an example. This would be a good contrast green. Instead,
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:54.640]   they choose a lower contrast green, which makes those green bubbles somewhat less legible
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:33:01.200]   than the blue bubbles. Do you think they did that on purpose?
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.000]   Can I give the history lesson here, which is they didn't select that color for Android.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.160]   They selected it for SMS because that app wasn't called messages. The iPhone started,
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:15.760]   it was called SMS, and there wasn't iMessage then. So they picked green because I don't know,
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:20.000]   because that was what they thought a text message should be. And then when they added iMessage,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.240]   they added a different color, which was blue. And so I think this is really great from a
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:29.360]   dark pattern perspective about how Apple chose a bolder design for their own thing than for the
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:34.080]   default thing. But just to make it clear, this is really about the green, unless they changed
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:41.360]   the green at some point, which I guess is possible, maybe iOS 7. But the green choice was made
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.120]   in the original iPhone for text messages, because that's where this came from.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:52.400]   Yeah. And if you have a bright screen, it's even worse, by the way. So it would be nice if Apple
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:59.200]   would change it to a better color. Green's fine, just a higher contrast green. Do you think they will?
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:06.880]   I have to say this, I do think this is suspicious. This famously, this is the company where Steve
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:14.720]   Jobs emailed the CEO of Google complaining about the shade of yellow in their own company logo.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:22.240]   I do believe that the Apple's own products undergo a certain UI beauty pass review that they'd
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:29.360]   say, "Ah, screw it." Alas, we have limited resources for making sure that we make the improvements
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:35.840]   apply to all of the UI elements inside the thing, particularly the things that help us to sell more
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:40.400]   iPhones than Android. And I'll grant you, Jason, it wasn't a slam-in, an Android, because it wasn't
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.080]   about Android at the time. But it might have been a way of saying we're better than SMS.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:49.120]   But it wasn't because when they introduced it, it was just SMS, and it was just green, and they added
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:54.880]   eye message later and turned it blue. I'm going to turn this into a tip opportunity for everybody.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.880]   You go to Settings, Accessibility, Display and Text Size, and turn on
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:04.080]   Increase Contrast. And guess what happens? That green bubble is a lot darker.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:09.920]   Yeah. So it captures your switch. That's okay. They give you a switch.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.160]   And the switch works, unlike some of their switches I hear.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.640]   All right. I'm going to go turn that up because I think I do have some friends.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.600]   Makes the blue one darker too, but it does make the green darker.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:31.360]   As a colorblind person, I have a lot of those things on because increasing contrast and
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.680]   just decreasing transparency makes it easier to differentiate. There's also a great setting in
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:40.240]   there, by the way, called Differentiate Without Color, which some apps follow and other apps
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.520]   ignore. But that could be useful because there was a time when you had very vital parts of your
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:50.880]   interface that would be a circle. And I would say to myself, what color is that circle?
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.960]   It's trying to tell me like, you know, the charging thing that they put on a lot of hardware,
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.200]   where it's like it's green or it's amber. I can't tell the difference. So anyway,
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.840]   Differentiate Without Color is there too. Accessibility settings are good.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:08.080]   So bold text, larger text, button shapes. Here's reduced transparency. You think that's a good one too?
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:13.840]   And I mean, it really changes the look, but you might like the look. And they have these on the
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:17.920]   Mac too. If you want to make your Mac feel like it's from the 90s, you can turn a lot of this stuff
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:22.640]   on. And everything gets like not transparent and with heavy borders around it and all. And I know
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:28.960]   some people who love that. There's also some this this one. Maybe you can explain.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:33.680]   You mentioned Differentiate Without Color. What does it like add little it says,
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:38.960]   replaces user interface items that rely solely on color. Right. So think about the one that I
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:44.000]   always always got me was back in the day was like an instant messaging app that has a red if
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.480]   they're do not disturb and a yellow if they're away and a green if they're okay. And when I turn
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:54.080]   that feature on on my Mac, it goes and it keeps the colors, but it makes them a triangle, a circle
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:37:00.560]   and a square. Because all good design, all good UX design, you should not have to rely only on
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:05.520]   color as a signal. There should be another signal like how when you move over the Mac window,
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:11.040]   those little traffic light signs in the corner also get symbols in them. So they're all circles,
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.920]   but they all get symbols in them so that if you can't differentiate based on color, you can just
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:21.040]   differentiate based on one, their placement left, right, center, and also the symbol that appears
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:27.280]   inside. Also on off labels, which I guess might help as well. Yeah, it puts a little on or off
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.960]   on the switch. So you can tell whether it's on or off without seeing the green or the red.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:35.760]   See, I see it. Yeah. So they're great. There are a lot of guys who are color blind and don't know it.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:41.520]   I didn't know until college. I took a I took a test in college and they said arrange these
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:48.800]   five green circles in order. And I was like, or a little team. That's it. That's all I know. Order
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:53.760]   a what? What are you talking about there? But anyway, I so I don't know the one fact that I
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:59.280]   don't know that I would love to know about the iMessage bubble versus the SMS slash Android bubble
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:06.240]   is did they change it at some point? And to Andy's point, yes, I am sure just like iMessage in
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:11.600]   general as a lock in feature, I it's one of those things where it's like, Oh, it turns out this
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:15.840]   thing is a lock in feature. What a shame. Let's not do anything to make it better. Right? Like
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.520]   listen, I'm gonna get right to make it better. Right. Right on that. We're gonna put this
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.640]   what's work order on the bottom of a disused filing cabinet.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:28.400]   Right. Of the leopard. Yeah, exactly. I know what you're going for there. And yeah,
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:33.520]   with our radar, we'll prioritize it appropriately and we'll see you back here in 2053.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:43.840]   I got to believe though, that Apple tests accessibility of their colors and this color fails the WooCeg
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:51.040]   tests that are out there. It's you know, and I would I would expect that they're doing that with
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:57.760]   all this stuff. Maybe not, but I would expect them to do this test. So do you think that do you
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:02.480]   think that they go so deep as to test make sure test to make sure that SMS green bubbles have the
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:07.600]   same? Do they go that deep or did they just simply say here is the basic use UI for iMessage?
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:12.160]   We regard it's somewhere institutionally, not specifically, but institutionally, they think,
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:16.640]   Oh, well, SMS is is an exception. It doesn't it doesn't marry its own tests.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:23.680]   Yeah, maybe not a test schedule. I should point out, by the way, according to this UX design blog,
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:31.600]   the blue that they chose also fails with the normal text size. So maybe they need to rethink
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:36.800]   their color choices or we should all turn on that contrast filter. Turn on the contrast feature.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:41.120]   Yeah. And that's actually the great shame as much as I like accessibility features,
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:46.320]   they do provide an out right like they can say, Oh, well, we made this thing inaccessible. But if
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:49.920]   you want it to be accessible, yeah, we can always turn on for those of you. That's a that's an
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:54.960]   excuse. But maybe you should make the default design better. Yeah. We make the we make the SMS
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:40:00.720]   bubbles very light gray on a white background just to save wear and tear on the pixels, you see,
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:07.440]   because it's such a popular standard. It's OLED. Yeah. Our customers love the color of our
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:14.720]   best bubbles. Only Apple could make a bubble this gray only Apple. You're welcome. So last week,
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:21.120]   we said that one analyst out of China said that Apple was going to delay mass production of their
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:31.200]   AR VR headset until 2024. Correction. Now a new report says this is from Digitimes,
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:37.840]   which I think is reliable. Yeah. That Apple may be starting as early as the first quarter of next
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:44.720]   year, like in just a few months, producing them. I think that it's it alludes to the Apple might
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:50.160]   announce it. I just don't see Apple announcing this before WWDC like developers need to get this
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.640]   stuff early, or it's just not going to be a great rollout. And you know, we heard that this would
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:59.840]   be the expensive developer version. That's what everybody does. Right. So maybe they're producing
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:04.000]   the developer version and now it's in June, WWDC so developers can get it.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:11.040]   Yeah. I still think it's going to go from the same template as they've had every time they've had
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:17.120]   a radical new product, like the Apple Watch, like the iPhone, like the iPad, they have always,
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:21.360]   there's a point at which they have to file with the FCC. Here is what it is. Here are
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:26.560]   specs. Here's what it's doing before they can actually let it outside of the lab. So if they're
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.880]   going to have to make that stuff public anyway, let's have an event like three or four months
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:36.400]   before we intend to actually for real rollout. So we can have a controlled environment in which we
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:41.200]   at least put it through its paces in a very limited way. And that also gives them, it also
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:46.800]   gives them a door so that they can start to seed after the after FCC certification. Now they can
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:54.240]   actually let 12 samples of these out so that 12 very, very well selected companies or developers
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:58.800]   can have something to show off during the WWDC, the big dog and pony show and failing,
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:03.040]   where they finally where they finally tell developers, here's how much it's going to cost.
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:07.200]   Here's how you can order it. Here's some ownership. And here is all of the APIs and toolkits you're
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.720]   going to have to start to use. And here are some simulators because almost none of you are going
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:16.800]   to be able to get one until a few months later. Yeah.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:21.840]   So the rumor is and the report that happened this week is that they are expecting this thing
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:26.320]   because we've already said it's more it's like 2,000 plus 2,500 3,000 who knows how much a lot of
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:32.400]   money and that they only expect to make. I think 7 million, 700 million of them,
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:37.920]   which is not very Apple to make a product with that. So yeah, I agree. I have thought with Andy for
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:44.000]   a long time now that the idea of I don't know if they will pitch it as a developer kit, but I think
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.280]   that it's going to be a de facto developer kit because it's so expensive. And I think that the only
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:53.680]   way they're going to be able to explain that price is to say, look, look, it's early days. This is
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:58.640]   this is the first step. We've got a whole vision, but we have to start with this one. And we're
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:03.040]   going to get the developers really engaged in it. And then just wait, we're going to have more down
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:07.680]   the road because otherwise that they really are going to have to set the bar pretty low if they
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:11.680]   don't think that they're going to sell more than a million. I do wonder sometimes though if in the
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:17.680]   end it will be a developer kit in all but name, right? Because then they they pre-announce it in
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:24.240]   March or something. And then they ship it to developers at WWDC and try to extol the virtues. But even
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:28.640]   there they got to make a case, right? If they're only going to sell 700,000 of them, why would you
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.480]   develop for it as a platform? So they've got to have a vision for like what the future of this
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:37.040]   platform is going to be because, you know, if you're a developer, why would you put all the time and
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.880]   effort in to reach an addressable market of 700,000, right? It doesn't make sense.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:45.200]   Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. And it is the more I think about the comparison between this
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:52.160]   and the iPad, the more similar is I see where even there they had Steve Jobs on the on the stage was
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:57.840]   essentially dodging around the fact that, hey, we know that this looks like a tablet which you've
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:02.640]   seen before but please don't judge this like a Windows tablet. It really is its own thing. And
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:08.800]   also we are giving you a bunch of sample apps that look like they're very they make total sense
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:14.000]   for advice like this. But we are desperately hoping that developers and users will tell us what this
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.880]   thing is for. I mean, they're not as speculative and crazy as other companies would be. But I think
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:24.400]   that there is going to have to be a period in which we think that we think that you can't
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:29.680]   you can't figure out a use for this until you have this thing here 700,000 of you here is that
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:35.440]   thing now because you are the most creative and crazy developer community on the planet, I believe.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.520]   I think that you're going to find compelling things that when we finally do manufacture
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:44.480]   a thousand dollar consumer version of these in millions of millions of units, you will have apps
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:49.440]   and experiences that people are going to want to buy into. Well, and also I think that number one is
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:54.880]   I bet you Apple has a pretty clear idea of what they think that this is for. You know, for this
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:59.600]   product specifically. Well, what do you think? Because there's two choices right now, right?
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:07.680]   There's gaming and there's productivity and Apple really doesn't have VR gaming. I just bought that
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:14.000]   ridiculous $1,500 Oculus Pro. And when they announced it, they had, you know,
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.760]   such an angelic come on from Microsoft, they talk about you're going to use it in office.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:24.880]   They're really kind of slanting it more toward a productivity tool. What do you think Apple's
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:32.160]   going to do, Alex? You know, I think that there's there is a, I think initially there's a real
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:36.800]   possibility of how do you integrate the other pieces of hardware that you have, you know, so
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:40.400]   whether it's your Apple TV. So, you know, one of the things that I think is interesting is
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:46.480]   if you had MLS, let's just say you had all the broadcasting rights, MLS, you would be super useful
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:52.160]   if you wanted to create moments. So rather than having it be something that is that you put on,
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:56.560]   and maybe you put it on and watch the whole game, but maybe you put it on because there's a moment
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:01.760]   that you might want to see that you're reminded of when you watch the show or when you're reminded
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:05.840]   of that, when you're watching a presentation, hey, you could pop this up and put the goggles on and
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:10.480]   you'll get to experience something. So we're talking about the Civil War. We're talking about Gettysburg,
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:14.400]   we're talking about Pickets Charge. Why don't you go there? Like, you know, put this on right now.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:19.840]   So education is it? Education. Well, so like, for instance, a good example is a friend of mine,
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:27.280]   someone at Office Hours, you know, they built some USDZ models and they gave them to the sales
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:32.400]   folks. And then they wanted the sales folks wanted the USDZ models of everything because they had
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:39.120]   them on their iPad and they were able to show them to a client with their, these are valves and
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:43.360]   stuff like that. But this valve on, like it looks like it's real, it looks like it's sitting on
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:48.080]   and they can move around and ask questions. And that kind of thing, that's so that sales,
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:54.720]   that is, experience is added to the Apple TV experience, it is education, it is, you know,
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:58.400]   those are, there's a bunch of places there that I think are pretty interesting models.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:05.760]   And I think that, you know, if, you know, with the given how much Apple has already put into it,
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:11.120]   I think that, I think that you're going to probably find that they've probably been working on
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:16.160]   for a little while, like as far as partners go. And then I think the other thing is, is that while
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:21.280]   there may only be a million units, it's a million people that are pretty free with cash, so they
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:25.920]   just spent $3,000 on something and are desperately trying to test it. Well, I mean, we see this all
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:29.600]   the time when something new comes out, whole bunch of people get it. I know when I first got
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:34.240]   Oculus, I was like, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, but that first couple weeks, you know,
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.600]   I'm kind of trying to figure it out, especially if you're a developer. I want to see what everybody
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:42.560]   else is doing. I'm probably a little less sensitive to cash than the average consumer,
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:46.960]   because it's part of my research. I'm going to write it off anyway. And so I'm going to, you know,
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:51.600]   so I want to know, I want to see what other people are doing with that. And so I do think that
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:55.360]   there'll be an awful lot of people running to get in there. And also the advantage for the
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:59.280]   developers is they're going to be the first movers. And so they're going to get to see how it works,
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:03.520]   respond, and so on and so forth. And these things are going to sell out. Like they're going to
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.240]   Apple will sell as many of these headsets as they can make.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:11.120]   Yeah, I agree with everything that you're saying. But there is with VR and AR, there's been this
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:15.520]   line of demarcation between selling to industry, selling to the people that you're talking about,
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:20.320]   where I have my goodness, I could save so much money in training for this. Or, wow, I want to
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:24.400]   create the next great thing in telemedicine. And I need a headset like this to make that sort of
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:31.280]   thing happen. But the line that I'm more interested in is that Apple is, you know, they've got hundreds
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:36.320]   of stores and malls. Okay, they build beautiful retail stores. So the difficulty that they're
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:41.680]   going to have is the same difficulty that everybody has had, which is how do you convince a regular
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:46.640]   consumer that this is something that they're going to want to spend $1,000 for assuming that's
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:53.760]   how much cost. And even when he comes in every time that that even you and you have so much more,
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:58.640]   not just imagination, but imagination fed by practical experience and knowledge,
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:02.720]   even when any but even when someone like you talks about, oh, when you have MLS could be a
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:07.840]   really wonderful experience, that's all it's always hopeful and speculative every time I think of a
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:12.400]   way that VR and AR could make a big, big difference like, Hey, what if you have virtual workspaces,
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:17.440]   not just conferencing, but just hey, my screen is now my VR headset is not necessarily
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:22.560]   with a video pass through those are every time I come up with something, it really is something
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:28.000]   that is speculative that okay, that's conditional upon again, people walking into best buy people
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.760]   walk to an Apple store thinking that yes, that's a better way of doing this, or that's a more powerful
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:38.000]   way or more. It solves problems, creates opportunities for me. It's definitely worth six, seven, eight
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.240]   hundred, nine hundred thousand dollars. I think a lot of it will have to do with the resolution
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:49.360]   and frame rate. So I know that seems like a really minor thing, but if I'm not from an Apple
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:53.920]   device, but from another device that other devices that I've worked with, I've had the opportunity to
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:50:01.520]   see, you know, more than 6k at, you know, pretty high frame rate. Yeah, it's completely different
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:07.120]   than anything you've seen before. Like, so all the stuff we've seen up until now is exciting and
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:12.480]   it's interesting. But the reason a lot of us go, anybody who's seen, you know, high frame rate and
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:18.320]   high resolution, which is like the kind of things that let you see that are big helmets that make
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:22.480]   you look, you could never take home and they're a couple hundred thousand dollars each. And you
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.880]   put them on and then it's like, oh, that's what everybody who's excited about it has, that's in
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.960]   development, that's seen these. And you know, these high frame rate things have been around for a
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:34.320]   while, high frame rate, high resolution, it's just that they're at a million dollars or quarter
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:39.040]   million dollars, they're not practical, right? And so if Apple can get these quarter million dollar,
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:44.400]   half million dollar units into three hundred three thousand dollars, and you really get six to eight
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:49.920]   k per i, and you really get over, we'll just say over 95 frames a second, 120 frames a second.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:56.080]   If you get to that level, there's a lot of people looking to buy that because it's now you're throwing
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:01.120]   it on there and you it's not like a digital thing that is kind of cool and you're almost there. It's
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:05.680]   like you really feel like you're there. And so the thing is, is that is and that's going to be a
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:09.680]   different experience. And again, I don't think that it's going to be for everyone at the very
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:16.080]   beginning, but I do think that when people see it, they're very aspirational and will want to,
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:20.240]   you know, be the person that has those at the house when when people come over be the person.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:25.440]   And you know, but literally, I mean, that's that's how I agree with you. And and people will,
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:30.000]   you know, want to be that person that has it. And and they're going to and again, there's
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.840]   and millions of those people, it's maybe not hundreds of millions or tens of millions, but
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:39.120]   there's definitely enough to get a market off the ground. And again, I think that there are so many
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:44.000]   places with that. And the big problem, right, the biggest problems that I've seen with with
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:50.880]   headset so far is one, low resolution, low, lower, and medium 30 to 60 frames per second is fine,
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:58.080]   but it's not great. Low resolution is a problem. Glasses are a big problem. Like I won't, I don't
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:01.920]   really use the Oculus anymore because there's no diopter. So I can't adjust it. And which means
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:06.800]   that I had to either change lenses out with the family or Oculus fits over my glasses better.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:11.440]   I know it's just, you know, I spent a lot of money on these glasses. I'm not gonna, I'm not
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:15.760]   aware of my glasses that when I'm doing it. And it works. I can't. Yeah, I did that with,
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:19.440]   I did with my last pair. And that's why I have a new pair is that, you know, last pair just got
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:24.320]   all wonky, everything else and so I'm a little, but so, so glasses are a problem. And the other
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:29.600]   big thing is the startup process. So contextually, like for instance, if you're connected to your
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.960]   phone and you're looking at your phone and you know what you're gonna get and then you throw it on
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:37.760]   and yeah, I don't have to hit any buttons. And I'm just where I need to be rather than the,
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:42.000]   it's the navigation that oftentimes is like, you've got to be like a little, you know,
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.760]   rain man to kind of figure out where to go at the very beginning. It's when you want to show it
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:49.360]   to someone or you want to do something, you know, it becomes really hard. So those are,
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:53.360]   those are things that are real. And then of course, content, you know, like games are fine,
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:56.880]   but Robo recall in my opinion was the only game that I enjoyed playing that and
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:00.080]   HTC had this sort of one with arrows that you shoot it like the other.
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:04.400]   I actually like the, that's about it. I like the Beat Saber games. They're a guitar hero,
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.800]   but instead of playing guitar, the great, the things are coming at you and you either hit them
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:13.120]   with sabers. There's one where you hit it with balls, but it's, you're moving, which is nice.
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:18.720]   And it's fun and you're listening to music. It's basically dancing with a silly looking helmet
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:22.080]   on you've played those, Jason as well. Yeah, I mean, Beat Saber is great.
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:24.560]   I love these super natural, which super natural.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:27.040]   Yeah, super natural. Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:30.240]   Super natural, which is an exercise game that has really gotten.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.440]   That's why I got to try to buy. Yeah.
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:35.840]   And a lot of pickup from that. And, and so we already have some sense of what some of the
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:39.680]   applications are that are going to be good here. And Apple having fitness and having, you know,
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:43.760]   the app started like Apple has some ideas. I'm sure about ways to make this all work.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:49.600]   I think the question is how long is the ramp up to it being a product that people, that lots of
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:53.600]   people are going to want to buy? And how do they market that first product?
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:54:00.000]   Because everything Apple does has a huge amount of scrutiny. And if, you know, the risk is you come
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.800]   out with a product for $2,500 and you say it's for everybody, but really not, that everybody like
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:08.160]   looks at it and is like, well, that's ridiculous. And they, and they write it off and it's a joke.
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:10.640]   To sell it. It makes it harder for them to sell it next year.
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:14.400]   To some degree that has already happened with VR, I have to point out.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.000]   Right. Well, this is, this is the problem.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.280]   And then if Apple comes in with something.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:21.200]   Yeah, that Apple is going to be able to make something happen is highly speculative.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:25.280]   I could easily see Apple putting all this money and effort into it and never releasing it,
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.720]   realizing that it's not worth it. We're not going to be able to push through.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:32.080]   Here's a mark. And they're not afraid. They're, they're not afraid of throwing billions at
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:35.760]   something and then just killing it. Yeah. They're making me turn. Yeah, they're not.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:39.040]   Apple TV. We don't, we don't, we don't, we don't, we don't have an Apple-branded TV set.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.960]   That then they were ready to go at any moment.
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:47.760]   It is a hedge against VR replacing the smartphone, right? Or AR replacing the smartphone
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:51.920]   with the interface. And if you're Apple and you have the iPhone, why would you not, and lots of
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:55.920]   billions and billions and billions of dollars in cash, why would you not hedge against that,
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:01.200]   that right? Facebook is making a little more of an existential wager here, I think. But for Apple,
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:04.960]   because they have to, if they have to, if their business is failing, so they have to.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:08.320]   Is it declined? Right. But if you're Apple, you're looking at like, what is the threat to,
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:14.640]   to undercut or replace my iPhone? Exactly. And if AR glasses is the, it turns out in 15 years,
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:20.080]   even to be the smartphone replacement, why would you not spend your 50, 60 billion in cash
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:24.640]   right now to be there? We're doing the work. Yeah. No guarantees are going to release.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:28.800]   Let me tell you what Mark Gurman's speculation is, because he had a really long piece about this.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:34.080]   First of all, what we already know, according to Gurman, and I think others,
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:40.240]   the headset, $2,000 to $3,000, because it's a high end product that will pack in a Mac level M2 chip,
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:46.160]   more than 10 cameras outside and inside. The highest resolution displays ever featured in a
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:52.800]   mass market device. The new operating system is called reality OS. They already have trademarked
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:58.640]   that. It will include mixed reality versions of core Apple apps like Messages, FaceTime,
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:04.560]   and Maps, the first version of the operating system code named Oak, is now wrapping up internally,
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:11.360]   so it's ready for new hardware next year. He says he, because of the trademark filings,
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:19.120]   believes reality pro and reality one are the possible names for this. And now he says,
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:25.840]   thanks to Apple job listings posted over the last several months and changes to the team,
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:28.560]   but behind the future headset, the technology development group,
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:36.800]   indicate that Apple's wrapping up its work to bolster the device with content. They're looking
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:42.400]   for instance for a software producer with experience in visual effects and game asset pipelines,
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:47.840]   who can create digital content for augmented and virtual reality environments. The listings
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:51.680]   also apply, again, this is all Mark Gurman from Bloomberg and his power on newsletter. The
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:58.000]   listings also apply that Apple is looking to build a video service for the headset featuring 3D content
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:06.560]   that can be played in virtual reality. And by the way, the one place that all that 3D content that
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:12.640]   we gave up on really works is a headset. If you get the convergence in the interact field or
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:18.400]   any ocular or any actual distance right, if you don't get it right, it hurts. But if you do get
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:24.000]   it right, the headset just looks amazing if you shot it well. So it's it's it's
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.560]   exciting. Yeah, I was going to say we a lot of us roll our eyes at 3D movies, right, because
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:32.400]   they were the next big thing and then they turned out not to be the next big thing. But you got to
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:38.080]   put on the stupid glasses and it takes half the brightness out of it because you've got to you've
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:44.320]   got to project the interleaved images. Let me tell you, even on the Quest 2, 3D movies look
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:50.160]   pretty good, even with that incredibly low resolution. If you can imagine an AK, AK resolution
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:58.960]   headset and immersive audio and a 3D movie or sports show or whatever, like it will, it's already
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:05.120]   very close at the the most low level of the Quest 2 to being a better experience than watching a 3D
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:10.800]   movie in a theater because the 3D movie in the theater has so many limitations, whereas this is
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:15.280]   just putting two images in front of your eyes and it's just native 3D. There's a lot they can do,
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:20.000]   even leaving aside like VR or having you sit in some seats at a sporting event and being able to
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.080]   watch it like you're sitting there like there's lots of stuff they can experiment with on the
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:28.000]   and they already have a like a movie and TV store, right, in a streaming service and like all the
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.800]   pieces are there for that. Yeah, the next VR stuff has been pretty good. I mean, they had a pretty
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:36.640]   good stack of patents and you know, one of the things that next VR did was figure out that you
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:40.720]   just put need two 180 lenses. You don't need to look around all the time where you have to
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:44.080]   stitch in a few small things. That's the company they chose about things a while ago, a couple
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:54.720]   years ago, not just 3 BC before COVID. So anyway, but they they've had that for a while and the
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:59:00.080]   big thing is is that when you want to watch basketball game or something like the one thing
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:05.680]   that I learned, I did a bunch of basketball games is that floor seats, baby. So the thing is,
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:10.240]   this floor seat, I got to sit like second row at a basketball game. It's a different game.
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:16.000]   It is. It's a different game. Yeah. These guys are huge and they're right there. Yeah.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:23.440]   And we put and we put Ozo cameras right right on the side of the of the of a basketball court for
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:28.160]   pro game and it's really cool. You're like, this is really awesome, but the resolution,
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:32.880]   the stitching, all the other things became more of a challenge. And so, so if you can get that
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:37.920]   resolution up and if you can get the frame rate up and you can get the immersive sound and everything
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:44.000]   else, it it it's a pretty compelling solution. Yeah. It's the box that everyone's trying to fit in
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.720]   by by trying to fit into the opportunity they have and I don't know if that was going to make
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:52.960]   that opportunity, but they usually do pretty well. The opportunity is they're not trying to fit it
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:59.280]   into a fine, you know, and that is trying to do something for a concert. Well, so yes and no.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.640]   So the thing with concerts, we talk about spatial audio, spatial video, right? Well,
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:08.800]   yeah, what you want to do is is the hard part with concerts is where you want to put the camera
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:14.080]   is right in front of everybody that might be at the concert. Right. So really where you want to go
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:19.040]   down this path and is you want your own, you know, what do this is what Apple can afford to do. You
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:24.160]   build a stage that is designed for it. And there's little things you do. You do things that create
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:29.280]   parallax. And so what you want is you want to put you want to put elements in the scene,
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:35.360]   including the people that because really in a 3D environment, typically the between five feet
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:40.880]   and about 20 feet is what you where all the money is, right? Like, so if a lot's going on in there,
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.280]   it really feels 3D as you get further out than 20 feet, the parallax isn't as much.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:50.160]   And you just don't notice as much as not a special. We just saw Roger Waters latest show and it's
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:54.800]   in the round. And you could instead of putting the camera in front of in between the audience
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:00.080]   and the performer, you put it in the middle looking out and it might have been really interesting.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.960]   It's a little, we've done the middle out and the problem is you start moving your head around.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.080]   It doesn't feel very natural. We never be there. Because you're looking behind you.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:14.320]   Right. But in 3D, if you again, if you decide like if he's in the round,
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:18.640]   that we're going to put the camera right in front of him and there's not going to be behind that
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.040]   area. And so now you see everybody else and you see him that might work or again by himself.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:27.280]   Because the nice thing about when the artist is by themselves, they just look at the camera.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:27.680]   Right.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.040]   This is the camera. This is who you look at.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:29.840]   They know who they're looking at.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:33.680]   And then it's this really personal experience and everybody gets an experience that is,
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.760]   you can't get anywhere else.
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:35.920]   Sure.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.720]   Because even when you're there at a stage, they're looking at this part of the stage or they're
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.840]   looking at that part of the stage. When you put a camera right in front of them, they're just
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:48.880]   playing to it. Whether it's a 16 by 9 rectilinear or stereo, it's a very personal experience.
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:55.200]   This show was in the place, the Chase Arena, where the Warriors play. So it's a big
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:03.040]   central area and they used almost all of the playing surface. They had instruments spread out
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:09.600]   all over. It was almost as if they were describing. And waters would go to one place and sing to
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:13.680]   that quarter of the audience because the rest of the audience is now behind him. But it's just as
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:20.640]   you described. Now you have this great depth with a drummer 20 feet over here and singers 10 feet
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:25.360]   over there. I think that maybe artists are already thinking this. I wonder if anybody
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:31.680]   know James Cameron because you got to think as he's shooting his new avatar, he's thinking next
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:37.760]   year might be fun to have this in a VR environment. Oh, yeah. He was also in the interview he
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.960]   at least he gave with New York Times. He was he did talk about what we were talking about earlier,
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:46.640]   about 3D movies that the difference is that like he is actually shooting his movie with a 3D setup
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:52.480]   with 3D in mind. And that most of the when the 3D looked like it was going to be a thing, all the
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.080]   studios were like, all the studios were like, we don't want to put the money to this, all the
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:01.680]   directors were like, we don't want to have to relearn how to shoot a movie. And so the results
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:06.880]   were these inferior. Okay, thank you for the 2D movie. Now we will basically hand will basically
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:13.600]   create Dr. Tong's 3D house of avatar or whatever to create these kind of fake looking 3D effects
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:18.160]   as opposed to things that are absolutely organic to the storytelling. Cameron has had enough cloud
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:22.080]   and he does still have enough cloud to do it right. And I and an high frame rate,
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:27.200]   you know, high high resolution to be very intro. I bet you anything Apple's talking to him. And
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:32.480]   wouldn't you in a year from now when they announced and now you can get avatar on the Apple's,
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:38.240]   you know, TV plus in surround, that might be very interesting problem for them.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:45.040]   And the thing is, is that it, Andy's absolutely right that there was this rush to the, to the,
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:48.720]   we see the same thing with spatial audio, which is that everybody's just trying to remix it or
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.120]   they're trying to use AI to strip this, strip it out and then move just move things around a little
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:57.840]   bit. And, and but when it's really done correctly, you know, I went to Sony when they were trying to
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:02.720]   get people going, they would invite people to come and get trained for stereo. And it was awesome.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.880]   It was like the best two train two days of training I've ever been through, which is that they,
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:10.800]   and they really just broke down like this is how you set up the cameras and this is convergence.
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:16.560]   And this is you got to sit there and on a Sony stage with Sony cameras, like actually, and then
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:21.600]   you go into a theater and look at some stuff that you come back out and work on it. And then you
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.280]   really got to see what 3D looked like. And it was stunning. It was just stunning to look at
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:30.080]   when you in the right environment and these, these headsets are the right environment for this.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:33.680]   And I think that it's going to be really, really fascinating to see. And James Cameron is going to
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:40.000]   probably be on the stage with Apple to find out. Again, a caution. Apple may never release any of
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.520]   this, but they're clearly hiring some more listings include. We're looking optimistic. Yeah.
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:50.080]   Well, but also, I know a bunch of people like, they got the money. They got the money. You know,
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:54.640]   I mean, they're doing the same thing with a car. And if it really seems like people really don't
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:00.320]   want this, they go, OK, just think you can, you can sit in your car with your VR goggles and it'll
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:05.520]   drive you somewhere and then you get really nauseated. Oh, my God. You feel sick. We're looking,
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:09.120]   this is from another listing. We're looking for a software engineer who'll work on the app,
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:14.960]   intense framework. This is, this is part of iOS to help design and implement solutions to unlock
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:20.000]   deep system intelligence, enable new developer tools, facilitate novel user interactions from
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.600]   application data models, which are leveraged by a variety of system services like shortcuts,
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:31.760]   series, search and more. So that gives you some idea. They're thinking this is more than just
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:38.160]   move, watch and movies. There's also, they want to develop a 3D mixed reality world.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:46.240]   That is so ambitious. And that's not a complaint, by the way, I'm saying that as we keep talking
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:51.760]   about all this sort of stuff, realize this, this, I like the fact that Apple is willing to risk
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:56.400]   failure and they are risking failure with this. This could be, this is the, this could be another
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:03.280]   Newton where it's wonderful, it's brilliant. People like me who are sometimes tricked themselves into
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:10.960]   thinking that of 17 months from now is actually now in human terms, think that, wow, this, this,
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:14.960]   this is the leading edge of what everything is should be the next two years. But then every,
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:20.160]   the actual human beings take a look at this and think that I can't, wow, I had the most,
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:24.880]   I'm mind blowing demo of this thing at the Apple store. I can't wait to go back to the Apple store
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:28.880]   and try it again. There's no way I'm spending a thousand dollars for it because I don't think,
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:32.640]   I don't, I can't see how I would use this in a way that I wouldn't already be using my other
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:37.280]   stuff. But hey, it was such a wonderful demo. I saw soccer in 3D and I was able to turn my head.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:42.400]   That's not denigrating anything else was said here. I'm just saying that this, it's a wonderful
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:47.520]   demo, but it has to be rolled into people who even the people are spending $2,000 for, for
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:53.440]   notebooks and people are spending $800 for Apple watches and $1,500 for the best iPhones.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:57.920]   It has to do stuff. And that's where we are right now. And that's the whole problem right now
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:02.640]   is it's a great demo. It's fun. And then you get tired of it. The other, I want to read a little
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:10.160]   bit more. By the way, Met is putting $10 billion a year into their efforts. Apple has so much money,
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:15.440]   they've got such an engine, they could double or triple that without breaking a sweat. So,
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:22.720]   I agree with you, Jason, when this is clearly something you do and because the phone isn't going
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:27.600]   to be there forever and they don't want somebody else eating their lunch. So you do it. And if it
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:32.640]   doesn't take off, well, oh well, we got an iStax right off. Well, and even if it doesn't become an
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:37.360]   iPhone, right? Maybe it becomes a $20 or $30 billion a year business like an iPad or even
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:42.560]   something like an iPad. And if that keeps it rolling as the technology, because the technology is
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:47.120]   totally going to get better, right? Technology will keep improving. And you know, you can keep that
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:51.600]   alive for a long time thinking at some point here, it's going to break through. And you know,
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:56.560]   if you're Apple, it would almost be malpractice not to do it because what if, right? What if it
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:02.000]   replaces the iPhone in the music stops? Yeah. And it's so hard to do like you need the years
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.880]   to do it. That's the thing you do. Yeah. And on top of everything else, I mean, we keep coming back
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:14.320]   to the probably the biggest flop in VR AR, which was Google Glass. And I mean, for a limited edition
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:18.720]   experimental thing, yeah, even it certainly didn't set the world on fire. But the thing is,
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:23.680]   Google did develop a lot of technologies with it that informed a lot of future products. So even
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:28.960]   if it does, even if they are, these things are really, really cool, cool collectors things that
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:35.120]   wind up like 10 years from now, alpha hardware is going to wind up on eBay, say, Hey, here's
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:40.160]   their unreleased unreleased headset, they will probably have the fact that they now have all these
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:44.800]   resources for building software experiences for their developers, they can develop Apple software
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:49.760]   that will work with future VR AR headsets that maybe Apple doesn't make or all the stuff that
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:54.400]   they can roll into their own hardware and software for doing some of the cool things that that
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:58.720]   I'll keep talking about, like again, capturing things from the real world and integrating real
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:03.520]   world into virtual virtual worlds, it's going to pay off and Apple can afford it.
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:10.480]   So it's a don't I mean, the last thing I'll say is that we make fun of the $6,000 Star Wars
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:14.880]   superliner experience at Disney. There are people who can afford it. It doesn't have to be awesome.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:19.200]   If those people like it, that's going to be fine too. All right, let's take a little break.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:26.080]   There's still much more to talk about Andy Inaco, WGBH Boston and points north also in
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:34.400]   nocco.com. They keep begging me to ask you about the website. I know. I don't want to be that
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:38.480]   guy. I don't want to bug you about well, they're they're they are very correct. It is later than
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:44.160]   I wanted to be, but it will again, I'm like, I'm like Apple developing augmented reality. I want
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:48.960]   to I want to invest in infrastructure that can pay off for years to come not for months to come.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:57.680]   Exactly. All right. I asked him. Okay. I asked him. Alex Lindsey office hours dot global always
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:02.640]   fascinating stuff going on over there. You're you you've changed your set a little bit and then
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:06.560]   your microphone. Are you on? What do you think? Well, so the microphone is because I'm not quite
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:10.480]   done yet. No, no, I'm at home. I so there used to be a gray screen. What I did is I spun the
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:14.480]   whole thing around. So now you're seeing my shelves. I like it. I like the oscilloscope and
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:20.480]   yeah, it's cool. Courtney. Courtney. Good. And I had a oscilloscope because you hate. You want
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:24.800]   to put one back there? It's really good. Look, it doesn't do anything. It's just looks it's just
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:29.200]   there for like it's it's it's pretty old. It's it's I think he said it still works. I haven't tried
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:34.000]   to play it in really long. I've got I yeah, I think it's I think it's a lot of fun and but I
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.720]   didn't get all my blankets up yet and wow is my room live without him. So I'm looking on that a
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:44.880]   little bit. Also using this M58 or something like that to get the to knock it out. Yeah, but
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:50.640]   once I get that fixed though, I'll be back to a regular one and and and yeah. I think the
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:54.400]   I can I can I can I see he's got a gazebo in their yard. The live ports have to get a zebo in
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:58.640]   their yard. Then the the ports put a fire pit and then now the lenses have to have a fire pit.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:04.720]   I just I'm just going to say this oscilloscope escalation has got to stop here.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:09.920]   Or you should see I've got I've got all pvw's that are going here. There's a big old beta cams.
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:15.360]   I got so just just in case I'm and I'm trying to get some stuff that'll have some lights and
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:19.760]   back there and and everything else. I'm still you'll see the background here evolve every week.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:25.760]   You'll see like oh I got a couple. I got I got I like I like how it looks. I think it looks great.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:31.200]   Thank you. Honestly, the sound is not any as far as I could tell any different. So I think it's fine.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:35.280]   There you go. Yeah. Back to my ticket. I like it. Yeah. Stick with the 58.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:41.520]   And of course, Jason Snell, who is all along had everything but in a oscilloscope. He's got every
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:48.400]   Mac behind all of those Macs behind me work. They will boot up at a moments notice and there's also
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:54.160]   a Lego Magnum PI back there and an Oscar the bear bobble head because I see it. I mean he
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:58.160]   Oscar's always back there, but it's big game week. So go bears beat Stanford.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:04.240]   Husky bear. And I got to tell you, you got to send somebody downstairs to turn on the lava lamp
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:08.720]   long enough beforehand. So it actually is moving. It takes a while for that.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:13.200]   It's moving it. It's moving. There's a big blob right there. There it goes. There it goes.
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:18.000]   Oh, this is exciting. It's doing its thing. Yeah, there's a great for the people listening to the
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.720]   podcast on audio. I know. I know. I love it. I love that. I love it when we talk about
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:29.200]   imagine a lava lamp, everybody. See, it's in their head and I have a massive oscilloscope behind me.
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:33.920]   It's the lava lamp of the mind. It's the lava lamp of the mind show title.
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:42.800]   Our show today brought to you by policy genius. I remember I very vividly remember when I decided
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:47.680]   I had to get life insurance. The kids were little. I'm thinking I got college ahead of us.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:54.400]   You know, I got I got a full family. Now I've got a real responsibility. I think I better have
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:13:00.080]   life insurance. And then when we started Twit, same thing happened. We got a key man policy because
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:06.480]   you know, if something should happen to me, you know, we'd need we need to hire somebody, I guess.
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:11.120]   So we actually have a pretty good key man policy life insurance. You hope you never need life
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:17.360]   insurance. The problem is mortgage payments and childcare and other expenses don't disappear if
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:22.400]   something happens to you. Right. Now you may say, Oh, no, it's okay. I'm cool, man. I've got life
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:28.320]   insurance from my job. But you got to look at that because it's often a very scant amount,
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:33.280]   barely enough for your family's needs. And if you leave your job, will it follow you? No, of course not.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:40.080]   Now I got to tell you another fact I learned life insurance gets more expensive as you get
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:44.960]   older, harder to get as you get older. There is no better time. The best time by life insurance
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:50.880]   was 10 years ago. The next best time is right now. Right now policy genius is the way to do it.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:57.200]   It will give you a smarter way to find and buy the right coverage for you and your family at the
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:03.600]   right price policy genius was actually created to modernize the life insurance industry. They saw
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:08.800]   a real gap here because you'll go to normally you'll go to a company and they'll tell you what
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:12.960]   the cost is. And you say, okay, but that's not the best way to shop with policy genius. You can
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:18.000]   compare life insurance quotes from the best companies, AIG and Prudential and just a few
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.600]   and others in just a few clicks to find your lowest price, which means with policy genius,
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:28.800]   you can find life insurance policies that started just $17 a month for half a million dollars of
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:34.960]   coverage. Policy genius has licensed agents who can help you find options that offer coverage in
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:40.720]   as little as a week and avoid unnecessary medical exams. But let me tell you, these licensed agents
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:45.200]   do not work for the insurance companies. They're working on your behalf, which is really great.
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:50.160]   The law requires to be licensed agents, but that's good. That means they've taken the exams,
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:56.560]   they have the expertise to advise you. They don't have any incentive to recommend one insurer over
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:01.120]   another. No, it doesn't work that way. You can trust their guidance. They're there to help. And,
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:06.240]   by the way, there are no added fees. Of course, your personal info is absolutely private.
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:11.280]   This is why policy genius has thousands of five star reviews on Google and Trust
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:17.520]   pilot. It really works. By the way, I should mention while you're there, policy genius has quotes for
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:22.800]   home, auto pet, renters, more. I mean, it makes it very easy to get insurance in all different
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:27.040]   areas. But I think it's good to focus on life insurance right now because I think that's something
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:31.840]   you've probably been thinking you should do. You know you should do. Maybe you haven't done it yet.
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:37.920]   And your loved ones deserve a financial safety net. You deserve a smarter way to find and buy it.

[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:05.040]   them for their support of Macbreak Weekly. And you support us when you go to policygenius.com/macbreak.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:12.000]   I'm feeling a little, John, I mean, I feel like my oscilloscope just isn't as nice as Alex is.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.600]   It's probably is it a working? Where do we get? Yeah, you got a good one, Alex. That's a,
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:23.520]   that looks like you could like the eye of Mortar. You could, you could, you could see,
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:28.080]   it's like a palantier. You could see with Sauron's oscilloscope. Yes.
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:35.040]   The oscilloscope of Sauron. I mean, we're playing with those, there, there are people who create like
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:41.120]   actual like audio music files that when put through an oscilloscope as a vector scope,
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:47.120]   actually do like animation, like really like wire for like incredible wire fry. And it's just music.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:51.760]   It's just the sound and it doesn't sound like static. It's like boom. It's like a tronica music.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:55.200]   I'll see if I can put a link in the show notes. I actually think early,
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:00.240]   early video games, Asteroids was a vector graphics. I bet you, and I know Space Wars
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:05.120]   basically was on an oscilloscope. That's basically what they were doing was creating
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:11.120]   an electric pattern to make the game, right? They're vector graphics. So I,
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:14.000]   by the way, Sauron, Sauron's oscilloscope bad vibes only.
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:23.440]   If it's music, it's bad music. Did you find it, Andy? Put it in the, yeah, I'm pacing it at the bottom.
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:27.120]   Okay. Good. It's you have to skip forward. I'll give you, I'll give you a timestamp. This is
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:33.760]   Tecmoan's video about it. Nice. Oh, I see. And you can, and you can, if you don't have a
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:38.320]   if you don't have an oscilloscope, you can just play them like with a, of course, an oscilloscope
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:45.520]   simulator. That's cool. Tecmoan. What time stamp should I, yeah? I'm gonna look for it.
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:51.040]   It'll be near the end. The first, the first half is, is him like buying a used oscilloscope
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:54.240]   that will actually work. Oh, I got it. Here we go. Oh, this is cool.
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:18:06.240]   So those are electrical signals that are, are. Now you don't have to go to the
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:11.760]   trouble of buying an oscilloscope to see these. I've only played just short snippets over a few.
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:16.240]   That's very cool. Oh, look, see, there you go. Vector graphics. Here, I'll turn off the sound.
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:20.320]   Yeah, that's basically battle zone right there. Yeah. Yeah. Battle zone was vector graphics,
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:26.480]   asteroids was vector graphics. Yeah. Go to like eight 30. There's like a bicyclist going past,
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:33.200]   a bicycle is going past a mountain range. There's a, yeah, that's cool. There's like a 3D globe.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.760]   That's actually rotating and it's like, oh, look, a butterfly flapping its wings going through a field
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:43.680]   of mushrooms. How do you figure out how to make noises? No, generating that. Like it's like, oh,
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:48.800]   my goodness. Yeah. Anyway, that's very cool. All right. Alex, you have an assignment now.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:52.720]   All right. All right. I'll work on getting some of them there. We'll, we'll, I'll cut to a video
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:56.960]   of it and we'll just, uh, so I'll figure out. I'll, I'll start working on it.
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:02.320]   Yeah. Just one other thing. You'll have, you'll have it back there in the corner. You'll just see
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:08.400]   those little green, like awesome. This is why I love and I hate a Tecmo's channel because I'll do
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:13.760]   a video like this. And suddenly I've added like tectronics, 760A, vector scope to my eBay, like
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:25.200]   search listing. Exactly. New iOS beta scratches the itch. Some have experienced over the always on
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:33.600]   display iOS 16.2 beta includes toggles that let you hide the wallpaper and notifications.
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:37.520]   Have you played with this, Jason? This is a report from Macromers and nine to five.
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:41.040]   You know, I haven't, I haven't played with that yet. Although this is, so the idea here is that
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:45.920]   people, some people said they'd like, they're always on screen to be a little more like low key,
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:49.760]   yeah, that they don't like having all that extra stuff like the images and all that. And they want
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:54.800]   it to be a much sort of like more staid thing. So it sounds like Apple is working on ways to
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:58.880]   let you tweak that a little bit. Yeah, Nielei Patel and his review of the
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:03.520]   iPhone said, I'd prefer a pixel style black and white clock. I don't have my pixel with me,
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:09.040]   but it's a, it is a much more subdued. I actually really like the, the Apple always on. In fact,
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:13.440]   once you showed me how I could do a slideshow so that every time I tap it, I have a different
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:18.720]   picture of my wife. Yeah, it's a great. I love that. But it's, I think this is exactly what these
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:24.640]   early dot releases of iOS are for, which is Apple introduces a big new feature. And then
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:28.320]   I mean, they get the feedback, but they've also probably got a list of like things they could do
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:32.320]   next. And some of that feedback comes in and they're like, all right, maybe we prioritize that
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:37.680]   because, you know, we had people on our team also arguing that they like the more subdued. And I
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:41.600]   think it's just a personal preference thing. I love having those pictures there. But I totally
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:46.000]   get why you might be like uncomfortable and would prefer to be as low key as possible.
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:54.080]   Change coming to iOS 16.1.1, which makes sense from a security point of view,
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:21:02.640]   airdrop, if you said it to everyone, that everyone option gets turned off in 10 minutes. It's already
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:09.200]   in China. And I think there is some speculation that's because people were using airdrop in China
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:19.120]   to send, you know, images stuff together. There you go. Stuff the government.
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:24.240]   Attractable one traceable anonymous. Yeah. Right. The everyone option means anyone who is in
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:28.800]   range of your iPhone can send you something. And for security reasons, it's probably a good idea
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:37.040]   to have a curtain off. But the change that Apple's making cannot be disabled in China.
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:46.640]   It's in 16.1.1 and 16.2 beta two. And if you have an iPhone purchased in mainland China,
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:54.880]   you cannot disable that. It will it will turn itself off after 10 minutes. Probably. Is it
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:22:00.320]   reasonable to speculate? This is something the Chinese government asked Apple to do. They've done
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:05.200]   other things like this. You can't see the Chinese flag emoji on iPhone sold in China.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:09.760]   I can't imagine that they would have thought this as a security and privacy enhancement for
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:15.280]   iPhone users without rolling either a rolling that out worldwide or be just making it an option.
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:20.160]   And it actually is an interesting option. I would it would be a nice option if you could simply say
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:25.760]   by the way, by default, we don't think that it's a good idea to have except airdrop from everybody
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:30.400]   off the time. So unless you flip the switch, it will automatically time out after 10 minutes.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:35.600]   But I don't think that they decided this would be just a random good place to test out this feature.
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:41.840]   This is what it looks like according to 9-5 Mac in the airdrop settings, you could turn on
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:47.840]   everyone for 10 minutes. And it says explicitly for 10 minutes. I think that's probably smart,
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:52.720]   honestly. I don't think that's. And also, no matter what no matter how this originated,
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:23:00.640]   if I were working if I were a citizen of a government like China, I might be concerned about,
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:05.840]   oh, there is something that is on my phone right now that I didn't ask for that could be a very,
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:09.520]   very big trouble if I'm crossing a border and it's discovered that this is in my camera roll,
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:15.600]   or this was transmitted to me. I would be I would be very nervous about that. So yeah, it's
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:21.280]   there's a lot to unpack here, but it's not it's not I wouldn't I wouldn't think that it's a bad thing
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:28.800]   to have on a phone just in general. Today, Apple enables that satellite emergency SOS
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:38.240]   feature. Good piece in a on a website called DC Rainmaker talking about how it works.
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:43.760]   And of course, the only way that you can test it is because you know, you're going to call
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:49.120]   emergency services is to somehow work with Apple. We were speculating about that when they announced
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:54.080]   it. And in fact, that's exactly what happened here. The test was coordinated with Apple.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:59.840]   DC Rainmaker says specifically they knew not to send rescuers to my location,
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:05.680]   but everything else is as is leveraging the real satellite system for communications.
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:12.400]   So the first thing you have to do is dial 911. He says the reason is because dialing 911 on an
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:16.160]   iPhone actually does some interesting stuff in the background. Unlike a normal call to your friends,
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:22.640]   it elevates the phone to go beyond your carrier's cell towers. Right. Because and we know that
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.960]   because if you don't have a sim in their emergency phone calls are still available and that's by law.
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:31.760]   Right. So if you if you think you have no service, but it turns out that you were on Verizon and
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:37.760]   you can see an AT&T tower, dialing 911 will get you a call because it will use the other carrier to
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:42.560]   make the emergency call. And then if you find anything, then it's satellite time.
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:48.560]   So if if you can't see a tower, you'll see no connection. Try emergency
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:56.240]   text via satellite in big red letters. You can see it here in the in the image. And there's a new
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:02.800]   screen that confirms you want to trigger a satellite emergency. Be outside to get a connection.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:08.000]   Messages will take longer to send answer questions to help get a faster response. And then it helps
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:14.480]   you aim. So the first thing you'll get is a menu that says, what's the emergency car, vehicle issues,
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:21.840]   sickness or injury, crime, lost or trapped fire? Then you specify who needs help me,
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:28.800]   someone else, multiple people. They ask, are you breathing normally or with difficulty?
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:35.440]   Then it says, what kind of emergency chest pain, traumatic injury, sickness, stroke, drowning
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:40.640]   other. Wow. And the reason they do this is because they can send this information as just a set of
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:46.560]   bits. So it's much faster than said than you'd saying, I can't breathe. They can get all that
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:51.600]   information in just a few bits. And having an having an instantaneous two way conversation is
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:56.720]   not optimal for this method. And that's that it just it speaks of all the infrastructure they put
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:02.320]   in. It's not just simply, Hey, we'll make a phone call to 911. It is no your emergency,
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:07.920]   your emergency pulse goes out to receiver that is set up to actually receive an Apple
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:14.160]   satellite SOS unpack it. It can send questions back to you, but it's really set up to make you
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:18.320]   very, very, very, to help you no matter what happens yet. You're not, you're not, we're not,
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:23.920]   we're not going to be reaching a local 911 dispatcher who has never talked to never dealt with
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:30.560]   iPhones SOS before. Right. It's it's a very well thought up thing. I during my, I was surprised
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:36.240]   to find out, for instance, that there aren't any, there aren't any battery level requirements for
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:42.240]   this to happen. That it is the idea is that if there is enough battery for you to light up the phone
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:48.480]   and dial 911, there is enough battery life to initiate an emergency, a satellite emergency call.
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:53.040]   So that I, when I saw the announcement, I was anticipating that, but that's they're gonna have
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:56.720]   to, I bet they're gonna have to turn the radios way up to get a signal. I bet this can be really
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:02.720]   costly. And if you've got less than let's say 4%, 5% battery is just not going to be a starter. But
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.560]   nope, it's, if you expect it to work, it's, as you can expect it to work.
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.800]   By the way, I think it's really interesting that Apple worked with this particular blogger
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:18.640]   to do the demo. He's a hiker, I want to say kind of like an extreme sports guy. I think he
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:24.560]   wrote about the Apple swims. Yeah. Watch Ultra too, right? So this is somebody who's like an
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:28.480]   expert in this in a way that I'm, let's face it, most tech journalists are not.
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:32.800]   I like it. I mean, you know, it shouldn't always be Neelite Patel testing everything.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:37.600]   So exactly. Exactly. And then by the way, if you want to try this, you actually, there is a demo
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:42.880]   of this that they, because they know people want to try it. So if you go in, it's in settings,
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:49.920]   emergency SOS, and you scroll down and there's a try demo option that will actually let you say,
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:54.960]   yes, I'm seeing the satellite and I would send a message and so you can feel like it actually
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:58.720]   works and I tried it without actually calling for help. Yeah. That's part. Also, if you want to,
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:03.600]   you can do, you can do Find My and if you're somewhere where you're not getting a signal,
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:07.040]   you can send your location via Find My and that's also allowed by the satellite.
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:12.080]   It's probably worth everybody spending some time actually in that emergency SOS
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:18.400]   section of the iPhone because, you know, Lisa told me, oh, look, I can put my contact
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:28.320]   information in there in my phone. So it'll work in the locks. Yeah, that's been forever,
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:32.560]   but she didn't know about it. So it's good. This is an opportune moment to do that. Let's do the
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:38.080]   try demo here and it'll show you about satellite connection gives you walks you through this whole
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:42.880]   process. I was just describing, but what it doesn't do is what DC Rainmaker finally did,
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:49.280]   which was he got to the satellite pointing screen. There are, he says, you don't need to
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:55.360]   wave your show my screen if you would. You don't need to wave your phone above your head or
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:00.640]   anything else. Just keep your phone flat like you'd be scrolling Instagram. You rotate your body or
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:07.040]   phone until it shows green. He says it took about 20 seconds. He's out in the woods somewhere.
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:15.520]   He says, what you'll find out while you're having an emergency is that the 24 satellites slowly move
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:20.480]   over the course of a couple of minutes. So you may be facing one direction when you start facing
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:26.800]   another few minutes later. So be aware of that. And then it'll send that message with all the
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:33.360]   things that you put in. And you'll see this status, keep pointing the satellite to send and receive.
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:38.080]   The emergency relay center responded within a few seconds of the message
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:44.080]   sending, which took about 30 seconds asking for more information about my location and situation.
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:47.680]   It says you've searched. I'm sorry, you've reached the emergency relay center.
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:51.120]   I'm reviewing the information you provided, described the location of the emergency.
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:58.800]   So what this is really, you know, good job, Apple. I mean, yeah, really amazing that they
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:02.000]   a lot of work. And by the way, a lot of money, almost half a billion dollars
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:07.440]   to support the satellites to make this possible. So yeah, really cool.
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:10.720]   If there's any criticism early on, said, Oh, well, Apple's of course, we're not going to see this
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:15.360]   on other phones because Apple's bought out 80 to 90% the capabilities. They, well, no, they haven't
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:21.040]   like unfairly made the given the self's monopoly. They have put the money in to make this thing exist.
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:27.120]   So yes, this is arguably their their feature. I hope I hope I hope we start to see this on other
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:31.520]   phones. But yeah, Apple is definitely this is this is not something that is necessarily going to sell
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:36.560]   more. This is this is not going to be the sort of thing that gets people to rush out and buy a new
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:40.800]   new iPhone. But it's something that absolutely is on brand for what they think the iPhone should
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:45.440]   be able to do. And this is such a significant investment of not just money, but time,
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:51.760]   intellectual resources, everything to make this work. And boy, if we thought if we thought that
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:57.680]   that Apple was showing like harrowing videos about I lost my left arm, then my right arm,
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:02.720]   fortunately, I could activate my Apple watch with my nose. And oh boy, we're going to see
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:06.800]   some harrowing videos of the next WWDC or the next event for sure.
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:11.760]   And as DC Raymaker points out, there are other devices anybody who does extreme hiking or
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:17.120]   wilderness hiking. There's a Garmin in reaches a spot tracker, which is designed to do this and
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:23.040]   probably will do a better job. He says, for sure, Apple says the main limitation here is the antenna
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:28.960]   to satellite connection is not as strong as dedicated satellite devices. So trees will impact it more
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:33.440]   the heavier the foliage, the slower the service same for mountains, even hills.
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:38.160]   If you're a wilderness adventurer, you should probably buy a dedicated device. And I know a lot
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:42.080]   of people do that and you pay for the device and there's a subscription and sometimes you can turn
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:46.400]   it on for the season and then turn it back off again. This is really for people who are just
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:51.600]   regular people with an iPhone who end up in a, you know, they're driving over a mountain pass or
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:55.680]   something and they get in a car accident or they get lost when they're hiking. But it's just a,
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:32:00.720]   you know, they're not extreme adventurers and they end up in a bad situation. And you've got your
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:04.720]   iPhone with you, right? Because why wouldn't you? And those are the people that this is going to
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:10.560]   save. The other thing he points out is you can also use this to let friends and family know
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:15.520]   where you are not in an emergency situation. Yeah, find my there's a me tab and find my.
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:21.920]   And if you don't have any visible networks, it will let you send a find my location update via
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:27.680]   satellite. So imagine if you're, yeah, if you're out somewhere and you want to let you know you're
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:31.200]   going to be out of cellular range, but you want to let your family know where you are,
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:36.000]   you can do that. It's not an emergency and it will just save that location. It'll send it up to the
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.080]   satellite. And then when somebody looks at your location, they'll say, you know, an hour ago,
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:45.840]   they were at this remote location via satellite. And you'll do the same aiming and all of that.
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:50.400]   It is not automatically updated though. You'll have to do it manually. Yeah, each time.
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:54.240]   And that's pretty cool right into camping or something. Right. Absolutely. Yeah.
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:58.480]   I mean, you get your if you're on the one and you're a little north of Jenner, you're off the
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:03.360]   grid. Right. Yeah. And so it's easy to get off. It doesn't take much to be. Yeah, it's it's it's
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:10.800]   really useful. You there is a list of predefined messages that you can send. Oh, no. I'm sorry.
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:15.920]   He says there's no option to add any informational content. He's asking for some predefined messages
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:22.160]   for this application as well. And as do some of the other devices like the spot.
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:29.760]   So it's a 1.0, right? I would not be surprised if Apple offers more customization later. And I also
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:34.240]   wouldn't be surprised if there is a I mean, they've said it's free for what two years or something
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:39.360]   like that. Like there's probably a subscription option somewhere in here. And I wonder if that
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:44.320]   might be something that if you pay a little extra, they will let you send text messages, for example.
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:49.120]   Yeah, sure. via satellite arbitrarily down the road because they're trying to keep this to the
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:53.520]   just the emergency use. He says when I go hiking in no cell areas, I'm still going to take my
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:57.360]   garment and reach device and he recommends that. But here's an interesting paragraph.
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:03.120]   I suspect in five to 10 years or even 20 years, this will become one of the most pivotal points
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:08.000]   in the history of not just the iPhone, but Apple. It can't be overstated how big a deal of this is.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.760]   Over time, this will basically put satellite emergency response in the pocket of everybody
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:21.520]   with an iPhone. Undoubtedly, others will do this from other carriers, but the Apple solution is real.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:28.720]   It's here today. And with the first international expansion plans already set for next month.
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:34.400]   Yeah, I mean, I wasn't joking earlier about the okay, I was joking with talking about the new
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:39.680]   the new. Oh, here's the situation I was in which my iPhone helped me. But the thing is like here in
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:45.600]   New England, every single every every month or more stories about how someone from a Boston
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:49.520]   College or New Hampshire College decided, Hey, we got the afternoon off and with such a beautiful
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:54.000]   day, let's go hiking up into the White Mountains with sneakers and we've got a couple power bars
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:00.240]   and we bought it. We bought a 16 hours bottle of Diet Coke and that'll do us and then they have
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:03.840]   all the energy to get three quarters, we have the mountain, not knowing that by the way,
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:08.080]   the weather up on the side of the mountain is nothing like what it's like at the base of the mountain.
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:12.080]   And you have to know how we're going to and these are these are the people who are not going to have
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:17.040]   those those specially built devices that Jason talks about. These people are going to have an
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:23.280]   iPhone and are going to say, yeah, let's try that in mercy and I'm on one because it's been a day
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:27.280]   and a half and now I'm sealing the grossing the grim spectrum of death beckoning for being
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:32.880]   above above the next ridge. Perhaps we should get some help. So thank you, Ray, the DC Rainmaker for
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:41.280]   that really good, very competent review. It's great. And he got Apple to work with them on that. So
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:48.640]   it's really, really good. Berkshire Hathaway believes in the future of TSMC. They just bought
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:58.160]   $4.1 billion worth of TSMC shares. Chris TMC makes the Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company,
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:03.200]   makes chips for a lot of companies. But Apple is the big customer. All the iPhone chips are
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:10.000]   all the iPhone CPU's are TSMC. All those A series chips are all the M1 chips also, I guess so.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:17.760]   The M series TSMC. Yeah. So that's it, baby. And they're the cutting edge of chip manufacturing
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:22.480]   right now. They're the ones who are pushing it down into smaller and smaller die sizes and like
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:27.920]   that's a that's a company. I think the only real fear with TSMC in the short term is they're
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:34.080]   in Taiwan. And China is a variable there, but they are trying to build fabs in other places. I think
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:42.240]   they've got a deal to build a fab or fabs in the US as a part of the incentives that the US
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:46.880]   government has been getting. And also, I think there's this goal to not have all the eggs being
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:53.360]   Taiwan. But yeah, that's a good investment. I'm not an investment analyst, but I see Berkshire
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:58.560]   Hathaway going in there. And I'm like, yeah, I mean, geez, they are the leader. They're the new
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:03.600]   Intel essentially. Well, and Buffett is Berkshire Hathaway is one of the largest, if not the largest
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:07.600]   Apple shareholders as well. So it's a way you could buy more Apple stock in effect, right?
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:13.840]   You know, increase your you're hedging on an Apple by my TSMC. His exposure, if something bad
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:19.040]   happens with China is pretty great at this point, but he must feel confident enough. Yeah.
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:24.640]   Well, and I think he also probably does look at their roadmap and say says that they're not going
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:34.800]   to be as dependent on China, not invading Taiwan going forward. Let's see. Oh, did you get the new
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:40.560]   Apple TV, Jason? I think you did. I did. I did. And I got it last and I didn't get to talk. I
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:44.400]   didn't think to talk about it, because it's so much like the old one, but you've got a big long
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:49.040]   article. Yeah. Well, the problem. I mean, yeah, it is like the old one. It's a faster processor.
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:52.400]   And so everything is a little more responsive. It's a little smaller. Yeah. It's got the new
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:57.920]   remote, which I think is a big improvement. It's got the new remote with the and it's USB
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:02.320]   charging now. So I don't need a lightning charger out in my living room. But the big thing that
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:08.080]   struck out struck me was, you know, in the last five years, Apple has really made great strides in
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:13.200]   making buying a new Mac or an iPhone or an iPad better where, you know, you bring it close and
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:17.040]   it does a little thing and it takes a picture of the screen and it transfers your data.
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:22.640]   And it is, you know, it sets off this transfer process and it used to be real frustrating to get
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:27.520]   a new iPhone and it's not anymore. No. Well, let me tell you, the Apple TV is not like that. The
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:33.360]   Apple TV, you bring your phone close to it and it will let you log in with your Apple ID. And if
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.920]   you've got the shared the one home screen feature turned on, it knows where your apps are supposed
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:46.240]   to be on the screen. But it doesn't restore or save or sync any data and nor is there any support
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:52.240]   on the device for iCloud keychain. So what you end up with, like me last week, when you get a new
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:58.160]   Apple TV is, do you subscribe to 10 streaming services or apps with logins? Well, guess what?
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:03.280]   You were going to sit down. Yeah. And I did this. I did this two hours before we were leaving for
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:08.400]   the weekend and we had a house sitter coming. And she loves our HBO Max, right? And I'm like,
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:13.600]   Oh, no. And I had to sit there for half an hour and log into every single app. And every app has a
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:17.600]   different case. Some of them have you scan a QR code or go to a website. Some of you want to
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:22.960]   input a password. And yeah, if you're using your iPhone to input the password, you can do iCloud
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:29.360]   keychain or one password from your iPhone. So some of them, it sort of works. Okay, sometimes
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:34.240]   inconsistently, but sometimes it works. Others, you got to go to websites. And like my previous
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:39.520]   Apple TV knew all of my accounts, right? And I just feel like this is one of those areas where
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:44.720]   Apple needs to get with a program and do for the Apple TV what it did for all of its other devices,
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:49.520]   because buying a new Apple product and saying, yeah, yeah, I am going to update my Apple TV. I
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:54.480]   don't need to, but I need an extra one. And so why not get the new one? The last thing you want
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:59.200]   is a roadblock where you're like, yeah, but I don't really want to log into everything again. So I
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:05.360]   just won't buy it. And that's when like, for me, the Apple TV is the argument of why I don't want
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:09.440]   the app store opened is I don't want I don't want to have multiple ways to pay for things. I don't
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:15.680]   want to because I literally have the not the new Apple TV. I have the last generation sitting next
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:20.160]   to the current Apple TV, because like, I was like, I didn't want to do it, Jason. I opened it up and
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:25.520]   I was like, and I plugged it in, and I went to the first app and I was like, let's screw this and I
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:30.320]   just put the other back. I'll get to that later. I'll just like, I get that authentic authentic
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:36.240]   with web services for disparate partners is hard. Like, I totally get it. But like, how about an
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:42.640]   effort to do something like, you know, saving it on device and working with the partners so that
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:49.520]   there's a way to save a token that identifies you or validates in the same way for every single app?
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:53.680]   Want that because I noticed, for instance, I have to log into Showtime every three weeks now in
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:41:00.960]   my Apple TV. And I think the partners are so afraid of getting the stolen, you know, the shared
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:07.840]   account that sure, but I mean, even even remembering who I am and having me validate in some way
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:12.560]   that's consistent would be better than nothing. I have to fire my laptop every time for Showtime
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:18.160]   and go to Showtime anytime. That's very bad and they should feel bad. And I think it's them
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:23.200]   that make Apple do this. Did you had did you didn't? I don't remember, but I don't think I had to
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:28.720]   tell who my cable provider was again, though, right? It didn't copy that. That's my problem is I
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:32.960]   don't but at least it was able to do that with Xfinity so that because a lot of that stuff's
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:37.600]   through Xfinity. No, no, it forgot it didn't know my provider and it didn't know my permission
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:42.400]   settings. So then it asked for every app that wanted to pair and look at my Fubo TV log.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:47.760]   I had to approve them again because it didn't remember any of that. It didn't remember my
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:52.400]   sync frame rates, sync HDR display preferences. It remembered absolutely nothing.
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:56.880]   So all it got was your Apple ID. That was it. And the home screen sync, which is better than
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:00.560]   I mean, imagine if you had to download every app and put it back where you want it. Like,
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:05.760]   at least it does that. But that's literally all it does. And it needs it just needs to do more. And
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:10.320]   I had somebody write in and say, you know what bothers me is that you can log in multiple people
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:16.240]   with multiple Apple IDs to an Apple TV now, but that none of the apps support pairing those with
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:21.680]   profiles. And that's true. That's not as I mean, it's sort of on Apple. But really, there is an
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:27.760]   API to do that. It's just that no app developer seems to care. So like HBO, I believe could say,
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:34.080]   Oh, you are logged in as Jason's wife. So I'm going to use your profile. It doesn't do that. It
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:40.560]   asks you Disney asks you all of them just ask who's watching now. So I don't know, it just it could
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:46.400]   be better. And I hadn't set up a new Apple TV in a while. And I think what the real story is that
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:50.800]   Apple has raised the bar on upgrading other devices so much in the last few years, because
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:55.520]   it used to be really bad. And now it's pretty good. But then you get the Apple TV and you're like,
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:43:00.480]   it's like the product that time forgot. Like it's just back in the old bad days. And they haven't
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:04.720]   put any effort into making it better. And again, I think that it came to they didn't have a lot
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:08.400]   of leverage when they started the Apple TV and they were desperate to have the content providers
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:14.160]   play. And so they capitulated to them and now we're paying for it. And that's why I don't think
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:18.960]   they capitulate. But iCloud keychain is a perfect example. Right? Like, like you could save your
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:25.760]   passwords for all those services on the Apple TV, right? Or sync with iCloud. And it's just like,
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:31.360]   no, you can do it for some of them. If they let you do an input instead of going to a web page,
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:34.800]   and you can do it on your phone, right? You can use your password manager on your phone. And I think
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:38.800]   either log in on the web or not, but it's not the same as just being able to sit there and go,
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:44.880]   yes, log me into Disney. And it's so obvious that I feel like there's something there from the
[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:49.520]   folks that have the apps that don't know, you know, I think that it's more than just them making
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:53.200]   it easy because I think if they make it easy, then it's, I don't know, it just it just seems so
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:59.360]   insane, you know, and and it is. And again, what what what has happened to me, what's currently
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:02.960]   happening now is that I have one that I bought right when it came out and it's still sitting there
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:08.320]   because I just was like, Oh my gosh, I have some apps. Now I'm slowly just clipping the apps. So I
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:13.520]   go, if an app has an external, if it doesn't say restore, and the worst one is masterclass, by the
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:19.840]   way, masterclass, what I what I the payoff for me, as soon as masterclass was available,
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:26.080]   I got excited. I went and bought the one year subscription right through the Apple, you know,
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:32.560]   in the Apple ecosystem, because that's how masterclass started. Now masterclass wants a email and I'm
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:38.800]   like, I don't have one. It's like, I don't have an email because I bought it as a user side of the
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:42.640]   thing. And they're like, well, you just got to put your email in. I'm like, I don't have an email,
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:46.960]   like I don't like I bought it. And I paid for it. And I haven't been able to use it on any of my
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:51.600]   devices. Oh, after two years, after two years of pain, I don't know 300 bucks or whatever, I was
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:55.040]   like, yeah, the heck with this guy, I literally because I would go up and I get it, I go back and
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:45:00.400]   forth with support. And it'd be enough for me to think maybe I can figure this out. And then I
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:04.400]   just was like, I can't figure this out. So I don't use like, I think masterclass is one of the best
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:10.640]   things ever. And I don't use it because of their, you know, they changed the system midstream. And
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:15.600]   just basically you don't exist. You know, if you if you are an early adopter through the Apple
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:20.800]   system, it's as if you didn't exist. That always makes me nervous. So when I use Apple to sign up
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:25.120]   for something, I love the subscriptions, the ability to cancel them and all that stuff. But I'm always
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:31.280]   nervous because I don't have a real login. And a lot of sites, masterclass will have a way around
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:36.080]   that. So you know, you signed up with Apple, why don't you give us a password and a login?
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:40.800]   Well, the funny thing is the masterclass made me so angry that now I sign up for things, and then
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:45.600]   I just I go right to my subscriptions and I say cancel. And it says you're gonna cancel and then
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:49.360]   a month from now or a year from now, whatever my subscription is. And I'm like, yeah, and you'll
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:54.000]   send me emails and tell me that I'm that that it's gonna get canceled. And then if I if I'm using it,
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.120]   that's when you get the password back on. But no, no, that's smart. Again. So I buy everything.
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:04.400]   And I won't buy anything new that requires a login. Like I have all the content. I will not
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:10.720]   on Apple TV, there is no amount of content that you could provide for me that I would log into. I
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:16.800]   have Disney, Netflix, HBO, Apple TV. I don't care about anybody else. Like if I can't log in,
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:21.440]   as soon as it says, I want a your email and password, I go, Nope, I'm not gonna buy that anymore. Like,
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:27.200]   I just I just walk away because I I'm like, I have plenty of content to watch. And you don't
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:32.160]   and this is where Apple needed to get is as a user, I don't as if you're a content provider,
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:37.280]   I don't need you anymore. Like, I don't need I don't I have all the content that I that I need.
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:42.240]   There's like paramount. I don't I don't I'm paramount. I did did subscribe to because it was
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:46.560]   I could do it inside of the app. So so but then I can't say it wasn't enough. Yeah.
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:52.320]   But it but it's not Apple TV is such a unique thing for for Apple where it is probably the only
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:57.840]   product where they can't just tell people to go pound sand because if they say YouTube, we're
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:02.080]   concerned about your data collection here are new requirements and Apple and Google could say,
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:09.440]   okay, well, enjoy not having YouTube. The one one of the like the four apps that everybody expects
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:14.480]   to have on every single streaming platform will will be at the big old place of the street. If
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:18.000]   you want to talk if you change your mind and want to talk about this, and I will say YouTube and
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:24.480]   YouTube TV are like, that's like 70% of our diet. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Honestly, every, you know,
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:30.800]   I am in the position now where it's like, it just I Netflix and Hulu and a couple other
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:35.360]   channels are like, I buy I have Netflix for that two or three times a month where I don't know,
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:39.120]   I want to relax and watch something. I wonder if there's something interesting on Netflix as
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:44.320]   opposed to Oh, I'm so excited about this new thing that's on Netflix. And I and because all of these
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:48.880]   other paid services are so vulnerable because I mean, just you just heard me talk about I got
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:53.840]   immediately recall a video on tech that Techmoan published that I love that immediately at the
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:58.880]   forefront of my brain because I spend so much of my time just watching stuff on YouTube instead of
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:04.320]   like, I'm I'm I'm Disney. I'm so glad you're spending hundreds of millions of dollars acquiring
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:09.600]   licenses and developing TV shows. But you've realized that you are competing against somebody
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:16.240]   who's going to try to try to crush a bowling ball with a hydraulic press. And you're often
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:20.720]   failing to compete with that guy. I mean, the body that is for Disney and now HBO, they just
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:24.480]   have a new thing out on for Game of Thrones, like behind the scenes of how it got made.
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:29.520]   Right. I like the I like the I really got to the point where I enjoy the behind the scenes from
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:33.440]   Disney more than the shows. Like I just I just want, you know, I know that I'm vertical, but
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:37.280]   it's like a and a lot of people I know like, Oh, well, you can't you can't drop your Disney
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:40.960]   subscription because I've got all those behind the seats. It's smart. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:45.840]   Yeah. I've gotten bored. I've gotten bored. I'm most of their their kind of stuff. Like,
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:49.840]   it's too much, you know, it's it's I won't turn this into a long rattle. I'll just say that I came
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:55.520]   to a I finally came up the way of explaining to myself and understanding what it is that
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:49:01.520]   kind of makes me uncomfortable about about Disney that it really is like going into a casino
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:07.040]   because you feel as though every I'm paying you a certain I'm paying you like 10 bucks a month for
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:12.320]   Disney for Disney Plus, but every piece of content is there not to show here's something from another
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:16.080]   studio. Oh, here's a documentary about something completely unrelated to anything that Disney has
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:21.040]   any monetary interest in. It's no, it's like, we want you to stay in there and gamble. Oh, you want
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:25.840]   to eat? We have a fine selection of restaurants inside our casino. Oh, why don't you take Oh, why
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:31.040]   should take a break from gambling? Go and see Penn and tell her inside our casino. It's like,
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:36.560]   it's I would love to see them have like a third party do here is some here is why it kind of
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:41.600]   stinks to have to do special effects for Disney for Disney productions or here is how difficult
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:47.120]   it was here's how difficult was to make this movie that Disney has no stake in. It's it's it's
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:52.160]   it's it shouldn't make a difference because the content is the content, the shows and the movies,
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:56.400]   they're the shows and the movies, but there's something that just makes me feel like, oh,
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:00.240]   I wasn't really gonna let them work to me. Have you guys watched and or yet?
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:07.280]   I thought it was great. Yes. All the reviews. Yes. Yes. Yes. It is spectacularly good.
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:12.720]   So good. I think in maybe in part because it's more like a historical drama that happens to be
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:18.960]   set in a star wars place instead of a an earth place, but it's not about. I mean, it's it's really
[01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:26.240]   this kind of interesting anti fascist rise of the rebellion spy story. It's it's excellent. It's
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:30.320]   so good. That's actually really smart. Don't make it a star wars story. Just make it in the
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:35.600]   Star Wars universe. Yeah, it's interesting. It's got a couple of characters you've seen in other
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:40.560]   places, mostly that rogue one movie that came out a few years ago, which was also kind of similar
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:45.920]   in the tone. It takes its time. It's actually it feels to me like it's four movies kind of stuck
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:50.160]   together. So some of the episodes just kind of end because it's the middle of the movie. And they
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:55.920]   and so the way it's chopped up episode by episodes, a little bit weird, but the overall story, I mean,
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:01.040]   I I think it's the best bit of Star Wars that's been done since. A lot of people are saying that.
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:04.720]   Okay, now I'm gonna have to watch it except it's real good. I'm saying like since row one.
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:08.480]   For grown up. Yeah, I mean, that would be the other way to go. Yeah, right. Like, yeah,
[01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:16.880]   yeah, it's it's it's a legitimate. It's a legitimate, excellent modern streaming series drama. Good.
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:22.400]   Like full stop, not like for Star Wars. Yeah, for for just, well, it's like it's because it is a
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:28.400]   very good show. And I didn't make it through Obi one. Yeah, I got I got two. I didn't even try.
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:33.920]   Here's the problem with a lot of these is that they I think from a budget perspective, they kind
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:37.600]   of sandbag you for the first couple episodes. And so it's really slow. And then it's not as
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:40.960]   expensive. I felt like that was what would happen with Lord of the Rings. Because Lord of the
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:46.240]   the, you know, the the rings of power. Yeah, last two episodes are pretty good. And now you're
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:51.360]   ready to watch the next one. I almost didn't make it. I got through two episodes. And then it
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:57.040]   just sat there. And until I had friends constantly telling me, well, everybody said episode six,
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:52:00.400]   it takes off. Yeah, like, you know, like you got to watch the thing and watch the episode six.
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:05.200]   And so then I came back to it. But it was, but but I think that they, you know, and for a while,
[01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:09.280]   Disney was doing like the this bump where it would start at the top and it'd be really action
[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:12.880]   pack for the first two episodes. And then the middle ones would be really boring. And then it
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:16.800]   popped back up. Remember, this is going to be great next time. Yeah, the structure of Andor is
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:22.240]   more like one to three as a movie. Yeah, four, five and six as a movie, 79, 10 as a movie. And then
[01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:25.600]   there's like the last two, I don't know what they're going to be because they haven't been out yet.
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:30.240]   But that's the that's the kind of pacing. And that's the problem I have with is I get why they
[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:34.240]   wanted to stretch it out and have it be that way. And the episodes are like an hour long each. But
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:38.320]   but really to get the vibe of Andor, you've got to watch the first three because that's really the
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:43.840]   first story arc of the thing. And it's it does play like a movie. And the writer, Tony Gilroy, is a
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:49.360]   film screenwriter. And like, so I have some questions about like calling this a TV show and
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:53.840]   having it some of the episodes just literally they just end and you're like, Oh, I guess that's
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:58.480]   over for this week. I think it plays I think it will play really well when you can binge watch and
[01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:04.240]   you can watch all three at once. You know, and then choose whether you want to watch the next three.
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:09.360]   I think it'll play better that way. I hate to be the downer on this but this but this but it
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:14.960]   else it really does point out like why I have difficulty with Disney and and the what they're
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:22.400]   doing with Star Wars in a broad sense that like it's I keep seeing all these premises for new Star
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:28.960]   Wars series and new Marvel series more new Star Wars series. And I'm thinking, yes, but what if
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:36.000]   you were to create just here is like a fantasy science fiction slash whatever future future
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:42.480]   the panopticon style spy story. What if you didn't actually tie it into Star Wars? What if you try
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:47.280]   to create something new? And I think the example of what of course we're going to tie it into Star
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:52.080]   Wars? Why would we not like want to expand the property? And it makes me think about things like
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:58.160]   well, what if if they came up if the if someone proposed Blade Runner to Disney, you know that
[01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:02.880]   they would turn it into Oh no, they're hunting down rogue like Empire robots. And that would
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:08.480]   diminish it because now it's not its own thing with its own vibe, its own characters. It just
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:14.960]   all says that it annoys me that even these little things where someone has to show up of course,
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:19.760]   it's going to be baby Yoda or so or so they've got a they've got a container that they're shipping
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:24.720]   this thing. And of course, it's the ice cream maker from that can be that little thing in
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:29.680]   Empire Strikes Back because it has to it has to give us the satisfaction of knowing that we've
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:33.920]   paying off something else as opposed to make something perfect in and of itself. I'm just watching
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:41.280]   and or and get back to me because it it refrained from almost my understanding is basically that
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:45.840]   the the people who ran the show didn't really care about Star Wars lore. They just wanted to tell a
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:50.240]   set a story in this particular time in this particular place. I think the art department sticks
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:54.160]   some stuff in the background that you're like, Oh, I sort of see that. But really other than
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:58.640]   there's a couple legacy characters who are there just to tie it into the the like if you're going
[01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:01.920]   to do a story about the rise of the rebellion, there's some characters you need to at least address
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:07.920]   their existence because they're in Star Wars, but like it's not like the others. And I think that
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:13.200]   that's why even though it is not being watched by as many people, it has gotten such great reviews.
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:19.520]   And I think shows you what Star Wars could be, which is an interesting setting for interesting
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:24.080]   stories that don't have to play the games of fan service that Andy just said. And you're right.
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:28.320]   I mean, Tony Gilroy could have made this somewhere else maybe, but he would have had to get somebody
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:34.480]   to put up the money and he wouldn't have been as much money as making it a Star Wars. But I mean,
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:36.960]   it's really got my highest endorsement. It's very, very good.
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:42.960]   Okay. That's a very strong endorsement for you. That's when Jason Snow, Jason Snow, he's not like,
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:46.400]   he likes lots of things, but the things that he likes are always very good.
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:47.440]   I got to move you along a little bit.
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:48.000]   All right.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:48.560]   Go, go, go.
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:48.880]   Real quick.
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:50.160]   He's not a Star Wars podcast. What?
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:55.920]   Did you get the 128 gig.
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:00.080]   Apple TV. There is.
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:05.760]   Yes. Like from Apple Insider, a report. I haven't confirmed myself of a bug that says,
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:09.440]   if you got the 128 gig Apple TV, you don't have more than 64 gigs.
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:13.920]   So just, I don't, I don't know if you've seen this,
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:20.080]   but I just noted this and I'll pass also.
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:23.280]   Also unclear whether that's a display error or an actual thing, right?
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:26.560]   Because sometimes you get those things. It's like that SSD thing where everybody's like,
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:32.560]   "Oh God, the SSDs in Apple Silicon Macs are being written to all this time and it's going to destroy
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:36.720]   the SSD." And it turned out it was the tool that they were using to see that wasn't updated.
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:38.240]   And so that wasn't happening.
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:43.840]   If you have to, if you have the size, right, if you've filled 64 gigs and then you try to
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:48.560]   download a game or an app, you'll get a message. This app can't be installed because there isn't more
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:49.360]   enough space.
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:54.480]   Gonna guess that's a bug that they're gonna fix. Otherwise, there'll be another class
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:55.680]   that's in Los Angeles.
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:58.880]   It's the first time they've had 128 gigs, right? So maybe it's just
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:00.880]   TVOS update.
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:03.600]   Yeah, they forgot to do that. They forgot to flip that switch.
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:08.400]   And please don't cry, but the Mariah Carey Christmas
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:11.760]   special has moved from Apple TV to CBS.
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:13.520]   Sorry.
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:15.200]   What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:16.000]   I was gonna cry.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.720]   It's the worst thing I've ever seen. I just want to say.
[01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:19.840]   Oh my gosh, it was so bad.
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:20.720]   So horrible.
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:23.200]   It was just. Oh my gosh.
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:28.000]   See, at least on Apple TV, it was contained. It wasn't in our airways.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.840]   Now it's on CBS, baby.
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:30.480]   So dead.
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:33.200]   I might be in the internet.
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:36.560]   Then it'll be on MTV where it's bound to get a good reception.
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:39.120]   I watched a couple of minutes of it and I skipped forward.
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:40.480]   I was like, it can't all be this bad.
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:41.920]   And it's all that bad.
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:42.560]   It can't all.
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:44.400]   It can't be all that bad.
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:46.560]   It is there. There's so much chatter. You'd be surprised.
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:51.120]   I need to. I'll tell you what, if I were on LSD or Molly, maybe
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:54.080]   then you'd go, wow, look at the pretty colors.
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:57.680]   Because I feel like it was made by somebody on LSD.
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:03.440]   technical perspective, but it was just like the quality of the composite story.
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:04.320]   Oh, it's horrible.
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:06.240]   Emigration and focal length.
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:09.520]   And please don't get grossed out, but Steve Jobs, old Birkenstock,
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:16.400]   have just been sold at auction for $218,750.
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:18.720]   And there's an NFT.
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:20.240]   And there's an NFT.
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:23.120]   The auction.
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:24.480]   Someone's got Conan on their mind.
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:24.880]   They're going to.
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:28.800]   I actually have Birkenstocks that look just like that.
[01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:34.480]   So maybe, I don't know, according to Julian's auctions,
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:38.400]   Jobs gave the sandals to his house manager, Mark Chef.
[01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:40.800]   Wow. Thanks, Steve.
[01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:41.840]   You're worth how much?
[01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:46.480]   But they did not confirm that it was Chef who had listed the lot.
[01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:50.640]   The sandals were part of his simple side.
[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:56.720]   They were his uniform, says Chris Ann, Steve's jotter, in an interview in 2018.
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:59:00.960]   The great thing about a uniform is you don't have to worry about what to wear in the morning.
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:02.080]   We don't know who bought it.
[01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:08.000]   You also got the 213 most important men in my life book.
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:13.040]   Or an NFT of those sandals.
[01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:17.760]   That's exactly what Birkenstocks look like after you've worn them for a while.
[01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:24.720]   When we moved to California in 1971,
[01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:29.200]   the house that we moved into, the farm that we moved into,
[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:30.800]   when I was a kid, I was in high school,
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:35.680]   was previously owned by the US distributor of Birkenstocks.
[01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:37.520]   She had brought Birkenstock to America.
[01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:42.800]   And they apparently moved out in a hurry because in the garage,
[01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:46.080]   there were like 20,000 Birkenstock catalogs.
[01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:48.560]   And at the time, what you would do is you'd get your foot wet,
[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:52.800]   and in the back page of the catalog, you'd step on it and the wet foot would make an imprint
[01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:56.000]   of your foot because the Birkenstocks were made to conform to your foot.
[01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:02.160]   And I had great fun at the age of 15 putting my foot on a lot of those catalogs.
[02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:04.960]   For a minute there, I thought you were about to say,
[02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:10.480]   and so we have tens of thousands of filthy footprints, total crangers across the
[02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:19.680]   everywhere. Let's take a break. When we come back, you, my friends, will give us your picks of the week.
[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:27.520]   First a word from Adagie. Okay, Mac people, you Mac party people.

[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:12.960]   Adagie, Add, i-g-y. It's actually really cool. They've created a solution that's so flexible,
[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:18.960]   so customizable. Any IT team can use it to easily maintain and secure their Apple devices in a

[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:32.000]   supported and you're ready to scale. I love the zero-touch deployment. You don't have to go down the

[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:16.720]   applications because they just go online and fix it. You get patch management, fix bugs early,

[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:49.920]   adegis.com/twit. Do you have a pick for us this week?
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:57.600]   I do. I wanted to solve a very simple problem, which is we have a bunch of local newspapers
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:01.600]   here in the Bay Area that are owned by the same company, the media news group I think,
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:07.520]   so like the San Jose Mercury News and the Marin Independent Journal. I, as a Marin resident and
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:15.200]   a digital subscriber to the Marin IJ to read my local news, a lot of my favorite sort of sports
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:18.560]   coverage is coming from people at the Mercury News. And it's like, well, I don't want to really
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:23.680]   pay for them because I'm already paying. And then I realized their stories are, they're using the
[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:29.360]   same CMS. All their stories are exactly the same when you change the domain to Marin IJ from Mercury
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:36.000]   News, the stories load. And I'm paying on that site. So I was like, well, can I just automatically
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:40.880]   redirect all these links I'm seeing on the internet to Mercury News to Marin IJ so I don't have to
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:46.080]   retype it. I don't have to think about it. And the answer is, guess what? There is a Safari plugin
[02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:53.280]   for that called redirect web for Safari. It's free if you want to do more than one and sync it
[02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:59.200]   through iCloud, you pay four bucks. And you can put in regular expressions or a simple wild card if
[02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:04.400]   you don't want to deal with it. And it will automatically redirect every page that matches
[02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:09.520]   to what you want it to redirect to. So I'm doing that for the Mercury News to the Marin IJ. I'm doing
[02:05:09.520 --> 02:05:15.760]   that for all these links people post to the IMDB mobile site that is a layout I do not like
[02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:24.480]   to redirect all those to www.imdb.com, which has a different layout that is nice. And it works great.
[02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:30.720]   It's real simple. There are other apps that will do this. If you use Stop the Madness, which is a
[02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:35.520]   more expensive plugin that does a whole lot more stuff, this is also a feature of Stop the Madness.
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:40.320]   So you can use that. But I just wanted this super simple thing, which is I know that I want
[02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:44.560]   the URLs that look like this to look like this instead. And you can use it for stripping out
[02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:51.120]   things or rewriting affiliate codes or whatever you want. You can do it using redirect web for
[02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:55.840]   Safari. I love how simple it is. And of course, now that Safari plugins run on iOS as well,
[02:05:55.840 --> 02:06:01.360]   this is on my iPad and my Mac and my iPhone. And yeah, really simple and effective.
[02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:09.680]   Mac iPhone and iPad redirect web for Safari by Manabu Nakazawa free within app purchases.
[02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:15.440]   Yeah, there's like a subscription. Don't get that. Use it. And if you like it, pay them four bucks.
[02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:19.520]   Why would you pay them two dollars a month or whatever? Four bucks. Four bucks cheap.
[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:25.440]   Four bucks. Nice. Why this must happen a lot? It's enough to write an app for it.
[02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:29.040]   It drives me nuts. Well, I mean, all these sports writers that I follow on Twitter
[02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:33.680]   are like, here's my latest story about about college football or pro football or the Warriors
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:38.800]   or whatever. And they're all like mercurynews.com. And I'm like, dude, I don't like, I want paying
[02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:44.240]   for the other one. Don't send me there. And like, yeah, now I never have to think about it again.
[02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:51.680]   It makes me happy. Mr Andy, not co pick of the week. Mine is a really fun app that just came out
[02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:57.920]   recently. It is a field guide to worldwide Apple stores. It's called facades was created by Michael
[02:06:57.920 --> 02:07:02.240]   Steber. It's a free app that now I know that you can go, you can have the Apple store app and it
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:06.160]   will show you, Oh, here's the nearest Apple store. And yes, it does have a genius bar. This is
[02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:11.120]   again, it's a field guide. It's like, Hey, I'm in, I'm in Boston. What's the local Apple store like?
[02:07:11.120 --> 02:07:16.160]   And is it interesting enough that I'd like to go visit it? And it is, it is just like there are
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:20.320]   people who are like train spotters who have no who have notes on every. Well, it's got the
[02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:25.440]   it's got the four by four by three bogeys that was upgraded through the Manson switch. This is
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:30.640]   this this app is that detailed. And if you look at if you look, I've got a front of it right now,
[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:35.680]   it's like, okay, is it a classic a classic upgrade and NSD style or is the vintage D dot two?
[02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:46.000]   Wow. The Apple Bridgeport Village opened on, opened on June 4 2005. It moved on November 12,
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:53.840]   2022. It's got avenues, it's got graphic panels, got a pickup counter, and store number R134.
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:59.840]   And you can and of course, and you can bookmarks, bookmark stuff. You can do searches based on
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:03.680]   features of the store. The only thing that it doesn't have that I really wish it would have,
[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:09.040]   it is a 1.0. And I'm sending in like feedback on this is I really, really want that have a
[02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:14.400]   category of these are the let me show me show me if there are any flagship stores nearby,
[02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:18.560]   or just give me a list of all the flagship stores like the ones where oh my god, I was in
[02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:23.600]   Chicago and there's like a Chicago flagship store like where I actually needed to charge up my phone
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:28.080]   and maybe get access to Wi-Fi anyway, I would have loved to have visited like the Paris Opera House
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:34.320]   store or again, and of these architecturally significant stores where they took a brilliant
[02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:39.280]   piece of 100 year old architecture, refitted it in the most sensitive historical way and
[02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:43.520]   it's just a beautiful place to be for 35 minutes while you charge your phone or just
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:47.600]   need something else to do while I'm waiting for someone to meet someone for dinner.
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:52.240]   And it's a free app and I just love the amount of specific love that went into this. There's
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:59.200]   everybody is the guy, non-gender specific, you know what I mean, the person who is that interested
[02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:04.160]   in this topic that they want to build an app like this and they are so helpful to the rest of us
[02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:08.720]   who are interested, but certainly not willing to create an entire app that makes it an easy way
[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:14.240]   to bookmark these places and find out like hidden details like stores that close like oh my god,
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:21.360]   there are 14 stores that closed. It's like the Apple Willow Road store, open August 3rd, 2001,
[02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:28.560]   permanently closed April 12th 2019. It's so much fun to play through it and it works for
[02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:34.400]   works for the iPhone, works on the iPad, it will also work on the Mac so it is completely ecumenical,
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:40.560]   it embraces the form factors of all shapes. I did want to mention Andy and no slight on you,
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:44.160]   the keyboard you recommended last week I ordered it because I thought that sounds really great,
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:51.360]   $219 and it arrived at an arrival, it's just nothing like they don't test it or something. So I was a
[02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:57.360]   little miffed, I haven't. Thanks for what do we know? Yours was fine though, right? It worked out
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:02.160]   of the box. It worked out of the box, another actually another, I'll also say that I did complain
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:05.920]   that my moment complaint about it was that it doesn't have backlit keys. Someone on Twitter
[02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:11.040]   mentioned that hey Logitech makes something that's kind of similar that is backlit and costs like
[02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:16.640]   $100 less. It doesn't look like it has the same sort of build quality on this. The thing is,
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:22.240]   yeah, which is why I'm so disappointed. I plugged it in a bunch of different Macs and nothing.
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:28.960]   So I don't maybe in transit something fell apart. I'm going to call them and say hey guys,
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:32.960]   do you test this before you ship them out? That's a curiosity.
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:41.680]   Did you plug them? Are they all M1s that you plugged it into? Yeah. This just happened to me.
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:46.880]   I tore the new background, I tore the whole place apart, put it all back together. Just as a node,
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:52.000]   I don't know if this is connected. I could not get my Apple, I mean I just have an Apple keyboard
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:58.800]   to talk to my studio and I was like what is going on and I plugged into all, you know,
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:03.360]   try to figure it all out. I plugged it, I was like I'm going to build it back the way I had it.
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:09.520]   So I plugged it into a KVM that I have that is bus powered, but I plugged into the KVM.
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:17.040]   Yeah, they do say it should be plugged into a USB hub. Maybe they need more power. Yeah,
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:23.280]   like I had never seen that before. I tried to have my two MacBooks here in my Mac studio and it
[02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:27.920]   just nothing. That's my Mac studio. So but what I will say is my Mac studio couldn't see it until
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:34.880]   now the weird thing about this is my Mac studio is powering the hub that is going into the keyboard,
[02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:38.640]   but if I plug the keyboard directly into the Mac studio, it will actually work. And if I plug it
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:45.920]   into the KVM, it will work. I did plug it into the CalDigit Thunderbolt 4 thing. That's powered.
[02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:49.520]   It's got a hundred watts, you could charge a laptop on it and it still didn't work. So,
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:56.720]   I have my plug directly into USB-C on my M1 MacBook Pro, some help wouldn't be. Maybe you did get a
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:00.560]   different one. I just got a bad one. I'll call. Anyway, I just wanted to
[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:06.000]   know. No reflection on you, obviously. And it also gives me a chance. I do wish that I had
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:10.960]   mentioned in the rundown. Oh, by the way, if you don't necessarily want something that could stop
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:16.000]   a bullet like a Bible in Ned Flanger's pocket, maybe you can save a hundred dollars and get a
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:20.880]   lot of the hey, I want something better than Apple's Magic Keyboard, but not necessarily spending
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:25.120]   two hundred and thirty dollars for something. Because I've also had extremely good luck with
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:32.880]   Logitech keyboards. They focus on this. It is an Apple specific thing with Apple specific keys on
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:38.800]   it and it works extremely well. I just find out even the Logitech ones, they have the Logitech
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:44.000]   Wave keyboard years ago that I loved so much that I bought two extras because I did go through
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:49.680]   them every two and a half years. They would be like, "Okay, now that's four. I can no longer
[02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:55.680]   handle the mental band, the mental load of writing without an E and R or a J. So let's
[02:12:55.680 --> 02:12:58.800]   let's switch to the next one or spend another hundred and ten dollars for a new keyboard."
[02:12:58.800 --> 02:13:03.280]   Yeah, I'm disappointed because it's such a beautiful tank of a keyboard. I don't want to
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:07.440]   show you. And also because they have they have they have standard cherry switches like if you
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:13.920]   bring a key, you can you can replace a key. Yeah. Mr. Alex Lindsey. I did I had the
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:18.640]   DOS keyboard as well. I loved it except to clickity. Like I got the keyboard and then
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:24.640]   that's what I want. I was like, "I need this to be quiet." You know, like I'll say that's
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:30.880]   why like on the podcasting desk, I have the super, super quiet keyboard and then I have the one
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:34.640]   that I use when I'm actually writing writing writing. I should have read it like it's right
[02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:40.080]   at here, but I will. Alex, your pick of the week. Yeah, so this one won't cost you anything.
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:45.840]   We had this conversation. It came up in office hours and then it came up a couple more places
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:51.680]   last week and I was like, "I just need to pick this up." I'm recommending Apple Notes. Some of
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:56.000]   you will not be using notes. Some of you are using Evernote or you're using something else.
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:00.320]   And I just I just really got clear talk. I was talking to someone a couple different times,
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:03.280]   as I said, last week about how it's just like the core of my,
[02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:08.640]   couple of notes, like the core of my existence. Like, you know, and it's just such a powerful app.
[02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:13.120]   And the fact that I use it a lot of interesting features that if you start, for instance, if you
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:19.440]   type an airline and flight number, it will give you the flight information. It'll fill in the
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:24.000]   note with the flight information. And then you can share it with other people. So I got tired of
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:28.400]   explaining to my mom a bunch of different stuff or telling her where a show was or whatever.
[02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:31.440]   So I made a note and shared it with her. So it shows up on her notes.
[02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:35.760]   Yeah. This is a well under appreciated app. I agree with you.
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:41.760]   And I share, I share check. If I'm going shopping, I'll share my checklist of what I'm going to go by,
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:45.920]   you know, at the whole foods or whatever my wife just keeps on adding things to it.
[02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:51.040]   Like, you know, you know, and so, oh, yeah, yeah, and then we, it eliminates the text that I
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:54.160]   don't get when I should have and everything else. I keep looking at the list and working through it.
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:58.560]   And it's updated on a manly, right? Yeah. And the, and the fact that you can draw,
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:01.280]   you know, you can draw on there, you know, I wish you could draw over top of the text,
[02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:04.880]   but you can drop between it and so you can draw little sketches. So I draw little sketches in there
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:11.040]   of things. And like when I open up a, every meeting I have with somebody, I go, I, I start off with
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:21.440]   the client, the project and the date, your first thing, but anyway, so. And so, so, date, your month
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:26.160]   day period, the time that I had the meeting. So I can always go back and find out what was that
[02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:30.080]   subject about. And then I keep it in there. Now anytime I need to find something, I just search,
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:34.480]   I just, you know, search for whatever and for that client or that date or like, I remember, you know,
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:38.880]   whatever the, or the project and I can always find them. And the thing is, is that it's, and I have
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:44.960]   folders of stuff of ideas. Like I have like second hour ideas for office hours and I have,
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:49.120]   you know, product, you know, all the videos that someday I'll make on YouTube, like all these
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:53.120]   things that I, that I, that I have, but I keep them in these little folders and these little sections
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:59.040]   of ideas. And it's just such a, it's such a powerful application that I think that it's worth
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:05.600]   digging in. And I know that I'm still only using like five or 10% of the, yeah, of what I had, I had,
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:09.440]   I had one, I had to change the weird light bulb and I just took a picture of it and put it in notes
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:15.040]   and that's, I just looked down, I just like to select the text in the picture. Like, I'm sorry,
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:19.840]   I'm sorry, I'm easily amazed, but I was like, it's a circular object and I took a picture. I just
[02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:24.480]   took, I just put my hand up there and took a picture of it without even looking, brought it back down
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:28.160]   and selected the text, you know, and, and, but I had it notes for some other reason. But the point
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:34.400]   is there's so much power in that, in that app and the fact that it sits on all my devices,
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:39.920]   it's also this thing like I keep, I keep all kinds of like links that I need to get into this show.
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:44.240]   Like, so it's one of my saved links at the top is the old link until we get the new one working.
[02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:50.400]   But I always, I don't have to go find it. Like, where did I put that or whatever? And I have all
[02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:54.080]   kinds of stuff like that that it just makes it easy for me to get to the places that I need to
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:58.320]   get to regularly. And it works on what I know is that if I get a new device or if I have any device,
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:01.760]   I just open it up and there's my links, you know, and there's my there's the stuff that I have and
[02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:06.080]   I don't have to figure it out. I don't really need it to be cross platform. So it works great for me.
[02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:10.720]   Anyway, it's just a, it's a really great app. And I think that if you haven't used it or if you
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:14.080]   don't use it, if you're not using it like 10 times a day, you should take it.
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:19.520]   I completely agree with you. It's like the, the hidden beauty of,
[02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:23.920]   I might use it 10 times an hour. Like it just opened all the time for all my stuff.
[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:29.200]   It's always there. Yeah. I'm trying to remember how I got the flight information
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:35.120]   thing to show up. I think there might be some trick. Just open notes, enter your flight number
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:41.600]   and tap on done. Okay, let me try that here. That's the other thing I'm on, I'm on Linux, but I can,
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:49.120]   I can do this. Where's the done button? I don't see a done button.
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:53.840]   I've been up, up or right? Yeah. See, maybe because I'm on the, I'm on the web now. So maybe that's why
[02:17:53.840 --> 02:18:00.160]   I don't, I don't have the same thing. Anyway, I've, I've done it before. It works. You get the,
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:03.520]   you get the flights. It's cool. Flight information up to date.
[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:10.880]   Yeah. If you, if you, by the way, if you, if you hit done, I just made one up. I just said flight
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:17.360]   UA 1120. Yeah. And then I tap on it and it says preview flight. And, and so I,
[02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:24.720]   I think that happens to be Chicago to one ask. It's Chicago to Mexico. Yeah.
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:29.120]   Turns out, turns out that 1120 goes to Mexico and it takes about five hours and five minutes.
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:33.920]   There you go. Isn't that cool? So if you keep notes on like your flights, you can put that in
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:37.440]   Apple notes and it'll give you the up to date information about the flight.
[02:18:37.440 --> 02:18:41.760]   Well, when I, by the way, one of the things I do do is when I, when I'm leaving, I cut and paste
[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:45.360]   everything into notes because I don't know what I'm going to get to or where I'm going to be. So I
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:50.640]   have my, I have my flight numbers, my hotel information. I have, so I have one thing that has all,
[02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:55.120]   one folder usually, but, but, or one docs that'll have all the things I need for that trip,
[02:18:55.120 --> 02:19:00.000]   or all in one place so that I don't, you know, so I just can go to that thing and I usually pin it
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:05.520]   to keep it at the top for that trip. And then I'd, I bet you Glenn Fleischman's written a take control
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:11.120]   of notes. Let me just check real quickly. I wouldn't be surprised. A lot of averages states that
[02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:18.560]   actually Josh centers has, but there is a take control book. The other take control superstar.
[02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:25.120]   Of course there is. Yeah. Awesome. So if you want to know more, six bucks, all the secrets,
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:31.360]   baby, all the secrets. That's it for the show. Apple expert,
[02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:39.520]   Rach Hontur, media guy, Alex Lindsay, is at office hours dot global. What you doing these days on
[02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:44.800]   office hours? You know, we had a great day today. We had folks that actually work on a lot of the
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:50.720]   electric election graphics last week. So, you know, all the AR graphics that spin out. And so,
[02:19:50.720 --> 02:19:55.920]   there were some folks from Ross and some folks from BizRT and, and they were, they were showing
[02:19:55.920 --> 02:20:01.840]   us examples and talking about what was hard about it and what was easy. And so, it's a good,
[02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:06.960]   it was a good day. Very nice. Yeah. So it's that it's, and it's something different, you know,
[02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:13.360]   every, every single day. It's quite a thing. Office hours dot global, always some good stuff
[02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:18.560]   going on in the office hours. And that will say tomorrow.
[02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:23.040]   Dante tomorrow, baby. Keep on talking about Dante, because, you know, there's lots to say,
[02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:27.280]   and Dante's so cool. Yeah. And our thousandth episode is coming up in December.
[02:20:27.280 --> 02:20:33.040]   It's a, you've already surpassed us. I don't know where, where's,
[02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:40.480]   what's just a, just a 901. Oh, yeah. The tech guy. No, but the tech guy, because we do two a week,
[02:20:40.480 --> 02:20:50.320]   is it 1945? So, it's got to be do seven a week. It really adds up. Very nice. Very nice. And,
[02:20:50.320 --> 02:20:57.120]   of course, if you want to hire Alex 090 dot media, Andy, when are you going to be on a WGBH next,
[02:20:57.120 --> 02:21:02.080]   the Boston Public Library? I'm on a little bit early because of Thanksgiving holiday. I'm on
[02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:07.280]   Monday at 1230. I'm not going to be at the BPL because we're all going to be in our homes.
[02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:14.480]   Go to WGBH news.org to stream it live or later. Go to the WGBH news YouTube channel to watch
[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:18.640]   streaming and pretty much almost exactly this same lighting and setup as you see right now.
[02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:24.560]   You're going, I know that guy. We had a great talk last week about
[02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:28.560]   gender delivery of AI, by the way, at the BPL. And that's, that's, that's already on the, on the
[02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:34.400]   archives. So that's, that's worth checking out. And, of course, Jason Snell, six colors.com
[02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:42.000]   has new downstream podcast is all about Disney. If you're interested, three small bears in an
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:46.880]   overcoat, the subject of the rebound. Yeah, that's Dan Moore and Dan Moore and does a podcast too.
[02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:50.160]   He posts his podcast too. I'm not on the rebound. That's a funny podcast though.
[02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:55.280]   I love the name. Three small bears or three raccoons in an overcoat. Either way,
[02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:59.120]   that would be noted, noted, noted science fiction author, Dan Moore.
[02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:02.960]   Oh, yeah. Noted science fiction author, Dan Moore and my co author on six colors.com,
[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:06.720]   of course. And again, I just, I just want to specify one last time before we go.
[02:22:06.720 --> 02:22:13.680]   Go Bears, beat Stanford. Okay. Do you want your little guy to do a little dance?
[02:22:13.680 --> 02:22:15.040]   I mean, I could sing the song.
[02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:19.840]   Oh, I mean, I wear up with the blue and gold down with the red,
[02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:26.400]   call of four. No, it's out for a victory. When is the ax handover? Is it this Saturday?
[02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:31.680]   Saturday. Yeah. It's a college football game. Nobody else cares about right. We're two mediocre
[02:22:31.680 --> 02:22:36.960]   to bad teams. Square off for a few more than a hundred years old game. I keep talking. I'm going
[02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:41.760]   to start sounding like Keith checks and then just give college football. And so why should
[02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:46.320]   probably give all we have is our institutional hatred for each other. Let us have this.
[02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:50.880]   Yes. Yes. Yes. To the last breath. I grapple with these Stanford.
[02:22:50.880 --> 02:23:00.480]   My trainer is a cow. I will be hearing about it. I'm sure. Hey, thank you, Jason. Alex,

[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:19.520]   And of course, the Twit plus feed with shows we don't put out in public like Michael Sargent's
[02:23:19.520 --> 02:23:27.200]   hands on Mac. There's also a side benefit to being a member of club, Twit. Your financing,
[02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:33.200]   subsidizing shows that can't get advertising. They're too new, like hands on Mac, hands on Windows,
[02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:39.920]   on Title Linux Show. You also subsidize the forums at Twit. Community and are masted on instance.
[02:23:39.920 --> 02:23:46.720]   And we need the subsidy now because it's growing like Topsy at Twit.Social. I'm trying to figure
[02:23:46.720 --> 02:23:53.280]   out a way to give a club members a special, some sort of special icon, a verified check,
[02:23:53.280 --> 02:24:00.480]   if you will, on our Twit.Social. But you know, in your heart, you've helped Twit.TV/ClubTwit,
[02:24:00.480 --> 02:24:08.400]   merely seven bucks a month. And it makes a huge difference to us. Discord members have a blue
[02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:13.360]   check on Discord or, oh, we can add you. Yeah, okay, I'll show you a little trick. I think there is a
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:21.520]   verified, I can we have some custom icons. It probably is a way to do that. So add your,
[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:25.520]   add your blue check. Actually, you know what? I didn't put it there because I didn't want
[02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:32.320]   anybody to do it. That's what that's what that's what I did. This there is no blue check on our
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:38.720]   masted on. And that's something we're very proud of. We do this show every Tuesday, 11am, Pacific,
[02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:45.600]   2pm Eastern time 1900 UTC. If you want to tune in and watch live, it's at live.twit.tv, chat live
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:53.920]   with us at irc.twit.tv or in the club Twit Discord where there is always a lot of fun going on. Oh,
[02:24:53.920 --> 02:25:03.120]   that's what is that? That's wild. That is wild. That's a Discord logo, right? And it's plasma
[02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:11.040]   pulsing or something. After the fact on demand versions of the show at the website Twit.tv/mbw.
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:15.600]   There's a YouTube channel dedicated to Mac break weekly. I have for all of our shows actually.
